txt ART . IV. - The Farmer 's . /Jlanual , including a Treatise on the Management of Bees . By FREDERICK BUTLER . Hartford . S. G. Goodrich . THE bee seems to be a native of every part of the globe , and the same characteristic traits distinguish the whole race ; we allude simply to the Honey Bee , Ilpis . Miell*fica . Even in New South Wales , we find that , excepting in some variation of size and color , the honey bee is the same with that of Europe and America . The history of one bee , and of one community of bees , is , with the slight variation which is always produced by climate , the history of the whole race ; nor should we venture to add our stock of observation to the great mass of what is already known upon the subject , and accessible to every class of persons , did we not wish to excite the attention more particularly of those who inhabit the mountainous districts of this portion of our country , to this practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history to our own day , bees have been an object of attention , honey has been used , and wax has been an article of commerce . In fact the amount consumed of the former for food , medicine , and a pleasant beverage , and of the latter for various purposes in the arts , would astonish those who have never turned their attention to the subject . In the savage and civilized state , wherever there has been sun enough to mature a flower , every individual of the community is as familiar with the luxury of honey , and the merits and uses of bees-wax , as with the daily food that is consumed . Man has never been slow to appropriate to himself the physical powers of the inferior animals ; but of all those which have been subdued to his use the bee alone has preserved its independence . We ought not , in fact , to use the term subdued , as it does not apply to the situation or position which the bee holds among us in its domestic state . Neither its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified . It preserves its singular economy unchanged , whether it inhabit a hollow tree in the midst of an unfrequented forest , or a hive in the centre of an apiary . And here , we would remark , that a hive ought not to be considered as the house or habitation of the bee , for eveii in // the forests , where there may be supposed to be abundance of holloxv trees suited to their purposes , bees have built their cells on the under side of a stout branch ; and they have neglected the convenient form of a well constructed hive , to attach themselves to the eaves of a house , or to the inner sides of a chimney . The nature of this part of their instinct goes no further than to secure a firm roof , to which they can attach the cells , and a position that shall protect the cells from the sun and rain . This faculty , or instinct , is sometimes at fault , for we often hear of their adopting the strangest and most unsuitable tenements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sus. * pended from a moderate sized branch of a tree , as to be ngi. * tated by slight winds , was found filled with bees and comlz* . An old coat , that had been thrown over the decayed trunk of a tree and forgotten , was filled with comb and bees . Any thing , in short , either near the habitations of man , or in the forests , will serve the bees for a shelter to their combs . If this instinct were as absolute as some persons would make us believe , the bees , when swarming , would undoubtedly choose a domicile , as nearly similar to the one they had left as possible ; but this is rarely the case . In their pursuit of food , with which the woods as frequently supply them as the gardens , their quick eye guides them to the places suitable for the establishment of a sxvarm . They do not , by a distinct succession of thoughts , arrive at the conclusion , that the hollow tree will suit them as a dwelling ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the whole swarm is collected on the branch of a tree , these foraging scouts , that have espied the hollow tree , run over the mass of bees as they bang , give the signal of departure , lead the way to the woods , and the queen and the whole swarm follow to the selected tree . But although the bees are rarely unprovided with a retreat for a new swarm , yet they readily accept of a more obvious one , when offered . Aware of this willingness on the part of the bees , man takes the opportunity , when they are collecting their numbers , of introducing them into a hive , and of bringing them under his own immediate surveillance , that he may the more easily partake of the fruits of their labors . Yet although colony after colony have dwelt in uninterrupted succession in a particular apiary , their instinct is not improved , nor their reflective powers enlarged . They are the same in all their in* // stincts and formations as they were , when the first observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made . We have , for seven years , had a little colony under our immediate inspection , and we began our personal observation with the knowledge of all that ancient and modern theorists have advanced , in relation to the habits , customs , and manners , of this wonderful insect . We came to their superintendence with a mind tinctured with all that was marvellous and fanciful , and with an ardor that seven years have not subdued ; although theory after theory has now melted away , and most of the wonders and enigmas have been solved , and reduced to the clearest and most simple particulars . Our wonder and admiration , although deprived of the charms of the fanciful legends in which the history of the bee was embodied , are still undiminished , nay , increased ; for an elevation of thought and feeling has been produced by the study . Notwithstanding the astonishing sagacity to be traced in the economy of bees , and the diversity of habits which might be expected , nature in reality is less variable in this instance than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitation may reduce their size , and scantiness of food reduce their numbers , yet as long as there are flowers , the bee will abstract the honey , and as long as there are forests , the bee will construct a cell . With other insects and animals , and even with man himself , the case is different . Insects will imbibe nourishment from the exudations of both animal and vegetable substances . Man can accommodate himself to every variety of diet , and thrive on all . The bee alone never changes its food . The sweet sap that exudes from vegetable pores , and which is accumulated in the nectary of flowers , serves alike to sustain the bee , and to render the seeds of plants fit for germination . As no flower can arrive at maturity without the assistance of this fluid , it is ever present ; and as the bee has a twofold duty to l ) erform , that of preserving its own being by such means as nature has pointed out , and that of assisting the winds in carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged it , that the peculiar food of the bee is in abundance . And as this nutritive fluid is to support inanimate life , which requires an unvaried and uniform food , the bee for ever partakes of the same nourishment , and is enabled to preserve its peculiarities of form and instinct unaltered from generation to generation . // For both the operations , therefore , of sustaining life and of dispersing pollen , which require uniformity of instinct and organization , the bee is the same in all situations and in all ages . The working bees have the instinctive faculties of building different shaped cells ; of choosing and preparing the food , both for the larva and for themselves ; of taking care of the young brood ; of carrying off noxious and extraneous matter ; of defending themselves from enemies of their own species ; and of expelling the drones when they are no longer of use in the hive . They have the instinctive knowledge that they can not , as other insects do , exist individually ; they are constructed , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the safety and comfort of the mother of the brood . She is , in their estimation , as much a part of themselves , as an eye or a limb . Their care of her is a kind of self-preservation , a law implanted in every living thing . After rejecting all the fanciful and marvellous speculations of the theorists , there are still several material points unsettled , on three of which we propose to make a few remarks at the present time . 1st . The most modern and the most rational theorists differ in their opinions respecting the accuracy of the facts , that are stated in relation to the queen bee 's leaving the hive at any other time , than when she goes forth with a new swarm. 2d . They dispute likewise on the possibility of the bees ' making a queen bee , from a neuter , when circumstances require it . 3d . They are still ignorant , whether the drone perform the office of nurse to the larva when deposited in the different cells . On the first point we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves the hive , but when she accompanies a swarm . For ten weeks , we fixed our attention on the entrance of two hives that stood close to each other on a bench . Our watch , either in person , or entrusted to another as interested and vigilant as ourselves , commenced at grey dawn , and continued till sunset ; and never within that period did the queen bee of either hive leave them , but at the time of swarming , which occurred once in each hive during our inspection . With an eye to this single circumstance , we have , for six successive years subsequent to the careful observation just stated , been in the constant habit of noting every peculiar movement at the // entrance of hives , but we never saw the queen . Independently of the reliance that can be placed on observations of this kind , we have confirmation derived from strong probabilities . The average number of a hive or swarm is from fifteen to twenty thousand bees . Nineteen thousand four hundred and ninety-nine are neuters or xvorking bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the queen or mother ! Every living thing , from man down to an ephemeral insect , pursues the bee to its destruction for the sake of the honey that is deposited in its cell , or secreted in its honey-hag . To obtain that which the bee is carrying to its hive , numerous birds and insects are on the watch , and an incredible number of bees fall victims , in consequence , to their enemies . Independently of this , there are the changes in the weather , such as high winds , sudden showers , hot sunshine ; and then there is the liability to fall into rivers , besides a hundred other dangers to which bees are exposed . Can any one , who considers all these casualties , suppose , that the instinct in bees is so defective , as to allow so important a member of the community , and the only one of the kind too , to leave the hive and run the immense risk that would attend an excursion in the air ? It is a well established fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that part of the daily duties of the working bees is to nourish the young brood , which , if there were no queen , they could not do , as there would be no eggs . if the bees are disturbed in their regular routine of business , they become uneasy and incapable of proceeding . When they return from the nectary of flowers , with the usual quantity of sweet fluid , they hasten to bestow the first or uppermost part of honey on the larvae and young bees , and when this simple , undigested liquid is disposed of , they deposit that , which has gone through a certain chymical process , in the cells . If , therefore , on entering the hive , they find no queen , they run about anxious and distressed , drop the little pellets of pollen that are attached to their legs , strike their antenn*. against one another , and are in great agitation during the day . Sometimes two days are passed in this restless state , before they make an effort to repair their loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Iluber and others fancy , she would run great risk of never being able to return to it . Even around the apiary , before she had made the usual evolutions in the air , common to all bees on leaving the hive , // she might become the prey of one of the many birds , that are hovering over bead , or on the watch . The blue-bird , the kin *-bird , and the cat-hird swallow bees by dozens while on the wing ; and the queen bee would have less chance of escape , as she is larger , and therefore more conspicuous , and is besides very slow and heavy in her motions , her wings being smalle.r in proportion to her body than those of tie working bee and the drone . From our own observations , therefore , as well as from the above inferences , we must believe that the queen bee never leaves the hive , but for the establishment of a new colony . The next material point of dispute is , whether it be in the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that of a queen , when by accident the hive is deprived of one . Accordin0 to the most accurate naturalists , the organization of the queen , or mother bee , is different from that of either the drone or the neuters . It appears to us quite as rational and philosophical to suppose , that a queen bee could be converted into a neuter , and therefore that all bees at first were of the shape and organic structure of the queen , as to suppose that a neuter or working bee could have new organs added , new curves given to its limbs , and new instincts to its nature . if we could see the interior of a hive whenever it suited our convenience , we should not be so lost in conjecture ; but the irritabilitv of these little insects , prevents a constant and minute internal inspection . It is a part of their instinct to know that light , heat , cold , and moisture , in an undue and unaccustomed degree , are prejudicial to the formation of wax , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brood . They therefore use all the little arts and advantages they possess , to prevent any one from exposing them to the injurious influence of these active powers . When a queen bee ceases to animate the hive , the bees are conscious of her loss ; after searching for her through the hive , for a day or more , they examine the royal cells , which are of a peculiar construction and reversed in position , hanging vertically , with the mouth underneath . If no eggs or larva are to be fiirnnd in these cells , they then enlarge several of those cells , which are appropriated to the eggs of neuters , and in which queen eggs have been deposited . They soon attach a royal cell to the enlarged surface , and the queen bee , enabled now to grow , protrudes itself by degrees into the royal cell , and comes out perfectly formed , to the great l ) leasure of the be*s. // Now this in itself is curious and wonderful . There is no need of adding superhuman powers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacity . The truth is , that the queen or mother bee lays the neuter eggs in certain cells of a particular construction ; in fact , the eggs are laid , at least many of them , as soon as the foundations are begun , before the cells are built . The bees know , from the peculiar shape of the egg , that it is to have a cell of certain dimensions . When the neuter and drone eggs are deposited , the royal cells are then filled , for abundant observations prove that the queen eggs are laid last . If the royal cells are not sufficient to hold all the queen eggs , they are laid in the common cells , and in the course of the regular business of the hive , these cells are attended to with the rest . When the larva is of a size to fill the cell , a covering of wax is put on , and here ends the life , or rather the embryo of the queen ; for no longer having room to expand , it perishes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the bees discover that animation is extinct . If , during the progress of the egg from the larva to the nymph state , the mother queen dies , and there are no eggs in the royal cells , then the bees have recourse to the queen eggs that are laid in the common cells . By enlarging the entrance , and by attaching to it a cell , which hangs vertically , they continue the life of the larva , and a queen bee is fornied . Here is no work of transformation . The jusect is already formed , and nothing remains to be done , but the mere mechanical operation of building a habitation , which shall be adequate to its wants . The peculiar organic construction of the queen bee perhaps requires a difference of food , as we perceive it does of dwelling . No doubt it is necessary to supply it more abundantly , and with greater care . The very position it is compelled to take , shows that it requires a different kind of nurture from either the common bee or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to direct these changes ; but it would be more than wonderful , if , in addition to this instinct , the bee had the power to construct new organs , as it does different cells , and thus to endow the insect with a different nature . The third point unsettled , and which is likely to remain for ever a secret , is , whether the eggs of the queen are hatched after the manner of the eggs of fishes , whether they simply // are animated by incubation , or by the care and nourishment bestowed upon them by the working or neuter bees . On this point experiment has proved nothing . The greatest diversity of opinion exists . There are upwards of a thousand writers on the history and policy of the bee , and yet no two have either observed or reasoned alike . Even the two distinguished naturalists , who have passed the best portion of their lives in studying bees , with equal zeal and with equal opportunity , have come to very different conclusions . Huber is by far the most circumstantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his truly philosophical mind has been rendered comparatively useless , nay , xvorse than useless , by the ignorance or wilful misrepresentations of his assistant Francis Burnens . Huber could but philosophize on facts as they daily were represented to him . His solutions of things unreal , and having no truth in nature , are most ingenious and rational . Had his physical sight been as perfect as his mental vision , his work would doubtless have been all that could be effected by the industry and talent of man . The naturalists of Europe , misled by his extraordinary talent , adopted Huber 's notions with respect to bees , and his opinions were considered as conclusive . The public opinion became imbued with the spirit of his doctrines ; and we find the greatest and acutest reasoners discussing , in perfect security , the nature of an insect , that could at one moment organize animal life and impart to it new instincts , and in the next , construct bulwarks and other modes of defence , to protect himself from an enemy , that until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inspired for the study of the bee by the interesting work of Huber , engaged many in the pursuit ; and the very mistakes that he has made , have led to something nearer the truth . Owing to the general improvement in education , the taste for the marvellous is fast disappearing ; and there are now many who set themselves down to the study with their reason unbiassed , and their judgment free to decide according to the evidence of facts . Huish , amongst the late writers , has most successfully combated the principal errors in Huber 's theory ; but although he has fixed a base on which a rational theory may be built , his object seems less to elicit truth , than to expose the errors of Huber . This he has endeavored to do in the most unamia // ble and bitter spirit , which destroys the gratification with which his book would be read by the candid inquirer . In addition to this , he has laid himself open to the charge of plagiarism . He must have studied the subject sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that have been in use from the earliest antiquity to his own time ; and the peculiar shape of the Greek hive could not have escaped his vigilance , for drawings and descriptions of it are within the reach of every student ; yet he boldly states , that a flower-pot first gave him the hint of the plan which he adopted for his own hive . The little work , the title of which we have prefixed to this article , called The Farmer 's Manual , ' contains , in a small compass , as much of the rninuti* of the management of bees as is necessary to the common cultivator . Mr Butler is a sensible , practical writer , as well on other branches of rural economy , as on bees , and we would recommend his book to all who ale engaged in those pursuits ; for , with some slight deviations from his rules , such as a different climate would indicate , his experience may be beneficial to all . We esteem it a very desirable object to make the care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of the country . With the exception of a small one under the superintendence of the society of the Shakers , established at New Lebanon , we neither saw nor could we hear of more than a single apiary , on a journey last summer to Lebanon Springs , although we made many inquiries . Never was there a country more suited to the cultivation of bees . Even in August there is an abundance of white clover , and small springs and shallow rivulets appear at every turn . There is no doubt that bees were formerly more frequently kept in America that at present . In many places in New Jersey , where there is now scarcely a bee to be seen , there once existed millions of these insects , to the great profit of their owners . It was common for one dealer in a country town , to sell from fifteen to twenty barrels of strained honey alone , to say nothing of wax and combhoney , as well as a kind of wine , made of the washings of combs , called metlieglin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find that it is mainly attributable to the ravages of the millers , or night-moths , which have of late years spread destruction through the hives . The attention of naturalists has been directed to the history of this fatal enemy of the bee , and many attempts have been // made to construct hives that would prevent the miller from depositing its eggs in them ; but the plans were defective , because there was no contrivance for inspecting the hives . Before we close this article , we will endeavor to give a de-. scription of a hive , t**at'is so constructed as to enable any one to see the interior and to free it from all extraneous matter , as well as to protect it from the inroads of the night-miller . On the general subject of the care of bees , the following remarks , the result of personal experience , may be acceptable to the reader . The situation of an apiary is of little importance . We have seen bees thrive as well with an eastern as with a northern aspect . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may possibly be detained within , a minute or two later in summel ' ; but this is more than counterbalanced by the same cause operating in winter , when it is desirable that the bees should remain in the hive . But for ourselves , we have seen no difference in the time of quitting the cells , between those that faced the north , and those that had a southern exposure . Nor have we observed that there is any difference in the welfare of hives as placed in valleys or elevated on hills , meaning , of course , hills of thirty or forty feet in height . We have seen hives prosper , adjoining a stercorary , and oftentimes near a piggery . We have known colonies of bees to exist for a term of twenty years , with no other protection from the heat and cold , than the top of the hives . They have multiplied equally well under an open shed ; hut as a free circulation of air is necessary to their health and comfort , we have never known them to thrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called , which is shut on all sides , may serve to amuse the observer for a year or two , but there must be an extraordinary combination of fortunate circumstances , if the bees increase , while confined in it . It is better to begin with a single hive , and so attain a knowledge of the habits and instincts of the bees by degrees . We have known several persons , who have purchased a number of hives at once , and relinquished the pursuit from the perplexity that ensued when the swarming season commenced . But there is no similar occupation so easily followed , and none that requires so little capital , as that of keeping bees . The profit is enormous . If a person , well trained to the employment , should follow the plan adopted in some parts of Europe , of removing // the bees from place to place , in a kind ark on a river of some length , thus providing a plentiful supply of food , he might increase his stock to any extent . An apiary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile , where there is plenty of blossoms . Every farmer should however provide pasture for his bees , as well as for his cows ; and therefore when the spring and summer flowers are gone , he should have a field of buckwheat ready , which , although not so palatable as other flowers , will serve the bees for winter food . An apiary , or bee-shed , should be , at the eaves , about four feet from the ground , with a roof sloping both ways , and with any aspect that the owner chooses . It should be ten feet wide , and the length of it should be increased as the hives multiply . It is , however , difficult to describe one accurately . The most convenient one that we have seen , is on a farm near New Brunswick in New Jersey . It is fifty feet long , and contains sixteen hives on each side . The swarms which are successively cast off , are placed under the same shed in the winter , and an equal number of the old hives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be enlarged to any extent , were there pasture enough for the bees ; but the area of the bees ' flight , as there are now many cultivators of bees in this district , does not furnish food enough for a great number . In this apiary the miller or night-moth is successfully guarded against . A small wire door , made to slide behind two doorposts , formed of needles , is closed over the entrance of the hive , as soon as the bees have retired for the night . This is done during the months of April , May , and June ; after that , if the weather sets in warm , and the bees are oppressed by heat , the floor of the hive is let down , which , as it is fastened to the hive behind with hinges , and on the sides with hooks and staples , can easily be accomplished . Two rows of scantlings or joists four inches square , and running the whole length of the apiary , receive the hives between them , which are thus suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hive is thirteen inches square at the top , and is of the same size at the bottom of the front and back , but the bottom of the sides is only seven inches *vide . By this slope of the hive , the combs wedge themselves as they are made , and there is no use for the ill-contrived crossed sticks , that are generally // thrust in the old hives , to keep the combs from falling down by their own weight . The floor is , as we observed , fastened by hinges and hooks . It is likewise an inclined plane , having a slope of at least four inches . The advantages of this inclination will be instantly seen . The perspiration of the bees , which is copious , is , by the inclination of the sides and floor , conveyed off at once , without being absorbed by the boards . All extraneous matter can be carried away by the bees with very little trouble , and they can defend themselves from robbers or corsair bees with much greater ease than if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuts , the observer can inspect the interior of the hive at pleasure , not with the hope of getting at the minutia of the bees ' policy , but to see the forwardness of the combs , the number of the bees , and the general appearance , which a practised eye can soon understand . When the floor of the hive is left down all night , and the bees hang very low from the combs in the morning , they will soon remove themselves up again , if the floor is raised very gently and slo*vly , and fastened as usual . The cover of the hive is of course thirteen inches square . It is made of common pine , as is the hive , with two cleats on the upper part , as well to prevent the board from warping , as to prevent the box , or upper story , which is always added , from being moved from its place . The cover of the hive has three boles of one inch diameter , within a quarter of an inch of each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper box , when the hive is full of honey . It is ascertained satisfactorily , that the young brood and the bee-bread or pollen are deposited in the hive where the swarm is first put . The holes in the cover are therefore kept shut by plugs , until the hive be filled . The holes are then opened , the bees immediately pass up , and if the season be propitious , they fill the upper box with comb and honey , which , as there is neither brood nor bee-bread , is of the finest and purest kind . We have often seen forty and sixty pounds obtained by this simple proceeding ; and the box is also used to feed a famished hive in the spring . A single comb left in one of these boxes will sustain a swarm , that has eaten up all its honey , until vegetation commences . As the boxes and hives are of equal size , any one box will fit a hive . When the combs in the hive are three years old , two of them // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey enough in the rest for the use of the bees . Thirty weight of honey is the average quantity that suffices for a swarm of large size . The hives in question weigh , when empty , about twelve pounds , a swarm of bees four pounds , the wax two pounds . The whole , therefore , ought to weigh about fifty pounds in November . All over this quantity can be taken out to advantage , as the wax becomes very dark after two or three years . The whole of the combs can be thus renewed in the course of four years , as the bees replace them early in the spring . We omitted to mention that the length of the back of the hive is twenty-two inches , and of the front twenty-eight inches , and that the floor projects in front about three inches , thus forming an apron or platform , on which the bees alight before they enter in at the little door . Models of this hive have been sent to several of the h5rticultnral societies of Europe , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm is to be hived , the hive is put in a moveable frame which is easily carried to the tree where the swarm hangs , and this is proved to be the easiest method of biving swarms ; as the screws are taken out of the cover and the hive lifted up to the swarm , into which they are shaken . The flame and hive are then placed on the ground , and the cover is gently laid on *nd screwed fast to the hive . Little sticks are put against the apron and rest on the ground , serving for ladders for those bees , that fell to the ground when the main body was shaken into the hive . Bees , from the moment of their leaving the hive , when swarming , until they are fairly settled and at work in a new habitation , seem stupid and confused . This arises , however , from the precarious situation of their queen . If she fall into the hive when the swarm is shaken in , all the remaining bees will soon find their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these insects when their queen is present . If , however , she remain on the limb , it will be necessary to shake it again over the hive , as the bees will leave it to fly up to the place where the queen is . When the bees are quiet in the hive ( which is ascertained by the number that are seen hovering in front of the entrance on the wing , and by others ventilating the hive with their wings ) , the top can be covered with a sheet , doubled several times , to keep off the heat of the sun . The hive must remain in the same spot until eight or nine o'clock in the evening , when two persons can quietly // and gently convey it , frame and all , to the apiary , and place the hive , with great care , between the joists where it is permanently to remain . Hives should be made and painted a year before they are used , as the smell of paint is disagreeable to the bees . The smoother the boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both for the health of the bees and for preventing the deposit of the eggs of the miller . We must except the roofs of the hive and of the hox , as they should be rough ; for we have ascertained , that the propolis , or bee-glue , does not adhere so closely to a smooth surface at all times . And here we would remark , that it has been the custom , from the earliest ages , to rub the inside of the hive with a handful of salt and clover , or some other grass or sweet-scented herb , previously to the swarm 's being put in the hive . We have seen no advantage in this ; on the contrary , it gives a great deal of unnecessary labor to the bees , as they will be compelled to remove every particle of foreign matter from the hive before they begin to work . A clean , cool hive , free from any peculiar smell or mustiness , will be acceptible to the bees ; and the more closely the hive is joined together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care it is to stop up every crevice , that light and air may he excluded . We must not omit to reprehend , as utterly useless , the vile practice of making an astounding noise , with tin pans and kettles , when the bees are swarming . It may have originated in some ancient superstition , or it may have been the signal to call aid from the fields , to assist in the hiving . If harmless , it is unnecessary ; and everything that tends to encumber the management of bees should he avoided . Straw hives are unsuitable to our climate , and afford a harbor for all kinds of insects . It is folly to talk of their cheapness. if a man intend to keep bees , he must , in the first place , make the hives in the very best manner ; by this we mean , of good materials and of good workmanship . A hive badly joined by an axvkward carpenter is worse than a hollow tree . One half of the labor of the bees , is directed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hive which we consider of the best construction may be seen at the village of the Lebanon shakers , in the hands of Mr Daniel Hawkins , or at the seat of Theodore 3edgwick , Esq . in *tockbridgc . The inventor of this hive has had an opportunity of judging of its merits by experience . // It is not asserted that the bees will , of themselves , fall into these hives , or that no trouble or expense is necessary in the management of an apiary . We know that both care and expense are required ; but the latter , after the first disbursement , is very trifling . Vigilance and neatness are for ever in requisition , and the care of bees , like all other profitable business , can not be pursued to any advantage , unless it receive daily and minute attention . But have we not accomplished a great deal when we have reduced the thing to this certainty ? But although , as we have before observed , nothing is more simple in theory and practice , than the history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unremitted attention , if we aim either at instruction or profit . Can anything be well done and to advantage without these ? Varro in his treatise de Re Rusticd , is the first who has spoken of hives . He wrote upwards of 1870 years ago ; and how many different sorts of hives have been constructed since his time , to say nothing of the different theories ? We wish to see bees in every garden throughout America , but we have no desire to see the subject encumbered with more than is necessary to advance the pleasure and profit of the pursuit . To the naturalist we will leave discussions of organization and propagation . They are foreign to our purpose , as they only serve to perplex and deter us from the main points . But it is proper to know the most simple mode of managing a hive , and this includes the pasture , or food that is necessary for its sustenance . Hunger destroys as many bees as the miller . We ought to cultivate such shrubs and plants as the bees like ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the red maple are the first trees that are visited by the bees . They are fond of the crocus , which is the earliest of our bulbous roots ; and these we can have in abundance , as they multiply quickly and occupy little space . They are beautiful in themselves , affording a rich treat to the eye ; and they flower so caily , and are of such bright and vivid colors , that we take as much pleasure in them as the bees do . The stercorary and piggery are next resorted to by these insects . These we presume are their medicine shops , and the extract absorbed from them must be used as a tonic . Blossoms of all kinds , excepting those of the red clover and of the honey-suckle , are excellent food ; and the bees especially profit by the increased attention bestowed at present on the cultivation of the peach-tree in some parts of this country . They not only // drink the nectar and abstract the pollen of the flower , but they appropriate the peach itself . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour ; that is , they carried the juices of it to their cells . The humming-bird alone can reach the bottom of the nectary of the honey-suckle , but even here the instinct of the bee is seen . The small birds , such as the wren , make an incision on the outside , near the bottom of the flower , and extract a part of the juices . The bee takes advantage of this opening , and avails itself of what is left . The scent of the bees is so acute , that every flower which has a powerful odor can be discovered by them at a great distance . Strawberry-blossoms , mignonette , wild and garden thyme , herbs of all kinds , apple , plum , cherry , and , above all , raspberry blossoms , and white clover , are delicious food for them , and a thriving orchard and garden and apiary fitly go together . But as the bee seeks only its own gratification in procuring honey and in regulating its household , and as , according to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poison , it sometimes carries honey to its cell , which is prejudicial to us . Dr Barton in the fifth volume of the American Philosophical Transactions , speaks of several plants that yield a poisonous syrup , of which the bees partake without injury , but which has been fatal to man . He has enumerated some of these plants , which ought to be destroyed wherever they are seen , namely , dwarf-laurel , great laurel , kalmia latifolia , broad-leaved moor wort , Pennsylvania mountain-laurel , wild honey-suckle ( the bees , as we oLerved , can not get much of this ) , and the stramonium or Jamestown-weed ; which last we should wish to see completely eradicated , as , independently of the poison extracted from its flowers , and from its seeds , which are often eaten by children , it is the ugliest weed that grows , and has the most offensive odor . The poets , always exalting and magnifying the subjects that they touch , have contributed perhaps more than any other set of writers to mislead our judgment . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it finds its way to the hive by this faculty alone . Nor is it only with regard to the bee , that poets , the worst entomologists in the world , have led us astray . // Cowper says , I would not enter on my list of friends , Though graced with polished manners and fine sense , . the man , Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm . ' By worm , we wonder if he included the grub-worm . Alas ! little did that amiable man think of the mischief that would ensue from this sensibility and tenderness towards insects . He thought that when nature created them , and designed them an abode , ' that it was a species of cruelty to hunt or harm them , when not actually crawling in th ' alcove , the chamber , or refectory . ' But the harm that the few do , who so inadvertently approach our dwellings , is insignificant when comupared to the ravages of every kind of insect , excepting the bee , when in the abode that nature assigned it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside when we meet it in our path , after destroying the roots of our pasture and our corn , becomes a winged insect , and continues its mischief to the destruction of our finest fruits . We really are in a sad plight between our sensibilities and our sense of justice to ourselves . We say that insects have so multiplied , that we can neither raise grain for our cattle , nor fruit for ourselves . Keep the birds near you , ' say the philosophers , quit the cruel practice of shootin* the harmless sono** a sters of the grove , and you will not only be rewarded by seeing that insects decrease , but you will be charmed by their melody . ' But , then , we say in answer , that the birds do not discriminate that they prefer bees to every other insect , and therefore the birds must die . And in reality we must make war upon those birds , that show the greatest fondness for our little friends . Let us , at least , show our sense of the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate from their very doors . Let us les* sen the chance of their encountering them abroad , by planting the favorite food of the bees as near the apiary as possible ; and also lessen the chance of their being drowned , when driven by high xvinds , as they stoop to drink , by giving them running streams near to their hives . We have scarcely observed any order in this discussion , setting down our thoughts just as they presented themselves . Had we written a regular work on this subject , we would in the proper place have spoken of the small bees , the aged , and those denominated black . As this essay is short , it will not be // difficult for those who have a respect for our opinions , to cull out and methodize the different matter as it occurs , and we can then ramble on with our few remaining observations to the close . In the hive of a new swarm , during the months of July and August , there are fewer small bees , than in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bee , like all other insects , spins itself a covering before it becomes a fly . When it emerges with wings , from its cell , several older bees approach it , feed it with the contents of their stomachs , and then clean out the cell and deposit in it fresh honey . This is their constant practice ; and the bee that is just born , as soon as it has been fed and has stretched its wings , flies off to a flower , and commences its labors . But although the bees clean out the cell the moment a young bee is born , yet they either find no inconvenience from that part of the fihn , which tbe young bee leaves at the bottom of the cell , and which is of a silky nature , or they are unable to detach it . In consequence of this , the cell is not so deep , and as the same circumstances occur perpetually , brood alternating with honey , the cells become every year visibly smaller ; and , consequently , those bees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great number , are never of the full size of those that have bad more room . Even the queen eggs , which we say are often deposited in the cells of neuters , and have afterwards larger cells attached to the first , never produce so large a queen bee , as if the cell had been of proper dimensions at first . Thus we see that the contraction of the cell may diminish the size of a bee , even to the extinction of life , just as the contraction of a Chinese shoe reduces the foot even to uselessness ; but in neither case will a single new organ be taken from or added to the bee , or a single toe be taken from or added to the foot , whether the cell or shoe be larger or smaller . A young bee can be readily distinguished from an old one , by the gucyish colored down that covers it , and which it loses by the wear and tear of hard labor ; and if the bee be not destroyed before the season is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the insect is seen , white or black . On a close examination , very few of these black or aged bees , will be seen at the opening of the spring , as , not having the stamina of those that are younger , they perish from inability to encounter the vicissitudes of winter . Our seasons are very variable . The scorching droughts of // summer deny to plants their accustomed moisture ; no honey therefore can be made by the bees at such times , and they are compelled to eat of their winter food . They cluster about the hive , or , deprived of their accustomed labor , they are very restless , and often intrude into a neighboring hive , apparently for the want of employment . In the summer of 1825 , during the latter part of July , the heat was so distressing to the bees , the thermometer standing at 92* in the shade , that they seemed to have lost their usual instinct . A number of hives of the old-fashioned patterns , that stood on a bench , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days in succession , the whole swarm of each hive rushed out , and ran into the adjoining hive , where they remained for a few seconds without apparent offence to the invaded bees , who in their turn flew madly out , and paid the same unceremonious visit to their neighbors . No quarrel ensued , not a bee was killed by these irruptive movements . They seemed maddened by the heat ; and yet the queen was left in the hive , for with all our attention to the sallying parties , we did not see a single queen among them . The same frenzy did not occur in those hives that were suspended upon joists , thus proving that the bees did not suffer so much from heat in those suspended hives , as they did in the flat-bottomed ones , that rested on a bench . Our winters are equally disastrous to the poor bees . Of late years , there have been so many mild days during the cold season , that a great deal of honey has been coisumed . These alternations of torpor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than would be occasioned by a continuance of uniform torpor . This we infer from the fact , that in Russia , where the winters are uniformly cold , bees do not perish ; and in the West Indies where there is perpetual verdure , they are never exhausted . But although a bee may remain torpid , to a certain extent , for six months in the year without injury , in those climates to which the insect has long been accustomed , yet it could not exist for the same space of time in lower latitudes , where such a period of continued cold rarely occurs . Nature has not constructed them for every emergency . She has done no more for them in this particular , than she has for man . They are compelled to get accustomed to a change of climate by degrees ; not by an alteration of the structure of their organs , for that can never occur under any circumstances , but by some change that // takes place in the circulation of the fluids of the body , by which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we leave this part of the question to the naturalists learned in the science . If we are correct in this our opinion , the suggestion of Dr Anderson would not be available in our climate . If , according to his proposal , bees were to be kept all winter in an icehouse , more causes than one would operate to the injury of their health , and consequently to the decrease of their number . The temperature of an ice-house , unless we are to suppose the hive to he buried in the ice itself , is much higher than that which is without the house . The torpor , therefore , would not be so complete , as to put a stop to the digestive process . The bees would be compelled to eat ; and as their food is constantly in contact with the impure , stagnant air of the icehouse , it would soon become vitiated and engender diseases . We know of but two diseases to which the bees are subject in this country , and they have to our knowledge never occurred at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring ,  --  dysentery and dyspepsia . The latter arises from the indolent , inactive life that they are compelled to lead , in our variable winters . The rule holds good with the most diminutive , as well as the greatest , in animal life , that if we eat and wish to preserve health , we must work . ' During the last xvintcr ( 1828 ) , the bees suffered more and lost more of their numbers , than has often been known before . There was scarcely a day , that they did not sally out to search for eniployment and food ; but not being properly stimulated , they seldom returned to the hive . We frequently saw them crawling on the ground , weak and spiritless ; and those that did return soon perished . On examining the hives , we observed that nearly all the honey was consumed ; arid many of the brood , that , in ordinary seasons , are not hatched until the first part of April , assumed the fly form at an earlier period and died . The cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as the flowers appear , they go to work ; and then it is , that they resort to aperients and tonics , which they abstract from the floors of the piggeries . The other disease proceeds from long confinement in bad air and from unwholesome food , and is invariably fatal ; nor can the bees avert it by any instinct of their own . We know of no cure for the dysentery , when the bee is seized with it . // Those that have it badly must die . We can restore those that are least affected , by frequently washing the hives , as far as we can reach , with weak lie , and by ventilating them and removing the dead bees . Much has been said of the danger to be apprehended from placing an apiary too near our own dwelling . There is indeed rio positive advantage in having it very near ; but as the person usually engaged in hiving the bees is occupied with farming affairs , and is not always present when the bees swarm , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . A bee certainly has frequently attacked a horse , and we have once or twice heard of one being stung to death . Considering the great number of hives of bees , it is really wonderful , that more accidents of this kind have not occurred . But they are exceedingly rare ; and when we know how many hundred horses annually die from the disease called the botts , which proceeds from the maggots of the egg , laid by the horse-6ee on the hair of the animal , the very few that suffer from the sting of the honey-bee do not deserve to be taken into consideration . In every point of view , therefore , it appears that bees should be cultivated . The wax that is consumed in this country , in various ways , is enormous , and most of it is imported . If we may credit Huish , Great Britain imports from Germany and Italy upwards of eighty thousand pounds sterling worth of wax annually . We are unable to say , with any precision , to what amount it is imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family uses in a year , and the amount employed in various arts , it must be worthy of notice . It is really disgraceful to such a country as ours to import wax or honey . XVe ought ourselves to export tons of it every year ; and we trust that , in the course of a few years , this improvement will take place . Massachusetts and Connecticut are well situated , and abundantly supplied with proper food for bees ; and their climate , being less variable , is better adapted to their nature . We spoke of hills of twenty or thirty feet in height ; this only applies to the site of an apiary near a dwelling . The dwelling itself may be on a hill . We have heard of convents situated on mountains , that have been well stocked with hives . In short , nothing is wanting but good pasture , good hives , cleanliness , and attention , to insure a rich reward to those who engage in the pursuit . Children are naturally very fond of watching the proceedings // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , if they were not taught to fear them . All danger can be guarded against , by making them wear woollen gloves that are long enough to draw over their sleeves at the wrist , and a wire cap to cover their head . They could thus be trained to manage bees ; and training is quite as necessary to the full coinprehension of the occupation , as it is in the trade of a carpenter or a shoe-maker . It would be unjust not to refer again to Mr Butler 's little book , after making it the occasion of expressing our own thoughts . XVe shall rejoice if our slender notice of his work should encourage him to put forth a new edition ; and we shall now take leave of the subject , although it be almost inexhaustible , by an anecdote , that we have reserved for the conclusion , that it may make the deeper impression . A good old French bishop , in paying his annual visit to his clergy , was very much afflicted hy the representations they made of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and families corroborated . Whilst he was deploring the state of things which had reduced them to this sad condition , he arrived at the house of a curate , who , living amongst a poorer set of parishioners than any he had yet visited , would , he feared , be in a still more woful plight than the others . Contrary , however , to his expectations , he found appearances very much improved . Everything about the house wore the aspect comfort and plenty . The good bishop was amazed . How is this , my friend ? said he ; you are the first man that I have met with a cheerful face and a plentiful board . Have you any income independent of your cure ? * Yes , sir , ' said the clergyman , I have ; my family would starve on the pittance I receive from the poor people that 1 instruct . Come with me into the garden , and I will show you the stock that yields me an excellent interest . ' On going to the garden , lie showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hank from which I draw an annual dividend . It never stops payment . ' Ever after that memorable visit , when any of his clergy complained to the bishop of poverty , he would say to them , Keep bees , keep bees ; ' and we shall bid our readers adieu with the same advice .
