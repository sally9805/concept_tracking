txt ART . II. -1 . Philosophy of the Human Voice , embracing its Physiological History ; together with a System of Principles by which Criticism in the . fIrt of Elocutron may be rendered intelligible , and Instruction Definite and Comprehensive . To which is added a brief . /lnalysis of Song and Recitative . By JAMES RUSH , M. D. Philadelphia . 1827 . J. Maxwell . 2. . /lnalysis of the Principles of Rhetorical Delivery , as applied to Reading and Speaking . By EBENEZER PORTER , D. D. , Bartlet Professor of Sacred Rhetoric in the Theological Seminary , Andover . 1827 . Mark Newman . WE take all due shame to ourselves , that two works on Elocution , like those now before us , should have remained so long unnoticed in our pages . We have thought it singular , and we are willing to confess our share in the fault , that works as creditahie to our literature as these are , and in a department of knowledge , which , as matters now stand , is positively of greater importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been ushered into the world without receiving a hearty welcome from any leading Journal among us . The Rev. Dr Porter 's book , we perceive , has been suffered quietly to slide into a second edition ; and from that circumstance we presume it is gaining , unpraised and unnoticed , the estimation it deserves among our Academies and Colleges . As to Dr Rush 's work , we venture to say that not one in a hundi*ed of our literary men has ever read it , or known anything about it . We have in these suggestions struck the key-note ; but the strain of our complaints is yet to come . It is a small matter , comparatively , that these books on Elocution have been neglected in our Journals , or by our scholars . The great evil is the evil indicated by this fact . The great evil is , that the subject itself has fallen into neglect . The art of Rhetorical Delivery is regarded with a more amazing and unaccountable indifference among us than ever befell any other art , in circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but this , accounts for the fact adverted to . One of the works , in question , it is true , is only a Manual , and might not be thought to crave much discussion . But the other is a stout octavo on the Philosophy of the Human Voice . An analysis of the voice , in many respects novel , and running through // more than five hundred pages , is a pretty serious matter . It must be a very weak production , indeed , to deserve to fall into utter neglect . If such a work ,  --  a work of such size and pretensions , of whatever character , had been thrown out among the ancient rhetoricians , we imagine that they would have turn-. ed it over , and handled it , till they made something of it . But now , if we should please to assert that this work of Dr Rush surpasses all that the ancients have done ,  --  surpasses all the rhetorical works in the world ; we presume , that not one in a hundred of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for contradicting us. *Z*ir plan is , first , to take notice of these publications , and , then , to offer some remarks on the general neglect of elocution among us , the want of good speaking , and the almost absolute futility of the common methods , devised for its improvement . We confess our obligations to the distinguished gentleman , at the head of the Andover Institution ( as we understand , according to a late arrangement of the officers ) , for the popular and most valuable treatise on the Principles *f Rhetorical Delivery , ' which he has presented to the public . We are obliged , we do pot say to his condescension ,  --  for we hold that to descend to labors like these , is to rise ; hut to the well known professional zeal , which , amidst ill health and the arduous duties of his station , has given us a work , evidently requiring much thought and attention . It is , beyond all comparison , the best work of the kind , that has appeared in our language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin 's Chironomia , which is too elaborate and expensive for common use ; and in the department which forms its principal distinction from other rhetorical works , that of action , too artificial , perhaps , to be safe as a manual . It were to be wished , by the by , that half a dozen copies of this work were placed in all our college libraries . Sheridan 's and Steele 's works had , and have , their value ; but they are too speculative , and go . too much into detail , for the purpose now in view . The same may be said of Walker 's Elocution ; though a great advance on previous undertakings , yet characterized by something of the vagueness and obscurity , and what now seems to us the unnecessary minuteness , incident to the investigation and establishment of new principles . Rome was not built in a day , and those who rebuild and improve , often do it out of the hard-wrought works of their predecessors . Campbell 's invaluable Philosophy of Rhetoric , ' which is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rhetorical uses , does not fall within the range of our present comparison . We consider Dr Porter 's work , therefore , as supplying a most material deficiency in our works on Elocution ; and it is in all respects exactly what was wanted . The Analysis of Principles , ' is sufficiently philosophic , and yet very practical . It is a condensed summary ; the work , manifestly of an experienced hand , the result of much observation ; clear , judicious , and discriminating . We have read , and re-read the whole , and can find no fault with it . We did , indeed , venture to question whether some of the ' exercises on inflection , ' giv*n to illustrate the fifth rule on that head , did not more properly belong to the ninth ; and we suppose that there is some debateable ground ' between these rules . Where the sense *s suspended ; ' and what constitutes an emphatic succession of particulars , ' - questiOns which determine whether the rising , or the falling inflection should be used , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more we have examined these exercises , wh ich occupy more than half of the volume , the more we have found it hazardous to dissent from so respectable an authority . We have only to add that the style of this work , that is , of the original part , is admirable ; and that those who have had the pleasure of listening to Dr Porter as a preacher , will meet here with the simplicity , perspicuity , and elegance , together with the pith and energy of expression , with which he is wont to deliver himself . More we might say , and strongly say , if it were proper , of the rhetorical qualifications of this gentleman , for the task he has fulfilled ; but lest praise should become intrusion , we leave the subject ; again expressing our hearty thanks to Dr Porter , for a work , which , however simple in its character and claims , we are satisfied will do more to raise the tone of speaking in our academies and colleges than anything else that has issued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Principles of Rhetorical Delivery , ' to the much larger and more elaborate work on a single branch of the subject , the Philosophy of the Human Voice . ' This , we do not hesitate to say , is the most important department in the whole science of oratory . The voice is the * principal organ of the soul ; it is that by which the mind first and immnediately pours forth its thoughts . Articulate speech is // the grand instrument of the orator ; the most accurate , flexible , delicate , exquisite , and powerful . It is from this , that eloquence derives its name . We can bear any defect in a speaker , better than a bad , or a badly modulated voice ; none so directly in * terferes with the just and forcible expression of his thoughts . We dwell upon this a moment , partly for the sake of inviting attention to the importance of the subject which Dr Rush has chosen for his essay ; and partly because it is not an uncommon idea , that gesture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorical instruction . We believe that the cultivation of the voice is entitled to this preiiminence , as , at once , the most essential , the most difficult , and the most practicable of all the labors of the rhetorician . It is the most practicable at the same time that it is the most difficult , because while , on the one hand , no man ever became a perfect reader without much practice and deep study , on the other , no one ever failed to improve his voice by daily and careful practice . This is more than can be said of gesture , which depends much on the general manner#of the speaker ; whereas to cultivate the voice requires nothing but sense , feeling , and patient study . And yet nothiug , much as it has been studied both in ancient and modern times , has been the subject of so many vague ideas and descriptions , as the human voice . But , not to wander too far from our object , we return to the essay before us . We have had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to the notice of our readers . But we have not been long in determining that we can not find space for any minute criticism on the work . We can not let our readers far into the mysteries of its nomenclature and notation . We can not go much into detail , in reviewing a book of details . Almost every page is crowded with discriminations , requiring more deliberation and experiment than we are wont to solicit for our own pages ; if it were possible , indeed , to find place in them for discussions of this nature . We shall endeavor , therefore , to give such a notice of this treatise as may , we hope , induce others to read it , rather than attempt to supply them with an abstract so full as to lead them to think a perusal of it unnecessary . We read it with great satisfac .. tion . We considered it as going far beyond any former analysis of the voice . It is from an honest and hearty impulse , therefore , that we recommend it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but reviewing it because we have read it . // Of all subjects for philosophical analysis , Dr Rush has taken up the most difficult . This arises from the flexible , variable , vanishing nature of the voice . It is ever changing . It does not stand still to be the object of attention . It does not pause to be listened to . lie who hunts in this field , to use the huntsman 's phrase , must shoot flying . ' It is like examining objects which pass swiftly before the eye , and almost instantly vanish from sight ; making it nearly impossible on both accounts to distinguish them . And , indeed , the only method of examining the voice , is artificially to lengthen out or prolong its tones ; just as we shouldeause the object of vision in the case just supposed , if we wish to examine it , to move more slowly or to pause before our eyes . It is for this reason , that the singing voice is more easily analyzed , and has been so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound , but it skips from note to note , pausing upon each one , and giving time for the listener to mark and describe it . The speaking voice is like a stream ; the o*server perceives , that there are undulations in it , that it rises or *alls , that its current is stronger or feebler , that its sound is higher or lower ; but all minuter discrimination is lost in its continual flow . Observations of this sort , indeed , pursued , not into detailed and accurate descriptions , but into more vague diffuseness , are by all that we obtain from the ancients . Julius Pollux , as quoted by Austin , enumerates ( Lib . II . c. 4. ) no less than thirty-seven qualities of voice . Our readers may be curious to know what they are . The following is the catalogue ; high , powerful , clear , extensive , deep , brilliant , pure , sweet , attractive , melodious , persuasive , tractable , flexible , executive , mellow , sonorous , distinct , perspicuous , obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indistinct , confused , discordant , unharmonious , unmanageable , not fitted to persuade , rigid , harsh , cracked , doleful , hoarse , brassy , shrill . What can be more wonderful , ' says Mr Walker in a note to his Observations on the Greek and Latin Accent , than that , among so many of the ancients who have written on the causes of eloquence , and who have descended to such trifling and childish observations upon the importance of letters and syllables , we should not find a single author who has taken notice of the importance of emphasis upon a single word ? Our modern books of elocution abound with instances of the change produced in the sense of a sentence by changing the place of the emphasis ; but no such instance appears among the an- // Principles of Elocution. 43 cients . Not one poor Will you ride to town to-day ? ' And yet they labored over the voice , they sent it to school , they had masters for it , they prescribed diet and a course of life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gross eating , much wine , and especially , Veneris damnosa voluptas , ' and requiring moderation , early rising , exercise , &amp;c. - all which , hy the hy , we suppose , amounts to this , that to the cultivation of a good voice , good health is usually necessary . The ancients understood the rising and falling inflections , and that circumflex , which consists of the rise and fall of the voice on the same syllahle . To these , Mr Walker claims the honor of adding that circumflex which is the reverse of the old Greek circumflex , which consists , that is , of a fall and rise of the voice on the same note ; and this , together with the application of these inflections , and some discrimination of the alphahetic elements , has hitherto been the extent of philosophi-. cal analysis , among modern inquirers . It may he asked , what other conditions in the movement of the voice there can be than its monotone , its rising , its falling , its rising and falling , or falling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , there are species to be sought for under these genera . For instance , the voice not only rises , but it rises through semitones , tones , seconds , thirds , fifths , and eighths on the musical scale ; and these transitions are appropriated to various sentiments , the semitone to the plaintive , the tone to ordinary emotions , the third to more earnest , and so on . It is with discriminations like these , that a part of Dr Rush 's work is occupied . In the same manner he traces the descent of the voice through the several intervals of the scale . He , then , applies a similar process of investigation to the circumflex , which he denominates the wave of the voice . ' He not only perceives a rising and falling tone or the reverse , on the same syllable , as others have done , but he finds that it rises or sinks , higher or lower , through various intervals , each having its peculiar expression ; and moreover , that it executes this movement by unequal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it commenced ; a circumflex , or wave , ' expressive of the highest degree of scorn . We can not go farther into particulars ; but this notice of what they may find will induce our readers we hope , to look into these chapters for themselves . Dr Rush has taken tip all the qualities of the voice , and ap // plied to them the same minute analysis . Words have not only force , as a quality of sound , but the stress may be applied at the beginning , the middle , or the end , or throughout ; or it may be compound , being laid at the beginning and the end ; or it may be a particular loudness on one syllable , to distinguish it from the rest . On emphasis , again , we have the same , and many more distinctions . The quality of the voice , time , accent ,  --  in short , most of its rhetorical characteristics have sections devoted to them , in which the object is not to lay down rules and definitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these various respects . There are sections also upon other powers and conditions of the voice , which are new in rhetoric , or invested with new importance ; as upon Aspiration , ' one of the most powerful elements of sound ; on the Tremor of the voice , ' a quality somewhere between its ordinary sound , and laughter or crying , and proper to the most impassioned language of either joyous or distressful emotion ; on the Drift of the voice , ' which is its general and prevalent tone , with reference to the leading sentiment of a discourse or part of a discourse ; and on the Grouping of speech , ' or the skilful mangement of the voice in such a manner as to show the bearing and connexion of the different clauses in a sentence . We can not , in consistency with the further views we have in this article , follow Dr Rush into that detail on these several heads which is necessary to do his thoughts any justice . And , in truth , we are more desirous , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to gratify it . For we repeat the expression of our earnest desire that this work may be much better known . We can not help hearing testimony to the spirit of thorough philosophy , and to the evidences of patient and acute observation , which are everywhere manifest in this very curious and original production . We do not profess to have entered very deeply into this new science , for in the hands of our author it is new ; but allowing for such differences as will arise where the ear is consulted , we yield our full assent to his general principles . We particularly recommend the long sections on the Mode of Instruction in Elocution , ' and on the Faults of Readers , ' to all those who have any thorough interest in this subject . The section on Syllabication , in an early part of the work , is a fine argument . And if any one would take account of articulate sounds , from an ear that seems to have listened to nature as few ears have listened , we would advise him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' // 45 After all , we have had our fears , from the first , that this work would not be much read . It is too profound , for that leisure reading , commonly assigned to books on rhetoric . He who erects an art into a science , and calls for a new style of thinking , for a novel application of the mind , on any subject , must wait with patience for the hearing ear . ' The intrin .. sic difficulty of the inquiry is a still greater obstacle to its obtaining the necessary attention . It is this that deters most men from the study of the mind . But the voice is a more impracticable and evanescent subject for philosophy . The mind has states , at least ; but the voice has no condition but that of impulse and immediate vanishing into nothing . The new nomenclature in this essay will be apt to discourage readers . Indeed , it gives an aspect of novelty to things that are not new . As for instance , what is Dr Rush 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling inflection ? 1f he had oftener stated , how far the books of rhetoric , or its received principles , accompanied him in this inquiry , he would have saved an indolent reader from the appalling difficulties of entering upon what seems to him an entirely new field , and an attentive one from the depreciating feeling , that very obvious matters are made mysterious by the new garb in which they are clothed . And , indeed , we think that there are decided faults in the work , which interfere with its success . There is a tone of contempt toward all former writers on rhetoric , not very conciliating to those who have hitherto taken them for masters and guides . The style , too , is often involved and obscure , and , it seems to us , unnecessarily singular and technical , however new are the thoughts to be exhibited . In fine , we can not commend the manner of this performance , as we cordially do the matter . Dr Rush has not patience . If we had said , modesty , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are many passages which have an air of haughtiness and self-complacency , that are not needed in a work so ca able of resting on its own merits as this . What will be the effects of this Philosophical Analysis , ' we venture not to predict . We wish that we could see a grammar of rhetoric , formed on its principles . In the close of his essay on Greek and Latin accent , Mr Walker has the following language . But till the human voice , which is the same in all . ages . and nations , is more studied and better understood , and *till a notation of speaking sounds is adopted , I despair of // conveying my ideas of this subject with sufficient clearness upon paper . I have , however , marked such an outline as may be easily filled up by those who study speaking with half the attention they must do music . From an entire conviction that the ancients had a notation of speaking sounds , and from the actual experience of having formed one myself , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with more learning , more leisure , and more credit with the world than I have , will be able to unravel this mystery in letters , which has so long been the opprobrium et crux grammaticorum , the reproach and torment of grammarians . ' If we were to apply this language to the whole science of the voice , which it really embraces in its spirit , we might say , that the course and object of Dr Rush 's work comes within the range of the prediction . He has , with his Philosophical Analysis , ' undertaken to give a notation of the speaking vois*e . It is drawn , as we have already intimated , from the sister art of music , and is founded on the musical scale . This is the most natural resort ; since the speaking voice differs from the musical , only in its being concrete , instead of discrete ; that is , only in its flowing through the whole scale . But whether Dr Rush shall be that fortunate philosopher , or whether his system , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not require more attention , than speakers of modern times will give , must be for time and experiment to determine . Having thus attempted to discharge something of our duty towards the works named at the head of this article , we shall now take up the burden of our original complaint , at the neglect with which this whole subject is treated . Let it be admitted . in the outset , that not one man in ten can or could be eloquent , though we do not believe it ; or , if our readers please , that not one in fifty can rise to the highest efforts of oratory . No doubt there is a distinction to be made between agreeable speaking and powerful eloquence ; and we make it , in lintirte , because we would not be charged with the extravagance of complaining that the body of our speakers are not eloquent , in the highest sense of the term . It is the agreeable speaking that we ask for , first of all , and most earnestly . Is it not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is wanted ? Is it not the staple of good oratory ? And if it were not , shall a man say that because he can not speak eloquently , he will not endeavor to speak agreeably ? that because he can not // please in the highest degree , he will take no pains to avoid giving offence ? Nor would the distinction turn out to be , in fact , so great as , for the sake of argument , we have admitted it to be , in statement . If men were trained to this art , with half the care that they are to the offices of the counter or the workbench ; if they were trained from their youth to a just , easy , and graceful delivery ; if the spell of embarrassment were taken off , and they were redeemed , regenerated , and disenthralled ; ' in one word , if their powers and affections had a free and full manifestation , we believe that the l ) roportion before stated would be reversed , and that the nine would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , and the one only would be inveterately dull . For there is by no means so great a difference among different minds , in regard to sensibility , as is commonly supposed . The difference , mt*h of it , lies in the mode and power of manifestation . After all , there must , no doubt , be instances of rare and unequalled excellence , such as Cicero has described in his opening , Dc Oratore ' ; there must be such instances in this art , as well as in statuary or painting . Yet , neither is this altogether a fair comparison . The labors of the sculptor and the painter are far more artificial than those of the orator . The breath of eloquence is in the human saul ; the instruments are provided by nature ,  --  the voice , the countenance , the eye , the lips , the hand , the whole frame ; and if habit did not make men automatons , and embarrassment did not put a dull mask over the human face divine , ' the eloquent soul would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent . We are aware that we touch a point here , on which some may differ from us , or may think they differ , and therefore we dwell upon it for a moment . There is a mystery about this matter with some , and with others there may be a misunderstanding of our meaning . There are some who regard the eloquent man as a kind of immediate creation from the Almighty . They say that a man is born an orator , ' and that it is in vain for any man to strive for excellence in the art , who is not made for it . If by this it is meant that eloquence is a peculiar gift , distinguishable from all the other powers of the human mind , we differ from such an opinion entirely . But if it be meant only , that a man is born an orator just as he is born a mathematician , a philosopher , or a statesman , we have no objection to offer to this position . It confirms what we have // been saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none the less necessary that they should use study and effort ; and this difference is not , in other cases , construed into a discouragement from study and effort . The comparison just made , may also help us to make our meaning understood . There are but few men who can be statesmen or philosophers of the highest order ; but there are many of various degrees of excellence , to whom we apply these titles . Let it be so with orators ; and let it not be said that because only one in a century can rise to the highest sphere , therefore but one has any call to exertion . Or if any one choose to understand by eloquence , the loftiest pitch of excellence , we will not dispute about a word ; let us then , we say , have good spe*ing ; and good speaking , we are sure , will pass oftener than men expect , into eloquent speaking . All that we are anxious for is , that no mystical or unphilosophical ideas of eloquence should prevent men from cultivating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble opportunities that are offered to them in this country . For , look abroad through this goodly land of free and intelligent communities , with its thronged schools , and academies , and colleges , with the most popular institutions in the world , with its theatre for oratory in every town-meeting , with its churches , and tribunals of justice , and halls of legislation ,  --  and tell us why eloquence may not flourish here ; why its elder glories may not be revived among us . We are accustomed to say , and not without reason , that this country offers the fairest field in the modern world for the culture of eloquence . Nor have men lost their eagerness to witness the displays of this divine art . There is nothing , in ordinary times , that will draw such multitudes together , or transport them with such enthusiasm . They actually feel , that is , the multitude , as if there were something divine , something like inspiration , in the inexplicable and overwhelmning powers of a great orator . They are ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not with the same venal feeling , to exclaim , It is the voice of a god ! ' We well remember , in the days of our boyhood , when our fathers and seniors had been up to the distant City , and talked to us , on their return , of the eloquence of Hamilton , that we caught from them an impression of wonder and delight , bor* dering almost upon supernatural awe and admiration . If any one would judge of the estimation in which this glo // 49 rious gift is held , let him observe hour the least approaches to it are received ; how a fine voice , or a prurient imagination , like charity , will cover up a multitude of sins against taste , and reason , and truth ; how the most absolute dearth of thought , or the most barren commonplace , will be forgiven , will escape the notice even of cultivated audiences , if it wear the veil of an elegant delivery ; how-we lad almost named names-but how men of the most ordinary talents will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of the weak alone , but of ' the xvise also , to hear them ; nay , how dignified senators , the most potent , grave , and reverend seigniors ' of the nation , will sit as if they were fastened to their seats , and listen by the hour to the most trifling anecdotes , to the most irrelevant stories , when delivered with the ease , and grac6 and charm of finished oratory . Indeed , in this matter we grow skeptical about the authority of our ( by turns ) most wise Hamlet . The judicious ' do not grieve ' ; but they smile , and listen ,  --  and listen , and look grave , and say it is very good talk . ' And the multitude-it is indeed a gaping multitude , ' and ready to swallow anything that comes in the shape of rhetoric . They are hungering and thirsting for it . They are lifting up their souls for it ,  --  to the pulpit , to the bar , to the senate-chamber . They are ready to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , the most obstinate are willing to be enlightened ; the most obdurate to be melted , the dullest to be charmed , if the power and the wisdom come in the form of eloquence . The field is white to the harvest ' ( not irreverently to make the application ) , but where are the laborers ? Indeed , the laborers are few . ' Some eloquent men there are in this country ; eloquent from the simple force of talent , from the irrepressible burstings forth of genius , on great themes and occasions ; eloquent , because they can not help it . But anything like settled , concentrated , patient effort , for improvement in oratory ; anything like an effort , running through the whole course of education , renewed with every day as the great object , pursued into the discharge of professional duties , is scarcely known among us . The mass of our public speakers would as soon think of taking up some mechanical trade as a subsidiary occupation of life , as they would think of adopting Cicero 's practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member of Parliament , mentioned by Ches // 50 Principles of Elocution. terfield , and very properly justified by him , of being caught in any practice of this sort . The art of speaking well , seems to be thought a trifliug or an unworthy art . Or , is it that most extraordinary desire that prevails so much among no preparation ? Whatever be the cause of this general neglect , the conse*uence is plain enough . The making of good sentences , the first business of a public speaker , seems , by most of our legislative debaters and forensic orators , to be least of all understood . Violations of sense , of the structure of sentences , nay , and of grammar , too , are constantly witnessed . It is really perilous to listen . We are in perpetual terror lest the speaker should make shipwreck of all reason and sense . As be rises on the wave of some swelling period , our own minds partake of his insecurity to such an extent , that we lose all thoughts of his subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our discourses , than with our sentences . Alas ! what would Father Quinctilian and Dr Hugh Blair say , if they could listen to some of our speeches ? The most solemn rules about the exordium , narration , statement , argument , peroratiou ,  --  abotlt the order , progress , climax of a discourse ,  --  about the consistency of metaphors , with themselves and with the subject ,  --  about figures , comparison , vision , hyperbole , are scarcely more regarded among us , than if those venerable personages had never lived . And then , what a variety of gesture . have we , from the arms , that sail about like the arms of a wind-mill , and with as little meaning , to the more common sawing , and hammering , and punching , that suggest a doubt whether the man was not brought up to a different trade from that of speaking . And so it is with the other organs of the speaker . The countenance is dull , or distorted . The voice is harsh and vociferous , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a languid and reluctant effort , as if the alternative were to speak or die . ' And the eye ,  --  we refer now to the pulpit ,  --  the eye wanders upon vacancy , or gazes strenuously upon nothing , or is fixed intently and sedulously upon the cushion , as if it were that Velvet Cushion , ' which teemed with wondrous thoughts to the attentive Vicar ; or the same organ , being lifted up , instantly seeks some pillar or post , on which it may conveniently rest itself . We almost wish , indeed , that those great boxes ; // called pulpits , with their many props and appliances for indolence and dulness , were hewn down , dismantled , and destroyed . Seriously , our only difficulty would beto find a place for the incumbent , and for his manuscripts ; and this we should do by arranging a bare platform , and a simple low reading-desk . For we would not have the manuscripts rashly given up , though they are undoubtedly an obstruction oftentimes to the zeal of the preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , who always literally follows his written page . But it requires a much more thorough training than our preachers yet have had , to venture much upon extemporaneous delivery . On this subject we would earnestly commend to our clergy , a little book from one of their brethren , * intitled Hints on Extemporaneous Preaching ; ' a book which , in some portions of it , illustrates the eloquence it recommends . - It may be thought that we have indulged somewhat in caricature ; but on this subject we are certain that no strength of language can be too great . No caricature , no extravagance , nor ridicule can come up to the absurdity of expecting to speak well , on the slight preparation which is commonly made ,  --  or that which is provided for , in fact , in our systems of education , - for this noble exercise . There may be , of lawyers , clergymen , and others , probably twenty thousand public speakers in this country . We do not believe that , on an average , they have each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their professional duties . The orator , with the ancients , was held to be the perfection , the beau ideal , of a man . They directed that all the powers of their noble youth should be concentrated to the attainment of this character . But that training of all the faculties to this great accomplishment ; that various study , all with reference to this end ; that sedulous culture of the memory , the judgment , and the fancy , as the polished instruments of eloquence ; that laying in of the stores of learning and the treasures of history for its use ; that patient , constant , daily practice of reading and speaking ; and , at last , that summoning up of all that was strong , and beautiful , and accomplished , and treasured in the mind , to the great endeavor ,  --  that almost godlike sway and mastery over human hearts , at which they aimed ; - all this , we seem as little // to think of , as if it were detailed in the stories of old romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are content to be slaves , and to wear chains . And yet we are speakers , forsooth , and we talk about eloquence ; or we are passing through courses of study preparatory to an appearance before the public ; and occasions and subjects that stir up all the passions of the soul are offered to us ; the high claims of justice are to be pleaded ; the great interests of the nation are to be discussed ; the tremendous powers of the world to come , ' if we may speak so , are to be wielded ; and yet the chain is upon us , the chain of mechanical habit , or slavish timidity ; the arm moves constrainedly in its socket ; there is a leaden weight upon the tongue , and a film upon the eye , that should flash forth the fires of the soul ; opportunities nobler than those of heroism are unimproved ; the temple of justice but rarely yields inspiration ; the public councils are tedious ; and the pulpit ,  --  that new and nobler field of eloquence ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more awful power , than when Demosthenes fulmin 'd over Greece , ' is proverbially dull ! But what can be done ? This is the question which we shall now attempt to answer . We shall speak with earnestness and confidence ; and if there shall seem to be anything positive and dictatorial in our suggestions , we must be excused , on the ground , that , to our minds , the case is as clear as it is cogent . We observe , then , in general , that this great aim  --  to speak well-must pervade the whole course of education ; we mean the education of those who are designed to be public speakers . We would not fall a whit behind the demands of the ancient rhetoricians in this respect . We would have it said to our youth , You must study , learn , acquire , comprehend , compass everything , with reference to that end . Your acquisitions are all to be put to that use . Your learning may indeed be valuable to yourselves on its own account ; but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to communicate it ? Without this aim , you are acting as absurdly as the merchant 's clerk , who should always be poring over Anderson 's Commerce , ' or treatises on commercial law , and never gaining any acquaintance with trade ; or as the apprentice , who should busy himself with studying the principles of mechanics , and never make himself acquainted with tools . If you were destined for the anchorite 's cell , it would be enough for you to know ; but // if you are coming forth upon the theatre of life , for what are you to come ? Is it to fold your arms , or worse , to have them pinioned to your sides ? and to have every power that you are cultivating , disenabled and rendered useless ? No ; it is for action , that you are to come forth ; and the action , if you are to be public speakers , is to be emphatically that , under which the old orators comprehended the whole body and soul of eloquence . ' There never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to them , and urged upon them , than the youth of our colleges . There is talent enough , and hard study enough , perhaps ; but there is no sufficient feeling of the great relation to active life ; nothing like that which must have been awakened in the schools of ancient eloquence ; nothing like that which must have animated the ardent youth that waited on the steps of Cicero , as he bent his way to the Roman forum . For want of this , the secluded and silent cells of our colleges are often the graves of genius , rather than its ndrseries . We might almost apply , without parody , the words of Gray to them ; Some village Hampden , with his dauntless breast , * * * * * * Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest , Some Cromwell , guiltless of his country 's blood . Th ' applause of listening senates to command , The threats of pain and ruin to despise , To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land , And read their history in a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No ; but their minds do not grasp it . We speak with feelings at the farthest possible remove from disrespect or scorn . We speak , it is true , more from recollection than from actual observation . But we remember how it was , and we suspect it is too much so still . We remember in what insensibility we passed that period of our lives , of all that was to he done and dared in the world . And there is another trait in our learned institutions , which many among us may probably be able to call to vivid remembrance , if they do not still observe it . There was , and there is , we believe , something , shall we call it , of a stoic or of a monastic spirit , in our colleges , with regard to learning . There was among us , we well remember , a feeling , that it was enough to know ; that knowledge was to be valued singly and solely for itself ; that the only worthy ambition was to be thorough scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sQme of the best and noblest minds , an almost stern and scornful feeling towards all exhibition , or desire of exhibition . In this feeling , it was very naturally forgotten , that the ultimate object , after all , is exhibition ; and that all learning and genius , but to their possessor , are useless without it . We have often thought that it would have been of great service to us , if we had , at that period , read the Letters of Lord Chesterfield to his Son . XVe recommend not their spirit ; their worldliness , we mean ,  --  for the taint of licentiousness is a thing that only appears here and there , and does by no means infect the volumes as deeply as is commonly supposed . But the useJessness of all talents and acquisitions , without the power of exhibition , is set forth , with a variety , pith , wit , and earnestness , to say nothing of an almost unequalled style , that would make them a valuable lesson to our young men . From this general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of education , let us descend to particulars . The business of training our youth to this accomplishment must be commenced in childhood . The first school is the nursery . There , at least , may be formed a distinct articulation , which is the first requisite for good speaking . How rarely is it found in perfection among our orators Words , says one , referring to articulation , should ' be delivered out from the lips , as beautiful coins , newly issued from the mint ; deeply and accurately impressed , perfectly finished , neatly struck by the proper organs , distinct , in due succession and of due weight . ' * How rarely do we hear a speaker whose tongue , teeth , and lips , do their office so perfectly as in any wise to answer to this beautiful description . Arid the common faults in articulation , it should he remembered , take their rise from the very nursery . But let us refer to other particulars . Grace in eloquence ,  --  in the pulpit , at the bar ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in private life , in the social circle , in th' family . It can not be put on with the toga civilis . It can not well be superinduced upon all the other acquisitions of youth , any more than that nameless , but invaluable quality , called good breeding . You may , therefore , begin the work of forming the orator with your child ; not merely by teaching him to declaim , but , what is of much more conse * Chironomia. // 55 quence , by observing and correcting his daily manners , motions , and attitudes . You can say , when he comes into your apartment , or presents you with something , a book or letter , in an awkward and lAundering manner , Just return , and enter this room again , ' or , Present me that book in a different manner , ' or , Put yourself into a different attitude . ' You can explain to him the difference between thrusting or pushing out his hand and arm in straight lines and at acute angles , and moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful action . He will readily understand you . Nothing is more true than that the motions of children are originally graceful ; ' and it is by suffering them to be perverted , that we lay the foundation for invincible awkwardness in later life . We go next to the schools for children . It ought to be a leading object in these schools to teach the art of reading . It ought to occupy three-fold more time than it does . The teachers of these schools should labor to improve themselves . They should feel , that to them , for a time , are committed the future orators of the land . We had rather have a child , even of the other sex , return to us from school , a first-rate reader , than a first-rate performer on the piano-forte . We should feel that we had a far better pledge for the intelligence and talent of our child . The accomplishment , in its perfection , would give more pleasure . The voice of song is not sweeter than the voice of eloquence . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers . We 51 ) eak of perfection in this art ; and it is something , we must say in defence of our preference , which we have never yet seen . Let the same pains be devoted to reading , as are required to form an accomplished performer on an instrument ; let us have our phonasci , as the ancients had ,  --  the formers of the voice , the music-masters of the reading voice ; let us see years devoted to this accomplishment , and then we should be prepared to stand the comparison . It is , indeed , a most intellectual accomplishment . So is music , too , in its perfection . We do , by no means , undervalue this noble and most delightful art ; to which Socrates applied himself even in his old age . But one recommendation of the art of reading is , that it requires a constant exercise of mind . It demands continual and close reflection and thought , and the finest discrimination of thought . It involves , in its perfection , the whole art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine genius without being a perfect reader ; hut he can not be a perfect reader without genius . // Let us now advance some steps higher , to our colleges . We mean no disrespect to their guardians , and certainly not to their officers ( whose duties are appointed to them ) , in what we are about to say . But we do entertain a full and entire conviction , and experience , observation , the actual result , warrant us in a full conviction , of the absolute futility of the attempts hitherto made , for training up the youth of our colleges to be accomplished advocates , debaters , and preachers . We remember to have asked an intelligent rhetorical professor in one of our colleges , what he was doing to make his pupils good speakers ; and his answer was , that he was beginning to think , nothing could he done . And we are persuaded that nothing can be done , till a great deal more is done . The case craves more thorough dealing than it has yet had , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are inclined to believe , that we had rather take our chance with a speaker , who had never declaimed in his life , who had never heard of a gesture , than with the body of those who have had the training of our colleges . It seems to us as true of eloquence , as of philosophy , that a little learning is a dangerous thing . ' There is a homely proverb , that men should beware how they handle edged tools . ' We think that tones , inflections , gestures , are such things . There are three states of the manners ; a native and crude simplicity ; next , the awkwardness and constraint of a man , introduced , but not accustomed to a public situation or a polished society , and trying to put on manners for the occasion ; and , finally , the ease , grace , and self-possession of the finished gentleman . And there are the same states in the manners of the public speaker . Now what we say , is , that if we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . It may he thought that we are saying bold things , and that we shall have few to agree with us . Let , then , these suggestions pass for the opinions of a few , or of less than a few . We are certain at least that we should have the old orators to agree with us . If Cicero were to rise among us , what would he think of the means and methods we use to form the orator ? If Quinctilian were to write again , he would find occasion to put with a new and satirical meaning , the apparently simple question , whether rhetoric be an art . " Another of his questions , he might think it almost indecorous to discuss among us ; namely , whether rhetoric be a virtue . ' It , certainly , is both ; Tind yet we treat it , as if it were neither ; or , at least , as if it x er* a // 57 virtue , an art , so very low , as to be worthy only of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , we pray , is done , and under what circumstances ? Possessed with innumerable bad habits of speaking , laden with blunders that have been accumulating through fifteen years , the boy is sent to college . What is done for him there ? He is required to declaim five or ten minutes , once in a month , or once in two months . One , two , or three weeks pass over him ( this is ordinarily the fact ) without his thinking of the matter but to dread it ; without his once opening his lips , in private , to declaim , or to do anything for his improvement in this most important branch of his education ,  --  anything to prepare himself for the principal use of his powers as an educated and professional man . This , we think , we might take for granted , if we did not know it to be , generally , the fact . This , the corporations of our colleges are bound to take for granted , because they have no reason to suppose that anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done . Take the most interesting study pursued at college ; and if a recitation were required only once in a fortnight , or a month , we know that , generally , nothing more would be done than to prepare for it . Once in a month , then , ( this is probably a fair average ) the pupil is called upon to declaim , before his teacher and his fellow-students . As the time approaches , he casts about him for a passage for declamation ; he commits it imperfectly to memory , rather than studies it ; he repeats it to himself , silently or aloud , a few times , and then goes forward to the trial . From begin ning to end , it is an irksome business , it is a thing by the by ; it is a hasty preparation ; it is a feverish effort ; and in the trial , the whole power of the individual is often taken up , with recollecting , or with striving to keep down his embarrassment , or with trying to appear not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come the terrors of criticism ; he stands like a criminal before his judges ; he quits the stage , as an accused man does the bar of trial , and feels only more comfortably than the culprit , inasmuch as he is not going to jail . For he is condemned , or let off as not worth criticism ; he is condemned , or feels that he ought to be ; condemned by himself , if not by his tutor ; he feels that he has done no justice to his own conceptions , and he retires , mortified and ashamed . *W*.kiv ' . w , that we are describing many and many a case , if VOtJ .

It is impossible , with the time and pains and means commonly used for accomplishment in this art , that the ingenuous learner , the noble aspirant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have spoken of the terrors of criticism . This fear is the pest and bane of good speaking in all our colleges . To our youthful orators , everything is wanting if they have not freedom . But they are made the slaves of criticism . And what , we ask , is to do away this fear , so long as the highest and most difficult of all arts , the most varied , exquisite , and comprehensive of all the exercises of talent , receives so little attention ? What but familiarity with a task like this , can beget freedom in it ? We do not know of a more comprehensive sentence with which the author of Hints on Extemporaneous Preaching , ' could have closed his little work , than that of Goldsmith , in which these two requisites and pledges of success are stated ; namely , to feel time subject thoroughly , and to speak without fear . ' Let us , while these pages are in mind , makQ arm extract from them in connexion with our present remarks . If any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilled in the very elementary principles ; and only after the most laborious process , dares to exercise his voice in public . This he does , though he has scarce anything to learn but the mechanical execution of what lies in sensible forms before his eye .

If he were devoting himself to the organ , what months and years would he labor , that he might know its compass , and be master of its keys , and be able to draw out , at will , all its various combinations of harmonious sound , and its full richness and delicacy of expression .

' pp. 59-61. // We can not resist adding to this , the following extract from Dr Rush , a line or two of which we hope our college instructers wiJl pardon , in consideration of the general truth and pith of the paragraph . Go to some , may I say all , of our colleges and universities , and observe how the art of speaking is not taught there . See a boy of but fifteen years , sent upon the stage , pale and choking with apprehension , in an attempt to do that , without instruction , which he came purposely to learn , and to furnish amusement to his class-mates , by a pardonable awkwardness , which should be punished in the person of his pretending and neglectful preceptors , with little less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orderly tasks , the masterly discipline , the unw*aned superintendence , and the incessgnt. toil to produce accomplishment of voice ;  --  and afterwards do not be surprised that the pulpit , the senate , the bar , and the chair of medical professorship are filled with such abominable drawlers , mouthers , mumblers , clutterers , squeakers , chanters , and mongers in monotony ; nor that the schools of singing are constantly sending abroad those great instances of vocal wonder , who sound along the high places of the world ; who are bidden to the halls of fashion and wealth ; who sometimes quell the pride of rank by its momentary sensation of envy ; and who draw forth the intelligent curiosity , and produce the crowning delight and approbation of the prince and the sage . ' pp. 489 , 490 . But , to return ; how unavoidable is it , that this ' uninstructed tyro , ' should be . ' mortified , ' and disheartened . How can it be otherwise than that agitation and fear should take possession of Jiis mind ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . imperfect lessons , taken at todd times , ' and irregular intervals , bear to come before a great audience , with his crude performance ? He would be more than a mortal man , or , certainly , more than a modest one , not to fear . The situation of a public speaker is as trying , as his task is great . He who has scarcely acquired ease and freedom in private society , with no other responsibility than to behave with propriety , or to make himself agreeable , is to rise up in the presence of a great assembly ; the only object of attention ; the only voice listened to , his ; - himself , environed with the eyes of hundreds . It must require laborious , assiduous , long continued preparation to meet a situatiol ) like this , with an unfaltering tongue , a calm eye , and an unshaken nerve . Without such a preparation , it is a species of cruelty to force upon a man duties like these . We // say to the speaker , or should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not seem at ease ; you did not give us your eye steadily ; you used no action , or you made gestures that meant nothing ; you were cold and dull ; you ought to have electrified your audience , in such a part of your discourse ; you should let out your feelings ; you should give up your whole soul to what you are saying ; it should hang upon your lips , it should beam from your eye , it should thrill your whole frame ; - all which is about as wise , as if we said it to the slave . How can a man , and be a man , discharge the highest and noblest function in the world , with less training than i*required for the most common occupation in life ? how can he do this , and do it without distrust , embarrassment , and awkwardness ? The spell that binds and paralyies all the faculties , is fear , and nothing can shake it off but studious practice . Even familiarity will not do it . For the speaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become familiarized but to constraint , and apathy , and despair ; familiarized to that palsy , which will never more permit him to put forth the vigor of his faculties . We have already ventured in part upon the implication , that our college exercises in declamation do more hurt , than good . The truth is , they leave the pupil , just in that position between rudeness and accomplishment , that constitutes awkwardness ; that makes him feeble without grace , and stiff without vigor . They do just enough to discourage him ; justenough to make him feel his deficiencies ; just enough to create the feeling , so natural to lingering but unsuccessful efforts , that he never can exert his powers in this way . Any observer may often see a plain man , earnestly talking in the streets , or speaking in a town-meeting with a glow of countenance and a propriety of gesture , which he might well wish to see transferred to the pulpit or the bar . And better , than to require these occasional and inefficient declamations , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural impulses , to leave it , to the great occasions of life , to draw forth a just and powerful oratory . If there be any force in what we have said , we would most earnestly solicit a hearing for it , from the trustees and guardians of our academies and colleges , and of those higher institutions which are designed to prepare our youth for the pulpit and bar . We humbly suggest to them , whether oratory , as a science and an art , should not be more distinctly recbgnised in // the plan of a public education ; whether it should not have hours of study and practice appropriated to it ; whether , in fact , it should not occupy as large a space as any other branch in the course of public instruction . We had it in mind before closing our observations , to suggest a project and plan for a School of Oratory in this country . But in truth all our colic .. ges ought to be such schools . There is a great deal to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises in rhetoric , that a great deal of time must be taken up , merely with correcting faults and removing bad habits , before the student can enter , free and disembarrassed , the career of great excellence . It is notorious , that . but few of our educated young men , when they leave college , are so far advanced even as to be good readers . We see and lament this defect continually in our pulpits ; and we lament it the more , when occasionally in the hands of a skilful reader , the Bible is unfolded to us , almost as a new book . But we leave our suggestions on this point , again earnestly commending them to those , with whom it remains to decide whether we are to go on for years to come , without any essential improvement . But we can not leave our public institutions , without taking notice further , of What seems to us the prodigious waste of study and talent , which the present system involves . Here and there a man , from some fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or favorable situation , breaks through the difficulties that keep down other men , and rises to a considerable measure of eloquence , and becomes conspicuous in his neighborhood or in the country at large . But do we not know that there are hundreds of others , whose powers and acquisitions are equal ,  --  who think as clearly , and feel as deeply , but whose talents are buried in comparative obscurity ? who think eloquently , who feel that it is within ' them to address eloquent thoughts to their fellow men , but who can never say , with Sheridan , it s/tall come out ' ! It is not for the want of study , that these men , the majority , fail . What years have they spent , and spent all their substance too ; what days of toil , and evenings of patient thought , have they pursued to the midnight hour . The waning lamp has been no romance to them , the fixed brow and the feverish pulse no poetry ; they have toiled , reckless of health and comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that has wasted away the strength and prime of their youth ; and when they come to the crisis of // their fate , when they stand before the great public , and are put to the trial in which they are to rise or fall , for this world ,  - -  they find , alas , that the very office they have there to discharge , is the office which they are least of all prepared for . With all the sciences and arts they have labored to understand , they have never learnt the grand art of communication , the science of speech ; with all the languages they have mastered , they have never learnt the language of eloquence ; and their acquisitions , their reasonings , the collected wisdom of sages , the gathered lore of centuries , sink to nothing before the pretensions of some flippant declaimer . It is from this cause , no doubt , it is from want , of the power of communication , that preachers are often unreasonably charged with dulness . It is not , always , that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a situation for which he is not properly trained , he sinks into a mechanical habit , from the very inability to give just and natural expression to his emotions . Many and many a sermon has been written ( it is not too much to say ) with burning tears , and when it came to the delivery , has been struck , as if by magic , with the coldness of death ; and he , whose breast glowed with sacred fervor in the closet , has appeared in the pulpit , as a marble statue . May we be permitted , in passing , to suggest to our preachers and public speakers , the propriety , nay , the duty of paying some attention to this subject ? We allow that the effort to improve , at this later period , is attended with considerable danger . Some , no doubt , have injured their style of delivery by such , an effort . Their manner has become artificial ; and they have lost in power , what they have gained in correctness . We venture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is , to forget all definitions , rules , and praxes , when entering the pulpit or the bar , to have no gestures or tones provided beforehand , but to give ourselves up wholly to the impulse of the occasion , letting whatever improvement there may be in manner , tone , &amp;c. be , at the moment , altogether unpremeditated and insensible . With this precaution , we have no doubt that reading or declamation an hour every day , would be of the most essential service , and would in a single year , if the practice were universal , put almost a new face upon our pulpit and bar . The labors requisite to form the public speaker are by no means duly appreciated among us ; and this is the first great difficulty that lies in the way of our argument . There is // 63 nothing like the ancient estimation of this work . An absurd idea prevails among our scholars , that the finest productions of the mind are the fruits of hasty impulse , the unfoldings of a sudden thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashings of intuition , or the gleamings of fancy . Genius is often compared to lightning from the cloud , or the sudden bursting out of a secret fountain . And eloquence is regarded as if it were a kind of inspiration . When a man has made a happy effort , he is next possessed with an absurd ambition , to have it thought that it cost him nothing . He will say , perhaps , that it was a three hours ' work . Now it is not enough to maintain that nothing could be more injurious to our youth , than this way of thinking ; for the truth is , that nothing can be more false . The mistake lies , in confounding with the mere arrangement of thoughts , or the manual labor of putting them on paper , the long previous preparation of mind , the settled habits of thought . It has taken but . three hours , perhaps , to compose an admirable piece of poetry , or a fine speech ; but the reflections of three years , or of thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good rule , no doubt , to write with fury , and correct with phlegm ; ' but a man can not write with fury , and write with sense too , without much previous thought . He may write with folly , and that is often done . He may imagine that he is writing finely , because he is writing fast , and that his sounding pen flies over an inspired page ; and that is likely to result from the absurd application of the maxim , that happy efforts are hasty ones . Genius is thought , is study , is application . The two simple , but magic words , which contain the secret of Newton 's greatness , according to his own explanation , are patient thought . ' There is not a more indispensable characteristic of genius than good sense . It is this that has given to the true works of genius , universal reception and immortal fame . And here , too , is indicated the rock , on which thousands have split . Many men have a powerful imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense , requisite to control it . They have not learnt , in the very torrent , tempest , and whirlwind of passion , to acquire and beget the temperance , that may give it smoothness . ' We wish that we could see an analysis of genius on these principles ; that we could see unfolded all the previous thought , the patient study , the thorough reflection , the fine discrimination , that are necessary to produce even a page of really fine wri // ting . It would be a useful lesson . It would teach our aspiring youth , that they never can succeed without labor ; that it never will do to trust to irregular hasty efforts ; that they might as well expect literally to command the lightnings of the tempest without philosophy , as without philosophy to wield the lightnings of eloquence . They ought not to have this power without laboring for it , without waiting patiently at the shrine of that divinity ,  --  the Industry , which alone can give it . The gift is too great , too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , which deserves to be considered by itself ,  --  the greatness of the art . To give the noblest thoughts the noblest expression ; to stand up in the pure light of reason , or to create a new atmosphere , as it were , for intellectual vision ; to put on all the glories of imagination , as a garment ; to penetrate the soul , and to make men feel as if they were themselves new creatures , to make them conscious of new powers and a new being ; to exercise , in the loftiest measure , the only gloriQus and godlike sway , that over willing minds ; to fill the ear , the eye , the inmost soul , with sounds , and images , and holy visions of beauty and grandeur ; to make truth and justice , to make wisdom and virtue and religion , more lovely and majestic things , than men had ever thought them before ; to delight , as well as to convince ; to charm , to fascinate , to win , to arouse , to calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of eloquence ; and it is a glorious work . The great object of all the liberal arts is to exhibit the mind ; to exhibit character , thought , feeling , in their various aspects . In this consists all their power and sublimity . For this , the painter spreads upon the dull canvass the breathing forms of life ; the sculptor causes the marble to speak ; the architect mo ( 1Cl5 the fair and majectic structure , with sublimity entkroned in its dome , with beauty shaped in its columns , and glory written upon its walls ; and the poet builds his lofty rhyme ; and the eloquent in music , orders his movement and combination of sweet sounds . But , of this mind , the human frame is the appointed instrument . It was designed for this end . For it could have answered all the purposes of physical existence , without any of its present grace and beauty . It was made with no more obvious intent , than to be the expression of mind , the organ of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers are put in requisition for this purpose ,  --  the voice with all its thrilling tones ; the eye , through which , as a window , - // the soul darts forth its light ' ; the lips , on which grace is poured ' ; the whole glowing countenance , the whole breathing frame , which , in their ordinary forms , can express more than the majesty of an Apollo , more than the agony of a Laocoon ; when every motion speaks , every lineament is more than the written line of genius , every muscle swells with the inspiration of high thoughts , every nerve is swayed to the movings of some mighty theme ; - what instrument of music , what glories of the canvass , can equal it ? Eloquence is the combination of all arts , and it excels them all in their separate powers . Nor is it confined to the mere gratification of taste . The great and ultimate object of social existence , is for man to act on man ; and eloquence is the grandest medium of this action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being ( for the orator must be a good man ' ) but it is that perfection in act . it is sublimity , beauty , genius , power , in their most glorious exercise . Eloquence , it is often said , is the peculiar attribute of man . But more than this is true . It belongs to humanity . The human soul is eloquent , whenever and wherever it has a full devolopement . Its signatures are divine ; and where they are seen , they can not fail to leave their impression . it is one of the maxims with which we have no patience , that the English character is not fitted for an earnest delivery ; that eloquence will not flourish on this stock ; that there is something in our temperament or taste that forbids it . The English mind not eloquent ! We might as well say , that it is possessed of no strong feelings or noble thoughts . For if it has these , and has them , in fact , in uncommon strength , has it not a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfettered arm , the weapon of the orator , ' to express them ? It is true , that our taste may not be altogether so favorable as it ought to he ; a dull , prudish , perverse taste . It is true that our ordinary manners in this country have not the desirable ease and freedom ; there is newness , embarrassment , awkwardness , constraint , in them ; they are not so free and forcible , and not so indicative of the free workings of the mind , as they ought to be . But these , after all , are rather the manners of ceremony , and of formal society . Go to the exchange , the market , the public street , the municipal meeting , and you shall see , that the men , in whose veins English blood is flowing , can be ardent and earnest , and can use action , though they do not know it ; and that is the right action . Go up to the greater // occasions of life , to the crowded and grave assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our own Ames , and Hamilton , and Emmet , and the names of the living among us , that rise to our thoughts , are sufficient to wipe away the stigri*a , that we are so willing to fasten upon ourselves ; sufficient to show that our court-room and our debating-hall are not always tedious , and that our pulpit is not always dull . It is another maxim , as little to he endured , that oratory must decline with the progress of knowledge and refinement ; that the age of eloquence is , in fact , passing away from us . We believe it not , any more than we believe that the age of thought and feeling is passing away . It is a shallow maxim , arising from an imperfect developement of mind , which is too often mistaken for refinement and decided improvement , when it is only the crude , fermenting process , that is leading to improvement . Is the mind to grow feeble , as it advances ? Is feeling to lose its intensity in true refinement ? Is truth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity to be less divine or mighty , because exaggeration has ceased to move us ? Is the soul to be bereft of its energy , or shorn of its brightness , as it emerges to light , and rises to sublimity ? Some of the awakening themes of eloquence may pass away with those occasions of tyranny , oppression , and danger , that create them . Enough of these , however , are likely to remain . But others will open , more glorious and majestic than these . These , too , will arise in new forms , so long as wickedness and misery prevail in the earth . We have as yet broken down only some of the outward barriers , in the way to social and individual happiness . There are other and more formidable enemies to be met in the great struggle for human welfare . The single evil of intemperance is as powerful a call for eloquence , as the most oppressive tyranny that ever cursed the earth . Heaven grant that there never may be occasion for Philippics ' in this free land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warnings , and all the arousing and pleading voices of eloquence , for many and many long years , before the united energies of this nation shall have wrought out that happy state , to which the patriot and the philanthropist are looking . It is , indeed , an Nnmense and glorious field ; and we trust that it is to be cultivated , with labors such as have not yet been seen among us . We look for future orators in this land , whose words of might shall shake its wide and utmost // borders , shall resound from the Atlantic to the Pacific seas ' ; and whose renown shall be the heritage of distant generations . We trust that a voice is to arise in this Western world , which shall echo to the glorious eloquence of ancient times .
