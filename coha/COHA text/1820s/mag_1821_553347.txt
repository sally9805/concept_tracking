Columbia , 1820. 3 . Report of the Board of Public Works to the legislature of South Carolina for the year 1820. // IN the complaints , which are so often and perhaps so justly made , of the want of national patronage for great public objects , too little , it may be , has been thought of the tendency of all our political institutions , to throw the care of these ob-. jects upon those who are more immediately concerned in effecting them . In a country of such prodigious extent as ours , presenting such occasion for every species of public works and public improvements , it will be allowed that the national legislature ought to proceed with extreme caution , in applying the common funds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we are divided into independent cQmmunities so rich and powerful , that scarce any object of public utility is beyond the grasp of the resources of the single states ; so that , after all , the care of individual objects of public improvement is put into the hands of those most sure to be benefited by them , and most concerned by interest and most enabled by local situation to accomplish them with zeal and economy . At the same time that this consideration ought to reconcile us to the abandonment to state patronage of many objects , to which the great engine of the national resources might be honourably and usefully applied , we are far from defending a penurious policy on the part of the general government ; and of all the applications of the principle of constructive powers , if we may be pardoned the pleasantry in a serious connexion , we regard with most complacency that which authorizes Congress to construct roads , canals , and other similar public works . That the cause of internal improvement meantime is not suffering in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the truly glorious enterprise now achieving in New York , to which we have long coveted and hope soon to enjoy an opportunity of particularly calling our readers ' attention , but in the public works of the states of Virginia and North Carolina , to which we have , in former numbers of our journal , devoted some of our pages , and those which are going on in the same spirit in South Carolina . It is obvious that commerce depends not only on the diver.sity in the productions of different countries ; but on the *omparative cost in different countries of the same article . Among the circumstances that affect this , the expense of transportation from the place of growth or manufacture to the market is not the least considerable . In the case of an article so // bulky as cotton , this must necessarily constitute a material part of the cost . For this reason , canals , which have ever been an important object in commercial and manufacturing nations , and in the eyes of enlightened governments , become peculiarly so in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded to . South Carolina , generally speaking , possesses a fertile soil , and from an early period contributed largely to British commerce , in the articles of indigo and rice . Of late years not only has the first of these given place , in the lower districts , to that variety of the cotton plant distinguished by its short staple and green seed ; but it has been found that the higher lands are congenial to the same species of cotton . It has accordingly spread through the western districts ; a circumstance which greatly adds to the importance of the works , which have for their object the facilitating of the water carriage from the upper portions of the state to the coast . The state contains about twenty-four thousand square miles , and is naturally divided into the primitive and the alluvial country , the former extending westward from the falls of the rivers , the latter eastward about an hundred miles to the sea . As the climate of the upper country permits white men to labor , it has become populous ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , it is warmly seconded by the lower country in the measures especially necessary to its prosperity . During the war in Europe and the increased demand for cotton , its culture rapidly extended ; but when peace allowed commercial nations to resume their enterprise , a supply of this commodity would of course be sought from sources least obstructed and expensive ; and in the market of American cotton thus reduced those portions of our country would necessarily have the advantage , who could bring their produce cheapest to the coast . Discerning men in South Carolina could not be slow in perceiving , that neighbouring states were in possession of advantages of natural navigation from the interior superior to their own . It was plain that the Missis .. sippi would pour a large amount of that staple product into the marts of the old world , at little expense beyond its first cost . The Savannah had been rendered navigable for steam boats , and the rate of carriage from Augusta to the metropolis materially reduced ; while the fertility of the banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emigration of their enterprising fellow-citizens . Meantime , however , it wa* equally open to remark , that South Carolina itself was traversed by numerous rivers , and possessed the advantage of an excellent port ; and of a wealthy metropolis , towards which every stream directed its course , actually requiring less expense to be rendered navigable , than the cost of land carriage for a single year . The importance of these considerations may be estimated by the value of the annual exports of the state , which had now risen to fourteen millions . Accordingly in December 1818 , on the motion of Mr Poin .. sett , the legislature passed a resolve , directing the civil and military engineer of the stam to devise and adopt all such means as he shall deem expedient for opening certain rivers , therein specified . ' We beg leave to invite the attention of our readers to the objects contemplated in this resolve , and the progress made in effecting them . The principal rivers of the state of South Carolina are the Santee and the Pedee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement of the navigation . The Santee communicates with Charleston by the Sea Island pas . sages , and is ascended without material obstruction to the vicinity of Columbia , a distance of one hundred and fifty miles . This city , the seat of government , is situated on an elevated plain , near the junction of the branches of the Congaree , denominated the Saluda and the Broad river . These latter streams , after flowing more than a hundred miles through a productive country , as they approach each other , are precipitated over successive ledges of granite , of no inconsiderable elevation and extent , and one great object in the internal improvements in South Carolina has been to remove the obstacles thus produced in this part of the water carriage . The judicious plan of the engineer appears to have been , to throw a dam across the Saluda* at the head of the falls , and from the more elevated surface of the river thus produced , to fill a canal , opened for the distance of two miles across the intervening ground , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks about the middle of the falls . He then placed a dam a short space below the lock , and thereby flowed the upper part of the falls , and produced a reservoir to supply ' another canal , formed within the opposite shore , between the river and the city , leading at the distance of three miles , to // deep water at the steam-boat landing . In its course opposite the town , this canal is enlarged into a dock , for the reception of the luggage boats from below to exchange loads with the smaller craft of the upper navigation . After the confluence of the Saluda and Broad river , the stream takes the name of Congaree to its junction with the Wateree ; after which , under the name of the Santee it descends to the ocean . The Wateree is naturally navigable to Camden . Above that town several falls occur , at which considerable works will be necessary , before we come to Rocky Mount , the greatest of the falls of South Carolina , and beyond which the river still bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , and measures a hundred and seventy-eight feet of perpendicular descent . The canal already commenced at this place , though remarkably favored by local circumstances , must be expensive . It does not appea that any estimate thereof is offered . When we recollect the inherent difficulty of computing an expense which depends on so many contingencies , the omission is not injudicious . It is said , however , in the report , that its completion ( together with the works doing in North Carolina ) will open the navigation to the foot of the Blue Ridge , within fifty miles of the navigable waters of Tennessee and three hundred from Charleston , in a direct route for the trade of the Western States . ' This route may be very important , especially in time of war , in connexion with the water communication between the Southern and Eastern States , subsequently to be mentioned . The Pedee , which name the Yadkin takes after an extensive course through the most productive districts of North Carolina , waters all the northern part of the state of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till it finally reaches the coast at Georgetown harbor . By the *kilfui application of mechanical engines , the bed of this river has been cleared , in two seasons , of the accumulat , ions , which collect in streams in an alluvial country before the banks are made a subject of public cftre . The several branches , moreover , of this river appear to be all considered of importance in the general plan . The Waccamaw has , however , been esteemed of peculiar importance . Its course is nearly parallel to the sea coast , and it is of a depth capable of carrying vessels of one hundred and fifty tons to the dis // tance of eighty miles . This river owes its peculiar importance to the circumstance , that the inland water communication , so desirable between the southern and middle states , must be opened by means of a short canal from the nearest point of its course to Little river . This river discharges itself near Bea*fort , within the Sea Islands of North Carolina . By means of these works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water carriage becomes practicable from Florida to the head of Chesapeake Bay , thence to the Delaware , by the canal long since commenced , ( but suspended for want of funds , ) and from the Delaware to the Raritan ; conveying southern produce to the remotest shores of the lakes and to the centre of New England . In a time of war especially , this inland navigation would be of great importance , defended as it might readily be , at exposed points , by floating batteries or steam gun-boats . Experience has already taught this country how severely the interruption of commercial intercourse would be felt , under long continued hostilities , without safe water carriage both of produce and other merchandise , to say nothing of the munitions of war , and supplies for the navy* The general plan of the improvements in South Carolina , is to concentrate all the business of the state , and of some part of the adjoining states , at the capital . From the harbor of Georgetown , therefore , a canal is making five miles , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we consider the quantity of produce that must descend all these rivers to pass this little work , its beneficial effect must be very great , compared with its expense ; besides its importance , when viewed as a part of the chain of inland water communication among the states* We have only to apprehend , that it may be made on too narrow a scale for that great purpose , and without conformity perhaps to the other links in the chain . It must not be forgotten , that the dimensions of this work will regulate those , which may hereafter be made in relation to it , in the other states , where manufactures are as progressive , as the agriculture of South Carolina . But we ought to retract our hesitating expression when we regard the liberality and enlightened spirit which the state has . already evinced . One million of dollars was at once appropriated to these various works ; and not less than a thousand northern laborers employed the second season . The works were commenced at once in so many places , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct them . To remody this defect , at the session of 1819 the Board of Public Works was constituted by an act of the legislature , composed of five members , two of whom are professional engineers , with salaries , the others public spirited individuals , who serve without compensation . The board is invested with corporate powers ) end all requisite authority , and is under the presidency of Mr Poinsett . Besides the works already enumerated , the Ashley , which flows on the southern side of Charleston , is to be connected with the Edisto , by a canal of twelve miles . This river divides itself into two branches , and waters an extensive district towards the Savannah , the southern boundary of the state . And it seems to be even intended to open a communication with that extensive river . The board have , moreover , comprehended in their design every conceivable improvement for the facilitating of the inland communication . They have made no small progress in the formation of a road , leading through the state towards Tennessee . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Columbia , and from that town to the Saluda mountain . In all their operations the views of the board appear to have been ably seconded by the personal exertions of gentlemen of fortune and influence in every part of the country . It has not escaped the observation of the intelligent projectors of these works , that they would avail but little , without a good system of navigation . It has , therefore , been their policy to encourage the introduction of steam boats , and other modes of conveyance , from which it has been demonstrated from some examples how great the savings to the public must finally be . We find it stated , in the second pamphlet at the head of our article , that since the Pedee river has been cleared of obstructions , so as to afford navigation for steam and team boats , cotton has been carried from Chatham and Society Hill to Georgetown for seventy-five cents the bale , whereas it could not be carried the same distance , by land , for less than two dollars , or by water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar twenty-five cents . ' From Columbia , it is supposed , though this is not stated in the report , that 200,000 bales annually , of cotton , may be expected to descend . The saving of the cost of carriage on this amount would be - $250,000 // The difference between land and water carriage on half the quantity down to Columbia may be esti mated at - - - - - - - 125,000 The saving on merchandise carried into the country we have no means of knowing but by comparison . The country which Charleston must supply is more extensive than New England . Now , through Hadley canal , on Connecticut river , there pass annually 6000 tons , through Middlesex canal about 2000 , and on the intermediate roads probably 3000 ; in all 11,000 tons , with a saving of 10 dollars a ton , on wa* ter transportation . Allowing no more to South Carolina , we must to the former items add , for the saving of 10 dollars on 11,000 tons - - - - 110,000 $485,000 Such is the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit , however , will principally depend on the modes of conveyance that shall be adopted . That mode of course will be preferable which shall best subserve the interest of the planter and the merchant ; not that which is numerically the cheapest , but that which shall unite despatch with safety , regularity and economy of time , as well as moderateness of expense . The time required for the transport of produce to market is of material consequence . The demand , early in the season , is brisk ; and the sooner the crop is down , the more opportiwiities there will be of a sale ; besides , that the cotton is gathered in and prepared successively . Every great planter has successive quantities to send to market , and is solicitous to get them quickly to the hands of his factor . The reasons for despatch are scarcely less urgent in the transport of supplies into the country , especially towards the close of the spring business and the approach of midsummer , when intercourse with the seaports is suspended for some months . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is placed , by the board , on the use of animal power in navigating these extensive rivers . It is not our purpose to decry experiments of any kind ; nor to discredit the utility of this mode of conveyance , when nothing better is to be done . When , however , this last is not the case , it is an obvious question , whether the substitution of the power of the steam engine for horses has been fallacious . In England , the breweries , dis // tilleries , and mines , are notorious instances of the preference of steam engines ; and the use of them on rail roads would be more applicable still to the elucidation of the point , were we better furnished with facts . It is stated in the report , that a boat propelled by the labor of eight mules , navigated by five men , carried three hundred bales two hundred and fifty miles in fifteen days , at the expense of a hundred and sixteen dollars twenty-five cents , and that the freight was seventy-five cents a bale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent profit to the navigators was a hundred and eight dollars seventy-five cents . The object of this statement was only to shew the savings by this operation to the public ; as the land car*age of the same number of bales would have amounted to six hundred dollars . It is unquestionably true , that for short distances , animal force may be applicable , while for great distances it is of doubtful expediency , among other reasons , because it can not in its nature be at every moment equal . It is never operative to the full measure of the force employed . The steam engine on the other hand is a force , at every moment equal and indefatigable ; and , whether great or small , is managed by one man . Though eight mules or horses can be governed and driven at once , it does not follow that sixteen could be . This power , therefore , has its limits in practice . It would be absurd to think of employing in one boat the animal force of forty horses , while it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To estimate the comparative economy of steam engines , and horse power we are enabled to state the facts of an experiment on the Merrimack , in Massachusetts , with a small steam towing boat of five horse power . Her wheel was placed in the stern to enable her to pass through the locks on that navigation . She towed two boats of her own burden along side , and ascended the river at the rate of thirty miles a day . Her expenses are estimated to have been twelve dollars a day , for fuel , men , &amp;c . We are inclined to think that even this steam engine , in the situation of the team boat abovementioned , would have done the business to more advantage , for the reason that the passage would have been made in five days , and at the expense of - - - - - - $60 and would have carried 180 bales at 75 cents - I 35 yielding a profit of - - - - - - 75 // or for three trips of five days $225 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat for the same time . The difference in favor of steam engines appears much greater when on a larger scale . Take , for example , one of fifty tons instead of ten tons , this being the size which we under .. stand is contemplated by the Boston company to navigate the Pedee and pass the five mile canal near Georgetown . First , the steam boat will receive half a load - - - - - - 20 tons 2 luggage boats each 40 - 80 So that the load is - - 100 tons or 600 bales . The equipage and other expenses will he twenty dollars a day , aiI*ounting in a passage of seven days to - $140 Freight at $1,50 per bale - - - - 900 Apparent profit - - - - 760 Boats exceeding a hundred tons would probably not be so economical , simply because their burden would not perhaps permit of continual freights , nor admit of that celerity and despatch necessary to this branch of navigation . We scarcely think it necessary to name the superior duration of engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness and death . It is obvious , that if an engine requires to be readjusted , there is meanwhile no expense for fuel , but if one or two of a set of mules are unable to perform , still the rest must be fed . Experience and interest will undoubtedly instruct and guide men in all kinds of business : nor should we have dwelt thus long on this topic but from the apparent retrocession of this expedient from the great modern improvement of steam navigation . A difficulty exists in the navigation of the southern rivers , in the liability to extreme *drought : but this it is proposed to overcome , in the building of the hulls of steam boats , by the use of that very light and durable timber , the spruce , which abounds in New Hampshire and Maine . A concurrence of favorable circumstances has attended the rapid settlement and improvement of the fortunate coun-. try , of which we have been speakifig . In climate and in productions-and ultimately in the facilities of trade , it will be unsurpassed by any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of cotton cultivated between 36* of N. latitude and the gulf of Mexico  --  and from the // Atlantic to the Mississippi , may be too great for the European demand ; and that we shall meet with a disadvantageous competition from india , and from the South American colonies . Yet this fear seems unfounded for the following reasons , which at once occur . Cotton will bear to be sent to China , when it costs here but ten cents per pound . With good management , it is supposed the planter might afford it even at eight cents . The voyage from the United States to China being much longer than from Bengal thither , we may safely presume , that if we are able to come into competition with India in the cotton market , at this rate of cost here , the price in India must be at least as great , and therefore that the India cotton can not interfere with ours in Europe , when the price is thus low , because the freight for a longer voyage than we have to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commerce to the United States is seen in the fact , that more than half of all the cotton manufactured in England is from the United States ; the quantity from India however is not small . In 1810 , there were received seventy-nine thousand bales from that country : and from this , two hundred and forty thousand . In 1811 , from India , fourteen thousand six hundred bales ; from this country , one hundred and twenty-eight thousand five hundred . The *auses , whatever they were , which produced this diminution in one year , evidently affected the India trade , more than the American trade , in this article . If we have indeed any thing to fear , it is from the Brazils . From that country the importation into England is less than from ours , in the proportion as three to eight , and from all other places , as three to ten . Uncertainty always attends cornmerce* but the wants of mankind are ever reviving . Our own country will consume a great quantity of cotton , new uses of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , probably equal the progressive extent of its cultivation . When , however , the gross quantity becomes too great , improvements in the quality will be attempted . The use of gypsum as a manure has the same effect on this , as on other plants . Skill in this branch of husbandry will be exerted . The labor of the white population will be found , as it already is in the western districts of the Carolinas , not only practicable , but productive of cotton of better quality . In contemplating the immense resources of our country , we // are perhaps too prone to exult in its advantages . We shall not , however , fear to cherish a sentiment of national pride in them . And although it be not a new thing that a territory , extending through various climes , should reciprocate from its extremities the benefits of trade , yet it is a circumstance equally remarkable and satisfactory , that these United States should be so bound together by diversity of habits and interests ; a diversity once supposed to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cement of the national structure . In closing the report it is stated , that from the progress made there is reason to believe that nearly all the improve .. ments contemplated by the legislature , opening an inland navigation of more than fifteen hundred miles , will be completed in the year 1822 , and within the sum pledged and set apart for internal improvements .
