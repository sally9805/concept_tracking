Pierpont , John , 1785-1866 : THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE. from The Garden of Gethsemane ( 1829 ) O'er Kedron 's stream , and Salem 's height . And Olivet 's brown steep , Moves the majestic queen of night , And throws from heaven her silver light , And sees the world asleep . All but the children of distress , Of sorrow , grief , and care  --  Whom sleep , though prayed for , will not bless ; These leave the couch of restlessness , To breathe the cool , calm air . For those who shun the glare of day , There 's a composing power That meets them , on their lonely way , In the still air , the sober ray Of this religious hour . ' T is a religious hour ;  --  for he Who many a grief shall bear , In his own body on the tree , Is kneeling in Gethsemane , In agony and prayer . O , Holy Father , when the light Of earthly joy grows dim , May hope in Christ grow strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , In trust and prayer like him .
