txt ART . 11. - Collections , Topographical , Historical , and Biographical , relating principally to . Yew Hampshire . Vol. 1 . Concord , N. H. Hill &amp; Moore , 1822 . THE object of this work , the publication of which commenced two years ago , is to collect and examine the accounts of Indian wars ; to present before the public whatever may be found remarkable concerning them ; to give topographical and civil sketches of different towns in New Hampshire ; and to preserve , in an authenticated and durable form , biographical notices of the eminent men of that state . This design is of a nature fitted to secure the approbation of all persons , who feel an interest in antiquarian pursuits , who wish to see the transmission of early records , and preserve the long remembrance of early deeds . It is pleasant to dwell on the memory of the past ; it is natural for men to look back on the sources of time , and in the lives of their ancestry , more than anywhere else , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to mark the conduct of those , who now exist only in fife recollections of their descenda*ts , as they were situated in times of dilliculty , and JVcw Series , JVo. 17. o // in seasons of trial and suffering . It is a duty clearly incum-* bent on the citizens of our republic , to do what they can to elucidate our early history . It is but a few years since our soil was burdened with impenetrable forests ; it is but a short time since the savage wandered in their dusky shades , and with his yells disturbed the cottages of the intrepid settlers . Many things may yet be learnt in respect to those times , which are treasured up in the memory of aged people , who will soon be no more . Whatever may be gained from such people , or from the voice of tradition , must be secured soon , or the opportunity will be past . That the object , therefore , of this publication should be approved , might be expected ; we wish , that publications with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We owe it to ourselves , and to the memory of our ancestors , to collect and preserve , if possible , every thing that relates to their deeds and characters , their sufferings and perilous situations . Historical studies have been cultivated with perhaps as great a *legree of spirit and interest in New Hampshire , as in almost any state in the Union . The late President Whee-. lock was a man of great historical research , and the enter .. prising and lamented Brown , his successor in the Dartmouth Institution , gave every encouragement in his power to studies of that kind . The History of JV'ew Hampshire , in three volumes , written by Dr Belknap , formerly pastor of the Con .. gregational society in Dover of that state , is a classical work , which exhibits everywhere proofs of great care , labor , and purity of taste . One of the recent chief magistrates of New Hampshire has devoted a great portion of a long and laborious life to historical pursuits ; and , as we have reason to suppose , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of this article , a Memoir of Dr Belknap . That distinguished scholar and historian was born in Boston , June 4th , 1744 . He entered Harvard Uni .. versity at fourteen years of age , and was graduated in the year 1762 . While in college , he attracted attention for his zeal in classical studies , the fertility of his imagination , and the correctness and seriousness of his deportment . He was settled in Dover , as a colleague with the Rev. Jonathan Cushing , February 18th , 1767 . Besides the History of New Hampshire , he wrote the Foresters , an simerican Tale ; . lmerican Biography , in two volumes ; a Discourse , at the // request of the Massachusetts Historical Society ; several Essays , Sermons , and Theological Dissertations , published at different times ; and he also prepared a collection of Psalms and Hymns , which is now used in many CongregationaJ churches . Among the accounts , which have appeared in the Historical Collections , the narration of the contest with the savages , commonly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lovewell 's Fight is one of the nursery tales of New Hampshire ; there is hardly a person that lives in the eastern and northern part of the state , but has heard the inci-* dents of that fearful encounter repeated from infancy . It was in April of 1725 , that Captain John Lovewell , of Dunsta-. ble , Massachusetts , with thirty four men , fought a famous Indian chief , named Paugus , at the head of about eighty savages , near the shores of a pond in Pequackett . Lovewell 's men were determined either to conquer or die , although outnumbered by the Indians more than one half , They fought till Lovewell and Paugus were killed , and all Lovewell 's men but nine were either killed or dangerously wounded . The savages having lost , as was supposed , sixty of their number out of eighty , and being convinced of the fierce and determined resolution of their foes , at length retreated* and left them masters of the ground . The scene of this desperate and bloody action , which took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often visited with interest to this day , and the names both of those who fell , and those who survived , are yet repeated with emotion of grateful exultation . The early contests between the aborigines and our countrymen on the frontier settlements , in which there were commonly but a few engaged , appear to be of but small consequence and little moment , when compared with the intense emotion ana vast consequences , connected with the perhaps more civilized , but not more sanguinary encounters in Eurcpe , where tens and hundreds of thousands meet on the fields of* death . Still they possess an interest , and it is one of no ordinary kind to those , who have heard them repeated from . their early days , or have wandered amid the woods and waters where they happened . The story of the captivity of Mrs Johnson is written in a plain and neat style , well adapted to the subject , is full of // incident , and we venture to say , that hardly any narration , whether true or fictitious , will excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an original communication to the Collections , but appears to have been written several years since ; we suppose from the date subjoined to it , in the year 1798 . The editors observe , In this number of the Collections we have commenced publishing a narrative of the captivity of Mrs Johnson , who was taken from Charlestown , in the county of Cheshire , in this state , in the year 1754 . This work was written many years since , by a gentleman of distinguished literary reputation , and though a work of his early years , contains many just and accurate observations on the dangers and hardships of settling a new country , and the cruelties which awaited those who were taken into captivity by the Indians . ' The sufferings , which were endured by Mrs Johnson , and those who were led into captivity with her , are such as to give a most impressive , and affecting idea of the toils , and dangers , and privations , incident to the situation- of those of our ancestors , who first made inroads into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manner so plain and vivid , and with such marks of truth , that , when reading it , we can hardly fail to see the forms , and hear the yells of the savages , who , before the light of morning returned , broke into the house where the captured family dwelt ; we behold the boundless forest , and the elevated mountains ; we follow with intense interest the captives in their fatiguing journey , with their bleeding feet and woewotn countenances ; we sail with them on the waters of Lake Champlain , and sympathize in their sufferings in the prisons of Montreal . The future poet will find his imagination kindling , when he reflects on scenes and situations , such as are described in this narration , and it will yet be , since they afford themes so rich with incident , that the woes , and dangers , and trials of our ancestors , shall live in the enduring monuments of immortal song . The republication of ancient historical tracts , and the history of particular towns , churches , and individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publication under notice , will be of essential service to future historians . In this way , as many of the events in our history are still recent , and as persons are yet living , who can give information , that // may be relied on , some of the errors , which have crept into our books of history , may be corrected . There is an instance of such a correction in the June number of these Collections , for the year 1823 , in a historical notice of the town of Rochester . Dr Bclknap , in giving an account of the events , which happened in New Hampshire , 1746 , speaks of a person being killed in Rochester in such a manner as to leave it to be understood , that he was killed by the savages . The man 's name was Roberts , and he was slain , not by the savages , but by one of his own townsmen . He was stationed , as we learn from the Collections , not far from the brook , called Norway Plain brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the main road to Dover , another sentinel was stationed near the garrison house . The advanced sentinel , Roberts , from some circumstance or other , became terrified , and retreated . The sentinel on the hill hearing a noise in the bushes , and seeing them wave , suspected that the savages had passed by Roberts , and were approaching to make an attack on the garrison . He accordingly discharged his gun and shot Roberts , who died the next morning , blaming himself , and justifying the man that shot him . We consider it a matter of real consequence , that every error of this kind , though it should relate merely to the destiny of a single individual , should , if possible , be corrected . American history will cease to be valuable , when there is reason for suspecting it to be filled with inaccuracies . We wish that it may go down to posterity , an unimpeached and unimpeachable monument . The early periods of our history are unlike those of Greece and Rome , and almost all other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained , and the traits of almost every prominent character are preserved in the written records of our nation . Very little obscurity rests even on the remotest periods of our history as a people , and , with this exception that there are probably a few inaccuracies , which , it is to be hoped , time and further research will correct , the history of the American nation , including both our fortunes as a confederacy , and events of merely a local and individual character , is in a great measure well authenticated . While , however , it remains a fact , that further information as to some points may be expected and is desirable , both for correcting errors . // and embodying many incidents and portkrns of history in productions of more interest , and a purer taste , than those in which they have hitherto appeared , we trust every effort , which shall have a tendency to secure these effects , will meet with its due encouragement . As the articles in the Collections are written by different pens , a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed ; but , although they are in general well written , we are not at liberty to bestow that commendation on all of them , which we thought justly due to the narrative of Mrs Johnson . There are some specimens of composition in this work , which would do no credit to productions of far inferior pretensions , and which certainly would not be tolerable in this , were it not that it grounds its claims to the public approbation , rather on the diligence of its search after authenticated facts , than on the graces of an elaborate diction . It is with pleasure that we notice the recent formation of a Historical Society in New Hampshire , which will essentially aid the exertions of the editors of this publication in their laudable attempts , if , as may naturally be expected , the*. society should make this publication the organ of its communications to the public . New Hampshire has been behind some of her sister states , in the formation of a society for historical inquiries . The Massachusetts Historical Society , which was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Boston , in January 1791 , and incorporated in February 1794 . The New York Historical Society was instituted , December 10th , 1804 . The Essex Historical Society was incorporated in 1820 . The Historical Society of Rhode Island commenced its operations in 1822 ; the Society of New Hampshire was incorporated , June 13th , 1823 . One of the causes , which delayed the formation of this society , is probably the circumstance of the principal seminary of the state being situated in its extreme western part . It is a seminary , which , in consequence of the circumstances , and the object of its origin , is remembered with feelings of regard and interest by those , who take pleasure in witnessing the spread of the Gospel , and probably the majority of the literary men of New Hampshire are indebted to the Dartmouth Institution ; still it is too far from the centre of the state to operate . as an efficient bond of union to such // men , and to unite and strengthen the literary spirit and enter-. prise of the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly respectable name among the states of the confederacy ; a name which has been won and will be sustained , we trust , by the industry and enterprise of her inhabitants , by their patriotism , and by the favorable disposition which is prevalent , towards a general dissemination of useful knowledge . From the first settlement of the country , she was ever willing to do her part towards the military expeditions , which were fitted out against the French and the savages , and it was not often that any portion of her soldiers shrunk from toils and hardships , or dishonored their name by discovering a deficiency of courage . Those , who take pleasure in recalling the periods of our wars and fightings , will associate with this state the names , among others , of Stark , Sullivan , and Miller ; men , who have secured to their memories a durable renown . We do not know that poetry has found many votaries *among the sons of New Hampshire , but we have at times seen specimens of their efforts , which show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can inhale the breath of their inspiration , and tejoice in the surrounding sublimities of nature . There are few portions of the Union , which can furnish more to gratify and to excite the powers of an imagination truly poetic , one that is fond of the marvellous in incident , and of the wild and enrapturing in scenery* The wonderful stories , which were told in the primitive times , of Passaconaway the Penac6ok , of Paugus the chief of the Pequacketts , and of Wohawa , who , though a Frenchman by birth , invaded the frontier settlements with more than the cruelty of a savage , are yet remembered and repeated with interest . Even Jocelyn and Darby Fields are not forgotten , and many an untutored lad has been more than half per- suaded to leave the unpoetic roof of his forefathers , and emulate the marvellous wanderings of those early adventurers , by going to search for carbuncles on the Clzrystal Hills . We are not of that number who imagine that poetry is an useless art , and , though republicans by birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor plan , when he contemplated the banishment of the sons of the lyre beyond the precincts of his ideal commonwealth . It is true , we have to lament , as all well meaning men will lament , the // unhallowed use of their powers by some of the great poets of the day , and we sincerely confess that we should wish our hills and waters to remain unsung ; incidents , worthy of a long remembrance , to continue unconsecrated ; and the breath of the Muses ' enchantment never to be heard , rather than our soil should be burdened and contaminated by a race of poets , who can not keep away infidelity and impurity from their strains . But we hope better things from American poets ; Bryant has set them a good example , both in the purity of his taste , and the serious and heart ennobling tone of his sen .. timents . Poetry is chiefly valuable , when , by revealing the odiousness of vice , and displaying the charms of virtue , it is able to secure an elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affections . It is not necessary that it should lose sight of these great ends , even when it undertakes to paint the deepest and wildest of the human passions , and to embody , in the forms of language , whatever is beautiful , and picturesque , and sublime in nature .
