She appeared to have been , in a measure , sanctified from her birth , and , from the first dawn of reason , to need only to be informed what her duty was , to perform it . " There is evidence , however , that , for a time at least after she was capable of understanding her duty and her obligations to God , her heart was not devoted to him . In a letter to her son dated Jan. 13 , 1823. , she speaks of having a distinct remembrance of a solemn coRsultation in her mind , when she was about three years old , whether it was best to be a Christian then , or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . But the God to /z/ ' whom she had been dedicated , and whose blessing her parents had so often and fervently supplicated in her behalf , did not suffer her long to rest in this sinful determination . When about five years of age , she was brought by the Holy Spirit to consider the duty and consequences of becoming a Christian indeed more seriously , and , in the opinion of her parents and of other pious acquaintances , to choose God for her portion . Of the correctness of this conclusion of her parents and friends she always entertained doubts , and regarded a season of deeper , and , in her view , more scriptural , religious impression , when about ten years of age , as the commencement of holiness in her heart . She made a public profession of her faith in Christ , and joined the Church of which her father was pastor , on the 19th of April , 1807 ; having just entered her seventeenth year . About this time she commenced a private Journal , which was continued till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her death .

This is the end for which we were created ; consequently , this alone can make us happy . Are not all the pursuits which engage our attention , except religion and those which are consistent with it , vanity ? Do we not follow a phantom , which shines but to deceive , which blazes but to insnare , us ? We are all in pursuit of happiness ; " who will show us any good ? " is the universal question . And how can it be better answered , than by pointing to that religion which heals every wound ? than by directing the inquirer to the balm in Gilead and the great Physician there ?

The cold apathy and insensibility , or suppression of feeling , which was inculcated by some of the ancient philosophers , might dignify a heathen . But their erroneous system of theology was not capable of affording to its disciples that holy peace and heavenly pleasure which are the blessed effect of real conversion to the religion of Jesus .

No : a Christian may blush at himsefy but he can never be ashamed of the name of his Lord . Surely , duty , interest , all , call upon us to take refuge under the wing of the Almighty .

Your observations respecting our inability to attain resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly Father , *Thy will be done , ' are undoubtedly just . But let us not forget the nature of this inability . , It is not such as furnishes any excuse or extenuation of our sins when we are not resigned ; but the very thing that constitutes our guilt , proceeding from the opposition of our hearts to the character and government of God . It should therefore produce in us deep humiliation and contrition , and drive us to the foot of the cross . The want of this resignation , this perfect acquiescence in the will of God , is one of the principal sources of the unhappiness of which we constantly complain . Could we acquiesce with cheerfulness in the dispensations of an unerring providence , we should at once feel a spark of celestial happiness enkindled in our hearts/ But this is a state of which frail humanity /z/ comes far short , at the best . We wish to have this or that desire complied with ; and think that , could we but obtain the accomplishment of our wishes , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be granted ; the wisdom and good* ness of God assure us it is so . And yet , because they are denied , we sink into despondency and grief . My dear friend , I believe that if we could view things as they really are , we should find reason to say , The Lord hath done all things well ; mercy and peace go before him continually . Afflictions are sent for our profit ; and if we do not profit by them , the fault is entirely our own . They are designed ta convince us of the unsatisfying and fleeting nature of all things beneath the sun . We should not therefore , when they are upon us , indulge the sorrow of the world which worketh death ; but pray that they may be made to work in us the peaceable fruit of righteousness , and , in the future world , a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory . While we are " pilgrims and strangers ' in this valley of tears , we must constantly meet with sorrows and troubleSf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This then , religion , is the hidden treasure , the pearl of great price , to obtain which we should sell all that we have . This it is that afibrds happiness in life ; this it is that smooths and softens the pillow of death ; this it is that leads its disciples to a heaven of unclouded day . My dear N. , do we possess this treasure ? Important question ! involving joys and sorrows inconceivable and eternal ! If we do not , let us , without delay , draw near to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy . There is a glorious Mediator between God and man . And He whom we have oflfended says to us , " Ask , and ye shall receive ; seek , and ye shall find. ' qwq MBS . SUSAN HUNTINaTON . It TO HISS L. , or If . H , Killingworth , July fUd , 1808 . Your letter , my ever dear M* , has just been handed me , and has afforded me great pleasure . It convinced me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , at the same time that it assured me of your friendship , conveyed to my heart a degree of consolation which I greatly needed , and which the divine truths it contained are so well calculated to inspire . We are subject to a thousand weaknesses , the natural attendants of frail humanity : it is not strange , therefore , that we should sometimes feel oppressed with doubts and fears . Indeed a certain religious author says , ' The soul that never doubted , hath never yet believed : for while flesh remains in the believer , it is unbelieving flesh ; and it is the office of faith to subdue this unbelief in all its activities . ' There are , it appears to me , two kinds of doubt respecting our spiritual state , to which we are sub  - -  ject . One is a distrust of God 's omnipotence , mercy , willingness to save , &c.,; something like that which , we should suppose the Apostles felt , when they exclaimed , with astonishment , Who then can be saved ? " The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith , &c.,; in ourselves . I do not think that my doubts are occasioned by any distrust of the blessed God . Oh ! no , God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; else why did he give his Son to be a ransom for sinners ? why does he run to meet the returning prodigal , while yet a great way off ? why does he continue to hold out to us the sceptre of his mercy , when we are practically saying to him , We desire not the knowledge of thy ways ? That God is love , is evinced by every thing around us as well as by iVv dc-/z/ aliens of his word . He is able and willing to save to the uttermost , all , who come unto him with faith in the merits of his Son . The difficulty seems to be entirely in myself . I am so cold and lifeless , so faithless and unbelieving , that it seems to be almost impossible that I should be allied to any thing good . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ought to be humbled in the very dust ; but I am far less abased before God than I feel that I should be . How far am I from that fervour of spirit in serving the Lord , and that deadness to the world , that watchfulness and zeal , which I ought to have , and which I long to possess ! My dear M. , it is a great thing to be a Christian at any time , especially in these last days , when iniquity abounds , and the love of many waxes cold ; when Hhe declensions of Christianity ' ' may be produced as a sad argument of its truth . ' ' But it is God that worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure ; and to him the work is as easy now as at any other period . Were the whole world around us faithful disciples of Christ , there would still be a law in our members , over which God alone could give us the victory , through Jesus Christ our Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptations , and it would be easier to maintain a close walk with God . Nothing short of omnipotence can , indeed , cause light to shine out of darkness . But the greatness of the work should not cause our hearts to sink in despondency . No work is too great for God to perform ; and he has promised to help those who trust in him , and to give them all that they ask agreeably to his will . Desjidndency must then arise from want of faith . This it was in Peter , which impelled him to exclaim , Lord , save me , I perish ! * ' He did not fully trust in the power of his divine Master , but yielded to fear , excited by the ronh appearance of the waves on which he stood ; iffiu. sirsAN HirifTiyoTOzr* IS foietting that He , whom the winds and the sea obey , was at his side .

The friendship which you feel for us all , and which we all feel for you , rendered any apology , in regard to your commencing a correspondence with me , needless . I hope ever to consider you as one of my friends ; and , as such , your letter could excite no other sensations than those of pleasure . The silence which you preserved while here , upon the subject of our beloved Eliza 's death , I did not impute , either to indifference , or insensibility . You knew her too well , to suffer the remembrance of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the theatre of life . And you are not possessed of that stoicism of feeling , which would preclude your * The person whose death is here referred to , was her sister , Mn . EJiza Olcott of Kiliiogworth . MRS .

I rather imputed it to a reluctance to open afresh those wounds , in the bosoms of the members of this family , which can never be entirely healed , by recalling to our memories the recollection of one of our number whom God has taken from us . She was all that was amiable and lovely ; and none can realize our loss , bat those who knew her as we did . Could I not feel that there is indeed a God that judgeth in the earth , and that though clouds and darkness arc often round about him , yet righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne , and did I not believe that he orders every thing for his own glory and the highest good of his intelligent creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink under his chastising hand . But the persuasion that ihe Lord reigneth in perfect righteousness , is not my only source of consolation under this trial ; for I have reason to hope that my dear sister died in peace , and slept in Jesus , and has entered into that rest which remaincth for the people of God . In this view , death seems disarmed of his sting , and I sometimes feel disposed to bless the Lord , for having released her from sin , and every attending sorrow , and admitted her to the full enjoyment of himself . Dear departed Eliza ! Thy journey was short ; but thou hast arrived at the haven of felicity , and God has wiped all tears from thine eyes . The various inquiries you proposed , need more time and wisdom than I possess , fully and properly to answer . Those which more immediately interest yourself , excite , in a peculiar degree , my attention . I suppose you consider yourself , as to be ranked among the sixth class of undecided characters mentioned in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt between two opinions , from a half persuasion that they are right , while opposed in their plans by the opinions and wishes qC /z/ flhiends &c.''; This is certainly a very unpleasant situation , and I am sincerely sorry il is yours ; because , when we are undecided in our own minds respecting any particular pursuit , there is less prospect of usefulness and happiness in life , than there would otherwise be , on account of our being , by this means , prevented from properly exerting our powers , and as it also prevents or clouds that approbation of our own hearts , founded on the firm persuasion that we are good soldiers in a good cause , which is as an anchor to the soul . I wish it were in my power to give you all that advice you desire from your friends , and to direct your mind to the course of duty and of happiness . I would direct you to that divine Book which contains directions for all , given by One who can not misguide ; directions which , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and hereafter . Seek from the fountain of grace , wisdom profitable to direct , and grace to help ; and be assured , you will not seek in vain . You say , it has , a long time , been your desire to preach the gospel , and that though , at times , a sense of your unworthiness leads you almost to relinquish this your darling object , yet you feel that by relinquishing it , you would give up also all your hopes of earthly happiness . If this is the case ; if you also feel this pursuit your duty , if you indeed desire to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified , and if you ardently long to glorify God and benefit the souls of men , I certainly think you ought to enter the ministry . Your distrust of yourself is no ground for discouragement . On the contrary , if you did not feel your weakness and unworthiness , you would have reason to doubt whether you had ever seen your true character , as delineated in the Scriptures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Renounce all dependence on /q/ yourself . Be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might : and you need not fear . With regard to the subject of Episcopacy , which seems to engross so much of your attention , I think myself qualified to say but little . I have never entered into the spirit of the controversy , and have but little information on the subject . I would refer you to Dr. Mason* , Dr. Millert , and others , who have written , so far as I am informed , ably and scripturally , upon the topics in debate between the Presbyterianst and Episcopalians . You think you can do more good as an Episcopal minister . Why ? You must give some reason for supposing so , or you may fail under the appellation " romantic , " according to Foster . What leads you to think you can do more good in the Episcopal ehurch ? Is it that Episcopal ministers are generally more successful in winning souls to ( ' hrist , than Presbyterian ministers ? Or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will exceed other ministers , in both churches , so far as to be peculiarly blessed ? Indeed , my friend , 1 would not damp your zeal , or cloud your prospects of usefulness . I hope you may be blessed of God , and turn many to righteousness . But I believe , judging from facts and the promises of Scripture to all faithful heralds of the cross , that you may be as useful a minister in the Presbyterian as in the Episcopal church . Are the doctrines which Episcopalians , in this region , usually embrace , more scriptural than those held by the Presbyterians ? That baptism is not regeneration , appears to me so plain , from the scriptures and the best observation of * Articlei , in the Christian 's Magazine , on Episcopacy. t Letters concerning the Constitution and Order of the Christian Ministry . t In Connecticut , the Congregationalists are usually called Presbyterians. 20 MfiMOIBS OF the world around us , as to need no other demonstration . If it be , I do not see that any can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Saviour explicitly affirms that ' except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God . " And can you adopt a sentiment which leads to such a conclusion ? You seem , however , rather to suppose that regeneration may be regarded , as always accompanying baptism , when the subject is presented in the proper spirit . If parents give up their children in this ordinance in faith , you appear to think , they may be , uniformly , regenerated . But who had worse children than Eli and David ? And yet they were both holy men , and no doubt gave up their children to God in faith in the ordinance of circumcision . And do we not sometimes see the best parents , who , we can not doubt , have , in faith , dedicated their offspring to God , and , by both precept and example , taught them the way of righteousness , afflicted with children who are utter strangers to the power of divine grace ? If this be the case , we must either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion in question is erroneous . With regard to that expression of our Lord in his conversation with Nicodemus , ' Except a man be born of water and the Spirit , &c.'^; it is , I think , evident , for the reasons just stated , that the phrase born of water " does not mean baptism . Mr. Henry , author of the Commentary , thinks that water is used in this place figuratively , to express the cleansing or purifying effect of the saving influences of the Spirit . " The washing of regeneration " and " baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire , " are , in his opinion , phrases synonymous with this . But I have heard it objected , In saying that baptism is not regeneration , you depreciate its worth , and render it of little or no use . ' By no means . It 's not being a converting ordinance , is no reason why we should consider it useless and of no efficacy . Conyersion /q/ is not immediately and inseparably connected with reading the Scriptures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that account , to be regarded as of no use . They are means of grace , and those who do not use them will , most probably , never be converted . Baptism initiates the subject into the visible Church of Christ , and implies the most solemn engagements , on the part of the parents , to train up their child in the way he should go ; and , if they fiiithfully fulfil their engagements , there is reason to hope , that when he is old he will not depart from it . If baptism is regeneration , Christ 's exhortation ' Strive to enter in at the strait gate , &c."; was unnecessary , for the road to life is so broad and easy of access that few can miss it . That the faith which is not followed by good works , is of no avail , I readily allow : or , to speak more properly , if good works do not appear , there is no faith at all , the soul is unregenerate . Nevertheless , neither our faith , nor our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ground or meritorious cause of our acceptance with God . It is certain that we can not be saved without faith , for the Scripture saith , He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life ; and he that believeth not the Son , shall not see life , but the wrath of God abideth on him . ' ' Yet it is not our faith , as a virtue in us , which procures for us the complacent regard of Jehovah ; but the merits of Christ , in which we become interested by faith . *'Being , " says the apostle , " justified /reely '  --  without any merit on our part , " by his grace , through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus . ' ' And the reason of this is obvious . Our faith can have no merit in it , because it is the gift of God . " By grace are ye saved , through faith ; and that not of yourselves , it is the giji of God . " The subject of the decrees of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable for me to spec- // ulate . Secret things belong unto the Lord our God ; the things which are revealed belong unto us/ I have reason to blush that my n ) ind is so enveloped in the shades of ignorance and unbelief , in regard to this and every other doctrine of the Bible . That 6od did , out of his mere good pleasure , from all eternity , elect some to everlasting life , ' * 1 firmly believe , because it appears to me to be plainly taught in the Scriptures . But that this election destroys or at all interferes with , the free-agency - of man , 1 do not believe It is my opinion that salvation by Jesus Christ should be preached indiscriminately to all , that all have the sincere offers of mercy , and therefore , that those who come short of salvation , must take all the blame of their destruction to themselves , while those who are saved , must ascribe it wholly to the riches of sovereign grace . And is there any inconsistency in this ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we to conclude that all efforts on our part to repent and believe are unnecessary ; and that we are excusable in neglecting the means of grace ? The Scriptures assure us , and we believe , that there is ' an appointed time for man upon the earth , " that " his days are determined , and the number of his months are with God , " and that ' he hath appointed his bounds that he can not pass . " But this does not prevent us , when we are sick , from using proper medicines for the recovery of health , We do not say , I will do nothing ; if I am to die I shall die , at any rate ; if not , I shall live , though I use no means for the preservation of life . ' This , all admit , would be an absurd way of reasoning . But is it not equally absurd , to reason in the same manner with regard to our eternal concerns ? I believe we are naturally in a state of enmity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins . " Yet I do not believe that we are in such a sense unable to repent , believe in Christ , and love /z/ God , that we are id the least degree , excusable for disobeying the divine commands which require us to do these things . The best Calvinistic writers , such as President Edwards , Andrew Fuller , &c.; make a distinction between , what they call , natural and moral inability to obey the commands of God . *If it were not the duty of unconverted sinners to believe in Christ , and that because of their inability ; this inability must be natural , or something which does not arise from an evil disposition : but all the inability ascribed to man , with respect to believing , arises from the aversion of his heart . ' Consequently , it is the duty of the sinner to believe in Christ ; and it is altogether owing to his disinclination that he does not , as is evident from many passages of Scripture , such as Ye will not come to roe that ye might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thy ways , ' ' ' Men love darkness rather than light . ' ' " Surely , " says Mr. Fuller , ' the plainest and weakest Christian , in reading his Bible , if he pay any recard to what he reads , must perceive a manifest difference between the blindness of Bartimeus , who was ardently desirous that he might receive his sight , and that of the unbelieving Jews , who closed their eyes , lest they should see , and be converted , and healed ; and between the want of the natural sense of hearing , and the state of those who have ears , but hear not . " The doctrine of the perseverance of the saints I also believe , because I think it is plainly taught in the Bible . That many profess religion who never felt it , that many deceive themselves and others by a false show , and that many go considerable lengths in the external practice of the precepts , and acquire a considerable speculative knowledge and belief of the doctrine of the gospel , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess and believe , I have no doubt . And if the perseverance IfKUOlnS OF of true belieTera depended upon themselves , none would persevere . But it does not depend upon themselves . " In the Lord have they righteousness and strength . " They build upon that " sure foundation stone which can never be moved . " They trust in Him who says to his people , " I will never leave nor forsake you . " And , saith the apostle , " God is true . All the promises of God in Christ Jesus are yea and amen . " In another place he says , " I am persuaded that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come , nor height , nor depth , nor any other crealure , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord . " And what were his reasons for this persuasion ? Did it proceed from confidence in himself ? No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " through Him that loved us . " To " the saints in Christ Jesus which were at Philippi , " he says , I am " confident of this very thing , that He which hath begun a good work in you , will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ . " And the Saviour says that his " sheep "  --  those that " hear his voice , " " shall never perish , " and that h  - -  will " give unto them eternal life . " To believe that any who have been truly regenerated , will totally fall away and perish , would , therefore , in ray view , be to impeach the faithfulness of God . Some have thought that the belief of this doctrine is calculated to make us remiss in the performance of duty , that it tends to make us relax our exertions , to live near to God , and to glorify him by a life of devoledness to his service . The speculative belief of it may , indeed , produce this effect upon the formalist and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will have no such influence upon the real Christian . And the reason is this ; the former performs all his duties , solely because he feeli that he must perform them to get to heaven , while the latter /q/ endeavours to be faithful , chiefly because he loves the service of God for its own sake . The former is entirely actuated by selfish principles ; the latter , though he values the welfare of his soul , is principally actuated by a regard to the glory of God . The eonsequence is , that the former , when he thinks he is safe , omits or slightly performs duties , which he never loved , because he has no further use for them , as his own end is , he thinks , accomplished ; whereas the latter performs them still , though he has attained the assurance of hope , not as a duty only , but as a pleasure . His confidence of being personally interested in that covenant which is ordered in all things and sure , makes him , if possible , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of grace , to glorify , by a well ordered life and conversation , that God , the breadth and length and depth and height of whose love for.his soul , he finds , pass his knowledge . The saints in heaven know assuredly that they shall never fall from grace ; but this does not damp the ardor of their love and zeal . This very knowledge increases the rapture , with which they give glory to Him who redeemed them unto God by his blood , out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation . Were I not writing to a friend , and had you not requested my opinion upon the several subjects mentioned in your letter , 1 should consider some apology necessary for the character and length of this reply . la the present case however , it is unneces sary . TO A raiEND AT N. H. KiUingwortk , December 20 , 1808 . I have been reading Fosters Essays . I admire them greatly . You recollect , I presume , what he /z/ says respecting romantic friendship . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of great discernment , and has an extensive knowledge of human nature . I was surprised to observe with what facility he makes the minutest events in nature subservient to the design of his work ; and how , even those circumstances or occurrences of life which we should judge of no importance , are , by him , recorded with an accuracy of recollection which we admire , and an energy of expression which makes them more fully illustrate his ideas than , perhaps , any thing else could have done . The essay on decision of character is an admirably well executed piece ; and , were the world more virtuous , we should rejoice in its principles being instilled into every breast . Ardor and invincibility in a good cause , would be the source of numberless blessings to the world . But when we consider the depraved state of the minds and morals of men , I think we have reason to bless the benevolent Parent of the universe , that he has not endowed a greater number of individuals with this fixedness of determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not controlled by virtuous principle , must result innumerable and unheard of dangers and distresses . Were it probable that , with all this inflexibility of temper , the influential motives which prompted the execution of any design would be good ; and that the heart which was the subject of this flrmness and decision , would be capable of that refinement , humanity , and deference to the opinions of others , which characterize beings of a more flexible stamp ; we might wish every person in possession of it ; as virtue and the good of all mankind , would be the ultimate object to which all its energies would be directed . These , however , Foster himself acknowledges , are rarely united ; and he regrets that almost all the examples of decision which he mentions , are among the cruel and tyrannical part of mankind . The reason , /q/ you recollect , which he assigns for it is , that a man of a decided character will , ahnost unavoidably , become indifferent to the opinions and advice of others ; or , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost exclusive right of judging , and therefore , condemn all opinions which do not exactly coincide with his . Such a man would , I should think , become a cynic or misanthrope , a torture to himself , and a source of misery to bis friends ; more especially , if he had not some great object in view , to employ his time and attention ; or , most of all , if his schemes should , in the end , disappoint his expectations . /z/ KiUingvDoHh , Jarmary 20 , 1809 . The subject of your letter , my dear friend , is one of infinite importance , and certainly claims our first and most earnest attention . Could we realize the tremendous consequences connected with it , we should , I think , cease to view it with so much supineness and indtfferoDce , and give it that careful consideration which it deserves . When we reflect that , upon our possessing real religion , depends our happiness , both for time and eternity , that the least mistake may be productive of evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception , and that this religion must be diligently sought for , before it can be obtained ; we must surely , unless our hearts are totally blinded by sin , and harder than the nether mill-stone , be excited to exclaim , with sincerity and earnestness , What must I do to be saved ? It is a small thing to profess Christianity , to acquire a theoretical knowledge of its doctrines , to speak of its nature and excellence , and , in a pharisaical manner , to mould our external behaviour to its precepts ; to /z/ do all this is but a small thing ; but when done , if utiaccompanied with that grace of God which is like a refiner 's fire or the fuller 's soap , it is but washing the outside of the cup and platter , while inwardly we are full of corruption . The work of sanctification is a great work , which nothing but the mighty power of God can accomplish ; for who but He can bring a clean thing out of an unclean , and release the creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Satan , when he is himself opposed to his deliverance , and bring him into the glorious liberty of the sons of God ? But great as is the work , and diverse as it is from any thing which men or devils can effect , it is nevertheless one which Satan and the oorruptions of our own hearts , use all their efforts to counterfeit . The adversary , we are told , can " transform himself into an angel of light , " and ' Hhe heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked . " On these two affecting and alarming truths , is reared that strong delusion by which so many are led blindfold to eternal despair . How necessary then is it that we should , frequently and carefully , examine ourselves whether we be in the faith ? My dear M. , when looking into this heart of mine , and finding so many sinful prupeiisities existing and operating within it , I am sometimes led to fear , almost to conclude , that I have never yet been renewed in the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon our embracing , from the heart , that religion , and being the subjects of that repentance and faith , without which we shall not be saved ! I can not , even to you , fully express my feelings on this interesting and all important subject ; it is too vast and solemn in its nature and consequences . I can only say , search me , God , and know my heart ; try me , and know my thoughts ; and see if there be any wicked way in me ; and lead me in the way everlasting . I do think however ; notwithstanding the many reasons 1 have /q/ to entertain doubts respecting my conversion , that Christianity is to roe all in all . Were the religion of Jesus torn from me , I should be like the mariner without a compass or a bark , in the midst of a lem* petuous ocean . I should not know whither to direct my despairing eyes , for hope in this life , or happiness in the life to come . Sometimes I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feel as if I could exclaim , with the Psalmist 0 , how I love thy law . But these precious seasons do not last long , and I again doubt , whether the joys I then felt , were not the fruit of those false affections which the legalist and the hypocrite may experience . My dear friend , let us pray for each other , that we may have faith to lay hold on the promises of Jehovah , that we may be enabled to hold on our way in the path of life , and finally be made pillars in the temple of our God to go no more out forever . /z/ KillingvDorthj February 19 , 1809 . What , my dear N. , would be our sensations did we suppose , like many learned infidels , tiiat this narrow sphere of being was the whole of our existence ? Dreadful indeed would be the thought ; that man was destined only to tread for a few short days this speck of creation , and then sink to nought ! What could ever have induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our nature as these ; notions which make us but a little higher than the beasts that perish , and which preclude all desires and exertions for nobler joys than those of time and sense ? Futurity is the Christian 's hope . In the gospel , life and immortality are brought /z/ // mated . Then shall we know even as we are known whatever appeared mysterious and incomprehensible to our finite capacities , shall be elucidated ; God will be seen to have done all things well , and to be just in justifying them that believe . /z/ KiUingtoorthj March 31 , 1809 . T received your kind letter , my beloved M. , with the most cordial pleasure . It is sometime since I heard from my good friends at N. H. ; and I hope I feel sensations of gratitude to Him who is the giver of every good and perfect gift , that he has preserved you from sickness and death until the present time , and that he has not withdrawn the precious influences of his Spirit , but is still causing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May the glorious work be continued until your right eousness shall go forth as brightness , and your salvation as a lamp that burneth . It is certainly true , my dear friend , that frequently , when there is an uncommon attention to religion , there is also an uncommon zeal in defending or opposing things unessential . That the Christian world is so divided in its opinions , is a circumstance which must excite sorrow in the bosom of every member of the family of God . But so long as human nature is subject to err , and as long as there are different doctrines taught by those who undertake to expound the Scriptures of truth , this must unavoidably be the case . We are not to condemn any , who differ from us in some points of faith , but hold to the fundamental doctrines of Christianity . ' A proceeding so uncharitable , has no sanction in the benevolent and perfect rules of the gospel . That the best men are liable to embrace , and have embraced , errors , is /q/ amply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , together with the numerous exhortations in Soripture to the exercise of charity , should lead us to view with candour and impartiality the opinions of others , to examine them faithfully before we condemn them , and , if we must condemn them because we find them to be fundamental errors , to do it in the meekness of the Christian temper . Yet , as I have already intimated , while we endeavour to avoid unjust and uncharitable censure of others for'their religious opinions , we must be careful not to sacrifice at the shrine of modern ' Miberality ' the faith once delivered to the saints ; we must not sanction , even by our silence , principles subversive of the great truths inculcated by Christ and his prophets and apostles . There is a manifest difference between those divisions among nominal Christians which relate merely to the externals of religion , or to doctrines which do not nearly affect the foundations of the Christian faith , and those which are repugnant or contrary to the essential doctrines of the gospel , and which , openly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To those who differ from us in relation to the former , we may and ought to extend our fellowship . But errorists of the latter description , should be strenuously opposed , if we would obey the divine injunction to contend earnestly for the faith . We are not indeed to oppose them with severity and acrimony , but with that firmness which arises from a consciousness of being on the Lord 's side , a firmness which , while it precludes our being turned about by every wind of doctrine , is accompanied with meekness and discretion . In the primitive church , some were for Paul , others for A polios , and others for Cephas . And yet they may all have been real disciples of Christ ; for Paul , Apollos , and Cephas all preached ( though with some unimportant variations , which /z/ were made the occasion of those divisions , ) the same . method of salvation ; they all preached Christ cruci- , fied , the wisdom of God and the power of God , unto salvation to them which believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Christians . . lAt the present day also , it is of little consequence . whether men are Presbyterians , Episcopalians , Methodists , or Baptists ; for , although some one of these denominations is doubtless nearer being right than the others , a person may embrace the peculiarities of either , and yet be a Christian . But it is of the highest importance whether we be Orthodox , Unitarians , Pelagians , or Antinomians , for the distinctive principles of these sects immediately affect the foundations of Christianity , and must , other things being equal , have a material influence upon the morals of mankind : on the points which separate these classes of , what is loosely called , the Christian world , we can not be too solicitous not to err ; for an error here may be fatal . Such , if I understand you , is the dis tinction which you make . I can therefore yield an entire assent to your remark that did Christians study more to avoid foolish and unprofitable questions , and give more of their attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the virulence of party spirit and more of the fruits of piety . " How unhappy it is , my dear friend , that the little family of Christ should be so torn with internal animosities and feuds ; and that , at a time when the state of the world seems to render it peculiarly necessary , that all its members should be bound together in the unity of the Spirit and in the bonds of peace . At no period in the history of the Church , can we discover so many and such powerful efforts of the prince of this world and his adherents , to destroy its purity , and its very existence , as at the present time . What were the clamours of the ancient Jews , what were the distressing persecutions of the idolatrous Gen- URS . SUSAN HITirriirOTON . SJ iiles , and what were the contemptuous opprobriums of the infidel philosophers of former days , capable of effecting toward the overthrow of Christianityi compared with that spirit of Antichrist which has now gone forth into the world ,  --  a spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its energies to the destruction of , the religion of Christ ? The former gave the blow openly , the latter gives the deadly stab in secret . The former depressed , but did not corrupt , the truths the latter infuses its poison into the very principles of our faith , and leaves us nothing of Christianity but the form and the name . Surely these are ' Hhe last times ' ' spoken of in the sure word of prophecy , when many shall be given up to strong delusions , and left to believe a lie , and when faith shall hardly be found on the earth . But , thanks be to God , he is shewing us , by the effusions of his Spirit on various places , that he still TQxnQtnhore ohuroh , and vv'ill not suffer the gates of hell to prevail against it . And blessed be his name for the assurance , that none shall be able to pluck his real children out of the Saviour 's hands , or prevent his giving unto them eternal life ! Oh ! my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , who is the believer 's hope , finally present us faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy ! On the eighteenth of May , 1809 , Miss Mansfield was married to the Rev. Joshua Huntington , son of Gen. Jedidiah Huntington of New London , Conn. , and junior pastor of the Old South Church Iin Boston , Mass. , which became , immediately after , the place of her residence . , The letters , of which the following are extracts , were written after her removal to Boston . ICiiMOIRS OF /z/ Boston , May 30 , 1809 . Our ride was very pleasant . I am delighted wHh the country around boston , and think the town is handsomely situated , and I doubt not I shall be pleased with the inhabitants . But , my dear friend , flattering as is the prospect before us , I can not contemplate the responsibih'ty of the station in which I am placed , its total dissimilarity to that to which I have been accustomed , and the arduous duties resulting from it , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without feeling a degree of anxiety lest I shall be found wholly unqualified for the situation . Did I not believe that the bounds of our habitations are not accidental , i but determined by the providence of God , I should ' sink under the weight of responsibility which now rests upon me . But I do believe that the Lord has placed me here ; he it Is who calls me lo The arduous duties in which I am now to engage , and I desire  --  I think I feel in some degree enabled , to trust in him for wisdom and strength to guide and sustain me . I have as yet seen but few of Mr. H. 's congregation . But , if 1 may form a judgment from those who have called , I think I shall find among them many who cherish an ardent attachment to the doctrines , and maintain a consistent practice of the duties , of the Gospel , unmoved by the prevalence of error ,  --  many real disciples of the blessed Jesus . I do not doubt therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly the society which renders a place agreeable or ' un-pleasant , /z/ Boston , July 20 , 1809 . You are already acquainted with Boston and some of its inhabitants , together with my feelings respecting /q/ them , and have been informed that I am pleased and contented in my situation . The town is pleasant , the people hospitable and friendly , and , could I feel as much complacency in myself as I do in some of them , I should be very happy . But you know , my dear E. , that to be sensible of our deficiencies , is one step taken toward their removal . I do feel that mine are many and great . May I not rest satisfied with merely acknowledging , but strive , and be enabled , to amend them . There are a few here , ( as is generally the case where impiety or error prevails , if there are any righteous found there , ) who appear to be decided in their attachment to real religion and strenuous in its support , uninfluenced by the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . Dr. 6. has frequently preached in town of late . I have strong hopes that much good will result from bis exertions and those of other Clergymen who are labouring to promote the cause of truth . It is melancholy to see people disputing about that Gospel which was designed to produce nothing but peace on earth . But I believe that the overruling providence of God frequently causes the most salutary effects to arise from religious controversy . Truth never sufiers by investigation ; and it is evidently better to hear people inquiring what is truth , than quietly embracing error , without endeavouring to ascertain whether they are right or not . In July of this year Mrs. Huntington made a visit to her parents . While with them , she wrote several letters to her friends in different parts of the country , from some of which the following extracts have be taken . $6 MEMOIRS or /z/ Killingworth , August I , 1809 . It is a week to day , my dear E. , since I bade adieu to your pleasant town ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write you , as I suppose you will be anxious to know whether I reached home in safety . That I left your family with regret , you will not doubt ; but that the parting would have been so painful as it was , I could not have imagined . It was justifiable in me to suffer myself to become attached to you ; situated as I was , it would have been unpardonable if 1 had not . But I believe that if we would not suffer our affections to become so ardent , as we sometimes do , for those whose society we can not long enjoy , the separations we must experience in this life would be far less distressing . Some however would say , and perhaps not without reason , this would be the philosophy of a stoic . Our ride was as pleasant as could be expected , and our sail as agreeable as high and adverse winds w.ould permit . I found our family well , and happy to see me , and my dear little native village appeared very lovely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giddy metropolis . Did I not believe , with Milton , that the mind is its own place , and in itself can make every circumstance and situation , merely temporal , productive of happiness or misery , and did I not also believe the more consolatory doctrine , that all things and events are under the direction of One who can not err , I should sometimes be almost disposed to sigh for the solitude to which my mind and feelings are so well adapted . But I trust that the situation in which providence has placed me , if it exposes me more to temptation than my former one will also lead me to more watchfulness /q/ and caution ; and that I shall be enabled to fill properly that station which is " sl call to duty , not a discharge from care . " /z/ KUlingtoortk , September 9 ; 1801 . You will be pleased to hear that the attention to religion in this place rather increases than subsides . New instances of conviction occur almost daily . I trust that this shower of divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease until it has plentifully wa* tered this dry and thirsty ground . Heavem grant it may not . It is a cause for lamentation , that the Christian world is so divided in opinion , and that the religion of Jesus , which is calculated to produce only peace among its disciples , should so often be made , by them , an occasion for animosity and dissen- . tion . But so it is , and will be , so long as men are subject to deception , and possess the frailties of fallen humanity . We see , that the world is torn with civil as well as religious dissensions , and that people disagree about every thing else , as well as about religion ; and therefore , we know that it is not Chris* tianity which produces the tumults of controversy . The essential doctrines of the gospel should be earnestly , though prudently maintained , for these are the foundation of the Christian system ; as , for instance , the deity and the atonement of Christ , and the entire depravity of human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel system is levelled with the dust . When pleading for charity , and liberty of conscience , we must be careful not to suffer ourselves to consider doctrines as unimportant ; for if , as is often said , it is no matter what a man believes if he is only sincere , we might as well , so far as our prospects for eternity are con-/z/ cerned , be groping in the darkness of Paganism as sitting under the sunshine of the gospel . This is a charity of which Christ and his apostles certainly knew nothing ; and it is as prejudicial to the cause of religion , as it is absurd in the view , of reason . But Sihoutjbrms , it appears to me , we are by far too fastidious . Faith and repentance are required of us in order to salvation , and these may be experienced in every denomination where the fundamentals of Christianity are received . The reason , my dear E , of my making these remarks is , that I was thinking how unhappy it is that there is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of party spirit is exceedingly apt to eat out the vitals of pure religion ; and it pains me to behold many , apparently , more desirous to gain disciples to their own distinctive , but unessential , opinions , than to direct perishing souls to Christ . There is no doubt that some of the various modes of worship , are more agreeable to the example of the primitive Christians and the spirit of the New Testament than others , and it is unquestionably desirable to ascertain and practice those modes . Yet if , by the influence of circumstances , we are led to prefer worshipping God in some of those other ways , I can not think it is an error for which we shall be condemned . I could wish all Christians were united in worshipping Jehovah in the same manner , but I esteem it the principal thing to worship him in spirit and in truth . /z/ Killingtcorth , October llth , 1805 . I received your father 's letter last week . The Intelligence it contained of the death of your beloved sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , my dear E. , invariably support the mind , if we have faith , to apply them to ourselves ; and these only can support it , when called to endure trials like yours . Your affliction is indeed great , and your loss no common one . In this light you are allowed to view it . Resignation does not imply in  - -  sensibility . But still a sense of the greatness of our loss , should never be suffered to produce feelings of dissatisfaction with the dispensations of providence . God has a right to visit us with greater , as well as with less , judgments ; and it is our duty to be proportionably humbled and improved . If they promote these ends , they are only mercies in a more unpleasant form ; for , as has been well remarked , whatever draws us nearer to God can not be real adversity , and whatever entices us from him deserves not the name of prosperity . ' * Could we view objects in their proper light , many of those things which now overwhelni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for us that our lot is not at our own disposal . Were it so , I am certain we should be wretched ; for the deficiency of our judgments , in connexion with our love of present ease , would lead us to reject those afflictions which , like some unpleasant but salutary medicine , are bitter to the taste , but necessary to existence and health , and to grasp too eagerly those enjoyments , which , if unaccompanied with sanctifying grace , only corrupt and vitiate the mind and render the possession of them wearisome and the deprivation of them insupportable , and which destroy both the means and tiie power of attaining true happiness , by drawing us away from Him , without whom we can no more acquire it , than animal life can be supported without breath . Let us always rejoice that God reigns , and that we are entirely at his disposal . How consolatory the thought ; for the Judge of all the earth will do right . Let us my /z/ dear sister , by this " awful warning heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to its proper value . Whatever can not be depended upon , should never be trusted . Let us , therefore cease to hope for happiness from the evanescent pleasures of life , and fix our eyes and our hearts upon those things which shall survive when heaven and earth have passed away . /z/ Killingworth , October 16 , 1809 . You have , I understand , been disappointed about obtaining Dr. K. This , according to man 's judgment , appears to be an inauspicious circumstance to your church . But very likely , nay most assuredly , it is designed to accomplish important purposes , and will be seen to have been productive of good in the end . Perhaps you trusted too much in an arm of flesh , and this is to teach you that all the power is of God , and to lead you to exercise stronger faith in him alone , without whose gracious assistance and blessing , every human effort to advance the Redeemer 's kingdom will be ineffectual . It is very desirable that you should obtain a faithful minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who will not fear to declare the whole counsel of God . And such an one , I trust , you will obtain . The people of B. have many prayers , and the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous avail eth much . We believe that you will yet have a time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord . There are many real Christians in that favoured metropolis . But some of them , though they are not dead , are sleeping . How necessary is watchfulness in order to preserve spiritual communion with the sacred Three ; without which /q/ the Christian can not be happy , for lukewarmness in religion is as inimical to our enjoyment as it is oflensive to God . /z/ Boston , Jamiary 1 , 1810 . Through the kindness of providence , I reached this place in safety ; and now you doubtless wish to know where and how I am situated . We have been keeping house seven or eight weeks , and as I have for company one to whom the management of a family is familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , is confined to no particular state or place ; and I can say with the Psalmist , ( I wish it were with the same pious gratitude ) . Goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life . I also find , as 1 have always found , that no situation is exempt from trouble ; and , while surrounded by blessings which demand my thankful acknowledgments , I see and feel , in myself , and in those about me , numberless evils which excite pain , and should produce humiliation . To the soul which can , with unshaken faith , repose , not only its own cares , but those of others in whom it is interested , on the arm of Him who is mighty to save , and which can view every event , whatever be its nature or effects , as necessary to answer some wise design of providence , nothing can be so distressing as entirely to break its peace . The truth of this remark is , I think , evinced by the conduct of some Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad declension of vital piety here , are filled with joy and confidence in God , and feel that , should the times grow darker and darker , they could still trust in Him who is able to dispel the clouds /z/ of ignorance and sin which hang over us , and cause the righteousness of Zion to go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that buraeth . Nor does the persuasion that when God sees it most for his glory to pour out his Spirit upon us he will do it , lead them to indulge in supineness and indifference in requesting it and using the means to obtain it ; for they remember that the promise is made to those who ask and knock and seek and strive , and that God has said he will be inquired of by the house of Israel to do these things for them I believe , however , that this high degree of grace is acquired , and retained without interruption , by very few ; though it is the duty , and , but for our wickedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire and preserve it . As to my own feelings in reference to the spiritual condition of the thousands around me ? I acknowledge with shame , that they are very different from what they should be . At times , I feel a desire for their salvation , and a conviction that God is not far off . Sometimes I feel almost confident that he will soon cause the glorious rays of the Sun of righteousness to shine upon us , with a power seldom before seen , because the darkness is greater than has commonly been known . At other times I am almost led to ask if the Lord has forgotten to be gracious , and cast off his people forever ; or I grow unmiodful of the alarming situation of the impenitent , and feel little solicitude for the revival of the work of God . And in reference to my own situation , I sometimes feel as if the lines had fallea to me in pleasant places , and think my spiritual privileges greater than ever ; and at other times I almost exclaim , Woe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell in the tents of Kedar ! I know I am inexcusable for this inconstancy of religious feeling ; /q/ bat yon would be less surprised at it if yon saw and heard the different persons I see , the different sermons 1 hear , and the different conversations I have At one time I hear a sermon exalting to the pinnacle of praise , human virtue , and the excellence of our nature , and calling upon those to whom it is addressed , to improve those good tendencies which they naturally possess , and which , if cultivated , will lead to holiness and to heaven . At another time I hear a sermon , written with all the energy which the arguments , persuasions and truths of Christianity can give to a discourse ,  --  an energy in the cause of truth which appears almost irresistible . Sometimes I talk with a Christian whose every word breathes faith , humility and love , and pours into my soul comfort and instruction . Soon after with another professed Christian who will maintain that truths , for which martyrs suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unimportant . These things perhaps , as 1 have already remarked , would not affect , so as to destroy his peace and his confidence in God , one who possessed that strong faith which views every thing , moral as well as natural evil , as under the divine direction and controul . But , alas ! , though I know that God reigns , and that not a sparrow falleth to the ground without our Father , I sometimes sink into despondency and unbelief . When are S. and E. to be married ? Dear girls ! I hope they wilMe happy in this state , which must be very happy Ifr very miserable . I am no advocate for cold ' esteem only , between those who are to live together , and in so close a connexion #@# through life . But I believe extravagant , misjudged attachment misleads more than that of an opposite character . If the understanding and judgment condemn what the passions only approve , and if this is the substance of the love which is to unite husband and wife there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dry stubble , which , though it may burn to the skies for the present moment , soon dies away , to be enkindled no more . TO A FRtEKD AT N. Y. Boston , January 14 , 1810 . I am happy that you estimate your religious privileges so highly . I believe your remark , that they are equal , if not superior , to those of any other place , is correct ; it is unquestionably correct if the comparison extends to other parts of America only . And perhaps there is not another place in the world that has , in proportion to the number of its clergy , so many pious , evangelical and great men among its ministers as N. Y. The inhabitants ought to feel that their mercies are peculiar , and strive , by earnest endeavours to improve them , to secure their continuance . But , though religious privileges are greater in some places than in others , thanks be to God ! they are unspeakably great wherever the gospel emits its unerring light . With this infallible guide in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is fear of nothing but remissness in searching out its divine truths , and of embracing errors ; not because we have not the means of knowledge , but for the want of a . disposition to iin prove them . My dear friend , when we thiiik of the various spiritual privileges with which we have been blessed from infancy , with what contrition ought our hearts to be filled that we gained so little with the talents entrusted to us ! I speak of us both , because I am sure my dear N. will not say , *I am not culpable here ' ; and though I hope she is far less so than I am , 1 know we must all consider ourselves as mere cumberers of the ground compared with what we /q/ should be . I hope , my beloved friend , we are not entirely blind to the concerns of eternity . I hope God has taught us by his grace that happiness is in him alone ; and not only taught us this , but enabled us , through faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This hope is a presumptuous one , like the hope of the hypocrite which shall perish , unless we have those evidences of its genuineness which are mentioned in the Scriptures ; such as , habitual aommunion with God , daily seeking , in faith , from Christy forgiveness for the past and strength for the future , voluntary denying of ourselves , abstraction from the world , &c.; And when I behold in how small a degree these evidences are in myself , I some* times fear that I am yet without God and without hope in the world . Remembering , therefore , that many come almost to the kingdom of heaven who never enter it , and that there is great danger of our being deceived , let us examine ourselves whether we are indeed in the faith , and strive to make our calling and election sure , lest , when weighed in the balance we be found wanting . You ask my opinion of Thornton Abbey . I regret that I am unable to give it . Through some misunderstanding between Mr. Huntington and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other had subscribed for it . It is doubtless a fine work . We may reasonably presume so from its having the recommendation of Andrew Fuller . You have probably seen Coelebs , the late fashionable work of Miss Hannah More . It has been highly celebrated , and I think justly . Perhaps books of this sort , in which religious sentiments are inculcated under the form of a story , are calculated to do more good to a certain class of society than any other , I mean to those who read merely for amusement . They would fly from any thing exclusively didactic ; but being allured by the fictitious part of a work /z/ like this , might read it , and , perhaps meet with thai conviction which , notwithstanding its promises te amuse it is calculated to produce . /z/ Boston , March 14i , 1810 . When the faith of Christians meets with much opposition , when they feci that there is no middle ground , that they must , with firmness , declare foi Christ or the world , and resolve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live more near to God . and to experience more of the power of divine grace , than when religion is respectable in the estimation of the world . And the reason is obvious ; they feel more the necessity of maintaining continual inter* course with Him from whom they know they musi derive strength against temptation , and grace to help in time of need . Happy , thrice happy , those or whom opposition produces this blessed effect ! Some such Christians there are here , who have long stood firm in their attachment to the truth , and in devotedness to the service of Christ I have been reading Milner 's Church History this winter , and am highly pleased with it . Critics would say Mosheim 's is the most learned ; but Mil ner 's is far the most evangelical , and will be fai more useful , at least to private Christians . Whec one reads Church history he expects to find a histor of the Churchy and not a tiresome detail of ecclesiastical heresies , wars and divisions , intermixed witt much entirely secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been frequent in the church , and ecclesiastical and profane history are intimately connected : yet the reader 's attention should ; as often as possible be directed to the real /q/ church , that he may see that there has always been such a church , which he will be very likely to forget , in reading Mosheim and some other church historians . /z/ Boston , March 16 , 1810 . Your situation , my dear friend , is certainly , on some accounts , a distressing one . The fear you express , lest you shall be left to depart from Him , under whose banner you have enlisted , by reason of temptation , is a fear which Christians , I believe , often feel . When we reflect on the disinclination of our hearts to the pursuit of our highest good , and the opposition to holiness , which remains in them , after its governing power has been destroyed by grace , it should humble us . And when we feel its influence , it may lead us to doubt whether we are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , let us not be discouraged , for we can do all things through Christ strengthening us . How prone we are , my dear Miss S. , to exclaim with the Patriarch , All these things are against me ! , when under affliction ; and yet , every Christian will , at , last , find , with him , that God meant it for good . If , as /z/ is undoubtedly the fact , we are inclined to look to , and be satisfied with , the things which are seen and tenv* poral , and if this disposition is not only our sin , but our misery , then what reason have we to bless God that he has so disposed things that no situation in life is so exempt from trouble , as to make us perjj fectly contented in it without higher enjoyments ? iJ The Christian certainly has reason to lory in trir/ bulation , for he has the promise of God that all things shall work together for his good . And , consequently , the afflictions he is called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unavailing distress , should operate as renewed excitements to duty and exertion . You will be pleased to hear that Mr. Huntington has , of late , been considerably encouraged by the moral appearance of his society . Nothing has occurred deserving the name of a revival ; but a spirit of inquiry in some , and of violent opposition in others , begins to prevail . Opposition to the truth is always to be regretted ; but when people are roused to ask what is truth , and are enlightened to see that there is really a great difference between it and error , though some reject , and exhibit their hatred of , the doctrines of Scripture , we may hope there will be a more general reception of the truth . The greatest danger lies in men 's believing all religions pretty much alike , and those who respectively adopt them , equally acceptable to God , if they are only sincere . /z/ Boston , November 4 , 1810 . I do not approve of people 's constantly complain* ing to others of their hearts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and God only . But to my dear M. , I may speak with freedom . And it is a great comfort that we can sometimes find a friend , to whom we may communicate the enjoyments or discouragements of our spiritual life , whose affection for us forbids our fearing to be betrayed , and whose experience prevents the apprehensions of being misunderstood . Such a friend is my dear M ; and as such , notwithstanding my many doubts concerning myself , I am sure I love her . Should we ever be so happy as finally to arrive at the spiritual Canaan , and be enabled through Christy to claim it as our /z/ /q/ - wn we shall Jock back with astonishment upon the way by which we have been led . Aad surely a sense of the innumerable dangers which attended our journey , and the capacity we shall then have of discerning the wonderful manner in which God made them all subservient to our progress in holiness , will greatly swell the song , and enhance the enjoyments , of victory . Perhaps some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though painful to be borne , they may , by the overruling mercy of God , be made to accelerate his speed in running the race set before him , and , by showing him the necessity of doing so , cause him to live nearer to God . That my doubts and discouragements may be of this kind , or rather , may be thus overruled , ( for I know they are to be deprecated , and are highly criminal , ) is my earnest prayer . /z/ Boston , December 20 ; 1810 . I am pleased that your journey to the south has been deferred . But my pleasure in ' this , as I often fear it is , in most other things , from which I derive that sensation , is selfish . I anticipate the satisfaction of hearing from you more frequently than if you were at Charleston , and , possibly , of seeing you in the spring . You , my kind friend , have been more acquainted with my mental concerns , than any one else ; and , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe there are many of Bunyan 's " Ignorances , " whose self-deception has its foundation in incorrect apprehensions of Jehovah . They do not realize his infinite abhorrence of all sin ; and thus , imagining " a God all mercy , ' * they never discover the native opposition of their hearts to his holiness and conse- /z/ quently never exercise that evangelical repentance  - -  founded upon just views of the malignant nature , and destructive tendency of sin , without which , Christ has said , we shall perish . They do not see such a transcendant excellence and beauty in holiness , as to feel that every thing else is , connparalively , of no importance , and that the destitution of it ; in a moral agent , deserves an endless punishment . I wish you , my dear M. , to pray that I may have clearer conceptions , soul-transforming conceptions , of the adorable perfections of God . Oh ! with what amazing transports of wonder , love , and astonishment , does the view of them fill the angels in heaven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this world ! Pray that I may see the beauty of holiness , and the deformity of sin , without that intercepting veil , which Satan and a depraved nature are so apt to cast over our minds , when we attempt to view them in their true characters . Oh ! for a closer walk with God ! A calm and heavenly frauiel A light to Rhine upon the road Which leads me to the Lamb . Do you not think , my dear M. , that we are sometimes blame-worthy in looking with too charitable an eye upon the experiences of others ? Is there not reason to fear that , at the judgment day , some may rise up and accuse us of having been the means of lulling them to sleep , when the fire of destruction was , even then , in their bosoms ? Great caution is necessary , when we attempt to administer consolation . I would rather a friend should be too severely exact with me , than too compassionate . I hope 1 shall be more cautious myself in future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however different our experiences may have been , can unite with the Psalmist in saying , in the sincerity of our souls , Exam* /z/ ine me , Lord , and prove me ; try my reins , and my heart . Our friend is to be married , in a short lime , to Mr. of , whose eminent piety promises her , should God spare their lives , a long succession of happy years . Oh ! the importance of religion in order to render the married state a blessing ! how important , to render any situation in life happy ! I bless God that I feel more powerfull " than ever my need of it , and think I have more insatiable longings after it . Dear , dear M. , what need is there of careful self-examination , to determine whether we possess it or not ? How much of our apparent love to God may arise solely from the hope that he will save us ? how much from erroneous views of his character ? How much of what we consider our repentance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus taking away our hope , and not from any just apprehension of its malignant nature ? How much of our obedience may spring from other causes than a desire to promote the glory of God ? How much of our faith may be no more than the faith of devils  --  unaccompanied with love ; and which , if we were only assured of our acceptance with God , would be altogether inoperative and dead ? 1 think I have heard you say , you were not acquainted with Andrew Fuller 's works . I admire them very much , A volume of Essays by him has lately been published in this country . They are , like all of his works , which I have seen , excellent . I have been reading : some of President Edwards ' sermons lately . 1 think they are even closer and more searching than his treatise on the affections . /z/ Boston f Jamiary 25 , 1811 . The loss you have sustained in the death of your brother , is truly great . When you reflect on his /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the favour and affection which he was gaining from all who knew him , you are doubtless almost ready to exclaim , Never was sorrow like my sorrow . Our faith is seldom , if ever , more tried than when we are called to give up those friends with whose existence our happiness is materially connected . Nor can we , perhaps , have conclusive evidence of its genuineness , till called to pass through the furnace of affliction . The faith of the formalist or the hypocrite , may appear to be sound , as long as God sheds upon him the unclouded sun of prosperity . But if he cause clouds and darkness to overspread his horison , then he exclaims . The way of the Lord is not equal . It is a proof of true faiths to be able , when all things are against us , to lift a tranquil eye to Him who sits on the throne of the heavens , holding the reins of universal dominion in his hand , and say . Just and true are thy ways , thou King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust you feel , though it may be imperfectly . And if so , you may be assured this affliction will work for your good . Nothing deserves the name of adversity which leads us to a more perfect knowledge of , and dependance upon Him , whose favour is life , and whose loving* kindness is better than life ; and that the death of friends is designed to have this effect upon Christians , is undeniable . Therefore , to the Christian , afflictions are as truly mercies , as those gifts to which we are apt to appropriate the term . But , perhaps you will say , 4 fear I am not a Christian . ' Dear S. , if this is the case , I feel for , and mourn with you . I can do so , for my own mind is often clouded with doubts , respecting my spiritual state . Nothing is so distressing as this . Any thing can be borne , if it is. tempered and sweetened with the presence and blessing of God . " Examine yourselves whether ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ of Scripture . I dare not , therefore , say , hope without examining ; but , my beloved friend , I may say , do not despond . Look not to yourself ; look to Christ , the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world . None of us need despair , while we have such a mighty and merciful Saviour to whoih we may repair ; who is the Author and the Finisher of faith , who never yet cast oflf , who never will cast off , any who come to him . /z/ BosloTif Augtut 15 , 1811 . It gives me great pleasure , my dear friend , to learn that you are so well pleased with your new situation , and that your society are so well pleased with you ; which I learned from a friend of yours . The approbation of those with whom we are connected , is desirable , if it does not interfere witJti , or divert us from duty . Our influence depends upon the opinion others entertain of us ; and influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interests of men . I have no doubt but my dear will improve every advantage she may have from the estimation of her friends , to advance His kingdom and cause , to whose glory our every talent should be devoted . The wife of a clergyman is more narrowly watched than almost any one else . Her deviations from duty are very seldom overlooked ; her opinions are minutely examined and often repeated . She is thought to take her notions of things , to a considerable extent , from her husband ; and , of course , he suffers if she is imprudent . When I reflect on the responsibility of this situation , I tremble ; and should faint , had not One , whose strength I sometimes feel as if I could lay hold upon , said My grace is sufficient for thee /z/ I have nothing particularly pleasing of a religious nature to communicate .

Our lectures and public exercises are better attended than I have ever known them before . The most fixed attention appears on the faces of most of the congregation . God has bestowed the hearing ear ; he is equally able to give the understanding heart . Nothing seems to be wanting but that effectual fervent prayer of the righteous , which availelh much . For myself , I sometimes feel as if my heart was enlarged to pray for the upbuilding of Zion , And when I am lifeless in the duties of personal religion , I feel as if I had some yearnings of soul over Christless sinners . But my heart is deceitful above all things ; and I am almost afraid to think I feel , lest I should delude myself . Oh ! my dear friend , how infinitely vile and abominable must we appear in the eyes of Him who can fully realize what our feelings in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , and knows exactly what they are ! Surely we must be stupid if the thought does not cause us to exclaim , It is of the Lord 's mercies that we are not consumed ! I know nothing in which I am so deficient as in my apprehensions of sin . God grant it may be more and more opened to my view in all its odiousness , and more and more embittered to my soul ! I believe the want of clear views of this , the nature and vileness of sin , is the rock on which thousands split . It is the want of this that makes the Arminian think he can save himself , the Unitarian deny the necessity of an atonement and the divinity of a Saviour , and the Universalist the eternity and perhaps the reality MRS . SUSAN HUNTiNGTOir. of future punishment . It is the want of this , that produces those restless replyings against God which are ever found upon the lips of the unregenerate . And , may I not add , it is the want of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian , when contemplating the tremendous wrath , denounced in Scripture , against the finally impeni* tent ? Oh ! how much should professing Christians pray for each other ! And when we reflect that there was an unhumbled Judas even among the twelve , how should it excite us to seek , with anxious solicitude , to make our calling and election sure . /z/ Boston , August 30 , 1811 . There is nothing so astonishing , my dear M. , nothing that places the thorough , universal and malignant depravity of our nature in so clear a point of view , as our neglecting to improve the dealings of the blessed God with us , which are all calculated to lead us to repentance , and then finding fault with him for not giving us ability to love him ( when all our inability lies in a criminal aversion , the most unreasonable and unjust , to his perfect character ) and making thai inability an excuse for not loving him . Oh , could we view this subject as angels view it , and as we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder and astonishment ,  --  wonder at the forbearance and mercy of God , astonishment at the moral degradation and turpitude of man . When I look into my own heart , and behold those endless replyings against God which lurk there ; when I think what must be the fountain from which they spring ; it would seem as if I should be filled with repentance , as if I should mourn , with deep and penitential sorrow , over my unspeakable , my amaz- /z/ ing guilt . But still I am freezing with impenitence ! The law is holy , and the commandment holy , just , and good ; man is bound to comply with itj God must not relax his requirements ; if he should , his law would not be strict enough to check the progress and influence of sin ; and sin , unrestrained , would soon disorganize his whole moral system , and banish happiness from the universe . This I know and believe ; and yet I rebel ! Yes , the worm lifts her unrighteous head , and asks , *what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what troubles me . I am afraid I have never been brought truly to submit all things to the disposal of God , especially to submit to his righteousness in the condemnation of sinners . I fear I have never yet seen aright the dreadful evil of sin , and that this is the source of the misgivings I sometimes experience ; as to its just desert of eternal punishment . But Jehovah iSy I know , he is , righteous in all his ways , and holy in all his works ; and he has said , that " the wicked shall be turned into hell ; where their worm dieth not , and the fire shall never be quenched . " Hush , then , every murmuring , doubting thought , every rebellious , discontented feeling !

I am comfortable in hope ; and this is my hope , that I have received something of the grace of God , and he who has begun the good work , will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ . I can not but feel , with the wife of Manoah , that if the Lord had not intended good for me , he would not have shewn me all these things . MRS . SUSAir XTTRTIKGTOir. 57 Is it common for minds to recur , with something like melancholy , to past scenes of a pleasant character ? Or is my doing it , owing to a constitutional disposition to attach gloom to every thing ? I hare tried long and hard to arrive at the true answer to this question . I am inclined to think that the emotion to which I refer , is peculiar to persons whose feelings have more of the sensitive and enthusiastic in them , than those of the rest of the world ; and such are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensive reflections , will perhaps account for the effect of which I have spoken . Dear M. , when I look forward to the trials I may meet with , and realize my own impotence , i feel that , if I am supported , it will be a glorious instance of the power of God 's grace to overcome and subdue constitutional infirmities , and bear up the spirit , when evenr thing seems combined to counteract its influence . I know that extreme sensibility is generally considered an excellence in our sex . But why should we , whose bodily weakness and necessary trials subject us to a larger portion of misery than men , be led to con* sider that as amiable , which only relaxes those energies of the mind which will prepare us for suffering ? I can not sufficiently deprecate the influence which such a sentiment may have upon the mind . Women are too generally brought up to think resolution useless , and led , by false notions of delicacy , to glory in their weakness . But the voice of the world changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sensations , which before excited pleasure , are considered as indications of weakness and folly . I wish women would endeavour , in all proper ways , to strengthen their more vigorous powers , as reason , judgment , &c.,; and pay less attention to the cultivation of their imagination , which in most of our sex , has naturally sufficient vigour . 5S MEMOIttS OP /z/ Boston , September 9 , 1811 . I am pleased to learn that your present situation is 80 agreeable , and your health so good . You have indeed mercies in the midst of judgments , and mercies of a peculiarly delightful kind . Nothing with respect to your departed mother , could afford you so much satisfaction as the reflection that she lived not in vain ; and that she has only been removed from an inferior station , ( where indeed she made it her constant effort to act the part of a good and faithful servant , but where her sphere of action was comparatively contracted , her powers cramped , and her conflicts many , ) to one where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly lyitness his approving smile . I am not so much a stranger , my dear E. , to the nature of your sorrow as to suppose that you grieve for her who is gone . You feel that her departure from this world is her gain , though it be your loss . But when you look to yourself , and reflect upon your impotency , your need of counsel , and your exposure to temptation , you feel the want of that friend to whom you have so long been in the habit of going for direction and support ; and , though you would not recal her , you can not forbear to mourn . *'It were no virtue , " says one , " to bear calamities , if we did not feel them .

And whatever leads us to God for strength is a great /q/ blessing ; for all that is obtained any where else , but from the fulness that is in Christ , is but weakness , however specious its appearance may be . Your feelings are acute , and , on this account , you have a harder struggle ; but , for the same reason , you will have a more glorious victory . And He , who has wounded , will heal ; He , who has broken , will bind up . He knows how much to inflict , to accomplish his gracious designs concerning you ; and he will lay no more upon you than he will enable you , if you look to him , to bear .

His would not be the lifeless calm of the cessation of feeling , but the divine union of those seeming contradictions  --  " sorrowful , yet rejoicing ; having nothing , and yet possessing all things ' ! Let us , my dear friend , endeavour , whether in prosperity or adversity , to cling to ihe cross of Christ , which possesses a virtue that will render the one harmless and the other salutary , or rather , that will render both salutary . And , remembering each others weaknesses , let us never forget to commend each other , and the whole Israel of God , to his grace , which is able to carry us through all things unto eternal salvation . Six persons were admitted to our church yesterday . There seems to be a growing seriousness among us . I can not but hoe that God has a blessing in store for us . The Holy Spirit would have much error and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the people shall be made willing in the day of his power ; and I sometimes have a strong hope that his gracious power will speedily be ( io or exerted in this way among this people , and thus obtain for itself great glory . No one , I think , who realizes , in any proper manner , the importance of the salvation of a single soul , can help praying for the up-building of Zion . And great things are promised in answer to prayer . If Christians were truly engaged in pleading and labouring for the prosperity and peace of Jerusalem , I am sure that we should see her streets running down with righteousness , and on her walls written inscriptions of praise . /z/ Boston f November 24 , 1811 . Your remarks , my dear M. , are just ; and were letters always , or even generally , the medium of religious communication , I think I may say without arrogance or hypocrisy , I should devote my time to maintaining many correspondences with less regret . Such I trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidently expect it will prove useful , and that we shall find the time devoted to it , time employed to the best advantage . The picture you draw of our insensibility to eternal concerns is correct . That awful unbelief , which man inherits by the apostasy , is never entirely rooted out of Christians in the present life . Hence , their faith is weak , their gracious affections languid , their obedience imperfect . Could we view the subject of redeeming grace as we shall view it , if we are so happy as to arrive at mount Zion above , it must , it would , make us feel our obligations . But , alas , the sinfulness of our hearts ! such a view we shall never obtain , till we have passed the dark valley of death , and left these clogs of clay behind . In the mean while , let us lie low at the footstool , and pray that , at least so much of our natural blindneaft /q/ may be removed , as that we may see that God 's love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our natural supineness may be so far overcome , as that we may be giving all diligence to work the work of God , and make our calling and election sure . How much enjoyment do we lose by our inactivity and indifference ! What can be more surprising than the conduct of those who , though they know that God is the Fountain of living waters , are continually forsaking him , and hewing them out cisterns , broken cisterns , which they also knovr can hold no water ? And such is the conduct of most who profess to have been engrafted into Christ by faith ! TO MISS L. , OF N. n . Boston , March 20 , 1812 . It will give you pleasure to hear that , for some time before the birth of my child , I enjoyed a degree of spiritual comfort scarcely ever felt before  --  not as high overflowings of natural feeling , but a sweet and delightful calm , arising from the consciousness of the infinite integrity , faithfulness , holiness and goodness of God ; and that these feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness . I am only astonished , and , hope , grieved , that I love and serve the blessed Jehovah no better . When I reflect on his unbounded goodness to me , who deserve nothings on the infinite excellence and holiness of his character , and my obligations as a ransomed sinner and a lawful subject , I wonder at myself ; I wonder that heart , . soul , and life , and all , are not unreservedly yielded to Him who deserves more than I can give . Oh , my friend , remember , me at the throne of grace . Pray that my soul may not be , as it were , the grave of God 's mercies ; that I may not be entirely /z/ dead in the vineyard of my gracious Lord , who has , as I humbly trust , redeemed me to God by his own precious blood .

And , as my firm opinion is that we are formed to glorify God , and that to enjoy him is our highest happiness , I will endeavour , by a life corresponding with this belief , to convince my children that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and the enjoyment of him my most ardent desire my unremitted pursuit , and my unspeakable comfort . I will endeavour , by avoiding all superfluous concern about dress , furniture , worldly accomplishments , &c.,; not to counteract my precepts , and thus inspire my children with the idea that , what I say I think tho highest good , I really view but as a secondary considieration ; to act uniformly as if a desire after the one thing needful , was an abiding , influential principle in all my conduct and pursuits . May God give me grace to keep these resolutions ! 23 . Indulged in many anxious anticipations . Did not sufficiently realize that all is at the disposal of a Being of infinite wisdom , and was therefore careful about many things .

We have been favoured beyond our expectations in the weather , and I trust the country air will soon restore him to usual strength . I assure you , dear H. , a line from Boston would be very acceptable . It is not true that attachments formed in after life are less strong than those imbibed in early youth . Never did I feel my affections more firmly fixed , than they are on those objects which have excited them since I have arrived at maturity . My earthly attachments , however , have always been more ardent than they should be . I was ashamed that I should feel so much regret at leaving my eastern friends only for a few weeks . It argued an inordinate love , which ought to be resisted .

Yet my feelings constrain me to try to console you , by endeavouring to express how much I feel for you , how tenderly I sympathize with you . Dear S. , I feel that human friendships are all insufficient to soothe grief like yours . I can only bid you raise your eye and your heart to Him who has inflicted the wound .

Yesterday my little son - appeared very sick . I was awake with him most of the night , and was apprehensive of two disorders , one in consequence of a bad fall , the other the efiect of having been exposed to an infectious disease .

I have great reason to be humbled before God , for the improper emotions I experienced to day , on account of the imputation , to my husband , of a certain trifling error , which imputation I thought unjust . I called it , at the time , a wound of my feelings ; but , on reflection , I believe it was a wound of my pride .

A regiment of soldiers , with a large number of baggage waggons , passed through the streets , just before we went into church this afternoon , on their way to Albany , it is said . The confused noise of fifes and drums , heavy cannon , and loaded waggons , combined with the various sounds of human voices , within four yards of the temple of God , and on his holy day , was new to my ear , and as painful as new . 1 could not help thinking how many distracted countries are continally witnessing siniilar , or worse scenes ; and my heart almost fainted at the idea of our precious sabbaths being converted into days of blood-shed and death , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity and wickedness .

She is a remarkable instance of the sovereignty of divine /q/ grace ; and her experience is , to my mind , an argument of no small weight in favour of those views of religion , usually termed evangelical . That the mind of a young person should be led , by the influence of no external cause , to embrace opinions , which she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impious , and to which the whole current of her preconceived sentiments and carnal prejudices was entirely opposed , can be accounted for on no other ground than that she was irresistibly led , in a way she knew not , by Him in whose hand are the hearts of all men , and who turneth them as the rivers of water are turned . You ask me to remember you in my prayers , that you may be kept from falling . I trust , my dear girl , you are founded on the rock Christ Jesus ; and if so , you are safe . Christians may indeed , like Peter and David , and Thomas , and others , fall into temptations and a snare , and against this , we should continually watch and pray ; if left to themselves , they would fall away and perish , and against this they should continually watch and pray : but none shall be able to pluck them out of the hand of Him who has died to redeem them , and pledged himself to raise them up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , that they may be kept in the Father 's name ; and they may say , Rejoice not over me , mine enemy , for when I fall , I shall rise again . It appears to me , that the charge of licentiousness , so often alleged against the orthodox , is occasioned by an ungodly world eagerly catching at those slips and falls , which are unallowed and adventitious , and which may have been afterwards bewailed with many a bitter tear , while the aggregate of their conduct is overlooked . It is not the existence , but the indulgence , of sin , that proves a professor unsound . It is not a single action , but the habit of conduct , that determines the character . While a scoffing world exuitingly spread /z/ the news of a professors fall , which he may be lamenting in his closet , with no witness but His eye who looketh on the heart , are they equally solicitous to report his benevolence , his heavenly-mindedness , his disinterestedness , his zeal for God , which may form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they forget that we are as accountable for principles as for actions , for the desire of sin as for the commission of it ; and that vicious desires , which we fear to indulge , are infinitely more abominable in the sight of the blessed God , than hated and unallowed miscarriages . I do not forget that the tree is known by its fruit ; and if any sin is so common in a professor , as to have become a habit , it is a dark sign . But these are not the sins of which I have been speaking , nor which are commonly charged upon professors of evangelical religion . October 2 . I have had a very precious exercise this evening , for me . God grant it may prove to have been genuine ! I have , for sometime past , been in a very worldly , carnal state , and Jehovah graciously chastised me . My trial was , in itself , a small one ; but it : was hard to be borne . One of my domestics treated me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , only continued to justify herself , and persist in her rudeness . This circumstance led me to realize , how infinitely important it is that I should ever tread in the precise path of duty , and never turn to the right hand or to the left , lest it should bring a reproach on religion . Such a sense of my multiform duties , as a head of a family , and of my entire impotence for their performance , rushed upon me , that I was almost overwhelmed . But I was enabled to go to that precious Saviour , in whom there is a supply for my every want . I think I was enabled to cast my naked soul upon him for wisdomi M &S.; SUAAH UWTXSetTOJSi .

Indeed , it seemed I was filled with love for all the world . Blessed semer ! precious , glorious Pattern ! enable me to 1 something of thy spirit , while sojourning in vale of tears ! And may that spirit and its divine Sy be consummated in the world of glory ! /z/ BosUm , December 29 , 1812. 8 to progress , dear L. , it seems as if there was luch to be known , and so much to be done , that metimes feel that I am hardly to regard myself iren a babe in Christ .

You remember the season of conflict I ired about two years and four months ago . Nevlall I forget it . Though my distracted spirit was almost swallowed up with the terrors of the Lord , an agonizing weight , which may be conceived , not described , seemed bearing me down to the /z/ blackness of darkness forever ; yet He , whose province it is to bring good out of evil , appeared for me , and said unto me , *Live . ' Whether I was a C/hristian then or not , or whether I am one now , I can not say with certainty , God alone knoweth the heart . But I have a comfortable hope that the Lord ha begun , and is carrying on , his work in my soul . I think my spiritual perceptions are clearer than they ever were before . The attributes of Jehovah , the extent and reasonableness of the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plan of redemption , the character of the Saviour , &c.,; are , I think , increasingly known , and increasingly rejoiced in . I remember when I could talk about these things ; I dare not say I did not feel them in a degree ; but I felt them not as now . This leads me to distrust myself ; for , if I once thought I felt so much more than I really did , there is reason to fear that I now feel , in no measure proportionably to the worth and importance of divine things . And thus I am driven to the omniscient God , to try me and prove me , to empty me from vessel to vessel , and do with me what seemeth to him good ; taking his infallible word , that I shall know , if I follow on to know the Lord . To him be all the glory , now and forever . /z/ Boston , January 5 , 1813 . Weareall well ; and all things go on well .

But , though we may rejoice , how much reason have we to rejoice with trembling ? ' The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked . ' Here is our misery . *I , the Lord , search the heart , I try the reins . ' Here is our remedy . And , were it not for this , we might all sit down in despair of ever knowing ourselves . But it is delightful to be able to commit our souls into the hands of One , who knows what manner of spirit we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity to his own glorious image . I suppose you are obliged , in your present situation , to associate more with the gay world than you could wish . But God is able to bring good out of evil . Perhaps the necessity of mixing with the thoughtless and worldly , may teach you to feel more the importance of living near to God , obtaining strength from him , watching unto prayer lest you fall into temptation , and maintaining good works , than you would do in a less exposed situation . Newton , you remember , thought the few chosen ones in London the brightest jewels in the kingdom . ' No doubt a similar remark may be made with reference to other large towns . I think that a formal spirit of frigid morality among all classes , and an indiscriminate incorporation of such a spirit into the church , when nothing is said against religion , and its professors can scarcely be distinguished from ' the wood , hay and stubble around them , is a condition of society much more hostile to the genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than a Btatb of looser morals on the one hand , and of firmer faith and zeal and greater spirituality on the other . January 22 . When I hear females , as I sometimes do deprecating the contractedness of domcs- /z/ tic life and eagerly panting after the employments and publicity of philosophers , statesmen and legislators , I am led to think that my life , in the little sphere of my family , must be more varied than theirs , or they could not consider the duties of the domestic circle as unimportant , or devoid of excitements . It is true , if the meed to be obtained were mere human applause , the female part of the world would have but little opportunity to shine ; and might justly complain of the narrowness of their sphere , and tiie insfgniiicance of their lot . But when it is considered that the quality of actions is determined by God , and that , in his view , the person who tears from his bosom a right-hand sin , or performs a self-denying duty , is greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such ; how is the case altered ? how does it dignify any station which is calculated to produce these effects ? The woman , therefore , who complains of the obscurity of her condition , feels and talks like a heathen . She virtually professes to value the praise of men more than the praise of Grod ; and is likely , by her impiety and folly , to forfeit both . In performing the duties of private life , no Christian will have reason to complain that he has not sufficient excitement to duty , or sufficiently numerous calls for the use of all his intellectual and moral powers . The various and complicated vexations and trials , pains and sufferings , privations and disappointments , which perpetually occur in the best organized and most favoured family , are enough to convince him , that there is no time to sleep , that much is to be done , and that he has need of all his strength and wisdom to decide , and resolve , and act . If the end of all that we set ourselves about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Christian will deny that it ought ) ; what situation is so favourable for this , as that which teaches the soul what are its ' besetting sins , and /q/ offers no illusive temptations to self-delusion no poisonous reward to virtues which our consciences tell us are defective at the core ? The natural effect of public applause is to produce self-ignorance and deception , for the standard of morals is extremely low and defective in the world ; and the popular man will give himself credit for virtues which , either are worthless in the sight of God , or he does not possess . How awful , when death shall turn him from the decisions of a world blind and partial , to Him who looketh on the heart ! Oh , that in humility of mind , I may ever prefer that condition which leads me to the most intimate knowledge of myself ! that I may be enabled to profit by such a knowledge , and rejoice to become nothing that God may be all in all . February 7 . There is scarcely any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper education of my children . It is a difScult and delicate subject ; and the more I reflect on my duty to them , the more Iieel how much is to be learnt by myself . The person who undertakes to form the infant mind , to cut off the distorted shoots , and direct and fashion those which may , in due time become fruitful and lovely branches , ought to possess a deep and accurate knowledge of human nature . It is no easy task to ascertain , not only the principles and habits of thinking , but also the causes which produce them . It is no easy task , not only to watch over actions , but also to become acquainted with the motives which prompted them . It is no easy task , not only to produce correct associations , but to undo improper ones , which may , through the medium of those nameless occurrences to which children are continually exposed , have found a place in the mind . But such is the task of every mother who superintends the education of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uni* /z/ form and consistent course of conduct which children ought always to observe in their parents and which alone can give force to the most judicious discipline ; and , verily , every considerate person must allow , that it is no small matter to be faithful in the employment of instructors of infancy and youth . Not only must the precept be given . Love not the world ; but the life must speak the same . Not only must we exhort our infant charge to patience under their little privations and sorrows , but we must also practice those higher exercises of submission which , they will easily perceive , are but the more vigorous branches of the same root whose feeble twigs they are required to cultivate . Not only must we entreat them to seek first the kingdom of God , but we must be careful to let them see , that we are not as easily depressed by the frowns , or elated by the smiles , of the world , as others . In short , nothing but the most persevering industry in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knowledge to particular cases , the most decisive adherence to a consistent course of piety , and , above all , the most unremitted supplications to Him who alone can enable us to resolve and act correctly , can qualify us to discharge properly the duties which devolve upon every mother . March 28 . How often do I exclaim with the Psalmist , ( would to God it were with his spirit ! ) * ' 0h that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes ' ' ! I resolve and re-resolve , yet live the same . 1 find myself so oftefi erring on the very point , with respect to which I meant to have been particularly guarded , that I am , sometimes , almost tempted to sit down in despair .

May 15 . How many trials are continually occurring to remind us that this is not our rest ! There are a variety of evils which imbitter life that do not deserve the name of aJHiciions ; and their end is to induce us to look to that perfect state which is to be revealed . I have this day been wounded in my feelings , by unintentionally wounding the pride of a fellow-worm . My remark should not have affected him thus ; it was innocent , and true . But such is our frailty , and I ought to be neither offended nor surprised . Oh for that charity which suffereth long and is kind , is not easily provoked , and seeketh not her own ! Then would none of these things move me. 21 . For a few days past I have felt myself more than usually influenced , by a spirit of vain-glory and pride of human applause , to the performance of right actions . How little disinterestedness of motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little be imaginary ? I am particularly deficient in humility , that precious grace . Oh , that I might see more of the plague of my own heart , and mourn ! But I am ignorant , knowing nothing yet , scarcely , as I ought to know . The next sabbath our communion season returns ; a season when , in times past , I have been particularly guilty , lifeless and cold . Blessed Spirit , take of the things of Christ and shew them unto me , and prepare for him an acceptable offering at my hands ! 24 . I have not had time till now to record the state of my feelings at the communion yesterday . On Saturday evening I had a very interesting season for preparation , and think I , in some measure , enjoyed iu Sabbath morning I heard a sermon on the personality of the Holy Spirit . It was , as discussed , a /z/ T8 - MEMOIRS Oil delightful subject , and my heart , I trust , felt something of warmth and spirituality . The communion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than many Christians generally feel on these occasions , yet it was something for which I desire to be thankful to Mim who is the Author and the Finisher of faith . I had not more joy than I have often had when attending that ordinance ; but my exercises were more satisfactory than usual . If I am not deceived , I was enabled more sincerely , to renounce every idol , and take Christ for my portion , to renounce my own will and surrender myself to his disposal , than ever I did before . Particularly I desired that my inordinate attachment to my children might be crucified , and my love to God be more supreme ; and felt as if I did cast myself on him for the supply of my wants . I felt as if I could go on in the strength of the Lord , and trust in him to carry me through all that is before me . It seemed as if I had some fee* ble emanations of the same spirit which caused the apostle to exclaim , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I might finish my coarse with joy . ' ' And I think I felt a spirit of love for my fellow professors , and a desire that we all , after having received Christ Jesus the Lord , might walk in him . June 4 . Yesterday I went to the meeting at Mrs. M.'s* as usual , but was in a very stupid frame . I did not feel a sense of the divine presence , or scarcely any desire to seek it . In the night I awoke about two o'clock ; and was led , first , to reflect on my insensibility , the preceding day ; and then , on the sufficiency of C hrist to atone for my sins , and strengthen me for future duty . I did not have as " * A stated female prayer meetinff ettablished in 1741 , and continued to the present time . See Memoin of Mrs. Abigail Waters , by the IUt . Jothoi Huntingtoii . " HSS . SVBAir HUNTIN0TON. 7t deep a sense of my guilt as I desired ; but I seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to live for God , that J ought to maintain a constant spirit of prayer , for myself , my children and this miserable world ; and it seemed as if 1 could get up and go to work , to some purpose , about my Master 's business . Oh , it is delightful to feel as if the first wish of our hearts was to fulfil the great purpose of our existence , as if we had caught something of the spirit of the heavenly world , and desired principally to be , and do , and suffer , just what God pleases . I think I scarcely ever saw more fitness in Christ for the peculiar offices he sustains than at this time . It appeared to me as if his having taken our nature upon him , and experienced the weakness of the flesh , rendered him peculiarly fit to be applied to by us for help . He seemed to me indeed a glorious High Priest ; in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead , and therefore able to succour us ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our infirmities , and therefore willing to aiSbrd us all necessary aid . How little do we know of the glorious truths of the Gospel ! Plow sweet are the faint glimpses of divine things which God sometimes gives us ! I think I long to know more , because 1 know enough to know that all beyond is glorious , glorious . Oh , for some emanations of the divine glory to change me into the same image ! 11 . I am quite out of spirits this afternoon . I am discouraged , and think I shall never do my duty , and feel as if I am not prepared for the trials which await me . Yet I am surrounded with mercies , and my life ought to be a life of gratitude . My impatience under the gentle rebukes of my heavenly Father , grieves me to the heart , and greatly diminishes my evidence of possessing that faith which works by love . I think I long to do my duty . /z/ This body of sin and death is a burden* If sin must llwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not reign there , but , like the Canaanites that were left among the children of Israel , occasion greater watchfulness , and a deeper sense of dependance on God for better evidence that my sorrow for sin is of a godly sort . If I knew as much as I ought to know of the evil of sin , how could I ever complain ? no afflictions would seem severe . Instead of this impatient , froward spirit , all would be calmness and resignation within . God ! what I know not , teach thou me ; and make me satisfied and happy , that I and mine are in thy hand , as the clay is in the hands of the potter . Do not suffer me to murmur , when thou layest thy hand on my earthly gourd , but keep me in the temper of the Psalmist , when bo could say , ' Surely I have behaved and quieted myself as a child weaned of his mother . ' Oh , may I be weaned from all the hopes and pleasures which God sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sermon this morning from Ps. xvii. 15. *I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with thy likeness . " The topics chiefly dwelt upon , were , the glories of the heavenly state , and the consolations extended to believers by the gospel , in prospect of a departure from the present world . I reflected that it might , be the last sabbath 1 should be permitted to spend in the earthly courts of the Most High ; and the thought was not attended with those sensations which it sometimes occasions . Formerly the idea of a separation from the body was painful ; and I feared I was not sufficiently humbled , to rejoice in being nothing in heaven , that God might be all in all . I was conscious of so much pride , and self-seeking , that it clouded my evidence of meetness for that world , where the loftiest Seraph derives his happiness principally from the contemplation and /q/ disinterested love of the character and glory of God . Oh that a deceived heart may not turn me aside , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Father of lights ! lest I perish . 15 . I was yesterday morning prevented from spending as much time as usual in private devotion , and was depressed in spirits all day . Every thing looked dark ; and I yielded to a superstitious presenti* mnt of evil , as far removed from piety as from comfort . I believe the gloomy forebodings we sometimes indulge , dishonour God , as well as distress ourselves , and are a great hindrance in discharging the duties of life . Superstition and religion are at an infinite remove from each other . The one tends to terror , gloom , and despondency ; the other to serenity , cheerfulness , and confidence in God . A spirit of bondage is the handmaid of superstition , a spirit of filial love and hope , the handmaid of religion Satan often fills the soul with a thousand dark and dismal apprehensions , on purpose to destroy its confidence in God and deprive it of peace . Such suggestions ought to be strenuously resisted . To-day 1 have been in a happier frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for secret prayer ; and , as usual , I have experienced the benefit of it through the day . Nothing has a more pernicious influence on my spiritual state , than being deprived of opportunity for private devotion . Whea I begin the day with God , I am usually strengthened for its duties and trials . How little have I valued , how little improved , my precious privileges , in comparison with what I should have done . 16 . Oh that I might groan , being burdened with the load of sin which I constantly carry with me ! I have felt not a little impatience in endeavouring to subdue a peevish humour in my child . How little effect can admonition or correction have , when it is not administered in a suitable temper , and accom- /z/ panied with a proper example . Impatience in the parent , must strengthen , rather than eradicate , fretfulness in the child ; for he will easily perceive that you require of him , what you do not practice yourself . I am sometimes almost discouraged . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strengthen the poor impotent creature whose only hope is in thee ! 21 . I was enabled , in secret prayer this morning , to plead , with some degree of fervour , and I hope , in faith , for my dear children . May I be enabled to continue wrestling mightily with God for them , as one that hath power with him to prevail . May I be enabled to lay up for them a stock of acceptable prayers , to be answering when I am in the dust ! Oh that , having been the instrument of their natural , I may be the blessed instrument of their spiritual life ! Why were they given me , but that 1 might train them up for God ? This blessed hope sustains and comforts me . What an honour to prepare gems for the Redeemer 's crown ! And shall my expectations be blighted ? God forbid . Oh that every breath might be a breath of prayer ! Holy Spirit , quicken my sluggish soul . 22 Nature shrinks at the prospect of suffering . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . In general , I am supported by the persuasion that I have given myself to my Father in heaven , to dispose of me as he sees fit ; and I know he will do all things well . If I am called to great trials , I trust he will give me great grace to endure them ; if to great duties , great grace to perform them . I think 1 am principally anxious that I may not be so rebellious as to find fault with his dispensations , but may lie low before my Almighty Sovereign , in a spirit of child-like and loving submission , always exclaiming . Good is the word of the Lord , let him do for me , and by me , and with me according to his righteous pleasure ; /q/ only let me not be accounted an enemy , let me not be found opposing the cause of God and the best interests of his kingdom . If I am not deceived , the character of Jehovah appears to me glorious and lovely . What a sweet delineation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I desire to do more for my Maker and Redeemer than I have heretofore done . 1 am ashamed of my past life ; it has been wasted , wasted . How imperfectly have I answered the great purposes of my existence ! What vanities have occupied my time , what bubbles engrossed my pursuit ! Oh for grace to live while I pretend to live ! May the love of Christ henceforth constrain me to walk in newness of life . 28 . What have I to say for myself ; my gratitude my improvement ! Alas ! I find I am the same poor short-coming creature still . On Oods part , my soul bears testimony , all is mercy ; his promises are sweet ; and he is a God at hand and not afar off . but how treacherous is my heart ! how unfruitful my life !

On the contrary , it seemed as if the language of my heart ought to be , and in some poor degree was Bless the Lord , O my soul ! Jltig% ( , st 5 . I have , some days past , been rather weak and debilitated , and , at times , considerably depressed in spirits . Death has appeared distressing to me . I have been too anxious to live . My heart is drawn out in love to my poor fellow worms , wha /z/ have been the mere iastruments by which God has conveyed his mercies to my soul ; while my heavenly Benefactor , the source of all I enjoy and all I need , has been forgotten . Oh , my leanness , my leanness ! I think I had some life in prayer this evening , some feelings of satisfaction at being in the hands of God for life and death . I think the employments of heaven seemed sweet to me , and a place at God 's right-hand desirable , as a release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually to groan . Thou Searcher of hearts , teach me what I am ! And oh ! bear up my fainting spirit , amidst all the trials and temptations which beset me , in my journey through the wildei'ness of this world , so that I may not dishonour thee by impatience , despondency , and unbelief ! Dear Saviour , I long to see thee with the eye of faith ! Unbelief throws her mist over my soul , and I grovel in darkness . Shine into my heart , and give me the light of the knowledge of thy glory ! /z/ New Londonj SeptemJber2 , 1813 . As I know it will be gratifying to you to hear of iour welfare , I embrace this early opportunity to inform you of it The first and second days of oift* journey , were very unpleasant . On Wednesday night we reached , very much to our satisfaction , the welcome habitation of our parents . How refreshing is rest , after the fatigues of a journey ! how comfortable is home , after having been wandering for days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. , feel about spiritual , as we dp about temporal , things , sweet indeed would be the prospect of leaving our earthly house of this Ubernacle and entering into that eternal habitation /z/ that habitation of rest that remaineth for the people of God ! Could we but climb where Moses stood , And view the landscape o'er ; could we feel that our souls were prepared for the employments and the joys of the heavenly worlds how pleasant would be the thought that the hours which must intervene , before we enter the promised land , are so rapidly passing away ! May we , my dear girl , be enabled so to work out our salvation , so to stand like those who wait for the coming of their Lord , as to rejoice , at the end of our course , in an admission to those mansions which Jesus has gone to prepare , in his Father 's house , for them that love him . That life is best spent which has continually this end for its object . October 3 . Since last writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced a variety of changes both in situation and feeling . Soon after that date I went to Bridgewater for my health , and was a good deal cast down , and , I fear , unreconciled to the divine will respecting me . The thought of leaving my husband and children was very distressing . A cloud of darkness hid the divine countenance from my soul , and I walked in the gloom of midnight . One communion season was allowed me while there ; but I did not enjoy it , and was all the afternoon , seeking after an absent God . My mind was greatly distressed . It appeared to me that an idolatrous attachment to the creature , and an extreme desire to live , were the separating sins between God and my soul ; and I was afraid that , at the last , 1 should be found wanting . One great cause of anxiety was , lest , when I should become sick unto death , I should be left to those turns of gloom and despair to which /z/ I have been subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graces of faith and love , and bring a reproach upon religion . Never was there so impotent , so weak a creature as I. Truly I am crushed before the moth . If I ever endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross , all the glory will , plainly , be the Lord 's . If I am called to endure affliction , and am not swallowed up with overmuch sorrow , it will evidoRtiy be the strength of God alone that sustains me ; and I do think I shall not , I can not , be so ungrateful as to forget the merciful and powerful hand that has upheld me . O God , have pity on thy poor worm , who shrinks at the slightest blast ; and let thine own power rest upon mel Then indeed shall my infirmity be my glory . 10 . I am again called to write in a chamber of sickness . On the 4th I took a severe cold , and have ever since been confined . My mind was , at first , in a comfortable frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of my rebellious disposition* When in health I think I can say , Thy will be done ; but , as soon as there appears to be danger of being called from life , I feel that I am far from the spirit which these words express . One of my domestics has also been taken sick , and obliged to go away . I feel that my chastisements are just . God has been dealing with me for my sins . I have been deprived of the privilege of attending the communion to-day . I hope to be humbled by it . My gracious Lord I think , did lead me to plead with him for those spiritual provisions , of which the provisions of his table are the symbols . I think I felt my will more bowed , and a greater desire to relinquish every idol , than at any time before* God grant I may not be deceived ! Oh that I may henceforward live as a pilgrim and a stranger on the earth ; that I may not be so dismayed when I have /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more frequent in the practice of self-examination ; a duly I have much neglected , chiefly because I have found it so difficult to perform it without distraction ; a fact that should have had just the contrary influence , exciting me to more frequent and strenuous endeavours to perform it aright . God , lead me into the knowledge of myself , and guide me in the way everlasting ! 13 . This has been a public day . When I saw the multitudes flocking to see the parade , &c.,; I could not help reflecting , how much more I enjoyed in my sick chamber , than they possibly could in such futile pleasures . And if I , who am less than the least of all saints , enjoy so much , what must those who continually live near to God enjoy ? Those lines of Pope , One self-approving hour whole years outweighs Of stupid starers and of loud huzzaS ; came into my mind ; and , though I do not altogether agree with him in the spirit of the passage , presuming that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet there is a sweet peace arising from the humble hope that our conduct is in some good measure regulated by the standard of the Gospel , and that our aim is universal obedience . This peace is unspeakably consolatory . Such a peace it is that Jesus has left to his disciples , a peace founded on evidence of that faith in Christ which justifies the soul before God , purifies us from dead works , and leads us in newness of spirit to serve the living God . 26 . What a delicate office is that of a mother ! How wary should be her footsteps , how spotless her example , how uniform her patience , how extensive her knowledge of the human heart , how great her skill in using that knowledge by the most vigilant /q/ and strenuous application of it in every variety of occurring circumstances , to enlighten the understanding and reform the heart ! Legislators and governors have to enact laws , and compel men to observe them ; mothers , have to implant the principles , and cultivate the dispositions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former have to exert authority over characters already formed ; the lattei* , have to mould the character of the future man , giving it a shape which will make him , either an instrument of good to the world , or a pest in the lap of society . Oh that a constant sense of the importance and responsibility of this station may rest upon me ! that grace may be given me faithfully to discharge its difficult duties ! 30 . I have been thinking of those words of James ' If any man lack wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him . But let him ask in faith nothing wavering . " I believe Christians are often lean from day to day , because , though they ask for grace , they do not ask in faith . I sometimes feel so little and so vile , that I fear God will disdain to help me . But I am always unhappy when 1 am in such a frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving and serving him , can not esteem it beneath him to regard my cry , when I plead that my soul may be fitted for his service . I fear I indulge too much in a spirit of bondage , which generates gloom terror , superstition , and despair . I am always happiest when 1 can view God as a merciful Creator , who is more ready to give spiritual than temporal blessings , and has given us every encouragemeat we can desire to trust in him . The idea that God is not willing to help me , that he is a hard master , that 1 have not obtained and shall never obtain his grace , or any similar discouraging thought/ paralizes my exertions , throws a superstitious terror /z/ over my soul , which drives me from prayer , and un* fits me for every duty . 1 must believe that , though the vision tarry , it is my duty to wait for it . Yes , my soul , wait at wisdom 's gate , and thou shalt not be disappointed . Though thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wait upon that Jesus who was never called upon in vain . my God , glory be to thy name , that I can hope in thy mercy , and believe that thou wilt one day bruise Satan under my feet , and give me a complete and final victory ! 1 beseech thee let me not be de-ceived ! 31 . I have been very much tried to-nighl with sceptical and unbelieving thoughts . Oh , that I may be brought out of the horrible pit , and the miry clay ; that I may bewail these things , not merely as a calamity , but also as a sin ! It is a hard conflict . 1 hope I shall be enabled to wait upon God and not faint . I feel that I am blind and ignorant . God grant this trial may be the forerunner of more glorious manifestations than any I have received . Yet I do think the religion of Christ seems to me a glorious religion , a religion worthy of an all-perfect God , a religion embracing principles more elevated , motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desirable , than the heart of man could have conceived . Yes , my faithless , treacherous soul ! it is the truth of God . I can , I do , stake upon it my everlasting all . November 5 . What a great , what a blessed thing , to be a Christian indeed ! Surely , after evidence of having attained this glorious character I do pant and strive . I would rather be a Christian than the monarch of the world . That blessed name embraces and supposes principles more elevated , and joys more exalted , than all other names combined . Men may talk of honour , of integrity , and of moral rectitude they may dream of pleasure and follow MBS . SUSAN HtTRTINOTON. 9t the phantom till they die ; but the Christian alone possesses dispositions calculated to make us either truly good or truly happy . So long as man is supremely bent on his own interests , his morality must be defective . None but a principle embracing universal good , and loving supremely what is supremely excellent , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves surpremely we love what is infinitely unlovely ; and in seeking our own interest as our highest end , we virtually take up arms against all that is excellent in the universe . Oh for the precious spirit of the Gospel , which makes us willing to be nothing ourselves , that God may be all in all . 14 . How kind , how good , is God ! How mercifully has he removed all my complaints , and given me , once more , health and strength ! I am amazed at my ingratitude . How little dependance can be placed on death-bed repentance . In my own experience , how much have I seen of the evanescent nature of resolutions formed in seasons of sickness . Alas ! it is my grief , that a return of health brings a return of cares ; and , in the whirlpool of necessary employments for the poor body , God and my soul are almost forgotten . Why is my heart so treacherous , so prone to leave the centre of all my hopes , the God in whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I long to weep , and weep away this heart of stone , and to honour God by the steady exercise of all the graces of the Spirit . Oh for a vigorous and overcoming faith ! Oh for grace to live above the world . On reviewing the past week , how little have I done of the great work for which I was sent into the world ! I have said something for God ; but have I done any thing for him ? and were my motives pure in what I said ? How much strange fire has been mixed with my best /z/ duties ! I should lie down in despair had not God laid help on One mighty to save . 17 . I think I have , this evening , some feeble desires after God . It does seem , that I am growing in the knowledge of my own heart , and seeing more of the preciousness of the Saviour . Life appears to me to be chiefly desirable as a medium of glorifying Glod ; and to live to the flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the righteous and the wicked at death , seems to me undesirable , and , I had almost said , ( and I ought to be able to say , ) hateful . To be holy ! those blessed words kindle desires in my soul inexpressibly more elevated and ardent , and suppose joys more delightful and transporting to me , than all the combined allurements of this world . And yet , ( 0 how can it be so. ) my sluggish spirit tires and faints , in the pursuit of the former , while , till roused to a sense of my guilt in doing so , to pursue the latter is comparatively easy ! Deplorable , criminal inconsistency ! December 5 . I have once more been permitted to commemorate the dying love of Jesus . Through the preparatory exercises , I was troubled with wandering thoughts , and apprehended a barren season . I hope , however , it was not entirely so . I think I felt my own utter destitution of every good things and was , in some measure , enabled to apply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 think I saw something of the preciousness of the dear Redeemer , and had some thankful remembrance of his death , some longing desires to know and love him more , some sweet emotions of Christian charity toward my fellow-travellers to the Zion above . 1 think I longed to be enlightened in all gospel truth , and to be completely conformed to the image of Christ , to have my soul filled with the love of God . For a few moments I felt that it was inexpressibly sweet to be so near /q/ to God . Dear Jesus ! what I know not , teach thou me ! Carry me safely through the dismal wilderness of this world , which I am so apt to look upon as my home ! And , how delightful it will be , to sing " Worthy is the Lamb , " when I arrive at the heavenly hills where they sit , and celebrate , without weariness , thy praise ! 17 . I have had some precious seasons in prayer , since I wrote last . I felt this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet consciousness that I had committed my soul into the hands of Jesus , that I was almost assured that his grace would always be extended to me , and be sufficient for me. 1 felt that my own extreme weakness was no reason for distress , for if I was called to great trials , especially to bereavements and death , ( at the prospect of which my fearful soul always trembles ) Ood would surely give me necessary aid . But to-night I am so bound down by earthly ties , so knit to the creature , that I have no spiritual enjoyment* These endearing temporal connexions ! how they wind about my heart , and , by the excess of devotedness which they engage , agonize , at the same time that they delight , my soul ! I am in little , or no danger , of falling into the snare of dissipation and extravagance ; but I am in danger from a quarter , perhaps no less alarming , because more specious , and glossed over by so many things which are really necessary and proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable me to crucify every inordinate affection ; and do thou reign supreme in my heart . January 7 , 1814 . I have had some happy moments in committing my guilty and helpless soul into the hands of my Redeemer . I feel an unspeaki* able tranquillity in the belief that , when I am in trouble , and need his aid , especially in the hour of death , he will remember the trust I have committed to him , and appear for me . How infinitely does /z/ the joy , arising from a strong scriptural hope of union to him , outweigh all earthly pleasures combined ! Oh yes , religion is the sweetest solace of life . When that reigns in the soul , all is harmony and peace . /z/ Boston , Jamuiry 16 , 1814 . I rejoice lo hear of your sister 's recovery . I trust she will be enabled to say from the hearty My life , which thou hast made thy carO ; Lord , I devote to thee . Surely those who have been brought near ( o the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special obligations of gratitude and love . And it is one of the most awful and convincing proofs of our inveterate tendency to sin , that recovering mercy so seldom eQcites those holy and grateful dispositions , which we think we shall exercise when pleading for deliverance from sickness and death . Yes , dear M. we do indeed need line upon line , and precept upon precept , and continual supplies of grace , to keep alive in our souls the spark of spiritual life . Blessed be God that be will undertake with creatures so perverse , so obstinate , and bring them into the way of life , and keep them there by the unmerited watchfulness of his love , by those kind and merciful dispensations which we call afflictions . When our own prospects darken , how apt are we to lose all our joys , not remembering that , though we change , God abideth faithful ? We always have cause enough to rejoice and be glad in the Lord , although we often have cause for nothing but sorrow and humiliation in ourselves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be all in all . /q/ Self will rise , and plead for a little gratification . Happy are we if a little is all we give . What is the reason , my dear M. , that some Christians glorify God so much more than others ? Is the deficiency of the latter , in this respect , to be always and exclusively ascribed to their own negligence ? Nothing seems to me so desirable as to live only to God , to have do will , no interest , no fears , no desires , contrary to him . But , alas ! instead of this , it is only now and then , that I feel in any measure that this is my case ; while the principal part of my time is wretchedly filled up with selfishness and sin . But it can do no good to complain to the creature-I only mention these things that you may be induced constantly to pray that 1 may be quickened , that I may not walk in a vain shew , until the just indignation of a holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morels Christian Morals ? Is it not excellent ? How much of Christian knowledge and Christian feeling she manifests ? The essay styled *Thy will be done , " ought to be engven on every professor 's heart . What a mercy it is that our lingering steps , our misjudging apprehensions have so many excellent helps ! But the best guide of all is the Bible . How can we estimate the mercy of having such a guide always at hand ? Do you see the Christian Observer ? There has been , in some of the last numbers , a sketch of a most interesting debate in the British Parliament respecting the propagation of Christianity in India . The missionary cause appears to be rapidly advancing ; the angel , having the everlasting gospel to preach to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people , seems to have commenced his flight . How reviving to know that this cause , of all causes the best , is flourishing , especially in that part of the world which has hitherto been enveloped in the /z/ thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over all . May the blessed day be hastened ! 23 . I wish to record the mercies of the past week as haying been singularly great , and affording abundant encouragement for the future . On Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday , I was much distressed , struggling with a spirit of murmuring and rebellion against the divine will respecting me . But on Friday morning I was enabled , in some good degree , to lay by my own desires and say , Not as I will , but as thou wilt . The prospect of death , should God call me to that trial , was sweetened ; and I was filled with a peace which the world knows not of . I can not but think I shall glorify my Saviour if called to pass through the furnace ; for it does seem as if he is pledged to perfect his strength in my weakness , and display his all-sufficiency in sustaining and carrying me through every conflict . February 12 . Oh my soul ! how pass thy fleeting moments ? What account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh almost trembles at these solemn inquiries . I am alarmed when I remember that twenty-three years of tny short life are gone . And how are they lost , lost , never to be recalled ! What has been done for God ? Oh , that 1 could weep tears of unmingled sorrow , when I answer , Nothing . Were I now in awful judgment before Him who is the Judge of all , and should I hear the heart-rending doom of the unprofitable servant pronounced upon me , could I say any thing in self-justification ? God knows I couldf not . Must I not , may I not , say , to the blessed Jesus , Vhere can I fly but to thy breast ; For I have Bought no other home , For I have known no other rest ? /q/ try ; set on an hill . 1 am requi of a full grown tree , when I am but a feeble plant in the garden of the Lord . Impotence itself is not more helpless than I am . But I trust I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms , and cherishes in his bosom . Blessed be his name , I have hitherto found him a strong tower , I have confided in him , and he has helped me . Yes many a time have I had reason to set up , like Jacob , a memorial of deliverance in the hour of extremity . And , though in view of the multiform duties of life , I exclaim , how am I sujQSlcient for these things ? yet I must hope , that I shall be enabled to do all things through Christ strengthening me . To him be glory forever and ever . Amen . 26 . No one can know the trials of the ministry , except those who undertake the arduous employment , or those who reside in their families . When we consider how much clergymen 's time is occupied by unavoidable company at home , how many special meetings , if they are faithful to their Master , tliey must attend , what a large portion of their time is occupied with visiting the sick , how much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to all this , what numbers of parochial visits they are required to make , and censured if they do not ; it must appear obvious that their task is arduous , their trials peculiarly great . It is a great trial to be obliged to attempt study , when the mind is distracted with the burden of a whole society . It is a trial to be , as it were , compelled to spend that time in visiting , which ought to be devoted to writing , and meditation ; and then to be censured for negligent and ill-digested sermons ; or , if time and pains are taken to vrriie good sermons , to be complained of , for visiting so little . Surely if societies and churches knew the /z/ trials of their ministers , in addition to those per sonal troubles which are common to all ; they would be more tender of them , more fervent in prayer for them . 1 do not wonder that so many of the labourers in the Lord 's vineyard faint before mid-day . They ought , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encouraged , by their people . March 5 . I think I can say , from experience , ' that it is good to draw near to God . Hut language can no more convey , to one who has no knowledge of it from experience , an idea of the blessedness of communion with the Father of our spirits , than it can of the nature of the light of the sun , to one who was born blind . It is indeed ineffable ; in comparison with it , every earthly joy dwindles into insignificance , and becomes light as a puff of empty air . If I , who have so little faith , can say so , what must the eminent Christian feel ? What must the spirits of the just made perfect feel ? I have had much solicitude for my children this evening . At one time , such a sense of the everlasting consequences of the trust committed to me , in reference to their immortal souls , rushed upon me , as literally made me shudder . I wonder I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me faithful , and crown my efforts with his blessing ! /z/ Bridgewaier , March 3 , 1814 . You ask my advice about the correction of children . I feel that I am not at all qualified to direct in a thing of so much importance . I will however remark , that I do not like the punishment of whipping , unless when the child exhibits strong passion , or great obstinacy . It ought to be the last resorts /q/ Neither do I like those punishments which are chiefly directed to the selfish principles of our nature , as depriving a child of cake , sweetmeats , &c,; I should rather aim to cherish feelings of conscious rectitude , and the pleasures of being beloved . I would have a child consider his parents declaration that he is not good , his worst punishment . For instance , if your littlboy has done very wrong , 1 would tell him he must not stay with mama , or must not take a walk , or see the company , or that he must eat his dinner alone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indulged these usual privileges . But there are some cases in which the use of the rod is indispensable* I am writing in the midst of the noise of tongues , and can only add that I think very well of Locke 's System of Education , generally ; also of Miss Hamilton 's , and Dr. Witherspoon 's . But after all , education is only an instrument , and the little ones must be borne , in the arms of faith , to that compassionate Redeemer , who has given parents such abundant encouragement to trust in him ; committing them always into his hands , believing that , if they do so , he will direct their steps . /z/ Boston f April 22 , 1814 . Have you seen the Memoirs of Mrs. Harriet Newell ? It is a very interesting book . Such unreserved and disinterested devotedness to the cause of Christ , in so young a person , appears very extraordinary in these times of religious indifiference and sloth . There was an elevation and spirituality in her character , seldom met with at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence . Christians will be humbled by its contemplation , and stimulated to greater activity in the service of Christ . /z/ Jipril 24 . I have noticed a very striking difference between my religious exercises now and several years ago . Then I was all joy ; felt as if I could die for Christ ; had the most joyful anticipations of heaven ; would sit for hours , almost in an extacy and sing the most spiritual and elevated of Watts ' hymns , particularly those concerning the frailty of life , the vanity of the world , the glorious state of departed spirits , &c.; The language of my lips , I then hoped , ( and I still hope it was so in some degree ) of my heart , was , Jesos ! when shall that dear day , That joyful hour , appear , When I shall leave this house of clay , And dwell amongst ' em there ? But now , alas ! I too often feel happy , when I can look with the least complacency upon death ! Yet it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , my views are more scriptural , more consistent and more mature , than they were then . The Bible is more truly precious ; and I see far more of the sinfulness of my heart , and my perfect impotency . At times , I think , my views of the character of Christ are more evangelical , and my faith stronger now , than they were then ; for sometimes , when my path is hedged up , and I am ready to sink in the deep waters , I am enabled calmly to stay my soul upon the bare promise of God . I certainly , if I am not altogether deceived , am not so self-dependent and self-sufficient now as I was then . But my joy is not so constant , nor , at any time , so great , and I am more frequently distressed by doubts of my being a Christian at all . When I think of death , my dear husband and children seem like ' weights that draw me downward still , * ' and sometimes the thought of leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , think my state better now than it was /q/ then , and that I have better evidence of having passed from death unto life . Joy alone , is a fallible criterion . I had rather have the assurance that I had parted with one darling sin , or given up one beloved idol , for Christ , than be raised to the third heaven in joy . But , oh ! I long for both ! I long to read my title clear To mansions m the skies ; and to have the comfort of such an assurance . Let me , then , press on ; continually examining my progress by the word of God , and applying for fresh anointing to my great High Priest ; and my hope will be like the morning light , which shineth more and more unto the perfect day . 25 , How poor and despicable is the ambition of living merely to shine . How many trifle away their little span , in the useless glitter of brilliant nothingness . It is a selfishness to desire to live merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that he eondemns it . It is a spectacle , at once curious and melancholy , and that would create astonishment , were it not accounted for by the depravity of the human heart , to see the worms of yesterday , who tomorrow are not , and whose knowledge is , at best , a mere point , vainly swelling with the ostentation and pomp of self-complacency . Of how little con* sequence is it whether we live splendidly , if we live usefully ? This is what we ought to labour after . This is an ambition which God approves , an ambition which suits the nature and dependant condition of man , and which will ennoble and elevate the faculties ; but which , otherwise employed , degenerates into unprofitable waste , and criminal perversion . May 2 . My lungs are very weak . I often feel great distress from very slight exertions in talking . how do I wish that my little strength may be de- /z/ voted to the glory of God ; that my breath may not be wasted by idle and useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my health no better , for the best of Fathers , and in the best of causes ! I long to do some good in the world . I long to be useful to my dear fellow creatures . I long to see all engaged for God . Oh , that these desires may be attained ! I had some sweet freedom in prayer this morning . I felt that I could go to God , through Christ , as my Father . I think I felt something of the spirit of adoption , and saw something of the preciousness of Christ ; remembered with satisfaction and thankfulness that he had trodden the rugged path of human life , and the rough descent to the valley of death , and smoothed them both for his children ; and felt as if I could follow where he had led the way . This day resolved to set apart fifteen minutes every day , for special prayer in every season of afiSiction , and especially for strength to conquer my last enemy death . I need a double share of grace , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extreme sensibility of my nerves . I think I have given myself to Christ . I hope , I believe , he will appear for me when every other dependance fails me , and shew me that he is faithful in keeping that which I have committed to him . 1 am nothing but sin and weakness ; but he is able and willing to save to the uttermost all that come to him . 7 . I have been blessed with much spiritual comfort for some days past . I scarcely ever had such distinct exercises of faith . It has seemed as if I was as conscious of the divine presence , as ever I was of the presence of a friend when conversing with me . And I have had such a persuasion that God did hear my prayers , and have gone to the throne of grace with so much of a spirit of self-renunciation and sweet reliance on the intercession of Jesus that MRS . SCrSAN mVTVXGTOlX. lOS I must conclude that my exercises have been different from any thing which the carnal heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to my view this evening . It seemed impossible for a being , so holy as I saw God to be , to admit sinners  --  transgressors of his holy law and contemners of his glorious perfections , into his approving presence , without a Day-man between them to lay his hand upon both . I think I know by experience the meaning of that text , To you that believe he is precious . " 14 I feel much comfort to-day in the thought that I am in God 's hands , for life and for death . Death has , indeed , had many terrors to me ; but I know that I shall be more than a conqueror , if ( ' hrist strengthen me ; and he is my hope . Heaven and its employments sometimes appear inexpressibly delightful . SalTation ! Oh the joyful lound ! Ear hath not heard another so sweet . Yes , I know that God hath laid up joys , which the heart of man jsannot conceive , for them that love him .. The gift ef Christ is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My heart sometimes yearns over my dear , miserable , dying fellow-sinners , who shut their eyes and ears to the voice of mercy . " Madness is in their hearts " of a truth . But they know it not . Pity them , God ! for Jesus sake , pity and save them ! 26 . I have , of late , been much more comfortable in my body , and less so in my mind . It seems impossible for me to keep in a spiritual frame , except when under the immediate pressure of affliction . When I see how time flies , and how little I do for God , it astonishes me . Such ingratitude and pride would melt into deep contrition a heart less obdurate than /z/ mine . It is strange beyond measure , that I can be contented to live so immeasurably below my obligations .

But , alas ! how is it with me now ? My dear husband is come ; and I find I still lean to the creature , and am wickedly reposing on one who , like myself , is crushed before the moth ; one whom God sent to comfort me , a blessing which He kindly lent me , but which I , wretched creature ! am disposed to put in the place of God ! how treacher* /q/ ous is my heart !

You have been informed of my unexpected journey to Connecticut .. I came to take my last farewell /z/ of a parent , a father , dear to my heart , whom God lias taken to a better world . How little did I anticipate such an event when I left home . But I can now see the kind interposition of providence in so disposing my concerns as to make such a journey necessary , notwithstanding the strong reluctance I felt to undertake it ; so necessary indeed that I was compelled to surmount every obstacle which interfered with its accomplishment . I came ; had the satisfaction of being with my excellent father a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope , of contributing to his happiness . I came to behold him struggle , for nearly five days , in an unequal and distressing conflict with a fatal sickness , and then , at last , yield his spirit into the hands of Him who will have all his children to be with him , where he is , that they may behold and participate in his glory . And now , my dear E. , if you have thought me negligent in delaying to write , you will think me so no longer . You have lost a parent ; and I need say no more . But I have , as you had , precious consolations under this solemn rebuke , which have , in a great measure , sweetened the bitterness of the affliction . I believe that one reason why the loss of friends , of Christian friends at least , is sometimes so insupportable to survivors is , that we are too selfish in our feelings . We are apt to derive nourishment for sorrows which enervate the mind , from two sources ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other the remembrance of what our friend sufiered . But immoderate grief on these accounts is sinful , for it savours too much of the spirit of tliat idolatrous declaration " Ye have taken away my gods , and what have I more ? * ' My dear father fell a victim to the distressing fever which has swept away , within the last two years , so many of our most valuable citizens and faithful ministers . He preached , as usual , the sabbath before his /q/ death . His last text was , And his rest shall be glorious/ ' The next Friday he was , I have no doubt , admitted into the regions of the blest , and made an everlasting partaker of the joys he had so recently described . Happy spirit ! Safe art thou lodged above these rolling spheres . The baleful influence of whose giddy dance . Sheds sad Ticissitude on ail beneath ! And who could wish thee again imprisoned in this dark world , far removed from God and heaven , and again subjected to the conflicts , the sufferings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my father 's death was a general loss . His family mourn not alone . Many feel the wound to be grievous ; many mingle their tears with those of his afflicted relatives , over the remains of the man the friend , the spiritual guide , whose fervent prayers , whose wise and benevolent counsels , have ceased forever . Glory be to God , for the precious promises of immortality which the Gospel unfolds ! Glory be to God , that this light of life has smiled upon the darkness of the tomb , and taught the believer that , because Christ lives , he shall live also . This consideration whispers peace , be still , ' and turns the terrors of the last , enemy into light , and hope , and joy . Pray for me , my dear friend , that this afflictive , but righteous , providence may be sanctified ; that I may be made , by it , a partaker of God 's holiness . A partaker of God 's holiness ?

I thank you , my dear H. , for your kind and excellent letter . Though I needed not such a proof of /z/ no MEMOIRS OF the continuance of your friendship , yet every token of affectionate remembrance is peculiarly gratifying in seasons of affliction . To be thought of , and prayed for when we most need prayer , is comforting indeed . And such has been my case in no common degree . Yes , my dear girl , human comforters can do but little toward alleviating the anguish of a heart bleeding with a wound like mine , unless God also administers consolation . And , blessed be his name ! such consolation I think I have , in some measure , received . The stroke was no common one . It swept away one of the kindest husbands , and one of the most affectionate and faithful fathers , that ever wife or children were blessed with . Those who knew him best , loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . To this bereaved congregation especially , it seems to have been a stroke , which can not now be estimated , and must long be felt . But , though the dispensation is mysterious , though the death of my beloved parent has dried up forever the principal source of happiness with which I was favoured in this town , and , with a few exceptions , in this world ; yet I have reason to bless God , that I am not conscious of ever having wished to counteract the divine decree . There has been so much of mercy mingled in this cup of sorrow , that it has sweetened the bitter dregs which I have been called to taste . Oh , H , , there is comfort , great comfort , in the believer 's latter end . Then the value of the Gospel appears . What philosophers and wise men have shuddered at , what infidels can not usually behold horror , the believer can meet with humble confidence and holy joy .

Ill Take away this hope , even were he certain of exemption from suffering , what clouds and darkness would settle , in impenetrable gloom , over the grave ? Yes , the preciousness of those animating assurances of eternal life , and of the resurrection of the body , which are given in the Gospel of Christ , can never be so forcibly felt , as when we are about , either oiirselves to put off the earthly house of this tabernacle , or to behold a dear friend bid a final adieu to all earthly scenes . Well might the Psalmist say , *'They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zioa which can not be removed , but abideth forever . As the mount-ains are round about Jerusalem , so the Lord is round about his people forever , ' ' to defendi to preserve , to cheer them , even when heart and flesh fail them . With the dead this earthly scene has closed forever . They have livedo they have died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be connected with them precious and dear as they once were , no more . But what remains for us ? Much , very much . We are to see to it , that we despise not the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when we are rebuked of him . We are to take heed that , by our faithful improvement of afflictions , we may have evidence , that our tribulation has worked in us patience , our patience experience , and our experience the hope which maketh not ashamed . It is dreadful , when God is cutting off one creature comfort after another to teach us that this world is not our rest , to be clinging , with all the energies of an undiminished attachment , to that very world , which is thus constantly breaking from our grasp , disappointing our hopes , and piercing us through with many sorrows .

I was quite well when I left Connecticut , but feel , since my return , much that appears wrong at my breast , and an almost constant pain in my side . At times I am almost discouraged , and think these complaints will terminate in a consumption . I had hoped to have been spared to my darling children ; to have used my humble exertions to guide their infant minds in the paths of truth and holiness ; to have watched over their early associations , and directed those propensities which a mother best understands , and on the judicious management of which so much of their future usefulness and happiness depends .

And , above all , I had hoped to have shewn them , from the history of past ages , that the lusts and passions of men produce wars and fightings , turmoil and misery and death ; and to have drawn them to behold the difference , manifested in the spirit of the Gospel of Christ , /q/ from this picture of wretchedness and sin ; and thus to have taught them to cultivate the dispositions which that Gospel requires , and on which the happiness of individuals and of society depends . how many ways may the mother seize , to leach the offspring of her love the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what if this office of maternal tenderness , dear to my heart as life , should be denied me ; have I any complaint to make ? No , none . Is not God able to take care of my children without me ? Yes , infinitely able . Let me not then be unreasonably anxious how it may be with my poor body . God governs , infinite rectitude is on the throne of the universe ; and why should I fear ? If it is for his glory that 1 should live , he is able to preserve me ; if it is not , ought I to desire it ? Oh that I may ever stand in a waiting posture ; not looking upon this world as my home , but desiring that all my will should be , that the Lord 's will should be done ! /z/ Boston J September 11 , 1814 .

And is not the object worthy of such an effort ? /z/ Boston , September 15 ; 1814 . I always find that I am in a better frame of mind when my earthly gourds are blighted . 1 do not pray for afflictions ; that would be impious presumption in a worm like me .

As to those time-consuming parties , which disarrange a family for a week before to prepare for them , and for a week after to compose those affairs which have been put out of place , 1 scarcely know , from experience and personal observation , any thing about them . My early habits of country simplicity are . so thoroughly interwoven with my constitution , that it would distress me greatly to go very much out of my accustomed way .

And yet how little is the abuse of time regarded ? How many squander a whole life away , and find , at the close of it , that they have made no use of time , but to accumulate to themselves greater misery forever , by a remembrance of the waste . November 1 . I feel an intense desire to put on Christ more uniformly , in my life and conversation . AU that is past looks dark and unprofitable . My best duties have all been stained with sin . I should despair , but for the blood of Christ which cleanselh from all sin . Precious truth !

Oh for a broken heart , that I may mourn its deep declension from God , and the love of the world , and the pride of spirit , which I have to record against myself to-night ! 20 . Many , who have no knowledge of the subject from experience , think that religion makes men gloomy . / know nothing of such religion . How can that which prepares us for afflictions , which teaches us to expect disappointments , which lowers our calculations and desires from this world , which resolves all things , with sweet complacency , into the will of the all-wise and all-merciful Governor of the universe , which assures us that Jehovah is pledged to make all things work together for good , which gives to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a hope attested by evidence which God himself has prescribed , of ultimate admission to the joys of his immediate presence , how can such a principle make men gloomy ?

You know Mrs.  --   --  . This day she lost a child , the fifth which God , in his inscrutable providence , has called her to give up within the last four or five weeks .

She behaves , I understand , like ' a weaned child " under this accumulated rebuke . Such a stroke , it would seem , must detach the soul that has received it from this perishable world . And yet the privation of every earthly comfort , will only make men miserable , unless almighty grace sanctifies the rod . How little can mere human fortitude do in such cases . Let us endeavour to learn wisdom from this melancholy providence . Have you read Dugald Stewart 's Philosophical Essays ? He is generally esteemed , I believe , one of the greatest men of the present age : and yet the /z/ loss of an only son , it is said , has almost made a wreck of those faculties which have delighted and astonished the world .

How is it with you now , my dear friend ? It is to be expected that the two years which have elapsed since a letter passed between us , have witnessed some changes in our affairs and in our feelings .

I too often find that it is only the immediate pressure of trials that keeps me in any thing of a suitable frame . Like those children who return to folly as soon as the chastening hand of the parent is withdrawn , I feel that I have an evil heart , continually inclining me to depart from the living God . MRS . SUSAN HUNTINaTON- 119 Yet great as has been my guilt in profiling no more by the rod , I would still humbly believe that these chastisements , especially the last and greatest , have afforded me some comforting views of God , which have strengthened and animated me to go on my way rejoicing ; some manifestations of the state of my own soul , of the preciousness of the word , and of the safety and sweetness of trusting in the Lord , which I should not otherwise have had . My dear friend , why is it so difficult to confide in God , in relation to what looks dark and doubtful before us , when we have so often found , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he does make his severest dispensations work for our good ? Why can we not cast all our cares upon him that careth for us ? It is a great dishonour to our compassionate God , to be doubting whether he will sustain us in our extremity , or fearing that he will lay more upon us than he will enable us to bear . No , no ; it can not be . Only let us entrust ourselves , and all our interests , unreservedly to Him who loved us unto death , and we must be safe . But ah ! these vile hearts ! Faith struggles , and struggles , and prevails ; and then we have comfort . Then unbelief , secretly but successfully , undermines our hopes , and we are in darkness . Yet let us not fear . God will , I trust , one day bruise Satan under our feet ; and then , 0h how pleasant the conqueror 's song ! " December 17 . Oh for those sweet and precious views of divine things , which I had when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then so comforted , and filled with peace . I can not express the manner in which this life was exhibited to me . It seemed as if I stood on the outer verge of this world . My connexion with eternity appeared mor immediate and certain , than that which /z/ I had with time . My husband and children , except one , were at a distance ; my dearest present friend had gone to the world of spirits ; and it appeared to me that 1 could apply to myself , as if addressed to me individually and alone , the direction , " Arise , and depart , for this is not your rest . ' 1 found that God was enough . I felt that his will was my will ; and was unspeakably happy . Self seemed , in some degree , reduced toward its proper place , and I could say , God is on the throne , what more can I want ? I perceived and felt that he governed uncontrollably , and my soul was satisfied , entirely satisfied . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! /z/ Boston , January S , 1815 . Do you find as much leisure for public charities , as you used to before your marriage ? Young ladies should consider the talent which is entrusted to them of time , disencumbered of domestic cares , as a precious deposit , and devote it faithfully to the service of Christ . They may not have so much influence ( though it is far from being always so ) as married ladies , but they have more time and opportunity for action , in the various fields of Christian benevolence which it is proper for females to cultivate ; they can do more for the promotion of the various charities of the present day . Yet our situation , my dear friend , is not without opportunities for doing good . A married lady can exert greater influence in her own family than any where else ; she may be more useful there than she could be any where else . It is indeed in a silent , unobserved way ; but not on that account , the less acceptable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides industrious /q/ wemeft may redeem much time from their families for more public duties . But in saying what might be done I condemn myself . I have nothing pleasing of a religious nature to eommunicate . I sometimes think you are much favoured , to be so quietly seated down in the midst of a people where doctrinal divisions are scarcely known ; though I am sensible that the greatest outward prosperity of Zion , can not produce abiding eomfort in that soul whose inward graces are languishing . It can not fail however , I think to give pain to every Christian , whose graces are not deplorably benumbed by the absence of the Sun of righteousness , to see thousands weekly visiting the sanctuaries of the Most High , the original use of which was to proclaim to lost sinners complete salvation through Him who died to redeem us from the curse of the law , without ever being informed by their spiritual watchmen that they are exposed to that curse , and in perishing need of that Saviour ! Painful indeed is it to see miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastening to eternity without being informed , that they must be born again if they would enter the kingdom of heaven , that by the deeds of the law no flesh shall be justified ; to see them coming away , from the place professedly devoted to religious instruction , ignorant of God , of themselves , and of the only way of salvation ; resolving , if resolving at all , merely to be more moral while the heart and soul of true morality  --  the motives from which truly moral conduct springs , are entirely overlooked ! Am I uncharitable ? Charity rejoiceth in the truth . But is this the truth of God ? Is the Gospel of the Son of God little better than a system of heathen ethics ? for if mere external morality is all it requires , it is little better . Yet , those who regard this as the Gospel , tell us there is no essential difference between their views of /z/ it and ours ! Strange , passing strange ! When we cohsider the tremendous realities of death , judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that declaration , *'He thatbelieveth not shall be damned ; " when we behold a person , who has never performed one sinless action , going into the presence of the Holy One trusting to his morality for acceptance ; and remember that Christ alone is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth , and that there is no salvation in any other way ; can we admit that there is no material difference between our views of religion , and those to which 1 have referred ? Is not the difference great , awfully , eternally great ? If not , 1 am blind indeed . But while we feel , and maintain , the vast importance of the truth , and the guilt and the danger of error , we must be careful to avoid , if possible , giving even an occasion for the imputation of uncharitableness . Those who are zealous for the truth , and even those who have experienced its renovating power , sometimes provoke this charge by an acrimonious and intolerant spirit .

I have not heard from you since the return of peace an event which , for several days , clothed almost every face with a smile . It is indeed a joyful event . And yet , one can not help being concerned at the apparent selfishness of the joy , manifested by most , on this occasion . Few appear to regard it in any other light , than as it afiects the prices of goods , or tho advantages for trade , or for the indulgence of luxury . Few , alas ! appear - to recognize God as the author of the blessing , and their consequent obligations to him . /z/ But let me not dwell upon the dispositions and views of others , while I have so much greater need to examine my own . My dear friend , it is we , professors of religion . Christians as we hope , whose ingratitude is the most provoking to God . National judgments , in my view , are especially sent for the profiting and purifying of Christians . Impenitence under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected from those who are . under every dispensation , treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath . But that God should behold his own children as stupid and carnal , as vain and worldly , after such judgments , as before , oh ! this is criminal , is alarming indeed . If , as all experience testifies , there is great danger of this being the case with Christians , then there is great need of their praying , constantly and fervently , for each other . We should seldom pray for ourselves , without remembering all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ every where . Were professors of religion more faithful in performing this duty , we should not see so many who in the spiritual sense , can scarcely be said to live at all . We should find them engaged for God , conformed , much more than they are , to his likeness , and , by their holy example and fervent prayers , constraining many others also to glorify their Father in heaven . Our churches would soon be purified from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest it to be of God . Our Bible Society ( Female ) succeeds very well , and is doing much good . I suppose you have seen the New Jersey and New York reports for 1S15 . The latter is very interesting .

The dawning of the millennial day . really /q/ seems to have come .

A female society has just been formed here for the liberal education of such indigent pious young men , of good capacity , as manifest a strong desire to preach the Gospel ; and it is confidently expected the gentlemen will take up the business on a large scale . Such societies are comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great importance . They ought , I think , to be instituted throughout Christendom , for the evidence is every day accumulating of the fact , that the harvest is great , but the labourers are few . In what way will so great an amount of good be likely to be accomplished , as by raising up faithful ministers . I hope females will more generally and deeply feel their unspeakable obligations to the religion of Christ , and make greater exertions for its extension in the world . They can do much , very much , in various ways ; and surely they are bound to do all they can . Christians of both sexes will see and feel the necessity of making far , far greater exertions in every way , than they have yet made , for the spread of the Gospel , before the millennial glory of the Church is attained . Jlpril 4 . This subject of education is one that lies nearer my heart than any other merely temporal concern . It is easy to speculate about it , and to prescribe rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most judicious system and to say with /z/ Fosters man of indecision , " Ibis is a good plan , k plan which would be very useful in its results , ' ' and after all , make shipwreck of the disposition and minds of our children by mismanagement . All this is easy , for the same reason that it is easy to acquire correct opinions on any subject . But acting , practice ; here , here is the difficulty . The truth is , no one can govern a family of children well , without much refleciion and , what the world calls , trouble . There must be an accurate judgment formed respecting the character of each child , and a regular and consistent method , adapted to each , pursued . And , what is more difficult still , the parent must uniformly govern herself . This , certainly , is not easy ; it calls for the unremitted exertion of several most eminent and rare Christian graces . It appears to me that three simple rules , steadily observed from the very germ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiable than we generally see them . First . Never to give them any thing improper for them , because they strongly and passionately desire it ; and even to withhold proper things , until they manifest a right spirit . Second . Always to gratify every reasonable desire , when a child is pleasant in its request ; that your children may see that you love to make them happy . Third . Never to become impatient and fretful yourself , but proportion your displeasure exactly to the offence If parents become angry , and speak loud and harsh , upon every slight failure of duty , they may bid a final adieu to domestic subordination , unless the grace of God interposes to snatch the little victims of severity from destruction . I feel confident , from what observation I have made , that , although more children are injured by excessive indulgence than by the opposite fault , yet the effects of extreme rigor are the most hopeless . And the reason is , associations of a disagreeable nature , as /q/ some of the ablest philosophers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melancholy fact , that the children of some excellent people grow up more strenuously opposed to every thing serious , than others. * They have been driven , rather than led , to observe the forms and outward duties of religion , and its claims upon their hearts have been too commonly presented to their minds , in the imperative , and not in the inviting form . For my own part , I find myself falling so far short , that 1 am , sometimes , overwhelmed with the distressing apprehension of erring fatally . Dear children ! I tremble for you , when I reflect how dangerous is the path in which you are to tread , and how difficult the task of directing you in safety . Lord ! I commit myself , whom thou hast made the guide of their youth , 1 commit their hearts and ways , unt6 thee ! /z/ Boston , April 27 , 1815 .

But cases of this kind are by no means so numerous as is commonly supposed . The truth i0y the children of religious parents are expected , ( and justly too , ) to be faNfetter than others . Hence every instance of the disappointment of this expectation , makes a strong impression on the mind ot an observer , which IS extremely apt to lead him to very erroneous conclusions , respecting the influence of the instructions and restraints of a religious nonily .

I5ut , when I see an increasing family of immortal souls , whom I have been the instrument of bringing into this wretched world , cast upon my care ; when I think , that I am to be a principal instrument in forming their characters , and thus , in fixing their destinies for eternity : that instructions and prayers and efforts must be accompanied with an example of unblemished purity ; that every inconsistency in xny conduct may produce in their minds a false association , the influence of which may be most pernicious , and the smallest deficiency in the correction of first errors produce a habit which may never be counteracted ; I tremble .

I always find the weakest people the most ready to animadvert upon the actions , and judge of the conduct , of others . They are not disposed to make allowances for motives which they do not understand . I find in myself a propensity to give my opinion with the greatest confidence , upon those subjects with which I am least acquainted . A thorough knowledge of a subject , commonly brings to view so many manifestatiotis of its parts and bearings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its aspect as first presented . And if a subject appears to me , upon examination , in a very different light from that in which I first viewed it , there may be still other points , which have been overlooked , that would give yet another appearance in my view . As respects the conduct of others , I have sometimes judged , and pronounced an unfavourable decision , when the circumstances of the case have been such , as to prevent nly ascertaining whether there were , or were not , good reasons for the action I condemned . How very reprehensible is such a temper ! How it displeases , and even irritates me , when I discover it in others . May 1 be led , when I see my actions ealled in question , to abhor the spirit of censorious- /z/ nessin myself !

' ' Especially it seems important that I should pray without ceasing , because it will soon , it may very soon , be too late for me to do any thing in this way for the world , and for my dear children . Blessed be God ! I have had much enlargement , of late , in pleading for the latler . I think I can appeal to Him who knoweth all things , that I have chosen Jehovah for the portion of my children above every other portion . Honour , and wealth , and long life , and all temporal blessings , have appeared , for them , as trifles and vanity , compared with this . And as I have chosea God for them above riches , and as he has promised to be the God of the seed of believers , 1 do feel great encouragement that he will also choose them for an inheritance forever .

And I bless his name that he has , I humbly hope , given me a good degree of willingness that this desire should not be granted on any other conditions . /z/ 22 . I have had unusual peace and comfort of mind of late . The strength of the Lord is my confidence . I am not afraid to trust to it . I rest , with calmness and joy , upon the precious covenanted mercy of God in Christ . I would not exchange the /q/ hope I have of an interest in that mercy , for all the healthy and wealth , and accumulated good things , the world can afford . /z/ Boston , Jtau 14 , I8I0 . I am reading the Memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How the life of such a man shames and condemns that of common Christians . He was preeminently a holy man . The most striking feature of his piety seems to have been , an annihilation of self , and total absorption in the will of God . This grace appears to me the most lovely of all the admirable qualities combined in the Christian 's character , and that , by which the superiority of his to all other religions is , perhaps , the most strikingly exhibited . And is it not also the most rare , and the most difficult to be acquired ? If we habitually felt properly submissive to our heavenly Father 's will , where would be that unavailing and harassing solicitude about our future temporal circumstances , which so often interrupts present enjoyment ? where , that dejected and disconcerted spirit with which we so often contemplate the desolation of our earthly hopes and visionary schemes ? instead of distressing ourselves , and preventing , by our unbelief , that good from being communicated by our Father which he is able to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meekly and humbly wait for what the Lord our God should judge best , and enjoy the comfort of such a heavenly frame in the midst of sorrow . How would such a disposition smooth the rugged path of life , and convert every occurrence of the way into a blessing ! Well , my dear friend , the God we serve is able and willing 10 give us this precious grace . There is no reason why /z/ we should be destitute of it , but that which spriags from our own unbeliefi which is our sin . et us then have stronger confidence in God , and wait upon him for this blessing by continual prayer ; and he will hot disappoint our hope , but shew us , by happy experiencci that his will is the best , and that none of those who trust io him shall be desolate . /z/ Boston , June 30 , 1815 . I have thought , my dear friend , of your present situation as respects religious privileges , with much interest . You think it unfavourable to progress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without doubt . But it is the peculiar excelleneie of cr reli- ) religion , thatit enables its disciples to derive ifistmetioA even from those circumstances wfaieh to human view , appear the most adverse . The pro  --  iise of God standeth sure , that all things shall work together for good to them that love him . And , my dear Mrs.  --  all our religious privileges can be profitable only as God blesses them to us ; and he is infinitely tible to grant as great a blessing without them . We may receive as much religious improvement from being deprived of a means of grace we had anticipated with delight , as from enjoying it . In general , undoubtedly , God affords the blessing in the use of his established means ; but when he sees an humble heart longing after the enjoyment of ordinances of which it has been deprived by his be meets with such a soul , and shews it that his presence and grace are not confined to particular places and circumstances . He is the Sun ; and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart in attend* ing upon ordinances , emanate from him . He is the Fountain from which all that is profitable in the /q/ most faithful sermon , the most spiritual companion , the most useful connexions , is derived . And to him may every thirsty soul repair , without the intervention of any outward means , and receive an abundant supply for every want . What a source of comfort is this , that nothing can shut out the soul that longeth after God , from communion with him ? Bolts and bars may exclude the presence of man , sickness may prostrate the body and enfeeble the mind , persecu* lion may cut us off from all those outward privileges which usually are the means of sustaining the Christian 's hope and joy ; but all these combined , can not shut out God from the soul that desires his presence . The Lord is nigh unto all that call upon him , to all that call upon him in truth . ' ' So the people of God may always expect to find it when , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of attending upon the public means of grace . But if they might attend upon those means , and neglect to do so , they need not expect the divine blessing . They may attempt to seek God at home , when they might , and ought , to be in the sanctuary ; but they will not find him . While they are thus slighting his ordinances he will turn a deaf ear to their prayer . /z/ Boston , December 31 ; 1815 . This is the last evening of the year .

But He , who has never , never left me in the season ot trial ; appeared ; and turned the darkness of night /z/ into the light of noon-day . I gave her up to him , and found it better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man , how were his everlasting arms put underneath and around me , and how adequate did I find them for my support .

The dear child , 1 think , very gradually , declines . Whether this complaint will terminate in death , or the total absence of reason , and how soon , God only knows . I feel a strong assurance that , whether she lives or dies , she is the Lord 's . And what is the chaff to the wheat , the body to the soul ? May I be living as if this world were not , as in fact it is not , my home . May you and I , and all our dear friends , by our enjoyments and our sufferings , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more say , ' I am sick ; ' where all tears shall be wiped away ; where sin shall be destroyed , and the saint be imbibing more and more , through eternity , the image of Him who is perfect .

But if I can suggest to you any new thoughts , I shall be very glad ; and expect the same friendly office from you in return . 1 begin to have my children /q/ io the room at prayers , within the month after their birth : and they always continue to be present unless they are sick , or are excluded the privilege as a punishment for having been very naughty . It is difficult , when they are quite young , to keep them perfectly still . But the habit of thinking they are too young to be present at family devotion , is a bad one . And besides , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain out with them , and is thus deprived of a precious privilege and an important means of grace . After they get to be two years , or more , old , and are able to understand the meaning of your conduct , if they play , or in any other way make a disturbance , they may be taken out , and compelled to remain by themselves till the service is over ; which will generally be felt by them to be so great a punishment , that they will not soon commit a similar offence . I would not do this , however , on every slight deviation from perfect order , as children can not be expected to conduct like men . As to government , I have always made it a rule never to give a child what it is passionately earnest to have lpwever proper the object may be in itself ; because , otherwise , an association would immediately be formed in the mind between importunity and success Were a child always told , when he cries for a thing , You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would soon teach him to be reasonable . I think it the destruction of government to be capricious , to refuse one day , what in circumstances not seen by the child to be different , is granted in another ; to let fretting and teazing carry a point at one time , when at another , they would bring punishment . Children very soon see whether we are consistent ; and little deviations from an established rule , afford great encouragement for the next time . These little deviations do great mischief , and are often slidden into ytry imperceptibly by the /z/ parent , thoufh the child is quick-sighted enough to observe them . One thing , my dear friend , I think of the greatest importance , and that is , that children be made always to mind , and consider the parent 's word as their law . Giving up once after a command has passed , may lay the foundation , and lead to the establishment , of a principle of insubordination as troublesome as unconquerable . For this reason , absolute commands should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with children in the way of command , saying do this or that , when you do not mean that the thing must be done . It weakens parental authority . I never like to tell very small ehildren to kiss strangers , as they often feel a degree of backwardness very difficult to overcome ; and if they refuse , it is necessary to pass it over without compelling obedience , which should not be , or to have a combat with them before the company , which hardens them to reproof . It is better to say , if a stranger offers to kiss them and they refuse , and it is thought best to say any thing , *Your kisses are of no great consequence , they may be dispensed with , I dare say . ' This leads the child to think he is not of so much importance as he might otherwise be led to suppose . It is also very necessary to good government that punishments should be proportioned to offences . If we make no distinction between intentional and complicated offences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurrence of these latter faults and the sharp rebukes they bring upon him , will become so accustomed to severe reproof that he will not mind it . Tenderness of heart is the most powerful human engine of parental government ; and when this is lost , it seems to me all is lost , unless the grace of God interposes . The inevitable consequence of frequent reproof is a heart blunted in its /z/ sensibilities , and unmoved by the parentis displeasure . Of course , all temptations should , as much as possible , be put out of the way of children . Many little things should not be observed , which , if you wer conscious the child knew you had observed , ought to be reproved . A harsh and angry ton  - -  should never be used , unless a gentle one has pre* viously failed . And I believe , where the authority of the parent is early established by the mild and gentle nneans , to some of which 1 have alludedi severe measures need be resorted to very seldom . TO A AT r . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Last summer I received a letter from you , and also a copy of the constitution of your MaternSil Association . The receipt of them would have been sooner acknowledged , had circumstances permitted . But I trust it is not now too late to do so , and express the satisfaction they afforded* Since then , a few ladies in Boston with some of whom you ar acquainted , have formed a similar association , and adopted the same constitution . I trust we have found them useful meetings , I ani sure they have been pleasant . The uncommon attention which is paid to the rising generation at the present day , is a token for good . It is truly aatonishing , however , that baptized children should , as such , be so sadly neglected by the eburches to which they belong , as they now are ; though it is a fact , which should be acknow- /z/ ledged with gratitude , that some churches have of late taken measures , as new as they are likely to be salutary , toward effecting a reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , I am willing to advise you as far as 1 am capable , though my knowledge upon the subject , whatever you may think , is extremely limited . Upon the whole , I give the preference to Locke and Witherspoon , above any other writers I am acquainted with , on the subject of education ; though they are not perfect . Some very few things in the latter appear to me unnecessary , and are perhaps impracticable . Miss Hamilton 's Letters are admirable , so far as they refer to the intellectual culture of the mind , and I may add to mere moral discipline . Her religious opinions are quite exceptionable ; but as they are not presented very prominently , are not likely to do much hurt , probably none to those whose minds are thoroughly imbued with correct principles . I scarcely know a writer that has suggested so many useful thoughts to my mind as Miss tiamil-. ton . I would by all means procure her Letters , if they can possibly be obtained . Miss Edgeworth I am neither so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . She writes , in my view , too much like a theorist ; some of her plans are quite visionary ; indeed , in this country quite impracti- /z/ * What the measures were to which Mrs. Huntington here alludes , the compiler is not informed . But , as the subject , though it has hitherto received little attention , is one of great importance , a brief account , it is presumed , will not be unacceptable to the reader , of a course of proceeding in relation to baptized children , which has been pursued with happy effect , in some churches in the middle and southern States .  --  Once a quarter , the baptized children , as such , are assembled , in the Church , with their parents or guardians . The children are placed together , in the body of the house : the parents and guardians are in the side pews , and , if more room is needed , in the gallery ; and the Pastor and Eiders before the pulpit . After singing and prater , the children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church is explained to them , their duties and obligations arc stated ; they are told that the vows of God are upon them , &c.; &c.; Then the /q/ aable . Her stories , however , evince an uncommon knowledge of the human mind . Mrs. Grant 's Intellectual Education I have seen , but can not say I was very much pleased with it . There are many useful hints in the work , but it is not so simple and practical as some others , and as such a work ought to be . There is a series of letters in the Christian Observer on the subject , I think in the 12th volume , which are uncommonly judicious . These helps , which God has afforded us , ought to make us more useful in our maternal capacity . They certainly call for gratitude . But , after aft , if we were better Christians , we should be more likely to make good mothers . Consistent , ardent piety , is the most essential qualification in a mother , for the proper education of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by any thing else ; and were our behaviour before them , at all times , circumspect , Christ-like ; did not the ebullitions of passion , the spirit of worldly-mindedness , and the love of selfish gratification , so often appear in our conduct , and utterly defeat our well-formed plans and good intentions , we should not so often have to complain , that we labour in vain , and spend our strength for nought . Alas ! in correcting the faults of our children , how many faults do we find to correct in ourselves ! Were it not that it is of God who sheweth mercy , there would be little encouragement indeed . But , blessed be his name ! there is encouragement sufficient to stimulate to the most unwearied exertion . And those who diligently sow Pastor addresses the parents and guardians , explaining and enforcing their peculiar duties , in the presence of their children . He then turns to the Elders , and addresses them in relation to the duties , in regard to baptized children and their parents , incumbent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exercises are then concluded with singing and prayer , and the apostolic benediction.  --  It is said , that where this course has been faithfully pursued for a series of years , a very large proportion of the baptized youth are hopefully pious , /z/ the seedyin humble dependanceon his blessing , shall doubtless , sooner or later , reap an abuniiant harvest . Our Association meets the same day with yours . We wish you always to remember us on those days , as we shall you , and other similar institutions ; and on all other occasions when it is proper . We need each other 's prayers . February 26 , 1817 . I never felt as if I had more cause for gratitude , than now ; every trial is so mercifully tempered . I enjoy the exhibitions of reason in my other children a thousand times more on account of dear Elizabeth 's situation . God is very gracious to me , even in respect to her . She seems to suffer but little , and is a sweet , quiet child . This heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can requite love so great with ingratitude , is , I think , my greatest trouble . I shall begin , the sixth of next month , which will be Elizabeth 's birth day , to observe a quarterly fast on her account . March 15 . Heaven looks very sweet . But I am sometimes led to fear , that such a vile creature , so little inclined to improve under the culture of the Gospel , can never enter it . Were the Christian religion a delusion , it would be the most blessed delusion that ever smiled on the heart of man . But it is not , it can not be , a delusion . Oh no : blessed be God ! there is an inheritance , incorruptible , undeiiled , and that fadeth not away , reserving in heaven for those who obey the calls of his word ; and their afflictions , however severe , shall all be made to work for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory . /z/ Saratoga Springs , June , 1817 . We have been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good , and Mr. Huntington 's /q/ evidently improving . We shall continue here a few days , and then set out for the Falls . In the SiDciety of such a place as this , a Christian , ivhile he finds much that is pleasant , sees many things that give him pain . To hear one complaining of sorrows , for which , we feel , there is a balm which he knows not of , and another regretting past disappointments , and vainly promising himself ample remuneration in future gratifications , when we know there is a hope sure and stedfast of which he is ignorant , without being able to speak of either , is revolt* ing to the spirit of philanthropy as well as of Christianity . He is the wise man who is able to seize the " time to speak , * ' and employ it properly . And it certainly argues a criminal indifference to the interests of our fellow creatures , or a deplorable fear of man , to be habitually and totally silent on those subjects , in suchcircumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the scale of religion ! Blessed be God ! the time is coming when this will be the case . This expectation gives joy to my heart . Especially , my dear Miss L. , I do earnestly desire that Boston may be visited with one of those vivifying and refreshing showers which cause the church to look forth fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners . No blessing of a temporal nature  --  the increase of corn , and wine , and posses sions , can be compared with it . This , if we are Christians , we must not only acknowledge , but feel . Lamentable inconsistency , that , feeling and acknowledging it , we do so little to effect it ! A few feeble desires avail nothing ; our desires are equal , and only equal , to our efforts , for in every thing else , we judge of the strength of desire by what is actually attempted . How then can we talk of desires for the advancement of true religion , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a spirit of earnest longing , and of efficient doing , might be poured out upon professors in that dear metropolis where God has cast our lot . /z/ Auburn , June 28 , 1817 . There has been a great deal of rain since we left home ; our journey has however been , on the whole , a pleasant one . My last letter was from Saratoga Springs , more than one hundred and fifty miles from this . We are surprised to find , how universally this State is peopled , upon this road . It is quite amusing to think , how little 1 was prepared to find a country , thirty years ago a wilderness , more generally settled than some parts of our own Slate , for instance , between Brookfield and Northampton . Thus far we have , every mile , seen cultivated lands , fine orchards , and good houses . Many of the buildings are constructed with a neat and simple elegance , which is very gratifying to the traveller . We have been much pleased with some of the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very fertile , and seems to promise a liberal return for the labours of the husbandman . We passed the settlement of the Oneida Indians yesterday . You recollect that Mr. Kirkland was formerly Missionary among them . Their present minister . is a Mr. Williams , who , I hear , is a very worthy man . It is curious to see , how scrupulously they adhere to their ancient dress and customs though in the midst of a civilized people . Auburn is quite a pretty village , something citylike in its appearance . Mr. Huntington has gone to call on the Presbyterian minister , while I am writing . /q/ We are told there is a revival in his congregation , and that his house is filled , on the sabbath , with anxiously attentive hearers . As to-morrow will be the sabbath , we expect to hear him preach , and see his congregation . Canandaigua July 2 , I intended to have finished my letter before , but could not . We were much pleased with the appearance of the congregation with which we worshipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently a work of the Spirit among them . Between forty and fifty have obtained hope , since the commencement of the revival . The subjects of the work are , as is usually the case , mostly young people . The minister seems to be much engaged . It was truly delightful to spend a sabbath in such circumstances . The roads have been so bad the last few days , that I feel quite fatigued , but hope I shall hold out to the end of our journey . How the hurried , noisy , and dissipated life some people lead , can be comfortable , I see not . Tranquillity is as necessary to my happiness , as bustle seems to be to theirs . A constant round of incidents and company , is very distressing to my mind . And , what is especially to be lamented , it is with great difficulty that I can , in such circumstances , keep up any savour of divine things . I have just received a letter from our beloved H. As cold water to a thirsty soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody , after all , like our dear folks at home . May God bless them and us , and make us all blessings to each other . I seem to love you better for this temporary separation . Pleasing is the hope of soon meeting you again . But how much more pleasant , how cheering , is the hope of meeting in heaven ! God forbid that any of us shofuld come short of it , /z/ Herkimer , July 18 , 1817 . I fear you have begun to think me rather remiss in acknowledging the receipt of your letter several ago . As I am certain , however , that you will not charge such remissness to the want of affection on my part , I shall only say , I have been going ixom one place to another so constantly , that I have been unable to write as frequently as I wished . Since my letter to Miss P. , from Canandaigua , we have been to the Falls , through Buffaloe ; and , I must  --  ay , have been more gratified than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a few exceptions , is delightful . The ride from Blackrock , on the Canada side , to the Falls , is on the banks of the Niagara river ; and this circumstance is sufficient to xnske it interesting . Add to this , that it was the seat of a considerable part of the last war , and you will readily believe that it must be highly interesting . We saw spots on the grass of deep green , fertilized with human blood , and bones unburied.  --  As to the Falls , I shall not hazard a description of them ; they are grand beyond description . Our journey has been a very pleasant one . We have been highly gratified with the appearance of things , in many parts of this State , in a religious point of view . We did not expect to see flourishing churches of two and three hundred members , and to behold the people flocking in erowds to the sanctuary , three times on the sabbath , in this wilderness , as we had considered it . In many places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was particularly interested in our visit at Geneva , a most beautifully situated village , sixteen miles this side of Canandaigua . The good people there , seemed to tfaink religion was in a dull and languid state among /q/ em . But I thought I found there a great deal of the very life and soul of it . Some of the ladies will , I hope , follow our example , and form a Maternal Association . At Buffaloe there is more than a usual attention to religion . Bufialoe is a delightfully situated place , on the bay , or whatever else it is called , where the waters of lake Erie enter the Niagara river . It is really very pleasant to see such a city-like place , grown up , as if by enchantment , on the extremity of our western frontier . There is but one house , a log one standing now , which survived the fire two years ago . The whole village beside was consumed . The people are still rather depressed by their late calamitiesy and have been somewhat straitened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive some remuneration for their losses from the government  --  Canandaigua is an elegant village there is scarcely a poor house in the place . Has any thing of consequence transpired among you , or any of the churches , since we left Boston ? Soon , I hope , we shall see our dear home . Oh that we might find such a time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord there , as has lately been experienced in some of the towns through which we have passed !  --  How are our dear little ones ? The Lord be their keeper , and preserve them from harm ! Write me all about them , and direct to Worcester , Remember me most afiectionately to all whom you know I love , and that is very many .

But I hope that God is dealing with you in covenant love ; and if so , all your trials will be the means of fitting you more perfectly for the kingdom of heaven . It is a great thing to grow better by sufiering . God sends judgments , upon his children , to wean them from the world and from sin , and to make them more like himself .

So long as Christians can pray , they may do more good in the world , than the greatest of unsanctified heroes and conquerors . And now , my dear mother , adieu .

Oh God of mercy ! let her mantle fall on t is who remain ! Let something of that meek , prayerful , holy , Christ-like , spirit , which distinguished her , be communicated to us , and abide with us continually ! Alas ! little did 1 think she was going to Charleston to find her grave .

I long to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that you are still enabled to say , This God is my God , and he will be my guide and portion until death . Dear , very dear mama , how it comforted my heart to be informed of the comfort which you received . God is faithful . He is a strong tower , into which the righteous runneth , and is safe . Trust in him ; and in every extremity , you will find him a sure and unfailing resting-place . Oh the blessedness of having God for our helper ! But we must keep near to him . If his children transgress and forsake him , he removes that light in which they live , and they are overwhelmed with sorrow . How much comfort do we lose by slackening our diligence in duty , and neglecting to watch against sin ? How oft has sin and Satan strove To draw my heart from him I love . And , alas ! how successfully , is the mournful language of every Christian . But , my dear mother , there is a world , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of victory shall never be interrupted by regrets and lamentaiionSy /q/ where progress in knowledge and bliss shall be rapid ; unceasing , and endless .

Oh ! keep heaven much in view . It will strengthen you to overcome those legions of corruptions , against which every Christian must fight till he dies . Be daily and hourly committing yourself to Him , who is mighty to save ; who can , who , if you look to him , certainly will , strengthen you , to resist every sin , endure every pain , and bear every trial , tp his glory .

My dear husband has been confined , about a fortnight , with a rheumatic fever . He is on the recovery , but is very weak When he was first seized , I think , I felt it a pleasant thing to glorify God , in just that course of his providence which he should appoint , and that my present business was , cheerful acquiescence in his will , and an humble and faithful performance of the duties immediately resulting froni this affliction .

And we do hope , we think not without reason , that there will soon be seen here , an increase of real Christianity , more remarkable than has been experienced in Boston for a long time .  --  What is the state of things in N.

I do not much wonder that some persons , seeing the bitterness of such religionists against each other , should be led to think there is nothing in religion .

The stroke has fallen ; and we are without a parent . But the Psalmist says , *'When my father and my mother forsake me , then the Lord will take me up. - ' Oh to be taken up , to be adopted , taken 4nto God 's family ; to have him exercise over us the endearing , the watchful , the vigilant attention and care of an omniscient and almighty Parent ! But in order to this , something is necessary on our part . As God promises to be the husband only of the ' ' widow indeed , " so be promises to be the father only of the orphan indeed ; of those who , disclaiming all other dependance , fly to him , through Jesus Christ , as their best , their only portion ; who feel the vanity of all human helpers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who manifest their attachment by a hatred of sin , which he hates , by a pursuit of the holiness he enjoins , by a life of unreserved obedience to his law . For how can we love God , if we are careless of " * Children of her mother ; but not of her father . /z/ offending him ? How can we , for a moment , think we love him , if we allow ourselves in any thing he hates ? " This is the love of God , that we keep his commandments . He that saith , I know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him ' My dear sisters , can we , with these passages of Scripture before us , appeal to our Master and future Judge , as Peter did , and say , " Lord ! thou knowest all things , thou knowest that I love thee ?

Is it so , my beloved sisters ? Dust and ashes , pollution and guilt as we are , does the infinite Jehovah allow us to indulge such a hope as this ! And can we live in sin ? Can we live without panting after grace to glorify Him much , from whom we have received all ? Can we go on , day after day , and month after month ; doing nothing for his glory , for his cause , for his people ? Time flies . We are drawing near eternity .

And , oh ! my heart is full while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life pleasant in the retrospect , to give calmness and serenity to the dying hour , to make eternity happy ? What are we doing , which evinces our hope to be that which maketh not ashamed , and which will receive the Master 's gracious reward ? These are inquiries in which we are all deeply concerned .

January 18 , 1818 . Since writing last in my journal , Mr. Huntington has so far recovered as to go to New London , and I have heard the mournful tidings of my dear mother 's death . My mind was very deeply affected by this event at first ; and I fel that my only refuge was that strength of my Almighty Saviour , for which I have so often pleaded , with particular reference to these distressing providences . I think I felt that his grace supported me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamentation , not for the death of another friend , but for my sins .

Especially a spirit of selfishness , which creeps into all my duties and desires , poisoning and polluting all , has been to-night , extremely distressing . My heart is pained within me for deliverance . This temper is as opposite to the temper of heaven , as ary thing that can be supposed . It is the prolific parent , from which proceed the murmurings and envyings , the strife and debate , the whisperings and backbitings , and the nameless host of evil passions , which distract the world and agonize the people of God . In my own case the outward manifestation has been graciously prevented ; but God knows , how like a fierce lion , though bound I humbly hope , it has been raging in my heart , and striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered ? Yes , if I ever reach heaven . How inexpressibly delightful is the prospect ! Blessed God , let me not come short of this rest . /z/ 17 . I feel an ardent desire to redeem the time more faithfully . The greater part of my past life looks like a miserable waste of this precious talent . How little that was purely religious have I done ! Though my life has been active , alas ! it has not been active for God . I long to reduce my religious principles to a system , that shall make them bear upon all that I do . This would not be so extremely difficulty if my heart was right . Oh ! when will the time come , that I shall do more faithfully the work to which Ood has called me ? When shall I have a constant reference to divine things , in the daily round of my duties ? 21 .

March 9. 1 have heard a remark to-day respecting myself , calculated to give , and which has actually given , me pain . It was , that I could not bear to be contradicted . I am sincerely desirous to profit by this observation . I hope it will not be lost . I pray God to enable me to improve by it I want to feel a noble . Christian superiority to human opinion , when it clashes with duty , infringes upon the /claims of my Master , or is , in any way , a snare to ' me in my progress heavenward . And I long , when Xhere is any ground for the strictures which others make upon me , to be enabled to turn them to profit , to draw honey from the bitter dreg , to redouble my watchfulness over myself .

It is a common remark , that the characters of men are , for the most part , pretty justly appreciated ; that the decisions which are passed upon them , by the great tribunal of public opinion , are , usually , a safe standard for the formation of private judgment . This may be true in general ; and yet , I am inclined to think , there are many exceptions to the rule . A MRS . SUSAN HTrnTINGTOir. 169 man may have the reputation of being generous . And why ? Because , in a few showy and popular instances , he has been so ; while his private life , may have been marked with all the bitterness of a mean and parsimonious economy . The world are apt to judge of a man 's character by a few splendid acts , or lamentable miscarriages . This is especially the case with those , who are not accustomed to follow the man , with the accuracy of a discriminating observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection has subsided , and see what he is there . I think it can never be pressed too earnestly upon the young , that character is not what a person does , or is , once a year , or once in half a dozen years , but what he is and does habitually . A very generous man may , from mistake , or from some other cause , do what will appear the excess of littleness . A very meek man may , from the pressure of perplexing circumstances , get so much off his guard , as to utter things unadvised and improper , which he would weep tears of blood to recal . A very humble man may be placed , by the imputation of charges which he knows to be false , in a situation so irksome , as to induce him to defend himself , with a tone and manner , entirely foreign from the general disposition and habit of his mind . Now these striking overt acts , are often those which are laid hold of by the world , and determine its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be early taught , to distinguish between appearances and realities ; else they will be continually in danger of adopting the egregious follies and palpable corruptions of persons , whose few splendid virtues may have excited their admiration , and of avoiding an acquaintance with persons the most worthy , because a few weaknesses or ioconsistencies , appearing in their behaviour , have produced disgust . Nothing , in such a world as this , can be more foolish than to /z/ ; renounce a friend , because we have found him to be imperfect . I Jlpril 4 . I have lately had many fears that my heart has never been thoroughly humbled , that I have never been made to see the righteousness of God in threatening eternal punijhment as the reward of sin , especially of my sins . I fear I have never seen the real desert of sin . This I esteem exceedingly important . 1 am apprehensive that though many say they feel that they deserve everlasting misery , it is often an inconsiderate assent to a generally acknowledged truth , rather than an inwrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have my mind more enlightened on this subject .  --  Yet , the government of God appears to me , a most righteous , holy , wise , benevolent , and perfect government . 1 think I rejoice in it . If I do not , I can not say what 1 rejoice in. 1 think I see and feel , that the blessed Grod could not , consistently with the honour of his law and the tirelfareof hiVkingdom , take the sinner to heaven in an unsanctified state . The idea of never obtaining the rest that remaineth for the people of God , of never being conformed to the image of my Saviour , is heart-rending . I have not taken up my rest in this world . I do long for holiness , for the holy employments and joys of heaven . In giving up the hope of being made complete in the likeness of God , it seems to me , that I should give up all that makes life supportable. 8 . The case of our dear church and people has kin upon my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own children .

You ask how I like Cecil 's Remains . Much , foe the most part . But there appears to have been something of severity in his character , something more of the determined scholar , than the amiable Christian . I am not pleased with his remarks upon my sex . This , you will say , is a matter of course . However , if I am not deceived , I object to his insinuations , not as a woman , but as a Christian , as a member of God 's universal family , and as a friend to the interests of both sexes ; having , I humbly believe , Thtf eztraot wm published in the Bofton Recorder of Juae % , 1818. 16$ KEMOmS OF learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose breath is in his nostrils , and to feel that if any one would be honourable in God 's view , he must be willing to become nothing . In his remarks on the marriage of Ministers , Mr. Cecil says , ' A Minister must stand on his own ground when associating with women , and not descend to mingle among them/ ' Thought is the characterizing feature of men , and feeling of women . " By the first remark , does Mr. C. intend to say , that a Minister must not bring himself to a level with the giddy , the volatile , the thoughtless , of our sex ? Or does he mean that all women are so ? My opinion has been , that , by cultivating habits of rational intercourse between the sexes , the real good of both parties would be promoted ; that the men would become more social and refined , without losing their strength , and the women more sound , without losing their gentleness . Is not the tendency of the above remarks likely to be unfavourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of men , an overweening opinion of their own importance , a loftiness of spirit , contrary to the temper of the meek and lowly Jesus , and inimical to the growth of religion in the soul ? Are they not likely to be equally deteriorating in their influence on the female mind ? Will not the woman infer that , if the case be so , it is not necessary for her to cultivate her mental powers ; that she may as well confine her views and her thoughts , so far as she thinks at all , to that contracted sphere comprehended under that general term self as to endeavour to expand her benevolence by enlarging her knowledge ? Will she not be in danger of becoming the despicable slave of a morbid sensibility which she has not learnt to controul , by being told that she was made for feeling rather than reflection ? Alas ! how can woman , subject to the accu- /z/ mulated vexations of outward temptation and con8ti tutionai frailty , be expected to endure the evils of life with firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enervate the energies of the mind , induce loose habits of thinking , and undermine the government of reason ? But the chief objection I have to Mr. Cecil 's remarks on this suMect is , that they are calculated to deprive women of that respect in their own families , which is necessary to the proper management of . children . Now this I deem of incalculable importance . Let the sons of a family lose their respect for their mother , and it will be utterly impossible for a substitute for natural authority to be found . I do not hesitate to say , ( and I do not say it rashly , or without much examination of the subject , ) that those families , where the character of the mother is depressed to that of a mere housekeeper , are never ' well governed ; and that , on the contrary , the sons of those mothers , whose rank in the family authorises them to be the counsellors of their children , are in childhood more amiable , and in manhood more worthy , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers , they must necessarily be left very much to their own guidance , and exposed to early associations unfriendly to virtue . Their characters will be mostly formed by the influence of adventitious circumstances ; unless , indeed , the father can oversee them constantly , which is rarely the case . The father requires the boy to obey his mother , and perhaps gives him long lessons on the subject ; but of how much weight they will be , in turning the scale between duty and inclination , when the child sees that the father does not respect her himself , it requires but little sagacity to conjecture . The habit of trifling , of dissimulation , and of rebellion , is thus acquired ; and , if grace effects an alteration in the state of the heart afterwards , it cer- /z/ tainly operates under circumstances unfavourable to its growth . There is also another evil resulting from the opin ion above stated . It is the interruption of domestic peace . Such an opinion introduces pride and pertinacity , and imperiousness , on the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among brothers and sisters ; and , in this way , is destructive of the best principles and affections of our nature . There are those who think , that if women are treated as equals , they will aspire to dominion , or will not " be in subjection , with reverence , ' ' to their husbands . I am of a contrary opinion . We can never yield unwillingly , when we think the duty of doing so is unquestionable . But we always give with the worst grace , what is extorted . We are always the most generous , when left free . The eii*-lightened obedience of a sensible woman is consistent , because it is the dictate of reason ; it is seen to be necessary , in the constitution of things , and for the preservation of order in the various departments of the creation of God . The capricious subjection of a weak and ill-informed woman , is that of a slave ; and , not being properly conceived of , in the first place , is likely to be disputed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more idle than to dispute the point of equality with our brethren . Time is too short to waste in this way . And besides , by society at large , every individual will , generally , be respected in proportion to his merits . If we would have influence , we must prove , in the first place , that we deserve it . But every one in his order . The moment a woman steps out of her proper sphere , she ceases to be , in proportion to her deviation from the path prescribed her , either amiable or respectable . And , in my judgment , were women blessed with an enlightened education and taught to view /q/ the subject of female subordinatioD in a philosophical and scriptural way . they would , not only be much greater helpers and blessings to their husbands and children , but in much less danger of usurping that authority which God and nature have delegated to the other sex . /z/ New Haven , My 21 , 1818 .

But , though 1 fear the state of my mind is not more distinguished by the grace of faith than when I left Boston , I do not feel the same anxious solicitude about my family which 1 did then . The mind , I suppose , can not be strongly exercised on one subject , when it is constantly and powerfully ajBected by many separate and remote interests . I have been passing so rapidly from one scene to and other , and have felt so many different emotions , since I left home , that I have scarcely had an opportunity to be anxious . While I was at New London , my time was entirely occupied with attentions to our sick father ; and since 1 left that place , I have been scarcely less engaged .

I will not say , New Haven friends were never so dear to me as now . That were idle . But I may say , that I feel an awakened interest in them -t present , which a long separation from them had , perhaps , somewhat blunted . I think an occasional visit to a place we have once loved , and which is the residence of early friends , is desirable , to keep alive , if not the enthusiasm of youthful attachments , those warmer endearments of the heart , by which it discriminates some places , and some persons , from the rest of the world . f have been thinkiipg , my dear friend , about the weakness of your eyes . I am sorry you should be tried in this way upon your first setting out in life . And yet , if you are a Christian , God loves you infinitely better than I do ; and he might prevent it , if he chose .

But , if they ripen us for a place at God 's right hand , it is well While we can look at the things which are not seen and eternal , every burden will be lightened , every sorrow sweetened . If we are Christians , we are passing through a wilderness to heaven ; and though God may give us many precious comforts here , it is but a wilderness still .

But he is again worse ; and Mr. Huntington has been again called to him , and is now there . I am expecting every day , either to hear that his father is mending , or to receive a summons to New tiondon . I have been , somewhat dejected in mind , of late , from another cause .

Now , when labouring with grief , and , at times ready to sink , the precious truths of the Gospel are sometimes sent to my mind , for my relief , with arn efficacy altogether superior to any other sources of consolation . I pillow my aching head on its precious promises , and I find rest . Oh my Ood , why dost thou thus fly to my relief ? Why , wretch that I am ! am I not left to my idols ?

There is scarcely a more mortifying subject of contemplation , than the littleness of the sum total of human greatness , compared with the capacity of man . The vast majority of our race , waste their powers in the pursuit of objects , which have little or no reference to the improvement of their intellectual and moral nature . While the man of mere business is pursuing , with a zeal worthy of the Christian 's imitation , schemes of personal emolu* ment , his mind , constantly employed within the contracted sphere of pecuniary and interested calcu lations , becomes almost incapable of taking a free and extensive range of observation . Like the limb enfeebled by want of exercise , it shrinks from every unusual effort ; and the disposition to mental exertion declines , as it is found to be laborious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cultivation of the mental faculties ; yet most possess advantages which , duly improved , /z/ might have advanced them higher in the scale of human greatness , than they are . The daily occurrences of life , furnish an infinite variety of occasions , upon which the wise may seize as means of improvement . The difficulty is , not so much in not having such means , as in the want of the ability , or the disposition , to profit by them . To teach us how to do this , how to seize upon , and turn to the best account , every means of improvement with which we are furnished by Providence , is , or ought to be , the great end of education . Whatever we have learned , if we have not learned to ihink so as to be able to advance ourselves in knowledge , by the judicious deductions of reason in reference to our daily circumstances , the most important of all knowledge is wanting , that of knowing how to educate ourselves . And if the mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be brought to think at all . How important then , that mothers should make the communication of ideas their principal object in instructing their children ; and that they should encourage in them a becoming curiosity to know the reasons and uses of things , and induce them to exercise their judgments upon what they have learned . To accomplish these designs , in reference to our children , is indeed , no easy task . But are not the benefits to be derived from their accomplishment of importance enough , and is there not sufficient ground to hope for success , to constitute a claim to more attention , and eSori , and prayer , in reference to them , on the part of mothers , than they commonly receive ? 18 . Pride has been my constant foe , ever since I have hoped 1 had begun the Christian race , and I fear it ever will be . Once , when I was the mere child of fiction , and romance , my ambition was to distinguish myself by poetizing , and shining as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some /q/ sharp lessons , my great desire was to be a good , plain , common sense woman ; a good wife , good mother , good mistress , good Christian . But pride besets me still . Tet I do hope , that I have lately learned some humbling lessons ; been made to feel my dependance on God for the exercise of reason , and to receive it daily as a fresh gift at his hand . I do hope pride has appeared more odious to me , more detestable , ungrateful , and abominable , ' of late , than ever before . Oh that my reason may be used for God , and if it is used thus successfully , that the consciousness of my infinite obligations to Him , who continues the faculties he gave , may keep me perfectly humble . I want to be clothed with humility . Vain man ! What arrogance to talk of having a mind that will not yield to despair ! Let thy God drop , for a moment , the hand ' ; which sustains thy reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 , 1818 . You will be pleased to learn , that our Christian community is becoming more deeply interested in favour of the Jevys , than it has been heretofore . Two Missionaries are expected to sail in the spring , on an exploring expedition to Jerusalem . Their object is , to ascertain what encouragements exist to the establishment of a missionary station there . It is believed that they will be found sufficient to justify such a measure . All the information we receive respecting the Jews , both in Asia , and in Europe , seems to indicatej most clearly , that the present is a time in which they are expecting something remarkable , in a political and religious view , to be done for their nation . Nothing seems to give such a spring to missionary exertion , as an increased attention to the /z/ Jews , for we know that their ingathering will be as life from the dead to the Gentiles . Park Street Church and ours , have agreed to unite in the observance of the Monthly Concert of Prayer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of one of these Missionaries to Jerusalem . Both churches have also determined , severally , to educate , at least one young man for the ministry , agreeably to the plan proposed in the pamphlet , entitled The claims of 600,000,000 of Heathen . ' Can not you educate one in your church ? Try . /z/ Boston , January 22 ; 1819 . No , my dear friend , I shall not ' be tired of your complaints ; ' though I may be pained by your compliments . To be told that we are clever , &c.,; may be gratifying to our pride , at the same time that it occasions uneasiness , because we know that it is not true . As to our respective management of our children , you see all your own short-comings , and I see mine , at least some of them . I suppose each of us thinks , that , were our faithfulness weighed in the balance , the scale would preponderate in favour of the other . But it is a great comfort that there is One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who knows all our weaknesses , and discouragements ; and who has said , ' ' If any man lack wisdom , let him ask of God , who giveth liberally , and upbraideth not . ' * Our discouragements often result from the belief that our difficulties are peculiar to ourselves . If we could only see the conflicts of others , we should often find that their struggles were as painful as our own . Perhaps they away not be called to contend with precisely the same things that we are ; but , if their /q/ difficulties be of a totally different kind from ours they are not on that account the less formidable . For myself , I often feel as if there could not be an individual of our weak and sinful race more feeble , more helpless , more unable to stand the smallest trial , than I am . These are sad hours . But they may be profitable ones . It is a sweet reflection that He , with whom we have to do , will not break the bruised reed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as our moral ones . Yes , he knovveth our frame , he remembereth that we are dust . The great cause of our getting on so heavily seems to me to be , that we are weak in faith . Would we quietly receive the allotments of God 's providence , would we patiently wait for the intimations of his will , would we unreservedly surrender all our interests into his hands , how much happier should we be . There would still be sin to grieve us , to be sure ; but a strong faith , though it would not diminish our contrition for our sins , and our concern on account of the sins of others , would takeaway much of their bitterness . The tears of godly sorrow , would not so often be mingled with the sighs of despondency ; and the restlessness and anxiety of our hearts , now such obstacles to a state of satisfaction with the government of God , would yield to an humble persuasion that he will do all things well . Oh , my friend , in saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am the peraon who has more need , perhaps , to pray , Lord , increase my faith ! than any one else . As to ( he subject of your strong and reasonable solicitude , remember that the hearts of all men are in the hands of the Lord , and he can turn them as the rivers of water are turned . God can work without any human instrument ; he can make the languor of debility , and the agonies of disease , effectual /z/ 1S6 MEM0IB9 or /z/ teachers and schoolmasters , to bring men to Christ . And he often does . Your desire and anxious concern for the conversion of this dear friend , are rational and proper , so far as they stimulate you to fervency and wrestling in prayer on his account . But if this desire and concern pass over these bounds , if they lead to an anxious state of mind , which enfeebles your health , interrupts your confidence in God , and thus unfits you to pray and labour , either for him , or yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it not become a hindrance and a snare ? It is a difficult case , I know . But your gracious God , on whose kind arms you have hitherto been so mercifully borne , will , even in this trial , put the song of salvation and praise into your lips , and give you the soul you long for ; or , if he withholds the evidence of this , he will quiet your heart as that of a weaned child . Be not dismayed . God is a rock , his way is perfect . You say you are easily disheartened ' . And do you not think others are so , as well as yourself ? Alas ! many have been the times that , after my little flock had gone to bed , I have shed bitter tears over the miscarriages and mistakes of the day . I feel that I am not faithful , as I should be , to improve opportunities of doing good in my family , of recommending religion to its members , especially the children . I think we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may be enabled to seize , with wisdom , every opportunity of doing good that may offer through the day . I do remember Wednesday evening . These seasons have sometimes been very precious to me . This text has been on my mind very sweetly of late , *I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring . /z/ * On this evening she and her correspondent had agreed to make MLch other 's children the special subject of their secret prayers . /q/ I feel , my dear friend , as if God will have respect unto his covenant 9 and choose the seed of his people as a generation to serve him . I want to have this promise fulfilled all the world over ; and I hope it will be before long . Perhaps , if Christian parents are faithful , the millennium will be introduced in this way . And if this be the case , is it not a privilege to be a mother in this day , when there is so great and comforting a prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crown ? March 4 . I have been in a poor state of health of late . I am now better , but still feeble . Though afflicted , I have experienced much of the Lord 's goodness in my illness . Oh , yes ; he is always faithful . I can only bear record against myself . 1 think I have , at times , felt my Saviour near me ; tasted the sweetness of his love , and the fulness of his salvation . Death has , at times , looked to me sweet , as the harbinger of eternal peace , of unmingled holiness . One day , when I was very much disordered at my breast , the prospect of living seemed to be received by me almost with reluctance . Oh what a glorious prospect has the Christian before him ! How precious are the consolations of religion in this world ! And what joys in reversion ! Yes , my Saviour , rivers of pleasure are at thy right hand ; and thy love is sweeter than all the enjoyments of millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I was when my health was better ; because I feel , ( if I am not deceived , and I believe I am not , ) so much more of the blessed influence of religion . Before I was so feeble , I felt as if I must be brought nearer to God . I prayed that I might be drawn near , and kept near , to him : if it could be done only by bringing me low , that I might be brought low . Any means seemed welcome , if the end could only be effected . And my prayer was soon answered . /z/ Boston , March 14 , 1819 , Dear Madam . Your letter of Feb. 9th , to the Maternal Association of Boston , came safe to hand . The expressions of Christian affection toward us , which it contained , could not fail to be gratifying . The apostle well understood the treacherous nature of the human heart , when he exhorted Christians to stir up the gift of God within them for mutual edification . Christians often need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as *'iron sharpeneth iron , so a man sharpeneth the countenance of a friend . ' The subject of your letter , the religious education of our children , is indeed one of the greatest importance . While , on the one hand , we would avoid the error of those who think education can do every thing ; we certainly are authorized to conclude , from the whole tenor of revelation , that , with the blessing of God , it may do much . The question then , what is a religious education ? becomes one of the deepest interest Is it to have our children baptized , and initiated into a knowledge of the general principles of Christianity ? Is it to make them attend upon the regular administration of the word , to catechise them , to remind them of the greatness of their obligations to become holy , and set before them the terrors of the Lord , that we may persuade them to flee from the wrath to come ? All this we undoubtedly ought to do . But all this we may do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never too earnestly press upon ourselves the conviction , that education is not what we teach our children in detached periods of time , when we are giving them special instruction , or explaining to them revealed truths ; but what we teach them by the silent , but /q/ ever-influencing , language of our general example . The mother who recommends religion , in her formal instructions to her children , as a thing of the first importance , while , in her own case , it is habitually driven into a corner ; who urges on her children , the supreme desirableness of laying up treasures in heaven , while her dearest ones are evinced , by her conduct , to be on earth ; who insists on the excellence and importance of meekness , patience , and charity , while she is no way remarkable for the exercise of these graces herself ; who descants on the vanity of the world , while she is seen to be a slave to its opinions and fashions ; can hardly expect much success from her labours . But , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occasion to confess to our God , and perhaps , sometimes , to acknowledge to our children , that the evil which we would not , that we do ; it should inspire us with courage that we have an High Priest who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities , and who is able to prevent the influence of unallowed miscarriages on the minds and hearts of our little ones . If there be a prevailing desire , and a settled purpose and endeavour , to walk before our house with a perfect heart , may we not indulge the humble hope , that our accidental mistakes , or occasional deviations , from the path of duty , shall not separate his mercy from us and our children ? The kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed into the ground ; and should sleep , and rise night and day ; and the seed should spring and grow The reader will find some very judicious remarks on this most important topic , in the Life of Dr. Scott , author of the Family Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastoral Address of itub General Association of Connecticut , in 1822 , published in the Christian Spectator for that year , at p. 491 .

For the earth bringclh forth fruit of herself first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear . ' Here is the sure word for encouragement . The husbandman , who casts his seed into the bosom of the earth , waits in quiet expectation of the harvest . He plants , he waters , he removes carefully the young weeds which appear and endanger the growth of the grain ; and , usually , he does not labour in vain . So is the kingdom of God , or his word in the heart . And , in due season , we may expect to reap , if we faint not .

The disease may be protracted , there may be many relapses ; but we must not therefore conclude that it is incurable and remit , our eJSTorts to save its unhappy victim . We are apt to be impatient to enjoy now the fruit of our prayers and tears . And to desire that our little ones may be early brought into God 's covenant , is certainly proper .

We all fall into errors and inadvertencies in this world ; and it is as necessary that we should learn the painful lessons of our ignorance of what is right , and of our great impotence in doing it , as other lessons more pleasant . The great thing is , to be made better by them all . You see , my dear girl , that innocent , or at least , comparatively innocent , actions , sometimes subject us to great censure ; and that from persons whom we dearly love .

We had yesterday , one of the most tremendous and awful thunderstorms I ever witnessed . It seemed as if all the elements were mingling and melting together . It had been preceded by a few /z/ days of most oppressive heat . Four barns were struck in this Parish ; a meeting house in the adjacent one , and four men who were working in it laid senseless , but revived soon enough to extinguish the flames which had communicated to the shavings . I felt quiet and composed , for I realized that Jehovah was riding upon the tempest and directing the storm . I was sensible that the danger was great , and my mind was rendered solemn .

It would have given me great pleasure , my dear sister , to have spent some weeks with you this summer , had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had I been able to take such a journey . But the goodness of God to me is very apparent in so disposing my circumstances , at the time of my dear husband 's departure , as to prevent my thinking of such a visit this season . I could not have borne the fatigue of the journey ; and the reports of yellow fever in Boston , so vague as they would have reached me at New London , would have occasioned me inexpressible uneasiness . I have not been without my anxieties here . I brought S.* with me when I came out . About a fortnight ago , I heard that S. A.t had been sick , and sent for her ; and yesterday I learnt that little M.t was seized on Saturday night , so violently /z/ as to endanger her life . Through the mercy of God , the dear child has recovered but I expect to send for her also to-morrow . I felt last night , as if I had 80 much more reason to be thankful to my heavenly Father for sparing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did lay his hand upon her , that the intelligence of her sickness was made very light to me . Upon every fresh trial , I feel more and more astonished at my own declensions , which make the stroke necessary ; and at the patience of God , which will continue to undertake , by mercies and judgments , the preparation , of so unmeet a subject , for heaven . It is easy to talk about the vanity and folly of earthly attachments and dependencies . But the Christian must be brought to an habitual , practical determination to have no other god but Jehovah . He must be brought to say , in the deepest sincerity of his soul . The dearest idol T Bave known , Whate'er that idol be , Help me to tear it fVom its throne ! And there is no doubt , that most of the trials of the people of God , are sent for the accomplishment of this very end . It is no easy matter , with such earthly hearts , and surrounded by earthly objects , and cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance in spiritual-mindedness . But , without this , we are not warranted to hope we are Christians , we can not expect to be partakers of the heavenly inheritance . As to the reports of sickness in Boston which you have heard , there can be no doubt that it has been very sickly there . The whole number of deaths , from various causes , the last week was twenty-five . The fever has been checked , since the commencement of the present coldness of the weather . /q/ If it can be so consistently with the wise purpose of Jehovah , 1 most earnestly desire this weather may continue . But I want a heart to feel such en  - -  tire satisfaction with God 's government as shall keep me in perfect peace . To view the subject so as to weep with those that weep , to long that the impenitent , who are sick , may not be driven away in their wickedness , and to desire , more intensely , that the judgment may be sanctified , than that it may be removed , is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed . I received a letter yesterday from my dear husband . He was , when he wrote , just about to leave Montreal for Quebec . He says he has been much gratified with his journey , and that his health is much improved . I hope he will not return before the middle of September ; but I fear that , when he has turned his face homeward , he will hurry as fast as possible . /z/ Bridgewaier , August 25 , 1819 . I hope , my dear Mrs. , you , and all the good people of the Old South , have been pleased with the preaching you have had since Mr. Huntington left home . I think that yesterday , and the preceding sabbath , you could not fail to be gratified . But after ally ordinances will be barren and unprofitable to us , however well administered , unless the God of ordinances meets with us in them . I believe I lose more , by neglecting a due preparation for religious duties , than in any other way . God will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his ordinances , io a spiritual sense , delightful and profitable . The word must be sanctified by ( aith and prayer , and then it will be a word in season . /z/ How are your niece and daughter ? I liope they experience a growing determination to endeavour to secure the pearl of great price  --  the safety of the soul , whatever else may be lost . The day is fast approaching , when all will be felt to be a dream , a bubble , without the durable riches of the Christian . Nothing else which we may acquire , can be retained when we enter the eternal world . And , may I not say , nothing else can ensure us happiness in the present world ? for The spiders most attenuated thread Is cord ; is cable , to man 's slender hold On earthly bliss .

I am distressed at my want of faith . The yellow fever has been in Boston since I have been here . There were eleven deaths by this disease , on Friday and Saturday of last week . I hear that my dear husband will probably be at home on Monday , and that , from travelling rapidly , he is much fatigued . I fear he is sick . If he is not , he will be exposed to the fever , when he reaches home . Oh for faith , to leave him with God ! My very heart sinks in prospect of his falling a sacrifice to disease . September I. I have reason to think my beloved husband actually is sick . I have only heard that be /q/ is fatigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in the stage to-day . Oh that 1 may find things better than I fear . /z/ Groton , September 9 , 1819 . This has been a trying day . My dear husband is very low . How this distressing fever wilJ terminate , God only knows . The prospect is very discouraging . Oh , that we may all be prepared for whatever is preparing for us . I feel as if I had never been afflicted till now . But the Judge of all the earth will do right . I want to feel that all is safe while he governs . The apprehensions expressed in the above extract were soon realized . Mr. Huntington died , at Groton , between twelve and one o'clock , on Saturday , September 11 , 1819. 0n the succeeding Monday the mortal remains were interred in Boston , with appropriate exercises , and great solemnity . A sermon was delivered on the occasion , by the Rev. Mr. Dwight , * in the Old South Church ; where an immense concourse was assembled , to express their interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished worth . The clergy of Bos* ton and the vicinity , the members of the church and congregation of which the deceased had been pastor , and a multitude of other acquaintances and friends , united with the bereaved family and relations in deploring their common loss , while they praised God for the bright example of Christian virtue which /z/ they had witnessed . The spacious house of worship where the last sad offices were performed , was so crowded , that many hundreds tried in vain to obtain admittance . The tokens of unaffected mourning were so numerous , and so impressive , that it could not be doubtful in what high and affectionate estimation the character of the departed minister and friend , was held. * " In relation to the state of Mrs. Huntington 's mind , under this heavy trial , an intimate friend , who was constantly with her , during the first week after her husband 's death , observes , in a letter to the compiler , written March 1 , 1824 , *There was , in her whole deportment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the divine will .

I remember asking her , on the day succeeding the death of Mr. Huntington , if it required an effort to be submissive . She answered , M am enabled to bless God , that I have not had to contend with an unbelieving thought . I would rather have endured the agony of separation , than that my dear husband should have borne it . I can truly say , ' T is the survivor dies ' ' 0n another occasion she said to me , The bitterness of my grief can be known only to God and my own soul . But I think I can say .

What the Church has lost , in his eminent consecration of himself to his work , his love to the poor , his compassion to the afflicted , his meekness and humility , his zeal and disinterestedness , his fervent prayers , his lovely and almost spotless example , God knows .

My dear sister .. My health continues comfortable . My spirits are better than could have been expected . Should I live , I think of spending next summer in the country , perhaps at A. Where God may then call me , 1 know not . I wish to feel myself entirely at his disposal , to live one day at a time ; and to believe that , when the period comes for determining in what place I shall pass the remnant of my days , my kind Parent will direct me . That place may be Boston ; it may be in Connecticut ; or it may be some where else . God knows , and with him I leave it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . But my children have other interests besides pecuniary ones ; interests which the parent on earth and the Parent in heaven , view as most important . Where , upon the whole , I judge these interests will be best promoted , there 1 shall go . The Old South Society have been very generous . They have voted to give me , tfie use of the parsonage-house , all my wood , and the salary , for one year from the first of this month ; and one thousand dollars a year , for six years , commencing Oct. 1 , 1820 . So you see , comfortable provision is made for us for the next seven years . And more than this , for I shall be able , I trust , to save something each year against the future . At any rate , I must , if possible . live on the thousand dollars . That , I suppose , would be an ample support in N. L. But this is f04 MEMOIRS OF an after consideration .

For the most Eart , I can cheerfully leave futurities with him , humly hoping that he will enable me to glorify him , wherever I am , and however I am . This is the great point And when I leave all , quietly , to Him who , with the gift of his Son , will most certainly , give his children all things best for them , I am happy . October 14 . Thus fiff the Lord has led me on . He has been better to me than my fears . I have fTeat comfort in my children . God has very mereiully provided for my temporal wants . I have cause to mourn only my own sinfulness . Heaven does not look so near to me as it did . I have come back , in some measure , to earth . The wound bleeds ; and will , while life lasts , continue to bleed ; but the first anguish is exchanged for suffering , as real , butless intense . The restless agony of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the tears and groans of a heart alive to sorrow , while the senses are slumbering , have , in a great measure , ceased . But I mourn . My precious husband is dearer than I ever knew him to be in life . Oh my Saviour ! make me diligent and faithful in thy service ; and when thou hast done with me here , let me live with him in thy presence forever ! TO A rEIBND AT B. Boston , October 2G , 1819 . In relation to my troubles , I wrote to you in  --  , and gave you particulars ; but it seems you did not /q/ receive my letter . I will only say at present , that I have suffered beyond expression , and , on the other hand , God 's wonderful grace has stayed my soul with the strong aid of his promises ; so that as ' my sufferings have abounded , my consolations also have abounded by Christ Jesus . At present , my chief desire is to glorify God , and my chief cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my bitter , persevering , specious , malignant enemy , the foe which I most dread , the greatest disturber of my peace . When , at any season , my soul is taken near to my Saviour , and satisfied from his fulness , this treacherous and cruel foe steps in , and beguiling me from my refuge and my resting-place , leads me far from his presence which is life , and from the manifestations of his love which are better than life . Oh ! when shall these wanderings be healed ; when shall I love and serve Him , whom I do believe my soul loveth , as I ought ; when shall I be satisfied with his likeness ; when shall sin be bruised under my feet ? Dear Mrs. , God loves you . Are you afraid to trust all with this wise , and kind , and loving , and unchangable Friend and Father ? Believe that he will manage your concerns better than you could do yourself . Believe that as your days , your strength shall be . Trust implicitly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing but sin . And even over this foe , if we are Christians , we shall be made conquerors at last . Blessed hope ! It is worth labouring for , worth suffering for . October 31 . It is a grief and trouble to me that , after having experienced such a trial , so calculated to detach me from this world , I find I have an earthly heart still . I want now to live , feeling as Abraham did , when he went out , not knowing whither he /z/ he went ; to be seeking daily grace and daily breads taking no anxious thought for the morrow ; saying I am not concern ' d to know What to-morrow 's fate will do ; ' T is enough for me to say , God supplies my wants to-day . But , instead of this , I find myself saying , Whcre shall I fix my place of future residence ? How shall I ever do my duty to all these children ? How shall I manage , to make my little property turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ! I know that after all these things , do the Gentiles seek , with carefulness ; and that it is not well , it is sinful , for me to be seeking them thus . I have been lamenting before God , to-day , my great guilt in this respect , and feel somewhat relieved . I have been giving myself again entirely to him , desiring to trust in him with a simple dependance , to stand ready to go where he shall appoint , to do , and to be , just what he pleases , to find my future pleasure in doing , with a holy courage , and humility , and energy , the work which he shall give me to do . How pleasant will even my widowed life be , ; if I can thus live ? No matter where we are , or what we are , so long as we can find our happiness in glorifying God , and in doing and sufiering his will . Oh , blessed , happy life ! This was the happiness of the Apostles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporal , were jersecuted , afflicted , tormented , and slain ; and yet sang the song pf victory , through Jesus Christ their Lord , on the rack and in the flames . This is the very essence of heavenly felicity . With a capacity to enjoy this happiness ; we might well say , with the Psalmist , " Though the earth be removed , though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea , we will not fear . ' Oh my God ! I am fully satisfied /z/ that here is the only quiet resting-place . Help me , oh , help me , thus to stay myself only on thee ! Then shall I be happy . November 5 . Nearly two months have elapsed since the hand of the Lord removed from me my earthly prop and comfort ; and I can say , in the language of Mrs. Grant on a similar occasion , ' Mine is a growing sorrow . Like other streams , it widens as it proceeds . ' ' It may seem strange , but I have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if these heart-rending agonies must be endured by one of us , I am the sufferer , and he is happy . It is sweet to me to know , and reflect , that God loved him better than I did . We both , I trust , loved our God supremely , and shall love him forever . Oh the blessed truths of Christianity ! These bear up my spirit , amidst the waves and billows of afSiction . I am afflicted , but not in despair , cast down , but not destroyed ; sorrowful , yet sometimes rejoicing . Dear , blessed saint ! we shall meet , I trust , where adieus and farewells arc sounds unknown . /z/ Boston , November 7 , 1819 . So far as human sympathy can operate to heal a heart torn by a wound like mine , it has availed for me . Few ever had more afieeting and soothing proofs , of tender concern and afiectiooate commiseration , than myself . I number this amg the many mercy-drops which my kind Father Mmingled in my cup of sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make my ingratitude the deeper , were I to murmur at the removal of a mercy which I never deserved ; especially when its removal has been accompanied with so many , so very many , mitigating circumstances . No : though God witnesses the tears /z/ of agony which daily force themselves from eyes long accustomed to weeping , I trust he does not behold them tears of impatient repining , or impious rebellion . 1 think I can say , He hath done all things welL I think I feel , that he has a right to govern , and can comfort myself with the sure and certain conviction , that his plan of government will be most conducive to his own glory and to the happiness of his people . In this trying dispensation the question has arisen , which shall govern , God 4r myself ? And blessed be his name ! I am not conscious that , for one moment , I have felt disposed to take the reins of dominion into my own hands . God knows best . ' This silences and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world dwindle , when heaven comes near ! And how cheerfully can difficulties be surmounted , and trials endured , and duties performed , and sacrifices made , while we look , not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen ! The great difficulty is , to keep a steady eye of faith on futurity , and the great example of the Author and Finisher of our faith in view ; to remember that we were created " to glorify God and enjoy him forever ; " and that , therefore , the main object of our creation , and of course the main ground of our happiness , can not be affected , materially , by the temporal changes through which we pass , while this object is pursued . Oh , this is the difficulty ! Faith wavers . We want to find our happiness in earthly comforts ; and when jy are removed , we feel as if all was gone . Deam ! rother and sister , pray for me . Pray that I may have double grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children of him whom you loved . Let us pray for each other , that God will bless us in all things , and bring us at last to the inheritance of the saints in light . MRS . SUSAN HUNTINGTON. 2Cfd November 9 . No more shall this bosom ; when heavins with anguish , In the kind breast of sympathy seek tor relief , While helpless I wander , or hopeless I languish ; Ah , cola is the heart that would share all my grief ! ConsumiDg thought ! Who shall ever more wipe he tear of sorrow from these weeping eyes , or lend he ear of undissembled sympathy to the complainngs of this broken heart ? Who shall bend , with the imile of tenderness , over my bed of suffering , and theer me with the voice of affection ?

We have not suffered exactly alike ; but we have suffered ; and that circumstance has made us love each other better than we did before . But , my dear friend , in our recent trials , neither of us has been called to suffer as those who have no hope . And how does the reflection , thai our departed friends have now reached the point which we must reach before we can be happy , sweeten and soothe the anguish of the separation ! Let us contemplate them in every supposable view , and the prospect is full of consolation . - We can not think of them as , what they were , or what they are , without pleasure .

True , when we look at our loss , nature will feel . This is allowable , is becoming . When I view myself , riven asunder , root and branch , not the limbs torn away , but the very body of the tree sundered from top to bottom , nature must feel the parting agonies , must , at times , be ready to sink under the consciousness of her dissolution . All this . must be , to those who hiave interests to be smitten , friendships to be broken , and hearts to feel . Yes , dear E. , our hearts have bled . The wound inflicted has been . deep . We have felt that the stroke was full of anguish , that it went to our very souls . We will not deny that this is all true . We will not please ourselves with the delusion that the deep , deep wound , which the hand of God has inflicted , can ever cease to bleed . But , oh my friend , is there not balm in Gilead , Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour ; wise to discern , prudent to manage , strong to save ? Has not the kind hand , which smote so deeply , accompanied the stroke with many softening , mitigating circumstances ? Oh yes ; I trust we both feel that it is so . It is God who hath afflicted us , the infinitely wise , compassionate , and faithful Jehovah , the Lord our God . And does it not argue great want of confidence in him , if we sink into despondency when ke chastises us ? Does it not shew , either that we think we could manage things better than he can , or that there is something which we have not cordially submitted to his disposal . And now , God , thou art the potter , and we the clay . O how this quells the murmurings of selfwill ; how it settles the restlessness of the troubled spirit ; how it plucks the sting from the rod of affliction ! Ood knows best . Precious truth !

This is all that is waqting . With this w6 may say , Cheerful I tread the desert through . With this we may rejoice when our beloved friends are taken from the stormy ocean to the peaceful port , from the weary wilderness to the happy home , from the field of conflict to the crown of victory ; and trace , with holy courage , our way , through the same difficulties , to the same glorious recompense of reward . But ah ! this , a firm , unwavering faith , is too often wanting . We miss our temporal comforts , the heart which sympathized in all our pleasures and pains has ceased to beat , the ear which was always open to listen to our complaints and our wishes is closed , the kind voice of affection and disinterested love is hushed , the arm which supported us is withdrawn ; it is a chilling thought . Cherished alone , we feel its freezing , benumbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turning every stream of joy into one waste of cold and motionless despair . But , my dear friend , we must not view our trials thus . We must think much and often of the blessedness of those whose removal we lament , of the perfection of the divine government , of the certainty of the promise that all things shall work together for good to them that love God , of the rapid approach of that hour which will unite us eternally to those in Christ whom we love , of the danger of creature comforts , and of the sufiering life on earth of our glorious High Priest and Head , and his assurance that it is through much tribulation we must enter the kingdom . Oh , my dear E , , if we are Christians , there is a glorious prospect before us  --  as much of the good things of this life as an infinitely wise and IZ MEMOUtS 01* kind Father sees to be best for us , and hereafter aa eternity of unmingled and ineffable bliss . /z/ Boston , November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that God is my Father ; can look back , and see how I have been borne on his kind arms from my birth , distinguished by many special mercies , led in a right way ; and trust him for the future ; and I am happy . But it is not always so . At times faith wavers , and 1 feel as if I were sinking in the deep waters where there is no standing . My dear sister , there is no resting-place short of heaven . There is no certain dependance upon any temporal comfort , which does not take its rise from a heart thoroughly satisfied to have God govern as he pleases . He is leading the Christian , through a dark and dangerous wilderness , to a city of habitation , the New-Jerusalem , the land flowing with milk and honey . And he is wise to know what is best for the poor wayward pilgrim whom he is guiding to glory , and faithful to do it .

' ' I experience a great variety of feeling . To-day , sorrow has prevailed . I have thought of the long , long separation I have been called to from the husband of my bosom and shuddered to /q/ look forward . An awful chasm presents itself to my view , and my spirit is overwhelmed within me . But the precious truths of the Christian religion then come in for my support . I look to the " Man of sorrows .

Oh/ my sister , if God will bring us to heaven at last , it should not surprise us if we , like our exalted Head , must be made perfect through sufferings . I send you a subscription paper for the Sermons , which it is intended soon to publish , of the blessed man whom we all loved . May their pub* lication brighten his crown of glory ! November 27 .

Oh for large portions of that blessed hope which is an anchor to the soul ;  --  a hope that will keep all who possess it from being shipwrecked on the troubled waters of affliction , though they may be tossed and driven from billow to billow , and , at times , feel as if they must give up all for lost . I would not , I do not , complain , though my breach is wide like the sea . God is good ; and I am , comparatively happy . I believe heaven is my home . That prospect brightens this dark valley .

Oh , my dear H , it is sweet to rest in the Lord . Time ! what an empty vapour His ! But no matter . The shorter it is , perhaps , the better , if our work is done .

Perhaps this depression has resulted from my dis appointment about the publication of a volume of my husband 's sermons , on which I have been depending , I fear too much . I can not persuade myself that it is best to give it up . But the blessed man was always opposed to posthumous publications , as generally wronging the author ; and his brother , who has been looking over the sermons he left , thinks that they are in such a state , ( many abbreviations and short band characters , whose meaning was known only to the writer , having been used , and many sentences and paragraphs left incomplete , to be filled up extemporaneously at the time of delivery , ) that he could not do them justice .
