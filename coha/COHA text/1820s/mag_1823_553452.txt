txt ART . XXI. - The Life of James Otis , of Massachusetts ; containing , also , notices of some contemporary characters and events from the year 1760 to 1775 . By f'Uilliam Tudor . Boston , 1823. 8vo , pp. 508 . To record the merits of those illustrious men , whose exertions have contributed to the freedom and happiness of our country is the most imperious and interesting duty of American scholars . Few of our readers need to be told how inadequately it has hitherto been performed . As a consolation , if not an excuse , for this lamentable deficiency , we can plead no less an example , than that of our transatlantic brethren ; and while scarcely one of the statesmen and heroes , who have flourished in Great Britain during the last and the present century , has found a biographer worthy of his merits , while the lives of Chatham , and Wolfe , and Mansfield are recorded , if at all , only in works too contemptible to be mentioned , while Burke and Pitt have found no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tomlins , we can not feel very deeply mortified , if , under all our literary disadvantages , we have produced no first rate specimen of biography , * with the solitary , though striking exception , of the life of Fisher Ames . To repair our fault in this respect , to do full justice to the memory of the founders of our republic , is in many cases , out * We would not be understood to apply these remarks to the memoirs of Franklin by himself , which break off before the commencement of the most active and important part of his life . // of our power . The private history of several of them rests entirely on tradition4 We know them in general as public benefactors , but all that distinguished them from each other is irrecoverably lost , the monument raised to their memory in the hearts of their countrymen bears no other inscription , than their names . When Johnson was writing the life of Dryden , upon applying to the only two of the poet 's acquaintance then living , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two unimportant anecdotes . Not forty years have elapsed since the death of James Otis , and our author 's researches for materials for the work before us have been pursued for a long period , and with exemplary diligence . The following candid statement of his incomplete success tends to shew , in a striking light , the evanescent nature of oral truth . The reader will be disappointed , if he expect to find in this volume more than mere fragments of the life of James Otis . After a diligent and widely extended search , but little comparatively has been recovered of his private life , or of his public services ; yet before the year 1770 , no American , Dr Franklin only excepted , was so much known , and so often named in the other colonies , and in England . His papers have all perished , none of his speeches were recorded , and he himself having been cut off before the revolution actually commenced , his name is connected with none of the public documents , that are familiar to the nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most learned , the most eloquent , the most ardent , the most influential man of his time , is now so little known , that to many persons the following language of president Adams seemed exaggerated . " I have been young and now am old , and I solemnly say , I have never known a man , whose love of his country was more ardent or sincere , never one , who suffered so much , never one , whose services for any ten years of his life were so important and essential to the cause of his country , as those of Mr Otis from 1760 to 1770 . " Language equally strong was used by the late chief justice Dana , when speaking of him , in one of his charges to a grand jur.y ; and similar opinions were held by all those who acted with him , and were witnesses to his talents and influence2 pp. xviii . xix . Of the private character , therefore , of James Otis , of his habits of business and recreation , of his conversation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tontains but little . That little , however , is highly interesting and extremely well told , and its scantiness is the less to b* regretted , as the // iife of Otis was so emphatically a public one , his time , his property , his talents , his heart , were so unreservedly given to his country , that the greater part of his history is inseparably blended with that of Massachusetts . This work is consequently valuable less as the biography of a distinguished individual , than as a sketch of the times in which he flourished , and of the band of patriots , of whom he was the chief , and exhibits him , not in a solitary portrait , but like Napoleon , on his brazen column , or Wellington in his silver shield , as the prominent figure in a variety of interesting scenes , the head of an illustrious group . The choice of his subject is alike creditable to our author 's feelings and judgment . To no portion of time can the citi zeus of this state revert , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which elapsed between the year 1760 , and the evacuation of Boston . Those years may be called , without extravagance or partiality , the most trying and glorious recorded in our annals . We do not mean to say that the services or sufferings of Massachusetts closed with that period . To do justice to the zeal and patience , which she displayed throughout the whole of the revolution , is a task of no ordinary* importance and difficulty , which little has yet been done to accomplish . My heart beats , I trust , ' said Mr Webster in the late convention of this state , as responsive as any one 's , to a soldier 's claim for honor and renown . It has ever been my opinion , however , that while celebrating the military achievements of our countrymen in the revolutionary contest , we have not always done equal justice to the merits and the sufferings of those , who sustained on their property and on their means of subsistence , the great burden of the war . Any one , who has had occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knows well how to estimate those merits aud those sufferings . Nobler records of patriotism exist no where . No where can there be found higher proofs of a spirit that was ready to hazard all , to pledge all , to sacrifice all , in the cause of their country . Instances were not unfrequent , in which small freeholders parted with their last hoof , and the last measure of corn in their granaries , to supply provision for their troops , and hire ser*ce for the ranks . The voice of Otis and of Adams , in Fanneil Hall , found its full and true echo in the little councils of the interior towns ; and // if , within the continental congress , patriotism shone more conspicuously , it did not there exist more truly , nor burn more fervently ; it did not render the day more anxious , nor the night more sleepless ; it sent up no more ardent prayer to God for succour ; and it put forth , in no greater degree , the fulness of its effort , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common cause , than it did in the small assemblies of the towns . ' It is still , however , the chief glory of Massachusetts , that the idea of resisting even to blood against a weak , but exasperated and obstinate British ministry , was first avowed ( as we hope presently to prove ) by one of her sons ; that he was supported by his fellow citizens in this noble purpose , with an ardor equalled only by their invincible firmness ; that for fifteen years the people of this state , as one man , while suffering the severest injuries and insults , and with the most desperate prospects , asserted and maintained the unalienable rights of the colonies , with all the courage , and what is far more wonderful , with all the prudence , which swayed the counsels of their illustrious leaders . Events like those to which we refer , could scarcely be divested of their interest , in the hands of the most unskilful annalist . Before making any comments on the manner in which they are generally treated by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , which he has been the first to illustrate , with the method and the copiousness due to its importance . This point is no other than the origin of our independence . Where the revolution began can be , we think , no longer a question , in any well informed and unbiassed mind . It was in February 1761 , that the fundamental rights of the American colonies were first openly and boldly proclaimed . The circumstances which led to this momentous declaration will appear in th' following brief statement , taken in substance , and often in terms , from the pv*es of this work . Ta 1760 an order in council arrived from Great Britain , directing the officers of the customs to carry into effect the aca of the trade , and to apply to the supreme judicature of Massachusetts for writs of assistance . Application was made accordingly , in November of the same yet , to the supreme court , then sitting at Salem . Chief justice Sewall expressed great doubt of the legality of the writ , and of the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other judges said a word in its favor ; but as the application was on the part of the crown , it could not be dismissed without a hearing , which was fixed for the next term of the courts to be held in February 1761 . In December , chief justice Sewall died , and the loss of this impartial , high-minded magistrate , at that critical period , adds our author , was justly esteemed a public misfortune . His place was filled by lieutenant governor Hutchinson , who thus united in his own person the offices of lieutenant governor , commander of the castle , judge of probate , and chief justice of the supreme court ! The officers of the customs called upon Otis , as advocate general , to argue their cause . But as he believed these writs to be illegal and tyrannical , he refused . He would not prostitute his office to the support of an oppressive act ; and with true delicacy and dignity , being unwilling to retain a station in which he might be expected or called upon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though the situation was very lucrative , and if filled by an incumbent with a compliant spirit , led to the highest favors of government . The merchants of Salem and Boston applied to Mr. Pratt to undertake their cause , who was also solicited to engage on the other side ; but he declined taking any part , being about to leave Boston for New-York , of which province he had been appointed chief justice . They also applied to Otis and Thacher , who engaged to make their defence , and probably both of them without fees , though very great ones were offered . The language of Otis was , " In such a cause 1 despise all fees . " pp. 56 , 57 . The court met in Boston accordingly , in February 1761 , ( the day is not stated , ) and the trial took place in the council chamber , at the east end of the old town house . It was at that time and place that James Otis made his speech , on the writs of assistance . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published at the time but a few interpolated fragments , and all else which it contained was supposed to have been forgotten . A full and satisfactory sketch of it , however , was lately made by president Adams , from notes taken at its delivery , and is now given to the public in the sixth chapter of this work . It is certainly far more than a compensation for the absence of contemporary records , mid the subsequent neglect of this great leading transaction , that one of the hearers , after the lapse of sixty years , with all the authority which // *enerable age and illustrious services can confer , should have called the attention of his countrymen to the subject ; and by a rare and felicitous force of memory , carrying back their regards over the course of two generations , have exhibited with a magical effect , through the obscurity of time , an impressive and brilliant sketch of one of the first struggles that led to their national existence . " The chapter which we have just mentioned contains , besides this extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the illustrious reporter . We shall not venture to abridge , and our limits do not permit us to transcribe it . Suffice it to say , that Otis , in an argument of four or five hours , laid down the great principles of civil liberty , and especially the m8xim that taxation without representation is tyranny , with a clearness and force , due to his subject and to the occasion . American independence , ' says president Adams , was then and there born . The seeds of patriots and heroes , to defend the " non sine diis animosus infans , " were then and there sown . Every man of an immense crowded audience appeared to me to go away , as I did , ready to take arms against writs of assistance . Then and there was the first scene in the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain . ' I do say , ' adds president Adams in another place , in the most solemn manner , that Mr. Otis ' oration against writs of assistance , breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus dwelt on this great and hitherto contested point , we proceed to a few remarks on our author 's powers as a his*orian . In his accumulation and selection of incidents , he is no less judicious and happy , than in his choice of a subject . Many of them are drawn from manuscripts , and more particularly from the writings of president Adams , and are now , for the first time , given to the public . Where he has taken his materials , as every historian necessarily must , in some degree , from other works , he has seldom failed to place the facts which he has borrowed , in a more clear , lively , and entertaining point of view , than he found them . Nothing seems to be admitted , which does not rest upon the most unquestionable authority , and but little which is not highly valuable , either for its intrinsic moment , or for the light it inciilentally throws on more important subjects . The author 's narrative of political events is interwoven with // many passages of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they occur more frequently , than in the pages of othet historians , it would be worse than stoical to object , upon any general principle . They not only serve to prevent the fatigue which might arise from perusing an unbroken narrative of mo*. mentous public transactions , but often afford , in a few words , more information respecting the private character of distinguished individuals , or the feelings , habits , and manners , of the people of this state , in the middle of the last century , than could well be learned from volumes of mOre stately history . The following anecdote , for instance , is a curious illustration of the character and condition of that class of negro servants , which has furnished a model to the author of the Spy , for his most original and entertaining personage . If some previous remarks on doctors Cooper and Channcy are recollected , they will render the following story more intelligible . Dr Cooper , who was a man of accomplished manners and fond of society , was able , by the aid of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study that others engaged in . This , however , did not escape the envy and malice of the world , and it was said , in a kind of petulant and absurd exaggeration , that he used to walk to the south-end of a Saturday , and if he Saw a man riding into town in a black coat , would stop , and a*k him to preach the next day . Dr Chauncy was a close student , very absent and irritable . On these traits in the character of the two clergymen , a servant of Dr Chauncy 's laid his scheme to obtain a particular object from his master . Scipio went into his master 's study one morning to receive some directions , which the doctor having given , resumed his writing , but the servant still remained . The master , looking up a few minutes afterwards , and supposing ' he had just come in , said , " Scipio , what do you want ? " " I want a new coat , massa . " " Well , go to Mrs Chauncy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old coats ; " and was ag'aiii absOrhefflYl studies . The servant remained fixed . After a while , the doctor , turning his eyes that way , saw him again , as if for the I*rst time , and said , " What do you want , Scip ? " " I want a new coat , massa . " " Well , go to my wife , and ask her to give you one of my old coats , " and fell to writing once more . Scipio re* mained in the same posture . After a few minutes , the doctor looked towards him , and repeated the former question , " Scipio , what do you want ? " " I want a new c*at , massa . " It now flashed over the doctor 's mind , that there Was something of repe* tition in this dialogue . " Why , have I not told you before to ask Mrs Chauncy to give you a coat * get away . " " Yes , massa , // but I no want a black coat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why , massa , I fraid to tell you , but I do n't want a black coat . " " What 's the reason you do n't want a black coat ? tell me directly . " " 0 ! massa , I do n't want a black coat , but 1 fraid to tell the reason you so passionate ! " " You rascal ! will you tell me the reason ? " " 0 ! massa , I 'm sure you be angry. ** " If I had my cane , you villain , I 'd break your bones : will you tell me what you mean ? " " I fraid to tell you , massa , I know you be angry . " The doctor 's impatience was now highly irritated , and Scipio perceiving , by his glance at the tongs , that he might find a substitute for the cane , and that he was sufficiently excited , said , " Well , massa , you make me tell , but I know you be angry , I fraid , massa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me to preach for him ! " This unexpected termination realised the negro 's calculation ; his irritated master burst into a laugh : " Go , you rascal , get my hat and cane , and tell Mrs Chauncy she may give you a coat of any color ; a red one , if you choose . " Away went the negro to his mistress , and the doctor to tell the story to his friend Dr Cooper . ' pp. 449 , 450 . Among a few passages of this book , which might be advantageously omitted , may be mentioned , in the first place , all the sayings and writings of Mr. Otis , during his mental derangement . The ruins of a great mind have been often compared to those of a fine building , but the resemblance , though sufficient for many poetical purposes , fails altogether when we consider the effects severally produced by these objects , on those who contemplate them . No sensations are more diverse , than the soothing pensiveness , which steals over the feelings in the one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitates and rends them in the other . We dissent from our author 's opinion , that the disclosure of the facts to which we allude , might throw new light on Mr Otis ' character . There is a difference of beauty among the young , says Juvenal , but there is but one face to the aged , and we think it true to nearly an equal extent , that the loss of reason reduces all understandings to a humiliating uniformity . Besides , the singular qualities of Mr Otis ' mind are too clearly seen in what remains ( little as it is ) of the private history of his better days , to receive any additional illustration from a few anecdotes of its operations , while in a diseased , condition . For these reasons we think it better , that the effects of his disorder on his conduct , should have been described only in general terms , and that no anecdotes should have been given of th' // latter part of his life , but those which relate to his lucid intervals . We ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now object , though in our opinion superfluous , are in no degree indelicate , and that the topic of Otis ' insanity is invariably treated with the most respectful tenderness . But the only passages really unworthy of this volume , are a few of a lighter cast . Of the long string of puns , for example , annexed to the character of Dr Byles , one or two , at most , are all that can he tolerated . They are none of them superior to many which we daily hear in our social circles , and have been frequently retailed in works , in which they are far better entitled to a place . The clearness and liveliness of our author 's narrative , are by no means his highest , much less his only merits . Instead of confining himself to this branch of his duty ; instead of merely chronicling events , and leaving his readers to make their deductions as they may , a practice for which our most respectable historians have been censured , not perhaps without plausible reasons , by foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own original and judicious comments . The uniform spirit of candor and good humor , in which these comments are uttered , can not be too forcibly recommended to the imitation of our historical and political writers . The author seems every where free , if not from error , at least from passion , alike exempt from mitional , political , and local prejudices , jealous for the honor of his native state , but not less so , for that of our whole country . His most able and interesting remarks ( if we can be considered as fair judges ) are those which relate to the New-England character , a subject which , as he has more than once proved to the pub*. lic , his previous researches have singularly qualified him for elucidating . With the exception of a few rather hasty and unqualified animadversions , on the intolerance of our forefathers , a point , in our opinion , not to be touched , without much caution and discrimination , we recollect nothing on this head , which is not highly creditable to his discernment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to its subject , and finished with much greater care , than that of our author 's former productionsb His language , with the exception of a // few such words as ameliorating and coruscating , ' is the purest English . He has offended in one or two instances against good taste , by the violent introduction of a labored simile , ( in his comments , for example , on the manner of Otis ' death , ) hut is generally equally free from ostentalion and uncouthness , uniformly perspicuous , easy and lively , and occasionally highly eloquent . But his great excellence yet remains to he stated ,  --  his power of drawing characters . This branch of a historian 's duty has ever been considered one of the severest tests of his abilities . It is easy , and we are sorry to say it has lately been common , to describe our heroes and patriots , in unqualified superlatives and shadowy generalities , to represent all of them as alike perfect , and consequently exactly equal , and to supply the want of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Like the prismatic glass Its gaudy colors throws on every place , The face of nature we no more survey , All glares alike , without distinction gay . ' Our author 's sketches of celebrated individuals , on the con*. trary , . are drawn with the force and naturalness , which are alone sufficient to persuade us of their correctness , and may be compared to the fine portraits , which , without having seen those whom they represent , we yet feel assured are accurate likenesses . They are at once concise and comprehensive . He points out , most fully and clearly , the distinguishing characteristics of Otis and his coadjutors , those qualities , in which their intellectual and moral identity consisted ; commemorates , with high and well deserved praise , their several merits , and discloses their faults , with lenity indeed , but with independence and impartiality . It is no less to his credit , that his remarks on distinguished loyalists are those of a firm patriot , and a liberal enemy . The thirty4ourth chapter is devoted to the commemoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most moderate and just summaries of the excellencies and infirmities of his unique character , which we have ever yet seen . He was not a man of profound learning . His discoveries and his writings were the expansive results of a vigorous mind , which were thrown off without pretension , and seemed as if designed rather for a pastime , than for fame . He Was no orator , and yet his power of instructing , and carrying a point by means of some // striking apologue , was almost irresistible . He can not rank high as a constitutional statesman , since he was in favor of the most radical and fatal error in a constitution , that of making a legislature to consist of one body . His theoretical deficiencies in religion may obtain forgiveness , through the number and extent of his beneficent efforts . His wit , his indulgent humor , and his intuitive discernment , made him the delight of society . His industry , his moderation , his love of peace , and his public spirit , established his merits as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen , while his discoveries will make its fame no less sure in the annals of philosophy . His cone nexion with the American revolution will place his statue in the temple of universal memory ; but his most lasting claims to the gratitude of mankind were his powerful efforts against war , op* pression , and inhumanity of every species . He was in truth a real philanthropist ; and his views tended to promote the welfare of his race , under all governments , and in every clime. ' - pp. 404 , 405 . The character of Otis himself is described with the care and copiousness due to the hero of the work , and is thus re-capitulated : In fine , he was a man of powerful genius , and ardent temper , with wit and humor that never failed : as an orator , he was bold , argumentative , impetuous , and commanding , with an eloquence that made his own excitement irresistibly contagious ; as a law yer , his knowledge and ability placed him at the head of his profession ; as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a classic taste ; as a statesman and civilian , he was sound and just in his views ; as a patriot , he resisted all allurements that might weaken the cause of that country , to which he devoted his life , and for which he sacrificed it . ' p. 494 . The description of Samuel Adams is written with still more spirit and elegance . After a candid disclosure of his prominent errors , his abilities and virtues are depicted in what may be considered the happiest passages in the whole work . He combined in a remarkable manner all the " animosities and all the firmness , that could qualify a man to be the assertor of the rights of the people . Had he lived in any country , or any epoch , when abuses of power were to be resisted , he would have been one of the reformers . He would have suffered excommunica4ion rather than have bowed to papal inf*libility , or paid the tribute to St Peter ; he would have gone to the stake , rather than to submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have // mounted the scaffold , sooner than pay a shilling of illegal shipmoney ; he would have fled to a desert , rather than endure the profligate tyranny of a Stuart ; he was proscribed , and would sooner have been condemned as a traitor , than consent to an illegal tax , if it had been only a six penny stamp , or an insignificant duty on tea ; and t WERE appeared to be no species of corruption by which this inflexibility could have been destroyed . With this unrelenting and austere spirit , there was nothing ferocious , or gloomy , or arrogant , in his demeanor . His aspect was mild , dignified , and gentlemanly . In his own state , or in the congress of the union , he was always the advocate of the strongest measures , and in the darkest hour he never wavered or desponded . He engaged in the cause with all the zeal of a reformer , the confidence of an enthusiast , and the cheerfulness of a voluntary martyr . It was not by brilliancy of talents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service to the cause of the revolution , but by his resolute decision , his unceasing watchfulness , and his heroic perseverance . In addition to these qualities , his efforts were consecrated by his entire superiority to pecuniary considerations ; he , like most of his colleagues , proved the nobleness of their cause by the virtue of their conduct : and Samuel Adams , after being so many years in the public service , and having filled so many eminent stations , must have been buried at the public expense , if the afflicting death of an only son had not remedied this honorable poverty . ' pp. 276-278 . To conclude , we have looked upon this book , we confess , with a friendly , but certainly not with a flatterer 's eye , and with the exception , perhaps , of a few minute defects , have given , in our opinion , a faithful , though incomplete view of its contents . If our expressions have done justice to our meaning , we must have declared in substance a highly favorable opinion of its general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the revision of our community of readers . Our author has nothing to fear from those who will allow him a hearing . We have often lamented as a fact , not only humiliating to our reputation as patriots , but highly detrimental to our dearest public interests , the indiscriminate and undeserved neglect , which has been shown in this country to works relating to our own history . Such works , however deficient in point of finish , so they be hut authentic *id impartial-and these are the . unquestioned merits of many of our annalistsare deserving of a far other destiny , than that of an iron // slumber on the shelves of their publishers . It is no light thing to arrest those important facts , which are every day falling into oblivion , which are only extant in the memory of a few individuals , and are continually borne away with them beyond the reach of human investigation . Thus to preserve such incidents is all that is now indispensably necessary ; to arrange and adorn them , may be left , not advantageously indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many , we know , will maintain , that it is asking too much of their patriotism to require them to wade through a dull chronicle of events , however important , that the only reason why American history is so little read is , that it is not more ably written , and that thus it must ever be in fact , whatever may be desirable in theory . Such remarks may be applied , we grant , with much justice to many of our historical works , but certainly not ' to this ; and should it fail of the reception due to its literary merits , to say nothing of any other , its fate will reflect as little credit on the good taste as on the patriotism of our countrymen . For the benefit of those of our readers , if any , who may not have seen this volume , we have composed the following brief abstract of the life of Otis . James Otis was born in West Barustable , February 5 , 1725 , and received his early education from the reverend Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave any very early indications of his extraordinary genius is a point , on which we are altogether uninformed , a loss which will not be regretted by those , who reflect , that such indications are seldom related without exaggeration , and are in themselves exceedingly equivocal . At the age of fourteen , that is , in June 1739 , Otis entered Harvard College . The two first years of his residence there were wasted in idleness , a negligence , which he more than redeemed in the remainder of the time . He tdok his bachelor 's degree in 1743 , and bore a part on that occasion , in a syllogistic disputation . After devoting eighteen months to the pursuit of general literature , and more particularly , as we are informed in a short sketch of his life , contained in the Monthly Anthology , to the reading of the most distinguished authors in Latin and Greek , and in the modern languages , he began the study of his professioh* under Mr Gridley , and continued in his office three years . On entering into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the high honors , . Ycw Series , No. 14. 45 // which he had so well earned by his previous assiduity , and was considered in a short time as at the head of the Massachusetts bar . This high station procured him of course an extensive , and for those times a lucrative business . He was once called to Halifax , in the middle of the winter , to defend three men accused of piracy , and for his successful exertions in this case , received a fee , said to be larger than any ever given to an inhabitant of this province . During all these laborious and responsible avocations , his fondness for general literature , and more especially for the ancient classics , never deserted hini . In 1760 , the very year before he made his speech on the Writs of Assistance , he published his Rudiments of Latin Prosody , a book mentioned with high respect , by many accomplished scholars of later days . He also composed during his life a similar work on the prosody of the Greek language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished with the greater part of his manuscripts . We would dwell for a moment on these circumstances , as they furnish no trivial answer to a common , and with many of our fellow-citizens a weighty objection , against the study of ancient literature . It has often been maintained , ( for what novelty has not found its patrons in this time of indiscriminate innovation ? ) that a great proficiency in classical learning , and more especially in its technical niceties , is an acquisition to be gained only at an expense of time and thought , utterly inconsistent with that practical usefulness , to which men in this country are so generally impelled by their circumstances , as well as by their duty . How was it then , that James Otis , with an education in no way superior to that now enjoyed by many of our youth , depending for subsistence on his own exertions , closely occupied in the practice of a laborious profession , unsurpassed , if equalled , by any of his contemporaries in legal acquirements ; living not- in studious retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in and for society , how was it that he , under all these circumstances , was yet enabled to acquire and display an extensive and minute knowledge of classical learning , which would do honor to a scholar of any age or country . Immediately after his speech on the Writs of Assistance , Mr Otis was chosen almost unanimously by the citizens of Boston a member of the General Court , and was continually reelected till the year 1770 , when he retired with the thanks of his // constituents for his previous services , and was chosen again for the last time in 1771 . During his continuance in the legislature , he was appointed upon most of the committees , which reported the resolves and answers of the House of Representatives , so celebrated , under the name of the Massachusetts State Papers , and was , in fact , the chief author of the ablest of those documents . His principal coadjutor in these labors was Samuel Adams , who qualified , corrected , and polished the rough but energetic effusions of his friend 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , in which they were given to the public . To recount the services of Otis during his public life , would be , as we have observed , to relate the whole history of that period . In the legislature , as at the bar , he held the highest station , and was considered by the English ministry , as the great arch-fiend of the rebellious spirits of Massachusetts . It ought also to be distinctly remembered , that on the third day of June 1776 , he brought forward a proposition , and was afterwards made chairman of a committee to carry it into effect , for opening a gallery for such as wished to hear the debates , and was consequently the earliest in this country to suggest the propriety of public legislative proceedings ; the first author of a measure , which , by disclosing to the people the reasonings as well as the decisions of their representatives , obliges the legislature to act with much of the deliberation of a judicial tribunal , and is universally considered one of the main supports of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the exigences of the times had thrown upon him , and for which he was so well fitted by his abilities , his learning , and his devotion to liberty , Otis displayed in most cgses a command over his own spirit , which , to those who consider his peculiar temperament , will appear a glorious triumph of principle over feeling . His reigning infirmity , his master passion , was a blind impetuosity ; yet we find him continually exerting the most unwearied and successful watchfulness , in regulating the movements of his fellow-citizens , and in restraining there from those excesses , which might mar the justice and honor of their cause . This self-control was at length overthrown , and the consequences , which followed , led to his fi*ial retirement from public duty . He learned from copies of letters transmitted to him from // England , thatthe crown officers in Massachusetts had used every exertion to persuade the ministry to arrest him for high treason , and try him in the mother country . Provoked beyond all endurance by this discovery , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston , in a short advertisement , written in the most bitter and contemptuous terms , which his unrestrained indignation could supply . This piece was published September 4 , 1769 . On the following evening , about seven o'clock , he went to the British Coffee House in state street , where Mr Robinson , one of those whom he had denounced , was sitting with a number of army , navy , and rev* enue officers . Robinson , after a short altercation , attempted to chastise him , and struck him with a cane . A serious affray followed , the lights were extinguished , and Otis was obliged to combat single-handed against Robinson and several British officers . In the course of the contest he received many severe wounds , one of considerable depth in his head , ' and after the parties had been separated , was led home bleeding . Shortly afterwards he appealed for redress to the law of his country , and received two thousand pounds in damages from Robinson , which he released in court , upon receiving an humble apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent intervals of loss of intellect ; but whether these were occasioned solely by his wounds is questioned , and with much apparent reason , by his biographer . His mind was , in fact , of that highly susceptible and enthusiastic complexion , which frequently indicates a constitutional tendency to insanity . In 1772 , he retired not only from public , but from professional life , for though his lucid intervals were frequent , and his mind then resumed all its original brightness , yet the uncertain continuance of them necessarily prevented the intrusting of any business to his care . The most important of his actions , in his diseased moments , was the complete destruction of his papers , a husiness which occupied him two whole days . In 1781 , he left Boston for Andover , where he resided with Mr Osgood , a respectable farmer , yet living . After the lapse of two years , his mind , in the opinion of all his friends , as well as in his own , had regained its former tone , and he returned to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal prac* lice . During this visit , he made a memorandum , yet preserved , in which he returns th2nks to heaven , that he was restored // to the greatest of all blessings , a sound mind in a sound body . ' This pleasing supposition was soon overthrown . So incomplete was his recovery , that the slightest physical or mental excitement again unsettled his reason , and in the spring of 1783 , he returned to his residence in Andover . Six weeks afterwards , on the afternoon of Friday , May 23 , 1783 , while standing , during a thunder shower , near the door of one of the rooms , and conversing with the family , he was struck by a flash of lightning , and instantly fell dead in Mr Osgood 's arms . His remains were brought to Boston , and buried with due honors . Mr Otis was married , in 1755 , to Miss Ruth Cuaningham of Boston , and had three children . Of his lineal descendants , only two great grand children are now living .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
