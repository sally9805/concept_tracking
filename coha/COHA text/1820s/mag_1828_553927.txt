txt ART . IX. - Reports of Cases argued and Determined in the Circuit Court of the United States , for the Second Circuit , comprising the Districts of New- York , Connecticut , and Vermont . By ELIJAH PAINE , Jun. , Counsellor at Law . Vol . I. Svo. pp. 718 . New York , 1827 . IN the course of the folloxvin* article we intend to speak at some length on the importance of promptly reporting adjudicated cases , particularly those settled in the United States courts ; of the nature and necessity of the common law , and the only sure means of improving it ; of the impossibility of codifying it completely in any of our free legislative assemblies , and the utter inutility of such a measure , even were it easily practicable . At the close of the piece we shall make a few remarks on the volume before us , and on the character of the eminent judges , whose adjudications compose it . We have chosen to lay out our ground thus distinctly before our readers , in order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they begin . To many of them , no doubt far the greater portion of our theme will be uninteresting , although we ourselves think it of the highest importance . Hitherto we have thought it so much so , that in order to give free play to an inquiry into the merits of the common law , we bave admitted into our journal articles upon the subject horn the opposite parties in the controversy , and therefore , as it would at first sight appear , wholly irreconcilable with each other . It is of great consequence , we say , that the leading questions in this dispute should by this time he definitively settled . If the common law be of the vicious character , of which some have represented it to be , it should as soon as posSible be removed , closely interwoven as it is , with all our p*iitical institutions . If , on the contrary , it be an excellent system in itself and admirably suited to our growing wants and changing circumstances , we ought to feel assured of it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in our paver to give it security and improvem*nt . This is the state of the case , as it appears to us at present . Measures are propOsed for the removal of an evil , which ( does not exist ; if it do exist , it is unavoidable ; if it he not unavoidable , still the measures pmposecl never will remove it ; and even if they could remove it , when promptly and efficiently carried into execution , in this country at least we venture to say they are wholly- impracticable . // 168 July , Since we last published an article upon this subject , we have the opinion of one of those venerable sages of the profession , who , uniting the noblest talents and the most extensive learning , with the greatest experience , both at the bar and upon the bench of one of the highest courts of judicature in our country , can not be regarded with too much respect . We should be almost willing to cite such an one , as conclusive authority upon a question , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , of course , as alludin b to the profound and eloquent Commentator on American Law . We will lay his opinion before them . In its improved condition in England , and especially in its improved and varied condition in this country , under the benign influence of an expanded commerce , of enlightened justice , of republican principles , and of sound philosophy , the common law has become a code of matured ethics , and enlarged civil wisdom , admirably adapted to promote and secure the freedom and happiness of social life . It has proved to be a system replete witb vigorous and healthy principles , eminently conducive to the growth of civil liberty . ' - Kent 's Commentaries , vol . I. pp. 321 , 3 ' 2*2 . A great proportion of the rules and maxims which constitute the immense code of the common law , grew into use by gradual adoption , and received , from time to time , the sanction of the courts of justice , without any legislative act or interference . It was the application of the dictates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . In the just language of Sir Matthew Hale , the common law of England is " not the product of the wisdom of some one man , or society of men , in any one age ; but of the wisdom , counsel , experience , and observation , of many ages of xvise and observing men . " And his further remarks on this subject would be well worthy the consideration of those bold projectors , who can think of striking off a perfect code of law at a single essay . ' - lbid. pp. 439 , 440 . In all ages and nations there must be common law , or leges noa seriptee . And in exact proportion , too , as those are advanee ( l in civilization and refinement , do these become numercus , extensive , and intricate . It was so among the Greeks . It was so also among the Rornans. * We know how it is in Eng * Constat autem jus nostrum , quo utimur , nut seripto , nut sine scripto ; ut apud Gr*eos , * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lit. 2 , 3 . Sine scripto jus venit , quod usus approbavit ; nam diuturni mores , consensu utentium comprohati , legem imitantur. ' ibid. 9 . Et non ineleganter in duas species jus civile distributum esse videtur . ' Ibid. 10 . Aristotle also makes precisely the same distinction . Rhet. lib. 1 , cap . 10 . Rhet. ad . Pex. cap . 1 . // land . It is more or less so in fact , all over the civilized world . It is the case even in France , and is rapidly becoming more so , as we understand , and as every rational man might have fairly expected , under the admirably digested code of Napoleon. * It is so , in short , from the uncompromising nature of things . It lies not in human foresight to anticipate even the various classes of cases that may arise . What legislature , for example , could have previously provided for the great questions that have presented themselves under policies of insurance , or hills of exchange , or promissory notes , or the admissibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short under any branch or department of law ? for to attempt to enumerate them is to limit ourselves , and to confess that they may be enumerated , when they are in fact innumerable . New and unimagined cases will for ever come up , for which no legislative provision could have been made . What then is to be done ? There can not be a great and grievous wrong , without a violation of law . The questions therefore can not be laid aside ; and by what laws must they be settled ? By the leges non scripta* , by analogies drawn from previously adjudicated cases , by well established usages and customs , existing among intelligent and experienced people , and arising from , and therefore adapted to their wants , and to circumstances in which they have been placed , and finally ratified by the sanction of the courts of judicature . It is this in fact which forms the first and perhaps the only true foundation of the common law . And without the liberty of judicially resorting to it , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state where there are innumerable and continually multiplying violations of right , for which , however , there can be neither redress nor remedy . We may hold it therefore for an incontrovertible truth , that there must be a common or unwritten law in every civilized state . If it he an evil , it is a necessary evil . No human ingenuity can prevent it . The only question then remaining is , how we can ensure to it correct principles , and give it all the accuracy of which it is susceptible . And we shall give our reasons , in the course of this article , for believing that this can * Still this code , with all its excellencies , has many defects . It provides no legal remedies . It says nothing of the various forms of action ; of pleas or pleadings ; of the law of evidence , or of the testimony of witnesses , &amp;c . And it is from some of these sources , that the greatest embarrassments have arisen in settlina our common law . // only be done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by applying to the legislature for aid when the evil is of a nature to require correction . There seems to be something contradictory in the arguments , as they are usually urged , against the character of the common law . By one , the judge is called a legislator , moulding his decisions to suit his own notions of equity and right . By another , he is thought to be so absolutely bound down to precedent and authority , that he dares not depart from them , however unreasonable they may appear to him to be . To our apprehension neither of these statements is in any degree correct . In fact , they neutralize each other . The legislator is free . No decree from a higher authority , except it be the letter and the spirit of the Constitution , has any restrictive force over his measures . Fa ? different from this , however , with the judge upon the bench . In the capacity of legislator , he has authority to act only so far as is necessary in order to carry some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowest limits , and strictly and ably watched . In clearly settled cases , he is indeed bound to acquiesce ; not because they were arbitrarily or peremptorily decreed , but because , as has been often observed , the pours of the question in controversy were thoroughly examined by the keenest minds in competition with each other ; and then deliberately pronounced to be law by cool and impartial judges ; and because the principles of justice , which regulate the rights of one man , ought not to be refused to another When the original cases were evidently not well examined in the outset , they may be re*xamined , and overruled , and set aside ; and this is the condition , which is always annexed to them in practice . But when they were so examined , there is every reason for giving them the obligatory force of law . We should feel the greatest insecurity of property and of rights , were it otherwise ; to say nothing of the time and labor uselessly spent in searching for what had already been well ascertained . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our judiciaries actually invested with legislative powers , far more extensive than any that they have been accused of arrogating to themselves . Judges , sharply and unremittingly watched from evemy side of the question in controversy , by the shrewdest and most intelligent men iu the community , whom education arid the warmest feelings of pride , ami ) itIon , self-interest , and rivalry // of excelling in the discharge of their professional duties , combine to make acute in the detection of errors , and bold and active in publicly exposing them , will not venture , intentionally , to go very far astray from the plain principles of rectitude . They are as strongly protected , too , from unintentional wrongs . It is from the same well guarded and unexceptionable sources , that they are compelled to receive all possible light and instruction . in such a body of men , and thus situated , we should not be afraid to repose absolute legislative power , so far , at least , as is necessary to regulate the common transactions between man and man . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserably wasted by many of our legislatures in making bad laws , to say nothing of the faction and the views of self-interest which reign in them , and the poor principles of qualification on which some of their members are elected , we almost wish that it were so . It is perhaps the ultimct Titule in the career of political improvement . In general , however , we believe that the writers against the common law have now given up what was formerly the most important point in the controversy . They concede that it contains some of the most admirable principles in any system or code ; and the object seems to be merely to select these , and purify them from the dross , with which they say they are mingled , and then give them the sanction of some direct act from the legislature . These arguments appear to be directed against a few of its slight errors , and , in the formal part of it , against some prevailing absurdities , which its warmest admirers are now willing to allow to be such . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronA*t the whole system into disrepute among the truest. *md in 50CM instances the most enlightened friends of ec*nity mu rivht *d l* Ii not innteriallj , in the end , affecting the prompt and J*1 ( *et rn niwis *auon of justice , they may be , and no doubt in seiae cases ou*hr te be correctcd* It is not the bii*ess o* the judic*a'y , hO* cv* ? , to undertake this .

The only question , indeed , now actually at issue between the writers upon this subject , we believe to be this . Is it expedient for us to undertake to analyze the whole of the common law , select the most valuable of its principles , digest them , arrange them , embody them into a code , give them the sanction of some direct legislative act , and by the same act declare all the residue to be void or of no legal validity ? We say we understand this to embrace the only important points of inquiry still unsettled among the parties in this controversy ; and for ourselves , we confess we have no confidence in the practicability of the proposed measure , even were it ever so desirable . The business of fully codifying all the existing laws , we believe , never could be accomplished by one of our free legislatures . We feel almost assured of this , in fact , by actual observation . How slowly and how unwillingly do they alter any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is strongly recommended to them , and by the most enlightened men . At every period of their coming together , propositions for this end are continually brought before them , which they as continually reject . The old Norman barons used to say , when in parliament assembled , . JVolumus leges lingike mutare . And it is still the practical maxim of our free legislative bodies . Suppose , then , they were called upon to go over the whole ground , investigate the complicated details of this most intricate and extensive and rapidly growing of all the sciences , take up title after title , rule after rule , principle after principle , examine them and the reasons on which they are founded , and the various modes by which they are to be carried into execution , and their influence on the general administration of justice in the community ,  --  we know not when they would find the end of it . And all this they must sooner or later perform ; for although the business of analyzing and codifying may at first be entrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and correcting , as well as enacting into law , must be done by the legislatures themselves ; or they delegate the highest trust committed to them to subordinate agents , without themselves seeing to its faithful execution . At least , under this impression they uniformly act . They think it their duty to place implicit confidence in no one . We can imagine the innumerable alterations , amendments , // and substitutions , which almost every member thinks himself capable of introducing , and bound , perhaps , to insist upon ; and it needs but little experience to convince us of the wearing delays and disaffections that must arise from this mode of proceeding . We venture to say , in short , that the undertaking never could be satisfactorily accomplished by our free legislative assemblies . We know that it was never so attempted .. It is not in lands of liberty and equal rights that the business of codifying flourishes . It is commonly the work of despots . A single imperial voice , commanding unqualified instant submission throughout the community , has hitherto ordered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner only can it be promptly , harmoniously , and efficiently done ; and although the laws which were thus framed are of a very admirable character , and still call forth the highest commendations of the wise , it is not because the people were free for whom they were designed , but because they were not free , and had neither the power nor the presumption to attempt to alter those , that were imposed upon them by the sovereign authority ; which , however , fortunately for them , had the wisdom to select and employ the most enlightened counsel in the work . If our political institutions had prevailed among them , they would not have had , they would not have needed , the statutory codes . The evils which called forth these important remedies , are of a kind of which we , in this country , can form no adequate conception ; and yet they ought to be taken into the estimate , when we speak of the necessity or the utility of their so much lauded legal system . Justinian was the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his code was , Quod principi placuji , legis kabet vigorem . For four centuries before him , in fact , such had been the constant and undisputed right of those clothed with the imperial power . The will of a single man , of a child , perhaps , as has been justly said , was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages , and the inclinations of millions ; and few institutions , either human or divine , were permitted to stand on their old foundations . Yet during this very period , were enacted by those various single-handed legislators , the perpetual edict of Hadrian , the Gregorian , the Hermogenian , and the Theodosian Codes ; the Code , the Pandects , and the Institutes of Justinian ; immense and admirably digested systems of laws , of which those // now remaining have nothing like a rival among the similar juridical efforts of modern times , aided as these have been by lights borrowed from those . The evils existing then , as we have said , were of a nature to make such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often irreconcilable , and sometimes contradictory . The ordinances , edicts , responses , rescripts , novels , and we know not what other classifications of laws , were inconsistent with each other , and no ingenuity could harmonize them . Many parts had never any force in practice ; many had become obsolete ; and the whole body of those actually in operation was full of obscurity and wholly destitute of order . In the space of ten centuries , ' says Gibbon , the infinite variety of laws and legal opinions had filled many thousand volumes , which no fortune could purchase , and no capacity could digest . Books could not easily be found , and the judges , poor in the midst of riches , were reduced to the exercise of their illiterate discretion . ' These are the evils which the statutory digests of Justinian were originally designed to remove . A few of a similar character , and others of a totally different one , existed in France and nearly the same imperial legislative power , though remotely and indirectly applied , was necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country had been long divided into very many provinces or departments , in which various opposite regulations of law prevailed .

Oh 00 mOw // But in our own country we have no such evils to remedy , and no such legislative power therefore is necessar&amp; for their removal . We have said , that we do not believe in e practicability of codifying here , even were it ever so expedient ; and we now say thatwedo notbelieve in the expediency or necessity of it , even were it ever so easily practicable . The good principles of the common law will have their full force and ascendency in our courts of judicature , without their being especially directed to it by the authority of the legislatures , in conse nence of a code which they have seen fit to sanction . And we have a plain way of removing thebad ones , when they are proved to be such , and the evil calls distinctly for a remedf . The sole avowed object of codifying is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we know that it can never in this fly be accomplished , even with the greatest power , genius , and facilities , for carrying it into e&amp;ct . The various and growing wants and occasions of the law , no human prescience can anticipate . We can approach the nearest to that highly desirable end , which codifiers so earnestly seek for in vain , by publishing promptly and regularly faithful reports of fully investigated cases . Submit them fairly to public examination , and the false principles will soon be laid aside , and the truly valuable ones have the full force of law without the sanction of a code . It is impossible for us to over-estimate ( we can not repeat it too often ) the importance of doing this . A remarkable proof of the absolute necessity of it , occurred to us on reading the volume now on our table . It was under a case , too , arising on the promulgation of laws . We do not know that we can do better than bring it before our readers , partly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly as a slight sample ofthe interesting character of the Reports , here presented to usbyMrPaine . For wethinkwecansee m this , and the other written opinions of Judge Livingston , the pen of a fine scholar and man of taste , and the marks of a bold and elevated , though sometimes erring mind . The facts in the case alluded to are briefly these . The act laying an embargo on the ports of the United States , was passed on December 22 , 1807 . On the ninth of the following January , the supplement act received the signature of the president . Ave* sailed from the port of St Mary 's , in Georija , on the fifteenth of the same month , and was afterwards seized by a collector for a violation of the law . The official // intelligence of these acts did not reach St Mary 's until the evening of the fifteenth , and was not publicly announced until the next day , although various rumors about them had been in circulation for some time before . The only question was , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them the force of a statute , and thus work the condemnation of the vessel . Judge Livingston decided that there was not . The vessel was accordingly restored . The following are some of his remarks . But whether a law thus worded be in force throughout the United States on the day of its passage , or not until after a reasonable time for promulgation of it in the different parts of the union , is a question purely of judicial cognizance , and may be decided without interfering with any other department of government ; and this again resolves itself into the simple question , whether in a case like this any promulgation is necessary . A more abject state of slavery can not easily be conceived , than that the legislature should have the power of passing laws inflicting the highest penalties , without taking any measure to make them known to those whose property or lives may be affected by them . It is not only necessary , therefore , in a country governed by laws , that they be passed by the supreme or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are expected to obey them . The manner in which this is done may vary ; but whatever mode is adopted , it should be such as to afford a reasonable opportunity to every person who is to be affected by them , of being as early as possible acquainted with them . " Whatever way is made use og it is incumbent on the promulgators , " says the learned commentor on the laws of England , " to do it in the most public and perspicuous manner . " The court will not stop to inquire in what manner the laws of congress , relating to different subjects , should be promulgated , or whether a mere deposite of them in the proper office , after a reasonable lapse of time , would not amount to a sufficient notification . But as it regards laws of trade , which is the case before it , rendering penal acts , although sanctioned by former laws , arid done in concurrence and with the consent of its own officers , the court thinks it can not greatly err in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different districts only from the times they are respectively received , from the proper department , by the collector of the customs , unless notice of them be brought home in some other way to the person charged with their violation . A proposition so reasonable , and so consonant to those principles of justice and humanity which are unchangeable , requires only to be stated to receive our universal assent . That a law which passes at Washington should subject to forfeiture every vessel which sailed from the United States on the very day of its passage , or the day after , // however remote the port of departure , and after a regular clearance by the authorized agent of government , is a doctrine leading to such unjust and tyrannical consequences , that nothing but a course of decisions , whose meaning admitted of no doubt , could induce this court to sanction it . There may be a difference in name , but there is none in reality , between an cx post facto law , which Congress can not pass , and one whose operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the law intends every person to have notice of what is done in parliament , as soon as it is concluded , because the whole realm is there represented , is too quaint to require refutation . Indeed , the same learned writer , who would very gravely persuade us that a merchant in Boston , at the distance of five hundred miles , must know every law of Congress the moment it is passed , merely because he may have had a voice in the choice of a few representatives , who may all have voted against it , as if not satisfied with his own reasoning , and feeling , no doubt , the propriety of affording to the subject some other and better means of information , tells us , that he had found upon examination , that not long after the art of printing had found its way into England , which was between three and four hundred years ago , the practice had been to publish acts of parliament in the counties , to the end " that the sul ) jects might have express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law " ' pp. 26-28 . Yet on the same statutes , under exactly the same material facts , and with some circumstances even more favorable to the ship-oxvners , Judge Story has decided the other way . Since the adoption of the constitution of the United States , which prohibits the passing of as post facto laws , it seems to be considered , that statutes take effect immediately from the time of their date or passage , and not before ; in the same manner as they now do in Ent*laiid . But we shall hardly find a case , in which the promulgation of them has been held necessary , to give them operamion . So early as the 39 Edw . IL. , this precise objection was taken ; and Sir Robert Tkoyc , then Chief Justice , answered , " although proclamation be not made in the county , every one is bound to take notice of that which is done in parliament ; for as soon *s the parliament bath concluded anything , the law intends that every person bath notice thereof , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore it is not requisite that any proclamation be made , seeing the statute took effect before . The same point is recognised as law in Corn . Dig . Parliament , ( C. 23 , ) and Hale en Parliament , 36 , and in Bacon 's Abr . Stat . A. It seems , therefore , a settled doctrine , that a statute takes effect from the time of its passage , and needs no promulgation to give it operation . // Against principles thus solemnly adjudged , I can not find a single opposing authority . ' 1 Gedlison 's Reports , p. 66 . The Brig Ann . The opponents of the common law would undoubtedly cite these as admirable cases in support of their arguments against it . But the difficulty is , we repeat it , such variances can not be prevented . New and unimagined questions are for ever arising . While we are codifying one body of principles , which are settled to be law by our courts of judicature , and have passed into the books of digested law , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , are brought before the court at every hour of its session . The remedy comes too late . It is here where the celebrated framers of codes are under the most egregious mistake . They think they have made everything clear and simple , and provided for all possible contingencies , which can arise in the various applications of the law . Justinian believed this of his system . It was not to be imagined , he thought , that anything could be wanting in his immense body of laws , when he first enacted and promulgated them to the Roman people . All the embarrassments and mischiefs , necessarily arising from the various and doubtful significations of words , were ascribed by him to the chicanery of lawyers ; and he denounced the punishment for forgery against those rash civilians , ' who should dare to interpret his will . Yet Justinian very soon saw fit to change his mind . The historian Procopius tells us , according to Gibbon , that on each and every day during his long reign , he introduced and promulgated some legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as speedily renounced it . I at first fancied , ' said he to Las Casas , that it would be possible to reduce all laws to clear , simple , geometrical propositions , so that every man who could read and connect two ideas together , would be able to decide for bin-iself ; but I became convinced , almost immediately after , that this idea was absurd . ' The truth is , we can not foresee the growin want of legal remedies ; and some common or unwritten law is therefore in every state unavoidable . We once had occasion to illustrate this by the numerous litigated questions which have arisen under the statute of Frauds , a statute penned by the ablest judges and civilians that England ever produced . In the foregoing remarks , when we have spoken in praise of the common law , we have referred not to the pure , unmingled // common law , where there is no statutory provision to guide or control it . There are comparatively few decisions of this character in our modern books of reports . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we advance . It accompanies us at every step of our progress in the reading of statutes , decrees , and decisions , which lie nominally beyond its reach . For the principles of interpretation and practice are borrowed from it in every branch and department of jurisprudence ; and scarcely a question of litigated right can arise in any of our courts of justice , without in some way calling for its aid , or receiving from it light . So that the more other laws multiply , the more the common law also advances . As the sole means of improving it , we insist on able reports of well investigated cases ; and we mean to make our remark particularly applicable to those of the Circuit Courts of the United States , because those are now very much neglected . And yet there is much complaint of the great number and of the rapid multiplication of law reports . The gentleman *f the bar is now under the necessity of enlarging his library and extending his researches far and wide , for the purpose of seeing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various questions submitted to him in the course of his practice . But can this be to any one a fair ground of complaint ? Is it not , on the contrary , to be regarded with feelings of unmingled satisfaction ? Does it not indicate clearly the increasing demand , and the more general diffusion of intelligence , on a subject , of all others the most important to the peace and good order of society ? The publication of such reports is the promulgation of the laws . They are promulgated , too , with the principles on which they are founded . In no other way is it possible to make them generally known ; and as they arise out of the actual demands for justice , they are likely to be peculiarly well suited to the existing wants and condition of society . We consider the prompt and full publication of law reports , to be , for a variety of other reasons than those we have mentioned , highly beneficial . Of the importance of it to our personal rights we can not form too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every possible motive , to the faithful administration of justice . What wrongs from this sotace may we not look for , in a community where the decrees of the courts of judicature are suppressed and kept from public view ? Judges , who act under the impression that such is to be the // fate of their decisions , although they feel the sense of duty in all its purity , yet want , the consciousness of being narrowly and extensively observed , which is a powerful incentive to great and generous efforts , even among the most elevated minds . But when they know , that their opinions may be severely scrutinized by the ablest men of their own , and perhaps of coming ages ; when they reflect that those opinions will be either made the basis of farther adjudications , or rejected as inconclusive and false ; above all , when from fear of error they are led , as in this country they almost universally are , to write their opinions at length , and themselves prepare them for the press , they have every inducement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the mind , to be laborious , accurate , and impartial . Let then our legal decisions be brought , as extensively as may be , before the public ; for nothing can tend more unerringly to the faithful administration of justice . If we mistake not , this is not yet estimated as it ought to be . 1'rue it is , the great and increasing number of the volumes of which we are speaking , makes it expensive to purchase , and laborious to read them through . But this is a difficulty attending the advancement of all the sciences . New treatises are published . The results of new investigations must be laid before the public . New discoveries and inventions , or new improvements or adaptations of the old ones , are continually soliciting our examination . Yet the man of real science does not very often complain of the multiplication of books upon his favorite theme ; nor the man of letters , of the numerous works of literature and taste . The comparison furnishes us with a good illustration of the true character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all other sciences , progressive . It perpetually enlarges , and suits itself more and more closely to our wants and circumstances . And one may as well think of coinposing a system of natural philosophy , which shall be perfect , and without the possibility of further improvement , as a code of laws , to which advancing society is to be chained . It is not necessary to read all the law reports which are published , any more than it is to read all the essays on experimental subjects in natural philosophy , which are published . There are accurate digests of the one , as there are accurate digests of the other . Competition , too , does its mighty work of improvement here , as everywhere else . The* valuable volumes of // which we are speaking , soon rise to their proper elevation the poor ones as soon sink into insignificance . The instances of this , in the history of these publications , are so many and obvious , that it is not necessary to name them particularly . It is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Common Law , like all the other sciences , is destined perpetually to improve . The system is becoming better , as well as more generally known . Oft the hearing of a question in controversy , the object is looked upon from every possible point of view . All the various and seemingly conflicting decisions upon the subject , are brought before the court and canvassed . The postulates and arguments on which they rest , are severely scrutinized ; the valuable truths selected , and the material errors discarded , from each . And there is every reason for believing , that by this mode of proceeding , the really sound principles of law xviii inevitably be reached at last . This is precisely the way by which all the sciences improve ; and it is the only way which our courts of judicature can take on the settlement of a litigated question . We wish also to see some books of reports put earlier into the hands of youth for their legal education , than they have been hitherto . It appears to us , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in which they are published . If we are not greatly mistaken , they would , with proper facilities for their explanation , find them far more interesting and instructive to read , and infinitely more easy to remember , than codes , or digests , or elementary treatises . We believe these last to be commonly too abstract and *general , and best suited to the minds of those , who are somewhat advanced in the science of the law . We know that the youn* pupil often grows tired of them , because he does not always easily or fully comprehend them , and , even if he does , can not long retain them accurately in his memory . When afterwards , in the course of his professional practice , he is called upon to make an application of the knowledge which he has thus gone over , he finds that he has forgotten it ; and when he recurs again to his books for the lost intelligene e , it often appears new to him , and in nine difficult questions out of ten , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not so , however , with that acquired by reading interesting law reports . The facts in these cases serve as bonds of association , by which the principles interwoven with them are held together , and kept long and strongly fas // tened in the mind . We appeal to the most learned of the profession , if this , even with them , is not sometimes apt to be so . The nice distinctions and the subtle refinements in their elaborate volumes of digested jurisprudence , which they have cause of recollecting only as they have read them , may pass from their thoughts ; but let them he connected with some cases of actual occurrence , in which they were engaged , or which they may have been called upon carefully to examine , and they do not forget the principles then . It is also to be borne in mind , that digests and elementary treatises are only the abstracts of adjudicated cases , and not always sure therefore of stating accurately the points decided . In fact , experienced counsel will never , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , the laborious compiler says , contains in an abbreviated form the principles of a question settled , when they have the original case itself within their reach ; for they have learned by observation the errors and the imperfections of digests . These are excellent as indices or tables of reference . Seldom , however , are they to be relied upon as absolute authority in themselves , when it is easy to procure the books of reports from which they were at first taken . Thus it is that the student , so far as he can read reported decisions intelligently , is sure of learning his law more accurately , as well as more pleasantly , than he can in any other way . He thus , too , will learn the questions of practice ; the various forms of action ; the manner in which rights are to be ascertained and settled . He sees the remedy at the same moment that he sees the wrong ; and if he reads the books of reports as rapidly as they appear , and in the same order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on professionally in the world around him , from which he is almost entirely separated in the common course of early legal education . Many of our readers may think us enthusiastic in our estimate of the importance of reported decisions , and of the various and extensive uses to which they are actually subservient . In support , therefore , of some of our last remarks , we shall cite here another eloquent passage from the writings of the admirable Commentator on American law . It is in every way just ; aud nothing can be more practically applicable to the lessons of the student . We only wonder , that reilections , such as these , did not lead their distinguished auhor to apply them , more particularly than he has done , to the // great purpose , which we have designated in the foregoing para . graph . They the Reports are worthy of being studied even by scholars of taste and general literature , as being authentic memorials of the business and manners of the age in which they were composed . Law reports are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic incident , and displays of deep feeling . They are faithful records of those " little competitions , factions , and debates of mankind , " that fill up the principal drama of human life ; and which are engendered by the love of power , the appetite for wealth , the allurements of pleasure , the delusions of self-interest , the melancholy perversion of talent , and the machinations of fraud . They give the skilful debates at the bar , and the elaborate opinions on the bench , delivered with the authority of oracular wisdom . They become deeply interesting , because they contain true portraits of the talents and learning of the sages of the law . ' Every person well acquainted with the contents of the English reports , must have been struck with the unbending integrity and lofty morals with which the courts were inspired . I do not know where we could resort , among all the volumes of human composition , to find more constant , more tranquil , and more sublime manifestations of the intrepidity of conscious rectitude . If we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and follow judicial history down from the first page in Dyer to the last page of the last reporter , we should find the higher courts of civil judicature , generally , and with rare exceptions , presenting the image of the sanctity of a temple , where truth and justice seem to be enthroned and to be personified in their decrees . ' Kent 's Commentaries , pp. 462 , 463 . A still deeper interest must be felt by the American lawyer in the perusal of the judicial decisions of his own country . Our American reports contain an exposition of the common law as received and modified in reference to the genius of our institutions . By that law we are governed and protected , and it can not but awaken a correspondent attachment . ' Ibid. p. 455 . If the foregoing remarks are true of the publication of law reports generally , with what peculiar force do they apply to those of the national courts of the United States ? It appears to us , that these must be interesting , not merely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wishes to see clearly the true character of our political institutions . We know in fact , that there is no other way of acquiring a knowledge of them with any degree of accuracy . The constitution of the courts of which we are speaking , is entirely unexampled in the history of states* // *July , We believe indeed that it forms the only characteristic feature , which is purely and exclusively our own , in the whole frame of our national government . All our other civil institutions have been partially borrowed from abroad , and are at least faintly imitated by foreign states . But the nature of the jurisdiction , and the supreme political ascendency of our national courts of judicature , have neither precedent nor parallel in any country or age . It had long been a favorite maxim , among enthusiastic writers on the true nature of political rights , that officers of government are but the delegated agents of the people ; subservient to them ; bound to give them an account of their stewardship ; with clearly defined duties ; with restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overstep the strict limits prescribed to them ; and liable to have their doings abrogated and held for nought , when they do . The world were inclined to look upon this as rather a Utopian vision in some fancied organization of civil society , than as a practicable principle in government . In ours , however , we have actually realized it . Our high courts of judicature have carried it into execution , and we are now witnessing their powerful influence over our political character , in the protection which they give to individual rights against the encroachments of the legislative and executive poxvers combined . It is not merely their humble duty to administer justice between man and man . They have a far more elevated one intrusted to them . In the vast machinery of our national affairs , they are , as it were , the regulators . All our great public functionaries , even Congress itself , as well as the legislatures of the several states , they hold in salutary check . Between the people and their delegated agents they stand the supreme umpire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the constitution ; keep you within the limits prescribed to you by that ; for when you transgress them , we are bound by our high political principles , as well as by our sacred oaths of duty , to set your doings aside , and hold them for violations of right . ' Is there anything comparable to this in the civil constitutions of foreign states ? There the courts of judicature hold a subordinate rank in their various frames of government , and over them the legislative and the executive powers have the superintendence and control . Here they are supreme , and exhibit before us continually , in actual practice , as well as in beautiful theory , the absolute sovereignty of the law . // For the discharge of duties of such unexampled importance , the courts of which we are speaking are necessarily clothed with the most extraordinary powers . They have ultimately the power of defining their own powers ; of drawing the line of demarkation between the rights of the several states and those of the Union ; between the jurisdiction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ; and of construing , and interpreting , and applying the provisions of the constitution , in such a manner as to their wisdom shall seem equitable and meet , for the purpose of promptly effectuating all the high purposes of national justice , for which it was originally designed . Should not the official doings of such a body of men be promptly and extensively made known ? It appears to us , that the publication of the reports of adjudicated cases , from sources and on subjects like these , ought to receive , most liberally , legislative patronage and support , and be diffused as far and wide as possible , throughout our community . If there be any intelligence important to the freedom of our political institutions , it is this . In the foregoing paragraphs we have referred only to the great questions of constitutional law which come before our national courts of judicature . The discussion of the simpler ones , occurring to them in the ordinary course of their jurisdiction , are also full of interesting matter to gentlemen of the profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of nature and of nations . In many cases , they introduce us to a knowledge of the peculiar local laws of foreign states , as well as of the great international law which connects them all together . They bring also into some practice the civil law , and tend to diffuse a knowledge of it , and gradually to reconcile and incorporate it with our own , and thus give us the use of some of its admirable principles . We ask our readers to consider the cases of frequent occurrence before the courts of which we speak , for the evidence of what we have said . The examination of wrongs committed upon the high seas , 6r of crimes in any way affecting our sovereignty as a nation ; of revenue and exchequer cases ; of questions of admiralty and prize ; of all those coming from the various laws of navigation arid trade ; of the vested or the violated rights arising under the stipulations of a treaty ; of the infractions of the privileges of a patent , or of the sacred security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and science ; of the // great maritime contracts , growing out of our extended commercial connexions with foreign states , and requiring for their elucidation the great code of mercantile law , now by common consent in force , almost all over the enlightened world ; - the examination of these , we say , has called forth in this country , to a very honorable extent , learning , research , and ingenuity , and furnished a rich variety of fruitful themes for valuable disquisitions , on the most important and interesting points of law ; and , for the reason we have already given , the publication of just reports of them must be exceedingly useful in extending the knowledge of that law , and making it more accurate and clear , as well as more generally known . May we not also look to the publication of the reports of which we are speaking , for making the common law of our country more regular and uniform in its character , than it has been hitherto ? The several courts of the various states are separate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not considered as having any obligatory force in those of another . Hence it is that they are often at variance and sometimes diametrically opposite . But the courts of the Union are joined . A most powerful bond of association connects them together . The decrees and doings of one would be considered as having something of more influence on those of another , than the mere opinions of learned and intelligent men . They go moreover into every part of the Union , and gather intelligence from the most gifted and eminent counsel of our country , and come together animally for the purpose of hearing , and conferring , and disposing of litigated rights , under circumstances peculiarly favorable to the clear and correct settlement of the law . No party feelings nor sectional views can sway them . Those of one must offset and counterbalance those of another . Their errors are reciprocally corrected . By a judiciary thus composed of the ablest judges , and acting under such advantages , the true principles of justice must be reached , if they are within the reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , they may do much to place our common law on a more steady and regular foundation , than it now has . At least , so far as their influence goes , it may be rescued from that inconsistency and variance for which it has been so long and so deservedly reproached . Is it not therefore to be regretted that the reports of cases adjudged in the courts of which we are now speaking , should be // so much neglected as they are ? Questions of much moment , as we have seen , are constantly brought before them ; and far the greater number of their important decisions are final ; yet there is no provision made by law for their encouragement and support . While those of the various superior courts of the several states are brought forward under the avowed patronage of their respective legislatures , and ordered to be circulated throughout the community , those to which we now refer are left to struggle their own way into being , unaided , but by their own intrinsic merit . With the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor or notice . Indeed , when they are published , it is usually , as in the present instance , in consequence of the generous efforts of some enterprising young member of the bar , who , desirous of becoming versed in the learning and practice of the highest branches of jurisprudence , and seeing clearly the importance of the adjudications before him , records them and gives them to the public , though sometimes , we fear , at no little pecuniary sacrifice of his own . What must be the natural consequence of such neglect as this ? Why , the reports of the cases settled in these courts are comparatively few in number ; on some of the circuits they are not published at all ; and on those where they are so in general , they appear irregularly and without any system . The publication of the present volume contains a remarkable illustration of this fact . It is intended to report the decisions upon a circuit , where very numerous and very important questions must arise . During the whole time which it covers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench ; and yet all the decisions which were gathered from the court , from the year 1810 to the year 1824 inclusive , are comprised in this single volume . We have no room now to speak as we could wish and as we intended , of the particular merits of this collection of cases . Mr Paine is a judicious and a very able reporter . It is a sufficient recommendation of the volume , that it is filled almost entirely with the written opinions of Judges Livingston and Thompson ; for the facts in the cases , and the arguments of counsel are stated very succinctly , and yet very clearly and satisfactorily , and the book therefore is encumbered with no useless or extraneous matter . Judge Thompson is still upon the bench . Many years of his very laborious public life have been spent in the discharge of the highest judicial duties , in the // courts of his own state as well as in those of the Union , and , we feel assured , to the great satisfaction of those who have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common law , which is our favorite theme at present , we know him to he peculiarly accurate and unexceptionable . It is * hardly proper for us , however , to dwell longer upon his judicial character now . But we hope to see more of it hereafter in the same manner in which this volume presents it to us . In the death of Judge Livingston , the American public sustained an irreparable loss . As the volume before us contains the latest of his published judicial labors , it affords us a favorable opportunity , which we have long sought for , and which we now gladly embrace , of offering to our readers some slight sketches of his life and general character . The private as well as the public virtues of such a man ought to be made known and recorded* The father of Judge Livin0ston was Governor William Livingston , of New Jersey , a distinguished lawyer and a revolutionary patriot , whose memoirs and a sketch of whose character may be found in Allen 's Biographical Dictionary . Judge Livingston was born on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington on the 23d of March , 1823 . His literary education he received at the College in Princeton . In the revolutionary war he served with distinction , and was aiddc-camp to General Arnold , at the battle of Saratoga , and indeed in the defeat and capture of Bur*oyne 's army . After this he studied law , and was a contemporary at the bar with General Hamilton , Mr Harrison , Judge Benson , Mr Troup , Mr Burr , and others , all of whom were very eminent lawyers . As an advocate his rank was among the highest . In fact , his talents were always thought more peculiarly adapted to the bar than to judicial duties . In his temperament he was very ardent and earnest , so that he was hurried on by the most implicit confidence in his client 's cause , and identified himself in devotedness with all his views , and felt an interest in his success almost as if the cause were his own . The same traits of intellectual character sometimes marked his decisions from the bench . Boldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , always accompanied them . On these occasions he was luminous and striking , far beyond the originality of the counsel in the case , the most eminent of whom were left behind him in the reasons given on their side of the question , when the judge decided in their favor . // We said , these pages show Judge Livingston to have been a scholar and a man of letters . And from a variety of other sources we understand this to have been remarkably the case . In the early part of his professional career , he stole many an hour from the forum , and from the severer studies of the law , and even from the nobler sciences of national and general jurisprudence , and gave them to the works of fine literature and taste . Of the ancient classics he was particularly fond . To the latest period of his life he read them with the greatest ease and delight . We understand that he never travelled on his long , laborious law circuits without taking some one of them as a cheering companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every moment of his time , which the pressing calls of duty on the bench did not extort from him , must be given to relaxation and repose . And so in fact it was with him . For to such minds as his , literature becomes , as it always ought to be , nothing but relaxation and repose . It is not surprising therefore , as has been well remarked , that he possessed a most copious and chaste and elegant diction . The eloquence of Judge Livingston was fervid , impressive , masculine , and persuasive ; his power of research uncommon ; his zeal untiring ; and his command of illustrative topics most rapid and comprehensive . He had a very powerful influence therefore with juries . On these occasions , indeed , he was always truly delightful ; for with all his ardor , he mingled a delicacy and courtesy , a courage and constancy , a facility of changing his ground and returning to the charge , after defeat or discomfiture , which surprised and sometimes astonished his audience . In the modern languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By his travels and his early residence in Europe , he learnt to speak the French and Spanish with as much fluency as his native tongue . His manners were uncommonly winning . In his general deportment he was affable , buoyant in he was full of candor and kindness ; of a liberal and benevolent spirit , an enlarged charity , a disposiPoLi to aid the humble and the oppressed ; and that he was a steady and bold asserter of the principles of civil and religious liberty . In the general diffusion of intelligence , he took an active interest . He aided the public schools personally ; and for // the purpose of improving and extending their good influences , he often wrote communications in the papers of the day . As a father and as a friend , he was admirable , and won the affections of all who knew him . As a political opponent , no one was more inflexible , but at the same time , no one was more kind to his adversaries . These traits in the character of Judge Livingston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimately acquainted with him ; and we were again and again assured , that we could not over-estimate his merits . In further illustration of them we shall conclude with the following extracts from a very able obituary notice , which was published at New York , immediately after his decease. * His judicial character is , of course , the most interesting to the public , and as a Judge , his character was very peculiar and strongly marked . He was eminently a man of genius , of strong , vivid , and rapid perceptions , and the frankness of his character always prompted the immediate impression of his convictions . Such a disposition and habit must of course , and not unfrequently , induce mistakes . But here intervened a redeeming principle resulting from one of the most peculiar characteristics of his happily composed nature . For a man of strong and ardent genius , and profound learning , and these too rendered conspicuous by great reputation and high office , Judge Livingston was in one respect , almost a miracle . He seemed to be without vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to arguments in opposition to his declared opinions merely from official decorum , but his mind was literally and truly open to conviction . Others may have committed fewer errors , but who has left fewer unrepaired 1 * Livingston was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of New York , in January , 1802 , and of the Supreme Court of the United States , as the successor of Mr Justice Patterson , in December , 1806 . He was buried under Wall Street Church , in the city of New York ; and in the church itself is the following inscription , written by a friend at the request of his family . M. S.

He never manifested anything of the petulance or insolence of station . He ever seemed to be of opinion , that there was a dignity in the administration of justice , which reached even to its inferior ministers ; and without ever forgetting the propriety of his station , he treated the gentlemen of the bar as his friends and brethren , over whom he was called , as it were , to preside for some temporary purpose . To say that he was just and impartial , would be low and inadequate praise . He was prompt , laborious , and indefatigable . His own ease and pleasure always gave way at the call of duty . He never delayed or slighted anything . He often labored most without the stimulus of fame . He was , perhaps , rather too averse to the parade of display and publication . Causes were not unfrequently heard at his own house , and many of his most elaborate opinions , the result of laborious and profound investigation , were communicated only to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life  --  and it is there that a man 's true character is best known , and its influence-he was far above the reach of commonplace commendation . None but those who saw him in retirement and knew him intimately , can appreciate his character in this respect . He was ever most affectionate , attentive and considerate , exacting little for himself , and always consulting the interests and feeling of his family . The main object of his life , at least that which seemed to interest him most , was to transfuse his own knowledge and character into the minds of his children . Every hour that could be spared from his public duties , and more than could well be spared from the time necessary for his relaxation and the care of his health , was devoted to their education .
