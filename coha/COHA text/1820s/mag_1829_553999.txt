txt ART . VIII. - The Works of slntonio Canova in Sculpture and Modelling , engraved in Oudine by Henry .1*loses , with Descriptions f*.om the Italian of the Countess . dlbrizzi , and a Biographical . Iliemoir by Count Cicognara. 2 vols. folio . London . 1624 . IN a preceding number of this journal , * we gave some account of the principal events in the life of Canova , and of the most remarkable among the multiplied productions of his chisel . Not long after the article containing it appeared , the grave closed over this celebrated artist , who died at Venice on the thirteenth // of October , 1822 , in the sixty-fifth year of his age , universally lamented throughout the civilized world , as one of those rare individuals whose extraordinary and unrivalled genius throws a lustre on the period in which they live , and whose loss is , in the nature of things , altogether irreparable . The biographical memoirs and collections of engravings of his works , which have appeared since his death , supply materials for a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we avail ourselves with pleasure of the opportunity for rendering complete justice to the memory of this great artist , who has particularly recommended himself to the attention of Americans , by consecrating one of his works to the honor of our political savior and father . A tribute of this kind is the more necessary in this country , because the British journalists , with their characteristic jealousy of all foreign excellence , have studiously underrated the merit of Canova , even since his death , in the vain attempt to give their own countryman , Chantrey , a preeminence over him , which that justly distinguished and amiable sculptor would himself as little dream of claiming , as any competent judge of assigning it to him . One of the publications , from which we drew the materials for our former article on *his subject , was the series of descriptions of the works of Canova by the Countess Albrizzi of Venice ; and we mentioned , in the course of our remarks , that that lady had announced the intention of publishing a collection of engravings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryman and friend . The work now before us , although no satisfactory account is given of its origin hy the British editors , appears to be a reprint , in an English dress , of the one which Mad . Albrizzi has probably published in pursuance of this intention , but which has not yet reached us . It contains a complete collection of engravings in outline of all the productions of Canova , accompanied by the commentaries of this lady , and hy a hiography , which is , however , not from her pen , but that of Count Cicognara , a Venetian nobleman , well known to the world by his literary talent and taste in the fine arts . The descriptions of Mad . Albrizzi are of a poetical rather than critical character , and probably appear to more advantage in their original shape , than in the present translation , which , however , is not a had one . The biography is a judicious and unpretending narrative of the leading incidents in a life of exclusive and untiring devotion to art , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in the charming productions of the artist .. We propose , in the present article , to lay before our readers a concise sketch of these events , with such observations on the works of Canova as may be suggested by the descriptions and engravings here given of them , or by the personal survey which we have had opportunity to take of some of the most remark .. able among the number . Canova was a native of Possagno , a village situated near the city of Asolo at the foot of the Venetian Alps . The tab ent for sculpture was hereditary in his family , having been exercised by his father aud grandfather with a good degree of success in the construction of monuments , altars , and other works , mostly for the interior decoration of the churches in their neighborhood . His father died while Canova was yet an infant , and it was from his grandfather , who still continued at a very advanced age the practice of the art , that he received his first instruction in the mechanical part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attracted the attention of several noblemen of taste , in the immediate vicinity of his native village , who supplied the young sculptor with the means of removing to Venice and studying under the first artists of that city , which he accordingly did , at about fourteen years of age . He began very early to exhibit , both in the choice of his subjects and in his mode of treating them , the lofty spirit and correct taste which afterwards raised him to the head of his art . His Orpheus and Euryd ice , which were executed in his sixteenth and seventeenth years , though inferior to his later productions , excited in a singular degree the admiration of his countrymen , and announced the dawn of a genius of the highest promise . They are still preserved in the palace of his earliest patron , the Patrician Giovanni Falien , at Asolo . The success of these and several other groups and statues , which he executed not long after , encouraged his friends to afford him the opportunity of studying at Rome ,  --  * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fine arts . He was accordingly placed there at the close of the year 1780 , under the protection of the Venetian ambassador , the Chevalier Girolamo Zulian . As a provision for the expenses of his residence at Rome , the govcrnment of his native republic voted him an annual pension of three hundred ducats for three years . Such were the circumstances under which Caaova entered on his brilliant career . From this time forward he passed his // life , with the exception of occasional short excursions for recreation or business , in his workshop at Rome , where he continued his labors with uninterrupted assiduity through the whole series of political revolutions which shook the world around him , and swept into their vortex almost every other individual of any note or talent in Italy . No clearer proof could be given of the absorbing and nnconquerahle passion for his art with which he was possessed , and which alone could have raised him to the distinction he attained . He was aware , before he left Venice , of the great inferiority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on the pure and perfeet models of antiquity . In this correct taste he was confirmed and encouraged , upon his arrival at Rome , as well by his own observations upon the works of art , which he there saw , as by the advice and opinion of the best judges from all parts of Europe , whom he met with in ihat city . After allowing him a sufficient time to prepare himself , by a proper course of study , for new efforts , the Venetian ambassador placed at hisdisposal a fine block of marble , and invited him to execute , upon a subject of his own choice , a work which should furnish a specimen of the improvement that he had derived from his residence at Rome . Canova , laboring in the palace and under the eye of the ambassador , who has thus associated his name with the glory of his protege , converted this block of marble into the group of Theseus and the i*linotaur ,  --  the first of his works in which he exhibited the maturity of his talent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young artist ; and the execution of it may be said to form an epoch in the history of modern sculpture . The circumstances attending this interesting moment in the life of Canova , are related by his biographer in the Ibhlowing terms ; On his arrival at Rome , Canova had experienced the kindest reception from the Venetian ambassador , and had free access to his splendid mansion . This enlightened and accomplished nobleman , soon becoming impressed with a hij*h sense of the merit and powers of the young sculptor , procured from Venice a cast in plaster of the group of Divdalns arid Icarus , which be had cxccute ( l in that city , for the purpose of exhihiting it to the artists and connoisseurs at Rome . The house of time ambassador was , indeed , a kind of athemunin , and frequented by all the i*ersons most distinguished by talents and genius in that city . ( hi the occasion of the first production of this group , he was surrounded // by Cades , Volpato , Battoni , Gavin Hamilton , Puccini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated the work with silent astonishment , not daring to censure what , although at variance with the style then followed , commanded their admiration , and revealed the brightest prospects . The embarrassment of the youth at this juncture was extreme , and he frequently spoke of it afterwards as one of the most anxious moments of his life . From this state he was , however , soon relieved by the friendly and paternal address of Gavin Hamilton , exciting him to unite with so exact and beautiful an imitation of nature the fine taste and beau id*al of the ancients , of which Rome contained so many models ; predicting , at the same time , that by such a course he would greatly pass the limits which had been reached by the moderns . But the censure which he overheard from one who stood behind him , was more agreeable to the young artist than any direct eulogium . This Aristarchus observed , that , from the effect produced on the observer by the naked forms so carefully finished in this group , they must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were *vholly the result of his severe study of the human form , entirely unassisted by mechanical means . This greatly encouraged the young artist , and convinced him that he had already raised himself above the mediocrity of his contemporaries . From the moment of his arrival at Rome , he had commenced a severe and profound study of the great models of ancient art , without , however , neglecting the fruits of his previous close observation of nature , the expression of which he always proposed to himself to make a distinguishing quality in his works . He had a prolound contempt for all conventional modes in the arts , and was led , even in that early age , by a correct taste , rather than by instruction , to prefer , among the Irmonurnents of ancient art , those which were of the age of Phidias , in which the lofty conceptions of the artist are most closely united with truth of expression ,  - -  a decision which has since been fully confirmed by the exhibition made to Europe by the British Museum of the first certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proper to take here a slight survey of the various circumstances which had 1 ) romoted the improvement in the arts previously to the arrival of Canova at Rome ; for the influence of the genius of one man could not have been wholly adequate to the reconducting of art into its true but forsaken paths , unless the approach to them had been cleared by the sound judgment of some of his pr ' *decessors , and without the aid of other favoring circumstances . Indeed the influence of established practice and professional jealousy created no trifling obstacles to the progress // of Canova . These , however , his modest and unpresuming conduct aided greatly to remove , while an air of triumph and superiority would , by wounding the feelings of his rivals , have created additional opposition . Already , however , many causes had existed , tending to an improvement in the arts . Among them may be enumerated the encouragement to right studies given by the Marquess Tanucci at Naples , the protection afforded to literature , and the arts at the courts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pius the Sixth , and by Cardinal Silvio Valenti , the Colbert of the holy See ; by the Albani , the Zelada , and the Borgia ; the studies of Mazzochi , Bajardi , Galliani , of the two Venuti , of Maffei , Gesnero , Gori , Passeri , Paoli , and Amaduzzi ; the good taste diffused by Cochin , Bellicard , Burlington , Mariette , and Sir William 1-Tamilton ; the Jierculanean discoveries ; the travels of St Non , Norden , Pococke , Wheeler , Spon , Revet , and Stuart ; the exact admeasurement of ancient architecture by Des Godetz ; the masterly works of the Piranesi cn the antiquities of Rome ; the illustration and rendering public of galleries and museums by means of engravings ; the opening of baths ; the study of the galleries of the Vatican ; the excavation of old edifices ; the collection and illustration of old inscriptions by Morcelhi , Marini , Zoega , Fea , and Akerblad ; the great works of Visconti and Winkelman ; the enlightened taste of the Earl of Bristol and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius and profound erudition of Haiicarville ; the valuable collections of I-hamilton , Jenkins , and Agincourt ; the perfection of the intaghios of Pikler ; the fine and bold designs of Flaxman ; the attraction given to these studies by the accomplished Algarotti ; the triumph over prejudices of the formidable Milizia ; the labors of Temanza and Lanzi. - These all supplied immense sources of aid to the young Phidias , and seemed to him to point out that moment as the favorable one for giving a different direction to sculpture from that which was pursued by living masters . It is remarkable , that both sculpture and architecture should at this time owe their revival to the genius of the Venetians ; for while Canova was executing his first great works at Rome , Ottone Calderari was reviving the Grecian taste in Vicenza , and Querenghi , at St Petersburgh , was fulfilling , in a masterly style , the magnificent views of that imperial court , by the erection of sumptuous and elegant edifices of every description . It must be allowed , however , that no ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the false and vicious rules of art which then prevailed , parti**ularly in sculpture , as not one of his contemporaries had , with all the incitements which have been enumerated , yet advanced a single step in that direction . Indeed the works which Canova first saw at Rome , the productions of // Agostino Penna , Pacili , Bracci , Sibilla , Pacetti , and Angilini are already fallen into total neglect ; neither can we discover in them the source of the slightest ex*itement to the improved style which the Venetian pupil afterwards acquired . The Chevalier Zulian now saw the importance of giving effective assistance to the developing powers of Canova . He therefore placed at his command a fine block of marble , to be devoted to a subject of his own choice , and to show the profit derived from his residence and studies at Rome . This was the first marble sculptured by Canova on those true principles by which he had proposed to himself to be guided in his works ; a composition by which a new path was opened to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we chose was Theseus , conqueror of the Minotaur , and the work was conducted throughout in the palace of the Venetian ambassador . It was a highly interesting momeut , when his excellent patron produced a cast of the head only of the Theseus to a party of the first artists and critics assembled in his house , without informing them whence it had been obtained . All concurred , however varying in other points , in pronouncing it to be of Grecian workmanship ; and many thought they had seen the marble from which it had been taken , not being able , however , to recollect exactly where it was . But when the ambassador conducted them before the original and entire group , their surprise was indeed extreme , and they were forced to exclaim , that by this work art had commenced a new career . On this occasion it may be said , that Theseus was the conqueror , not only of the Minotaur , but of Envy also , forcing from his rival artists the first homage of their admiration of Canova , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher degree of perfection than had been attained by any sculptor since its revival in Italy . ' In this group the Minotaur is represented , necording to some of the traditions , with the body of a man and the head of a bull . The contest is already decided , and the lifeless carcass of the fallen monster is carelessly thrown over a rock , which thus furnishes a natural pedestal to the group . The young conqueror is seated on the body , resting his ri6ht hand on one of the thighs , and holding in his left the club with which he has achieved his victory . His shoulders are thrown back a little as if he were reposing from a stroab effort , while with his head gently inclining forward he fixes a look of proud satisfaction on the face of his antagonist . The subject of this work is very happily chosen . The uncouth form of the monster , while it gives variety to the figures , furnishes a fine foil to the // exquisitely symmetrical shape of the hero . The attitudes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a unity and pyramidical appearance to the group , which are always pleasing qualities when they naturally result from the subject . The action represented ,  --  a prince , in the flower of youth and beauty , adventuring his life in an almost desperate conflict for the purpose of delivering his country from a savage imposition , - is fitted to awaken emotions which tend to increase the effect of the work . The figure and countenance of Theseus are in the highest style of manly beauty . rlhe features express the stern delight of triumph , mingled with contempt for the brutal enemy . As the situation is substantially the same , so the predominant expression of the features was probably borrowed from that of the Apollo Belvidere , who is supposed to be represented as having just slain the serpent Python with an arrow . The division of the lips , and the disdainful curl of the upper one , are seen alike in both ; but the difference in the attitudes removes the appearance of anything like servile irnitation in Canova , who has in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same sentiment which is shown in the face of the Apollo . The Perseus , one of his later productions , is a direct copy of the celebrated antique statue in question , but is perhaps a less successful exhibition of the talent of the artist than the Theseus . The Countess Albrizzi expresses in strong terms her admiration of the beauty of this statue . Men , ' says she , who behold it , would fain resemble Theseus , while the fairer sex experience all the emotions of Ariadne . ' We have dwelt at some length on this group , because , while it is in itself one of the most finished productions of the chisel of Canova , it is particularly remarkable as the one which opened the series of his mature efforts . It is now , we believe , in possession of Count de Fries , a banker at Vienna , of the house to which our countryman , Mr David Parish , was attached . The talent exhibited in the Theseus gave celebrity at once to the name of Canova , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of Pope Clement the Fourteenth ( Ganganelli ) , in the church of the Holy Apostles at Rome . The complete success with which he acquitted himself of this honorable and arduous commission , is attested , for those who trust more to the judgment of professed connoisseurs than their own , by the following letter , in which the formidable // Milizia ,  --  as he is called in the above extract ,  --  a critic not less distinguished for the uncompromising severity of his judgment , than for the perfection of his taste , expressed his opinion of the monument of Ganganelli soon after its erection in 1787 . In the church of the Holy Apostles , near to the Sacristy , and fronting to one of the side aisles , a mausoleum has been erected to the late Pope Ganganelli , by Antonio Canova , a Venetian sculptor . So great is the simplicity of this composition , that it seems all facility , but it is nevertheless full of talent and difficulty . What repose ! what elegance ! what harmony ! Both the sculptural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are highly classical . Canova may indeed be reckoned among the ancients . I hardly know whether he belongs more to Athens or to Corinth , but of this I feel assured , that if in the best times of Grecian art a subject of this nature had been to he treated , it would have been by such a work as this . During the twenty-six years which I have lived in this city of the world , I have never before seen such universal admiration excited by any work of art as by this . The most intelligent and liberal artists pronounce it to be the nearest approach to the ancients of all the productions of modern sculpture . Eveii the Jesuits can praise and admire this marble Ganganelli , which certainly may be deemed a miracle of that Pope , who will derive as much glory from this monument as from the suppression of that order . If anything were needed to convince us that this is a perfect work , it would be fhrnished by the censures of the Michacl-Angelists , Berninists , and Borrominists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest beauties , charging the drapery , the outlines , and expression , with being Grecian ; - " Dio abbia picta di loro . " ' Of the funeral monuments executed by Canova , the most remarkable are the one now mentioned in honor of Pope Ganganelli , that of Pope Clement the Thirteenth ( Rezzonico ) , in the church of St Peter 's at Rome , which was finished in the year 1792 , and that of the Archduchess Christina of Austria , which was erected in 1805 by desire of her husband , the Duke of Saxe Teseben , in the church of the Augustine Friars at Vienna . These three compositions are all of the first order of merit , and quite unrivalled by anything of the kind in Europe . The last is generally rebarded as the finest of the three , perhaps because the artist has given greater latitude in this than in the others to the tender and amiable feelings that formed the basis of his own moral constitution , and determined // the leading characteristics of his style in sculpture , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . The description of this monument by the Countess Albrizzi is particularly full and interesting . It xviii be read , we think , with pleasure , although it loses of course a part of its effect when not accompanied by the engravings . This mausoleum , placed in the church of the Augustines at Vienna , is in memory of Christina of Austria , daughter of Maria Theresa , and wife of Duke Albert of Saxe Teschen . This beautiful and pathetic composition was executed by Canova at the desire of her afflicted husband , whose grief must be soothed and alleviated by the contemplation of the celestial figures which here so finely express the virtues of her whose memory he so fondly cherishes . The monument , the material of which is a greyish marble , presents one side of a pyramid to the spectator , being only slightly raised from the xvall against which it rests . It is placed upon an ample base , from which two steps are raised and form the approach to the door of the tomb , over which , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AusTRIACA3* . ALBERTI . SAxoNI*m PRINCIPIS . CONJUGI . There are nine figures employed in this monument , besides the lion and the medallion . They are all of the natural size , and may be divided into four groups . The first , which occupies the middle part , consists of an allegorical figure of Virtue , with two young females bearing torches . Virtue is represented in the form of a young matron of a dignified hut afflicted aspect , bearing before her the funeral urn , on which , bending down , she rests her forehead . She is attired in a rich tunic and a mantle , gracefully and appropriately disposed ; her hair is unbound and spread in a disorderly manner over her shoulders , and her head is encircled with an olive crown . Ascending the steps , which are spread with a rich carpet , she approaches the door of the tomb . The attendant , who goes before her , has already reached the entrance , where her steps seem for a moment arrested by the awful feelings which the place inspires ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark abode , she prepares to enter . The pious attitude of this young female , her loosened tresses falling down in rich curls upon her shoulders , her simple attire and modest step , give to her figure a grace and expression which , unaided by the effect of countenance , I have never seen equalled . The other attendant , who is behind , and is seen in profile , has the same simplicity of dress and character . With downcast eyes and slow and devoted step she follows her celestial conductor . Two wreaths of flowers , joined at the top of the urn , connect // these figures , which , from the depth and harmony of the sentiment that unites them , would separately form a complete and charming composition . They are followed , at a short distance , by the second group , observing in some degree the order of a procession . It consists of a female figure , whom , from the gentleness of her aspect , we recognise to be Beneficence ; a blind and aged man whom she is leadincr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the simplicity and grace of the Grecian manner . Her hands are sorrowfully crossed before her , and her eyes fixed on the ground with an air of gentleness and affliction . So perfect is the character and expression of this eloquent figure , that she awakens within us all the heightened feelings that the most pathetic poetry could convey . She has ascended the first step , and is followed by the old man , who , leaning on her arm , tries , with the aid of his staff , to raise himself on the step . His appearance bespeaks the feebleness of age and poverty ; and his countenance , on which acute sorrow is depicted , is turned towards the tomb , which probably contains his best friend and benefactress . The child , who stands beside him , and is represented with a simplicity conformable to her tender age , is in the humble attitude of prayer . In this group the artist makes a lively allusion to the warmth and readiness of benevolence for which the Princess was so much distinguished . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short space between the first and second groups ; and if our feelings are excited by these deeply impassioned figures , the fine diagonal line in which they cross the steps of the monument is no less pleasing to the eye . Opposite to these figures , on the left , is a magnificent lion , lyincr crouching on the upper step , who seems the faithful and eternal guardian of the monument . Seated beside him on the steps , is a winged genius , whose form and aspect discover his celestial origin . A mantle , spread beneath him , protects his delicate limbs , while , bending forward and leaning with his right arm and side against the lion , he steadfastly and mournfully looks on the funeral procession . His left hand rests upon the shield of the house of Saxony , of which he is the tutelary genius . The fourth group , which occupies the upper part of the pyramid , is of a more exalted character . The figure of Felicity is there represented , bearing up*vard the image of the Princess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lightness of her motion , her serene and heavenly countenance , her delicate limbs , are all of the most perfect taste and execution . On the other side , a little winged genius flies towards her bearing a branch of palm . Favored by heaven in an illustrious birth and splendid destiny , // this Princess is no less felicitous in possessing such a tomb , where the memory of her virtues , which are symbolized by the most perfect creations of genius , is perpetuated , and which will continue to be an object of interest and admiration so long as virtue and genius shall be regarded on earth . ' We have never had the pleasure of seem * this monument , but the effect of it , even in the imperfect shape of an engraved outline , is very great . In the work before us there are five engravings of it , one representing the entire work , and the others respectively the four groups of figures which are specified in the above description . The fourth group , which is placed near the apex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of Felicity , suspended in the air without any visible support , bearing a medallion with the head of the Archduchess , attended by a little winged genius with a palm-branch , is to us less agreeable than the others , and might , we think , have been omitted without injuring the effect of the monument . It was probably thought necessary to introduce somewhere the face of the Princess . In general the effect of winged human figures , which , if they be well managed , is often agreeable in poetry and even in painting , is positively unpleasant in sculpture . The essential incongruity of the combination is here so apparent , that the imagination can not lose sight of it and the main impression suggested is that of a person painfully hovering in the air , without sufficient support and in imminent danger of a fall . A still stronger impression of the same kind is of course produced by the view of a figure suspended in the air , without wings or any visible support whatever . Of the other groups , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the most attractive . The art with which the sculptor has communicated a mournful expression to the leadin figure which is just entering the monument , and of which the back part only is visible , is truly remarkable . The view of these charming groups recalls to mind the exquisite allegorical figures which the delicate genius of Collins has collected round the hallowed mould ' of the brave who fell in the battle of Fontenoy , the gray pilgrim honor , ' Spring , with dewy fingers cold , ' and the weeping hermit Freedom ; ' and again in the dirge on Colonel Ross ; The thoughts which musing Pity pays , And fond Remembrance loves to raise , Your faithful hours attend ; // Still Fancy , to herself unkind , Awakes to grief the softened mind , And points the bleeding friend . ' O'er him , whose doom thy virtues grieve Aerial forms shall sit at eve , And bend the pensive head ; And , fallen to save his injured land . Imperial Honor 's awful hand Shall point his lonely bed . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat less celebrity , which Canova executed , that of the poet Alfieri , in the church of Santa Groce , or the Holy Cross , at Florence , is the one most worthy of note , as well for the interesting character of the subject , as from the perfection of the work . Canova , like other artists of transcendent genius , was often compelled , probably with some regret , to lavish the treasures of his talent upon noble mediocrity and royal nothingness ; but we may readily conceive , on the other hand , with what inspiration and enthusiasm he must have labored to perpetuate the glory of his illustrious contemporary , who had effected in the poetry of their common country nearly the same revolution which he had himself brought about in the sculpture of modern Europe . Alfieri and Canova were the two great names in art of their day ; and the monument , which thus commemorates them in connexion , will he viewed with the deepest interest , independently of its merit as a work , by all future ages . The plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , like the spirit of him whom it records . It consists of a simple sarcophagus , the four corners of which are each ornameiited with a tragic mask , symbols of the dramatic genius of Alfieri ; and in the centre is sculptured his bust in a medallion , full of life and of that fire which ever glowed in his impetuous breast . On the medallion is inscribed , VIcT . ALFERIUS . AsT . Standing beside the tomb , and resting upon it her right arm , is a colossal female figure , with a turreted crown . With one hand she holds the border of her mantle . to her streaming eyes , while the other falls neglectedly at her side . In her majestic countenance , although clouded with grief , we observe that fine symmetry of features in which beauty consists , and which the rules of art require to be ever preserved . She is attired in a tunic , confined under the breast by a narrow band , over which is a **OL XXiX. - No. 65. 58 // regal mantle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , whose large and graceful folds give a wonderful dignity to her person . It is Italy weeping over her son , and with such tears as would be grateful even to the lofty spirit of Alfieri himself . On the base of the monument is sculptured a lyre , and underneath it the following inscription ,  --  VIcT . ALFEiHo . ASTENsi . ALoYsIA . E. STOLBERGIs . ALBANYA*. co*1ITIssA . Among the many noble tombs which adorn this church , that of Alfieri is distinguished by its grandeur , and particularly attracts the attention and admiration of the stranger . It is on this also , that at departing he casts his last glance , as if desirous of treasuring up in his memory so noble an object . May this temple , so sublime a monument of Italian glory , be ever preserved from the sacrilegious hand of violence , and may the ashes of Alfieri here find the repose which his impetuous and inflexible spirit ever disturbed when living . ' The sepulchral monuments executed by Canova would have been sufficient of themselves to have procured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with all their merit , they are perhaps not the highest , and certainly not the most pleasing efforts of his genius . The triumph of the plastic art , as of painting , lies in the representation of the human figure ; and it is obvious that the artist will have more room and better opporttlnity for developing his talent for this purpose , in proportion as his attention is less diverted from the main object by accessories of inferior importance . In sepulchral monuments there is generally a large mixture of architectural accessories , which a good deal injure the effect of the sculpture ; while in groups , statues , and busts , the human figures , which nie the proper objects of attention , are also the only ones . XVorks of this kind , therefore , are far more favorable for the exhibition of the sculptor 's skill ; and of the various classes of subjects to which they may be devoted , those again are the most happy , which afford the greatest latitude for the display of the naked figure . The executiort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of science , is after all an inferior branch of art . It is often abandoned by the best portrait painters to their pupils ; and in statues , the parts that are covered are in reality , as regards effect , almost wholly lost . We find accordingly , that the antique groups and statues , which are the most celebrated , and are in fact considered as indicating the perfection of the art , have little or no drapery ; and that of those among them in which draperies are employed , // the naked parts alone attract much attention . As statues and groups afford hy far the best field for the exercise of talent , so it is in them that the genius of Canova displayed itself to the greatest advantage and under its l ) eculiar characteristics . The number of his productions of this class is so astonishingly great , that we shall not undertake even to recapitulate , much less to comment upon them ; but shall content ourselves with making a few remarks upon three or four of those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the very best , and at the same time most decidedly original statues , is the Penitent . JJ/Jagdalen . It was executed by Canova in 1796 , and intended as a present to his native city ; but afterwards passed into the hands of the French , and now forms a part of the collection of Count Sommariva at Paris , where it has a small room entirely to itself , like the Venus de ' Medici in the gallery of Florence , and the exquisite Ariadne of Danneker in that of the banker Bethman at Frankfort . The Magdalen is placed in the centre of this apartment upon a pedestal about three feet high . The figure is of the natural size , and is seated on a rock in the oriental fashion with the feet turned back , and the body resting on them . The arms are extended over the upper part of the thighs , with the palms of the hands upwards and supporting a small cross , upon which the eyes are intensely fixed . The head is bent slightly forward ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked with a strong and deep expression of sorrow . The dishevelled hair falls loosely over the back and shoulders . A slight drapery veils a part of the front of the figure ; a cord passes round the waist , while a skull is placed on one side upon the rock . Three engravings are given in the work before us of this fine statue , which we have also had opportunity to examine ourselves . Although the subject is not of that class in which the genius of Canova has been thought to take most delight , the execution of the work is perhaps equal in perfection to that of any of the others ; nor is there any appearance in it of the affectation , with which some of them have been at times reproached , The attitude* though rather unusual , at least in our latitudes , is perfectly easy , an ( l the form and features true to the style of beauty which belongs to the character . Settled grief dwells in every line of the countenance , and diffuses itself over every part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of is // even on a side view and when the face is not visible . Nothing indeed can be finer in its way than one of these side views . It presents the flowing outline of a beautiful female form with proportions rather full than slender , but nicely symmetrical . The upturned sole of the delicate foot , the recumbent thigh swelling under the resistance of the legs and feet on which it reposes , the gracefully reclining body , the smooth and gently rounded shoulders , and the finely turned arms and hands , are all finished and disposed with exquisite taste and skill . At the view of so many beauties , voluptuous emotions begin to steal upon the mind ; but the cord that surrounds the waist of the lovely sufferer , the mysterious symbol of torture and penitence that is seen in her hands , the drooping head , the dishevelled hair , the general attitude of utter desolation and abandonment , chasten every idle thought , and inspire , even without the aid of the countenance , the deepest sentiments of melancholy and pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to less advantage , the attention is chiefly engaged with the features . These , as we remarked above , are in the finest style of Grecian beauty , but impressed with the stamp of settled grief . No ray of light enlivens the gloom of this beclouded mind . The cross itself , upon which the unhappy victim of passion fixes her gaze , is still a sign of terror rather than of consolation ; and the expression would be that of absolute despair , were there not around the lips a sweetness indicating patient resignation , which holds out a gleam of hope , that her sincere repentance will in time be accepted , and that heavenly grace will descend in whispers of peace to quiet the alarms of her troubled conscience . In another statue on the same subject , executed for the Earl of Liverpool in the year 1622 , the fair penitent is stretched at her length upon a rock , with a cross by her side , in an attitude which recalls to mind that of Eloisa , in Pope 's Epistle ,  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that painting or sculpture has ever produced . See in her cell sad Eloisa spread , Propt on some tomb , a neighbor of the dead . In each low wind methinks a spirit calls , And more than echoes talk along the walls . Here , as I watched the dying lamps around , From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound . " Come , sister ! come , " it said , or seemed to say ; " Thy place is here , sad sister ! come away . // Once like thyself ' , I trembled , wept , and prayed , Love 's victim then , though now a sainted maid . But all is calm in this eternal sleep ; Here grief forgets to groan , and love to weep , E'en superstition loses every fear ; For God , not man , absolves our frailties here . " ' Although the poet in this exquisite Epistle , and the sculptor in the two Magdalens to which we have alluded , have chosen to personify Repentance , under the form of a beautiful female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would perhaps be more truth to nature and better means of producing effect , at least in poetry , by assuming for this purpose the internal agony of successful and triumphant guilt . When our deviations from the path of rectitude fail in producing for us the pleasures and advantages we had expected , such is the infirmity of the human heart , that we naturally bewail our ill success rather than our errors . He repented of his faults , ' says Goethe , in describing the last moments of some wretched vagabond , He repented of his faults much , hut of his misfortunes much more . ' Er bereute seine Febler sehr , Ja ; and bejammerte sein Unglock noch viel mchr . ' In these cases imagination brings before us the objects which we have failed to attain under new attractions ; and instead of really repenting of our vicious desires , we rather regret that we were not permitted to realize them , and thus to become even more guilty than we have been . The poet , by presenting different trains of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the means of exhibiting correctly this conflict of opposite and various feelings ; and the truth , energy , and beauty with which it is described , forms in fact the great merit of Pope 's Eloisa . But the painter and sculptor , who can only represent a single moment of time with its predominant emotion , are compelled to set before us images of Repentance , which , however touching , are to a certain extent untrue to nature . Cromwell in his palace , and not Bonaparte upon his rock , would be the true type of the torments of guilty ambition . When the flush of triumph is over , and experience has proved the nothingness ,  --  considered as elements of happiness in themselves , and independently of the means by which they are acquired and the manner in which they are used ,  --  // of the power , the wealth , the fame , the pleasure , in pursuit of which he has defied the suggestions of his own conscience , and trampled on the happiness of all around him , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice looks hack with unavailing regret upon the peace of mind which he has lost for ever . It is then that Virtue appears to him in all her natural charms , heightened , if possible , by the coloring of Fancy ; and that he begins , like the evil spirit in Paradise Lost , to pine his loss ' ; or in the words of the Latin poet , from whom Milton imitated the passage , Virtutem videat , intabescatque relictd . ' This is the moment of real repentance , a secret agony that dwells , unperceived by the world , in the inmost recesses of the heart , while perhaps the face is radiant with smiles , and the body rohed in purple . The sculptor , whose art dwells only in sensible images , has really no means of delineating these feelings , and must leave it to the poet in his wider range of observation and description to do them justice . For these reasons the two admirable statues , which we have just been describing , are perhaps , in strict correctness of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of accessories , which direct the imagination of the spectator , they produce the effect intended . While they are among the very best , they are also , as we have already remarked , among the most completely original works of Canova , and would suffice of themselves to refute the invidious suggestions sometimes made by his enemies , that he was a mere imitator of the ancients , and entirely destitute of any creative genius of his own . Upon the force of this objection , taken in general , we shall presently have occasion to make a few remarks . Among the other statues of Canova , the Perseus and the two Venuses , though perhaps not decidedly the first in effect , are particularly remarkable as being direct imitations of the 4pollo Belvidere and the Venus de ' . Medici . A comparison of these beautiful copies with their still more beautiful models is at once an interesting study , and will afford a convenient occasion for a brief inquiry into the merit of Canova in itself , and as compared with that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an artist at Milan , but the Pope insisted on retaining it at Rome , and placing it in the Vatican Gallery as a substitute for the Apollo Belvidere , // which was then in the Louvre at Paris . The subject is analogous to that of the Apollo , and the general plan of the execution is the same . Perseus is represented in the moment of his victory over the Gorgon Medusa , and holds out at arm 's length in his left hand the head which he has just cut off , while his right grasps a dagger . The weight of the figure reposes on the left leg , and the right one is drawn a little upward , and touches the ground only with the toes . The upper part of the body is slightly thrown back , and the face is turned with a look of scornful triumph upon that of the hideous enemy . The attitude and expression are therefore exactly the same with those of the famous original . There is , however , this important difference in the execution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural roundness and smoothness to the limbs of the Apollo , and has hardly represented the muscles at all , intending , as is commonly supposed , to indicate in this way the supernatural character of his subject . Canova , on the other hand , has brought out fully the entire muscular conformation proper to the age and constitution of his hero . In this particular the modern sculptor has , we think , shown a better judgment than the ancient one . Our idea of divinity is realized and embodied in human forms ( as far as it can be so realized and embodied ) by representing these forms as they exist at their highest point of perfection , and not by fantastic variations from the truth of nature . A distinct indication of the true shape of the limbs is as necessary to the beauty of a statue , as a correct representation of the features of the face ; and a god without muscles must be ranked , as such , with the other imaginary beings that people the heaven of the pagan mythology ,  --  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the two Venuses , one was executed in 1805 for the Grand Duke of Tuscany , but under the express condition that it should not occupy the place of the Venus de ' . llKliedici in the Florence Gallery ; the other is a repetition of the former with some variations , and was executed in 1820 for Mr Thomas Hope . Although the modesty of Canova led him to decline a formal competition with the celebrated antique which has just been mentioned , he has had it in view in b . th these statues , and in the latter still more directly than in the former . Both are , however , somewhat larger than the model , and depart so much from it in other respects , that they must he regarded as free imitations , or original works on the same subject , // rather than mere copies . In the one first executed , the goddess is just issuing from the bath . She bends the upper part of her body slightly forward , and presses to her breast , with both bands , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , and which hangs down in loose folds , forming a drapery that nearly covers the front of the statue . She turns her head towards her left shoulder as if listening ; and the beautiful countenance , as well as the attitude of the body and disposition of the arms and drapery , exhibits very decidedly the sentiment of alarm , as if she were afraid of being surprised by some unwelcome visitor . The Venus de ' Nedici has no drapery whatever ; arid although the attitude and disposition of the arms give to the statue an air of modesty which is one of its principal attractions , yet the countenance indicates complete tranquillity . The sentiment expressed is not the fear of surprise , but rather an instinctive delicacy which shrinks from exposure even in retirement . In the second Venus of Canova the proportions of the figure are rather fuller than in the first , and the disposition of the arms is nearly the same as in the Venus de ' Medici . The drapery is considerably reduced , and is secured by the right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the front of the figure , while the left arm and hand are drawn up before the breast . The expression of the countenance is that of entire tranquillity . In all these respects the sculptor has shown an evident intention to copy more closely than he did before the celebrated statue , which , as the poet of the Seasons enthusiastically expresses it , enchants the world . ' The Countess Albrizzi , illustrious herself for beauty as well as xvit , and of course a competent judge on the question , enlarges with warmth upon the perfection of both these statues , but declines expressing a preference for either . The shape of this Venus , ' she observes in reference to the second , is more formed than that of the other , and there is more of ease and repose in her posture arid features . The minutest difference which so consummate an artist has thought proper to make in two models of female beauty , executed at different periods of his life , is doubtless highly interesting ; but I deem it prudent to desist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauties , and advise the lover of art to to content himself , as I shall do , with tracing out and admiring the peculiar charms which each of them possesses . ' There are two repetitions of the former of these Venuses in its original // shape . The first belongs to the king of Bavaria . The second was executed for Lucien Bonaparte , and is now in possession of the Marquis of Lansdowne . Any one of these statues , or of the repetitions of them , would confer upon its author the fame of a first-rate sculptor , but when tried by the high standard which is properly applied to the works of Canova , they xviii not perhaps be considered as among his happiest efforts , and not being such , m ustof course fall below the famous models which are justly regarded as the masterpieces of the art . There are no circumstances , indeed , under which talent is exhibited with so little advantage as in direct imitations of the finished productions of others . A diligent study of the best models is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a correct taste ; and to make copies of them is for this purpose a useful exercise . But when it is the object of the artist to display the ripe fruits of his own genius , he should look for models directly and exclusively to nature , and rather avoid than seek such subjects as have already been treated in a masterly way . For in laboring upon them , if he aim at close imitation , the free developement of his genius is checked ; and if*n the other hand be rather seek to avoid servility , he is apt to run into a false direction for the mere purpose of being oririnal . In either case he loses the direct and unchecked following of nature , which is the only principle of excellence in art . If we compare in detail the Perseus and the Venuses of Canova with their respective models , it is easy to perceive the points in which the latter are inferior . Neither of the Venuses , however exquisitely beautiful they both may be , is equally perfect in shape or features with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a far more pleasing expression than the startled timidity of the others . The second Venus has nearly the expression of the antique ; but here again the fuller proportions are an unfortunate variation , because they contrast with the extreme and , as it were , ethereal delicacy which seems to be the leading characteristic of the subject . The Perseus , which we think sustains this dangerous comparison better than the Venuses , wants perhaps the exact truth to nature in the attitude and disposition of the limbs , which distinguishes the Apollo Belvidere , and brings out so happily the character of intellectual and moral sublimity , which the artist intended to impart to his work . The attitude of the Perseus has been said by some to // be impossible ; and if we grant that this statement of the objection is a strong exaggeration , it must yet perhaps be admitted that the figure has not the complete freedom which the expression of nobleness and superiority so peculiarly requires . We may conclude , on the whole , that notwithsianding the extraordinary merit of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preeminence which they have always been allowed to possess over all the other efforts of the art . There is something indeed in the nature of these subjects , combined with the perfection of the execution , which renders it nearly impossible that they can ever be surpassed or even equalled . The manly and the female form , each in its perfect state , and inspired by the moral expression that properly belongs to it , are the natural types of sublimity and beauty . When , therefore , the two have been represented with their respective attributes of imposing dignity and modest grace , in a style of execution which seems to realize our idea of per fection , it is evident that the capacity of the art for producing effect is exhausted . The best subjects have been treated in the best manner ; and nothing remains for succeeding artists , but to repeat them under all the disadvantages attending imitation , or to do the best they can with inferior subjects , which , however well treated , must necessarily produce inferior effects . A somewhat similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been carried , in point of execution , to a high degree of perfection ; but it is more remarkable in sculpture than in the rest , because there is no other in which any one or more particular subjects are so distinctly marked out by nature as the best . For these reasons the Apollo Belvidere and the Venus de ' Medici will probably be regarded for ever as the ne plus ultra of statuary , the matchless boast ' of the age , the country , and the unknown artists that produced them . We may imabine , though with difficulty , other groups of equal or even superior merit to the Laocoon ; because in the infinite variety of actions and passions that lie within the compass of possibility , and of the figures which they respectively bring together , there is no one combination that naturally strikes the mind as positively superior to all others . But for single statues which produce the two great effects of the art , sublimity and beauty , in their simplest , and of course purest and most perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects , are distinctly indicated // by nature as the best ; and the boldest imagination is wholly incapable of going beyond them . But while we think that Canova , in his attempt to copy these miracles of art has fallen below his inimitable originals , we are not prepared to admit that his genius was inferior to that of the sculptors who produced them . We conceive , on the contrary , that he carried the art to as high a pitch of perfectioii as it ever has been or ever can be brought to . We must estimate the extent of his talent , not by comparing his imitations with their models , but by comparing his best original works with those of other sculptors . Nor is it of course necessary , in order to vindicate his claim to an equality with the Grecian artists , that he alone should have produced a collection of masterpieces equal in number to the vast multitude of recovered antique works that fill the galleries of Europe . A single production of first-rate merit insures its author the glory of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cheerfully and generally accorded when his genius is prolific as well as powerful . Such was the character of that of Canova . His works , in almost all the departments of sculpture , are exceedingly numerous ; and the best of them stand , in our opinion , on a line of equality with the finest remains of antiquity . The Theseas , the Penitent . Magdalen , the Hebe , and twenty others that might be cited , are in no way inferior to the Fighting and Dying Gladiators , the Listening Slave , the . lntinous , and the numerous other antiques that belong , by general acknowledgme nt , to the first class . If none of them equal the Apollo and Venus , it is , as we have remarked above , because the latter are placed by the nature of their subjects beyond the possibility of rivalry . The Greeks are entitled , no doubt , to the peculiar honor of having first carried the art to perfection ; but this was effected by a gradual process , and the glory of doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ever memorable nation which produced them , and appertains in a very limited extent to any in ( lividual . It is indeed a most extraordinary thing , that amou , g the vast variety of communities , under so many different conditioas of society , which cover the face of the globe , one only should have discovered and applied to practice the true princil ) les of taste in the arts . And vet , strange as it is , it is nevertheless certain , that in Greece only ,  --  a little cluster of communities , hardly more populous at the time of their highest prosperity than the New England states are now , and oc // cupying a territory not more highly favored , as respects geographical extent and character , than ours ,  --  in Greece only , we say , and in those countries of modern times which have been inspired by her example , do we find any approach to perfection , or any appearance of correct taste in the arts , although they have all been attempted by almost all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal circumstances which would seem likely to facilitate success , such as wealth , population , and especially stability of political institutions . To what particular causes the Greeks owed this remarkable peculiarity in their national character , whether to some natural advantages of climate ( in which they yet seem to have possessed no decided preeminence ) , or , as is more probable , to their popular forms of government , which brought into action the sincere and unsophisticated opinions and feelings of the body of the community as the test of excellence of every description , is a question that we need not and can not here discuss . The fact , however , is undoubted . The honor of it , as we remarked above , belongs in the main to the Greeks as a nation , and not to particular individuals , although we may justly allow a very singular degree of merit to those arti*ts who , in each department , give as it were the finishing stroke to the work , however nearly it may have been brought to perfection by their immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved in the museum of the king of Bavaria , are a single step only behind those of Athens . They exhibit the true principles of taste , and want nothing but the perfect freedom and grace in the application of those principles , which belong to the later school of Phidias . Yet the final effort by which this celebrated sculptor brought the art to perfection , though not I ) erllaps more difficult than some of those by which it had been advanced to the state he found it in , has consecrated his name to perpetual remembrance , while those of all his predecessors are lost . To a glory like this , Canova can of course have no pretenslnn . His genius , like that of all modern sculptors , like those of the artists of the period to which belong nearly all the antique works that have come down to us , like those of the authors of the dpoiio Belvidere and the Venus de ' . liledici was inspired by the contemplation of the masterpieces of a former age . Next , however , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reviving the true principles of an art or science after they have long been lost ; and this , // we think , Canova has a right to claim . He must he looked upon as the real restorer of sculpture in modern times . Michel Angelo is doubtless an illustrious name ; but in all the arts which he exercised , though his genius was bold , creative , and imposing , his taste was imperfect ; and he exhibits the extravagance which is one of the symptoms of a still progressive and immature style . In painting he was excelled , in his own time , by Rafael ; and after the lapse of nearly three centuries , Canova has finally raised the sister art , from the point where Michael Angelo left it , to the antique standard of perfection , and has thus proved himself the Rafael of sculpture , and the Phidias of modern days . If the name of Phidias be justly regarded , and must always remain , the first and greatest in sculpture , that of Canova will rank for ever as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost , and some other happy genius , whose merit would of course be the same with his , shall again restore it to all its present lustre . In building , the taste of Michael Angelo , though not less objectionable than in painting and sculpture , has not yet been much improved upon by his successors . The architectural Phidias of modern days is yet to come ; and the probable place of his appearance , if we may venture to say it , without awakening the jealousy of rival nations , seems to be indicated with sufficient exactness by the granite quarries and popular institutions of our western continent . Such by the general acknowledgment of the age is the merit of Canova , and his rank when compared with other sculptors of ancient and modern times . But although the European public has been nearly unanimous in according to his works the tribute of enthusiastic approbation , he has yet found detractors even on the Continent ; and some of the leading British journalists , though evidently in a great measure uninformed respecting his productions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usual national partiality by attempting to depress his reputation below that of one of their own countrymen . This is the more remarkable , because the real judges of the art in England have given the strongest evidence of the value they set upon his works , in the eagerness they have shown to possess them . Some of the finest of them have been executed for or purchased by the principal personages in Great Britain , such as the Dukes of Wellington , Bedford , and Devonshire , Lord Liverpool , the Marquis of Landsdowne , // Mr Hope , Lord Browniow , and the King himself . It has , however , been ohjected to this great artist , that he has employed his genius too much upon subjects taken from the Greek mythology . The proper business of the artist , it it said , is to imitate *nature as he sees it around him . If he go back for subjects to Grecian history and fable , he will probably give us nothing more than repetitions of the works of the Grecian sculptors , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art . It is farther objected that in some of his statues there is an air of affectation , and a profusion of un- . meaning accessories in the way of ornament , which make them look like groups of opera dancers , rather than images taken from real life . The first of these objections , which is stated in detail , and with an air of much triumph , in the London Quarterly Review , seems to be founded in the mere spirit of wanton hypercriticism , which does not even take the pains to be consistent and plausible in error . It is admitted by all , that direct imitation of particular forms , that is , the taking of portraits , whether in painting or sculpture , is an inferior branch of art . But in treating historical subjects , the great merit of an artist does not lie in preserving with strict fidelity the figure and costume of his characters , but in powerful delineations of the passions belonging to the situation in which they are placed . In order to do this with success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind and in the varying action of the world around him ; but in displaying the results of this study , it is wholly unimportant whether he lay his scene in his own time , or in any former one , or in the fabulous epochs and regions of mythology . Shakespeare drew his materials for the character of Macbeth from his observations on the workings of ambition in himself and his contemporaries ; but the image is not the less true and striking , because the character is drest in a Scotch bonnet and plaid instead of the British costume of the age of Elizal ) eth . When a sculptor has produced a perfect image of the airy form , elastic step , and thoughtless gayety that belong to the spring of life , of what consequence is it whether he call his work Youth or Iiliebe , that is , whether he give it its proper name in Greek or in English ? The Adam and Eve of Milton 's Paradise Lost represent precisely the same subjects with the Apollo Belvidere and the Venus de ' Medici @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arts of // poetry and sculpture ; but is the effect , in either case , less striking because the nature so admirably delineated is not baptized with a modern European name ? Would the fair large front and eye sublime ' of Adam appear to greater advantage if his body were habited in a coat , waistcoat , and breeches ? Are the hyacinthine locks that Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustering , but not beneath his shoulders broad , ' less graceful than the flowing wig of the age of Louis the Fourteenth , or the convenient crop of the present ? Every impartial reader will reply without hesitation in the negative . But while it is thus a matter of indifference where the artist lays the scene of his work , provided it be true to nature , there may be , on the other hand , particular classes of subjects which , for accidental reasons , are particularly favorable to the exercise of each of the arts . And without going into general considerations , which would carry us too far , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as allow the representation of flowing draperies and of the naked human figure . Draperies of all kinds occasion , as we have already suggested , an expense of labor for a comparatively trifling effect ; and the stiff costumes of the modern world , however well they may be managed in painting ( and even there they are in general sufficiently ungraceful ) , are intolerable in marble . The historical and mythological personages of antiquity are therefore really superior to all other subjects for the purposes of sculpture ; not because there is a magic virtue in the name of Greece or of antiquity , but for the simple reason , that a swanlike neck and a finely turned arm are more agreeable objects to contemplate than a starched ruff and a sleeve d la gigot . In frequently working upon this class of subjects , Canova has , therefore , exhibited good sense and a correct understanding of the means of producing effect ; while the perfection with which he has treated various other subjects of a different kind , demonstrates that he is in no way indebted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other objection , that in some of his works there is a childish expression and a profusion of useless accessories , has perhaps some slight foundation in truth , but does not affect his general reputation , because it applies only to a few hasty efforts of little or no consequence . In stating that the groups of Canova appear like opera dancers rather than ima*es of real life , // the critic had probably in view two or three models for works in relievo , particularly those of Venus dancing with the Graces , and of Helen carried off by Theseus . In these productions certain garlands , similar to those which are often employed in the ballets of the French opera , are in fact introduced , and probably furnished the hint for this flattering and candid criticism . But without inquiring here , whether a garland of flowers , one of the most beautiful and poetical objects in nature , be or be not absolutely inadmissible in sculpture because it is occasionally used at the opera , we may add , that the aforesaid models were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute them in marble . They have been preserved in the collections of engravings by the effect of that religious reverence that attaches importance to every trifle connected with the objects of its just veneration . Among the finished works of Canova , whether of greater or less importance , only one , namely , the Group of the Graces , exhibits this obnoxious feature ; but without disparagement to the better judgment of others , we must confess , that the garlands , with which these beautiful forms are entwined , appear to us to have been the happiest accessories which the sculptor could have employed to sustain his three figures , and at the same time leave them , as the subject required , almost wholly without drapery . Mad . Aibrizzi , who criticizes under the influence of a different , but much more correct feeling , than the London Reviewers , calls it a happy thought to sustain the figures of the Graces with flowers . ' This charming work was executed by Canova for the Empress Josephine . It bears the same relation to the antique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venuses hear to the Apollo I3elvidere and Venus de ' Medici ; and like them it falls , we think , rather short of the model . The symmetry and finish of the figure are perhaps equally l ) erfect , but the attitudes and expression are somewhat less fortunate . I1 ) stead of the easy position , and open , tranquil countenances of the antique group , we have in that of Canova an artificial twining of the arms , and an almost childish sweetness , bordering too nearly upon unpleasant insipidity , in the faces . The antique artist had chosen the correct posture and expression , the same which Canova would probably have employed , had he wrought with entire independence . But the latter having been requested to execute a work upon the same subject with the ancient chef-d'ceuvre , and being willing to avoid the appearance // of servile imitation , adopted variations in the mode of treating it , which were necessarily alterations for the worse . This grou p is the only one of the numerous productions of Canova , iii which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been represented by unfriendly critics as one of the faults in his general manner . Although , as we have already shown in detail , he has often ti'eated the stronger passions with much success , Grace and Tenderness , as they corresponded with the prominent features in his own moral character , breathe of course through die marble upon which he had impressed it . But the expression of these amiable qualities is always governed by a Perfect taste , and never deviates into affectation , at least in no other instance than that which we have now remarked . We may add here , that while Canova has , in all his statues , employed as little drapery as possible , and although his style be soft and graceful , in some cases almost to voluptuousness , he has never overstepped the limits prescribed by the strictest delicacy , but on the contrary has sedulously studied , more than almost any other sculptor , all the reserve which real modesty requires . So remarkable is this peculiarity in his manner , that even female critics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A light drapery , ' says the Countess Albrizzi in her remarks on the Psyche , a light drapery of brilliant whiteness and of the finest texture , which forms an admirable contrast with the almost natural tints of the flesh , and does honor even to the chisel of Canova , is folded with graceful simplicity around her . But why , 0 Psyche ! conceal beneath that envious vest thy lovely limbs , when , veiled only in thy ingenuousness and artless innocence , the thoughts of those who fi their admiring eyes upon thee become pure and guiltless as thyself ? ' It would be impossible for us , within the limits to which we are obliged to confine ourselves , to conunent upon all even of the remarkable productions of this proflfic genius . Having noticed , in some detail , two or three of the principal sepulchral monuments and single statues , we shall mention somewhat more concisely a few of the groups , busts , and portraits . Of the groups , the finest are that of the Three Graces , to which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Psuiche , the Venus and . ldonis , and the . Mars and Venus . The two last are in our opinion the most perfect of the whole . // The subject of them is substantially the same under diWerent names , and is obviously the best that can be chosen for a group of two figures , manly strength and dignity brought into contrast with female softness , grace , and beauty . It is not treated in any of the antique groups that have been preserved , so that Canova has , in this instance , exercised his talent with perfect freedom ; and his complete success proves , that when he has wrought upon the same subjects with the ancients , he has been , as might have been expected , embarrassed rather than assisted by his models . In bringing together in a group the natur*d types of sublimity and beauty , it is impossible that either effect can be produced in its highest degree , because the sentiment that unites the two figures softens in part the peculiar attributes of both . A group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fi.orms as perfect as those of the Apollo Belvidere and the Venus de ' Medici . The settled majesty of proud disdain ' naturally melts into a milder expression in the neighborhood of beauty ; whose ideal image must be supposed in turn , like the maid of France , in Milman 's poem , to gaze upon the noble form of the heavenly archer ' with more than reverence . ' But though something be lost in the perfection of both figures by bringing them together , there is a new source of pleasure in the contrast of their respective beauties . Canova has , we think , done full justice to this subject , especially in the Venus and Adonis , and given it all the effect which it could possibly be made to produce . Adonis stands erect , with a hunting spear in his right hand , as if preparing for the chase . His left arm encircles the waist of the goddess , who stands at his side , with one hand resting on his left shoulder , and the other gently touching his cheek with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled with regret , while the young sportsman is all unconcern and indifference . His companions expect him , and his thoughts are already far away upon the distant mountain-tops and in the sylvan haunts of the savage boar . It is evidently to no purpose , that Venus is using every effort to detain him . At the view of this somewhat disparaging representation of the power of beauty , our fair critic relaxes a little from her habitual tone of unmingle d panegyric , and gently reprehends the sculptor , in the name of the sex , for his want of gallantry . This delightful group , ' says she , must command the admiration of every one , but will be least pleasing // to our sex , Wl ) o can not endure , even in marble , that the sentiment which t.hey inspire should be weaker than that which they themselves experience . If this subject had been treated by a female artist , undoubtedly Adonis would have been the suppliant , it is generally felt , that the figure if Venus , notwithstanding the seducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , heightened as it is by the expression of gentleness and affection , is not so strikingly beautiful as that of her lover . Is this because she is in the attitude of solicitation ? Gentle dames what a lesson is this for us , and what can we expect when it is necessary to sue , if Venus herself in so doing loses her attraction. * This group was executed in 1795 for an Italian nobleman , and is now the property of Mr Favre of Geneva . The Mars and Venus was executed in 1816 , for the king of Great Britain . The two on the subject of Cupid and Psyche belonged to the ex-king of Naples , Murat , and were both at one time placed in the royal palace of Compiegne near Paris . One of them is now in possession of the emperor of Russia . They are both charming compositions , but inferior , we think , to the antique group . We have not room , however , to comment upon them in detail . Among the busts on ideal subjects may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatrice of Dante ; with that of Helen , which was presented by Canova to his fair commentator , as a token of his satisfaction with her descriptions of his works , the first editions of which were published during the sculptor 's life . In the subsequent ones , she expresses in turn her gratitude for the present . That enchanting Helen was to Paris the precious token of the gratitude of Venus , and now her image presents itself to my eyes endeared by the same noble sentiment . But this highly valued gift serves only to manifest the friendship and generous feelings of Canova towards me ; for as to these imperfect descriptions of the delightful productions of his chisel , his indulgence alone in respect to them has made me proud and grateful . ' The chisel of Canova was comparatively seldom exercised in portraits ( if this term may be used in reference to statuary ) , but of the few which he executed , two are particularly remarkable from the extraordinary interest of the subjects . We allude to those of Napoleon and Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was executed in 1803 for // Napoleon 1 ) imself . There is also a bronze cast of the model in the palace of the arts at Milan . The Washino*ton , as our readers are aware , was executed for the state of North Carolina , and was sent home , we believe , in the year 1S21 . The Napoleon is entirely without drapery , excepting a loose military cloak which hangs from the left aim , without covering any part of the figure . The Washington is clothed in the habit of an ancient Roman warrior . In both cases , Canova has , we think , exhibited a less correct judgment in regard to costume , than we should naturally have expected from his consummate taste . However superior naked figures and flowing draperies may be , for the purposes of art , to the formal and fan-* tastic dresses of the modern world , we hold it to be quite clear , that portraits , whether in painting or sculpture , must be clothed in the costume which the persons represented habitually wore . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the highest effect consistent with the imitation of a given model . For this reason the taking of portraits is doubtless an inferior branch of art ; but it has , nevertheless , its own rules that can not be violated without sacrificing the value of the work , which , in that case , may be a fine statue or painting , but will not be a fine portrait , and , having been intended for a poitrait , will probably , after all , not be an ideal work of the first order . In the statue of Napoleon we hardly recognise , even after we know it to have been intended for him , the well known form and features , and are disappointed , instead of being gratified , by tl ) C ideal perfection of the figure . The ocorest possible approach to the person of Bonaparte , as it was at the period of his first campaign in Italy , with a modern niihitary costume , would have produced , as a portrait , an infinitely greater effect . Napoleon himself does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though placed in the gahiery of the Louvre , was concealed from public view by a curtain . The Biography of Living Characters affirms with a ludicrous excess of political party feeling ( in a passage quoted in our former article on this subject ) , that the statue cxhibited at once so perfect a resemblance to the model , and so irnoble a form and countenance , that the emperor was ashamed to have it seen . Every spectator , not absolutely blinded byT prejudice , sees at a single glaiice , that it is a grand heroic flgure infinitely nobler than that of the subject , but of little or no value as a portrait , precisely from the want of mcsemblance. // After the abdication of Napoleon , it was presented by the allies to the Duke of Wellington , and now remains in his possession , a most appropriate and splendid trophy of his victory over the before unconquered original . The costume of the Washington is less injudicious than the no-costume of the Napoleon , but is not , in our opinion , cOnceived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sittin* attitude nova , is also less advantageous than the upright one would have been . It is only in fact in a standing position , that the human figure displays its full natural dignity ; Os homini sublime dedit ccelumque tueri Jussit , et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus . ' Now as dignity , moral and physical , was the peculiar characteristic of Washington , the attitude best fitted to express this quality seemed to be ahnost commanded by the subject . We were therefore a good deal surprised to find , upon conversing with Chantrey on the plan of his statue on the same subject , before he had begun the model , that he was wavering between a standing and sitting position ; and we have seen with much satisfaction , that he finally decided in favor of the former . In this particular and in that of the costume , his work is a happier one than that of his illustrious Italian contemporary ; and as his talent in this branch of the art is probably equal , the citizens of Boston may boast of possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canova , though by a generally inferior sculptor . Our limits will not permit us to enlarge any farther upon the particular merits of the different works of Canova , which amount in number to several hundreds , or even to specify their subjects . Our object has been to indicate the general character of his style of sculpture , and to illustrate our views respecting it by observations on a few of his productions . Nor have we room to dwell at length upon the events of his life ,  - -  his embassy to Paris in 1814 , for the purpose of reclaiming the works of art which had been carried away from Italy by the French , or the numerous titles , crosses , and pensions , that were conferi'ed upon him by the admiration and gratitude of the various sovereigns of Europe . No artist , ' says his biographer , was ever more exposed to the intoxicating effects of honors and distinctions , exceeding perhaps any instance of the kind in the history of the arts . But although decorated with the equestrian orders of many great sovereigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles , enriched by pensions , honored by important charges and functions , received with distinction at all courts , desired in all societies , and associated with all the principal academies of Europe , he still preserved the simplicity and modesty of his character . His disposition was naturally highly benevolent , and all his pensions and gains were devoted to useful and charitable purposes , so that some interference was often required to prevent him from embarrassing his circumstances by a too active generosity . ' Various instances of l ) is munificence are related in detail by his biographer , which we have not space to copy . He appears in fact to have been the chief l ) atlon of the arts and of those who cultivated them at Rome . Rome herself , during the gloomy period when she was deprived of the presence of her sovereign , and incorporated with the French empire , is said to have found her princil ) al economized resources in the presence of this illustrious and indefatigable artist . What a fall was there , when the Eternal City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low that she could draw consolation and relief from the chisel of a single sculptor What a contrast too , between these active and amiable private virtues , and the wild extravagance , the gross sensuality , the revolting eccentricities , which so often obscure the light of transcendent genius ! What would not have been the happiness and glory of Lord Byron , for examl ) le , could he have combined with his powerful and brilliant poetical talent such a moral character as that of Cariova ! The contemplation of such a union of various excellences reconciles us with humanity ; while the extraordinary success and popularity xvhicb formed , in this instance , the reward of real merit , consoles us in part for the frequent temporary ascendency of error , violence , and vice . It only remains to notice , very briefly , the last moments of this interesting and well filled life . Canova had early impaired his health by intense application , before his reputation and success procured him the means of employing assistants in executing the less important parts of his works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged to make constant use for a long time of a machine which required a pressure on the breast , and thus occasioned a disorganization in that part , which injured his health through life , and was probably the cause of the schirrous affection of the stomach , which finally proved mortal . A careful , regular , and simple // mode of living prevented , however , any immediate ill effects , and his labors were seldom interrupted by illness until just before his death . The great vital organ which was diseased finally ceased to perform its functions ; and the illustrious artist resigned Ii imself to undergo the common lot of humanity with a calmness and serenity corresponding with the beauty and purity of his life . When his brother , who was his constant domestic companion , brought him some of the last soothing renedies , T is good , ' said he , very good , but t is all to no l ) urpose , - Buono , buonissimo , ma d inutile . And yet , ' continued the kind-hearted sculptor , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little longer . ' The last words which he uttered , and which he repeated at several different times , were . lnima belles e pura , pure and gentle spirit , ' a reminiscence , perhaps , of the well known address of the dying man to his soul by the Emperor Adrian , which is imitated in the Dying Christian of Pope . daimula , vagida , blandula ! As the stern soul of Napoleon appeared in the midst of its mortal agony to be directing the storm of battle at the head of his army ,  --  t*te arm*e being the last words he pronounced ,  --  so this milder , though not less lofty spirit , while hovering on the confines of eternity , was still engaged in the sweet and soothing contemplations in which it l1ahitually delighted . We have already mentioned the period of his death at the commencemerit of this article . The funeral honors which were rendered to his memory in his native city and throughout all Italy , clearly indicated the public estimation of his works and genius . The loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice , the power which regulates human destinies having conducted him to the tomb in that country where he had first drawn breath . The patriarch himself would perform the funeral rites ; and the academic body , who were desirous of supporting his bier , conducted the coffin of their revered brother and master to the church , and thence to the hall of the academy , followed by so numerous a train , that that vast apartment was insufficient to contain them . The walls of the hall were hung with engraved copies of the works of Canova , so numerous that they al ) peared the labors of a whole race of artists , rather than of a single mind and hand . The president of the academy , an affectionate friend of the deceased , ' ( Count Cicognara himself , ) delivered the oration , exciting in the minds of the assembly the same deep emotions by which he was himself affected . The only torch , which burnt beside the bier , stood on that ancient bronze which // had , for so many centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall of the great council , and was deemed a suitable candelabrum for the last offices paid to tim latter glories of the Venetian state . Immediately after the ceremony , the body was removed to Possagno , where an honorable tomb will be raised to hismemory in the new church now nearly completed . The funeral rites were performed on the twenty-fifth of October , and a discourse delivered by a distinguished prelate to so large a concourse of the inhabitants of that district , that it was found necessary to address them under the open sky . Throughout Italy the deepest affliction prevailed on this event . Rome , who lost by his death the restorer of her modern greatness , decreed to him the honor of a statue , proclaimed him perpetual president of her chief academy , and ordered for him a funeral in the church of the Holy Apostles , of such magnificence that all the tributary arts were occupied for many months in the preparation of it . The Pope contributed largely to the expense ; and the whole of the magistracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed their respect for it by their presence . Likewise Florence , Trevigi , Udine , and Lodi , gave each her public demonstrations of grief on this occasion ; but none with more zealous promptitude than the Venetian artists , the kind friends and fellow academicians of Canova . Immediately on his death , they voted to his memory the grandest and most distinguished monument that could be devised . Not to limit the honor of this design to Venice alone , or even to Italy , the subscription was thrown open to all Europe , to whom his fame might be deemed to belong ; whereupon the powers then assembled at Verona , following the example of our august emperor , severally evinced their desire of promoting this object by munificent donations ; as the more distant sovereigns also did on the announcement of the l ) roject . So rapid and considerable was the subscription , that long before the ensuing spring they were in condition to begin the work . A monument to the memory of Titian had been designed by Canova in the year 179* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De ' Fran in Venice ; but the design , which was to have been effected by subscription , failed by the death of Chevalier Zulian , its chief promoter , in 1795 . The model being thus left on hand , without any l ) resl ) ect of its being carried into execution , Canova adopted the same idea for the monument of the Archduchess Christina , reducing however the dimensions , and with considerable alterations in the groups . The opportunity of restoring to its oni*ioal state an ( l colossal proportions , this beautiful composition , far more suitable to a consummate artist than a pious princess , and perhaps even better adapted to a sculptor than to // a painter ; the absence of all rivalship in the adoption of the design of him whom all considered as a master ; and the means it afforded of employing at the same time the numerous sculptors who were anxious to pay homage to the memory of Canova , all concurred to justify the choice of this model , formed by the hand of Canova himself . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much occupied with a plan for the erection of a church in his own native village of Possagno . This project grew out of another which he had conceived upon the return of the Pope to Rome from his exile in France . Though totally free from affectation and fanaticism , Canova was deeply and sincerely religious , a quality which seems indeed to be almost implied in the strong sensibility to the beauty and sublimity of nature that constitutes the principle of genius . The extraordinary character of the political revolutions of 1814 , considered particularly in their influence on the interests of the cI ) ureh , produced so powerful an impression on his mind , that he was desirous of commemorating them by a work of his own art . He accordingly prepared a model of a statue of Religion , personified under the form of a colossal female figure , of the height of thirty palms , which he intended to execute at his own expense , and erect in some one of the principal churches at Rome . By the completion of this design , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonder of art and sublimity to which it has never *et seen anything equal , emanating too solely and spontaneously from the mind of the artist , wholly uniastigated and unaided by extraneous means . All Europe looked forward to see it adding to the glory of the Vatican , or adorning the magnificent expanse of the Pantheon . Already the model was completed , the marble disposed , and the chisel of the sculptor suspended until the signal of authority should be given by pointing out a l ) lace for its reception . It will be for history to explain the causes of the frustration of this devout and magnanimous design ; and perhaps it may be found needful to draw a veil over the motives to which it may he traced . Posterity will with difficulty believe , that no place could be found at Rome for the reception of the sacred image of Religion . It is however certain , that the model remained for many years the object of public admiratv ) fl , a masterly engraving being made from it with the following inscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formam sua impensa in *narrnore e culpcndant Antonius Canova libens fecit et dedicavit ; and that finally it was // workC ( I in marble , a little above the natural size , by order of Lord Browniow . The emblem of Catholicism was thus rejected from the Tiber , and fouiid refuge on the banks of the rVhalnes . This extraordinary circumstance did not , however , depress the mind of Canova , who , actuated by the deepest religious feeliii* , had already formed the design of consecrating his fortune and the last efforts of his genius to the commemoration of a period in which the inscrutable decrees of Providence had been so remarkably displayed . that the statue which he had projected for this pious purpose might not be profaned by any less sacred use , he resolved on raising a temple for its reception in his native village , to be enriched with the productions of his chisel ; by which means also he would open a perpetual source of prosperity for Possagno , in the concourse of workmen , the visits of strangers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sumptuous edifice was accordingly laid in July , 1819 , amidst an immense concourse of people , with all the solemnities of religion , and the deep emotions of the assembly . But the artist had not foreseeii , that this design would require an infinitely greater expenditure than that of the colossal statue ; to supply which it became necessary for him to renew his labors , and to undertake fresh commissions . Accordingly he set about new statues , groups , and monuments , *vorking incessantly , and with all the ardor of his youthful application ; his mind always intent on the great object of his pious wishes . It is not improbable , that this greatly increased exertion , and the mental excitation consequent on it , tended to accelerate the termination of his existence . ' The church , as we learn from one of the preceding extracts , is now nearly coniplete ( l , and will doubtless be finished by the piety of die friends and patrons of the great sculptor arid his art ; but what hand is coin petent to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been its principal ornamnent ? It is singular indeed that objections should have been made to the erection of such a nionument at Ronie . We have no further information whatever respecting their nature , than is given in the above extracts . The model , of which there is an engraVing in the work before us , is certainly conceived in the highest style of subliuiity ; and if executed with the usual felicity of the artist , and on the grand scale which he had intended , would have been perhaps the noblest effort of his chisel and of modern sctdpture. // ART .

THE general design of the work of Professors Long and Dunglison appears to be much the same as that of Butler , in his Geograpliia Classica ; or the Application of Anejeat Geography to the Classics . ' But the Roman Geography , furnished by Dr* Dunglison , is left , as it is acknowledged to be by the author , incomplete . It was his wish , as he says , to add the geogra l ) h ) ical history of the Roman colonies and conquests but his very restricted Opportunities have not permitted him to do so . Professor Long also offbrs , as an excuse for small errors or omissions , the limited time in which the work was pared for the press . The public have long since to re-ceased gard apologies of this kind , offered by living authors , or by others in their behalf ; and with good reason ; for there is not such a lamentable deficiency , in any department of learning , as to compel a writer to send forth his productions prematurely , or against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be understood to speak with severity in this particular case . The work is valuable , and the undertaking laudable ; but the admissions of the authors show , that it inVht have possessed more value , and have deserved more praise . ( rflie chapters on Ph*nicia , Babylonia , the Scythian tribes , the Persians , Egyptians , and Carthaginians , ' as Professor Long informs us in his preface , are founded entirely on the work of Heci-en , entitled Ideas on the Polity and Commerce of the principal Nations of Antiquity .
