txt ART . XX. - Sketches of the Life and Correspondence of Nathaniel Greene , Major General of the . Irmies of the United States in the War of the Revolution , compiled chiefly from original materials . By William Johnson , of Charleston , South Carolina , in two volumes 4to . Charleston . E. A. Miller , 1822 . Wu have taken occasion in a previous number of this journal to express our admiration of the talents and character of general Greene . He may justly be regarded as the most extraordinary man in the army of the revolution . We would not be understood to assert that he was the greatest man , or that he rendered more important services than any other individual ; but when the circumstances of his early life and education are taken into view , as well as the disadvantages under which be entered the service , we know of none , whose subsequent reputation and advancement can with more justice be attributed exclusively to personal merit . It is not necessary to recapitulate the particulars of his military career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least degree conversant with the history of the revolution . Unhappily , his private circumstances by no means corresponded with his eminent services and high reputation . Like most of his fellows in arms , he discovered at the close of the contest , that national liberty had been purchased at the price of personal independence . We have the satisfaction , however , in the case of general Greene , to know , that this reflection was not aggravated by a sense of the ingratitude of his country . The states of South Carolina and Georgia , to express their obligation to their deliverer , each invested him with a valuable estate . This munificence was , however , inadequate to relieve Greene from the embarrassments , in which the unavoidable neglect of his affairs and the treachery of false friends had involved him ; and which clouded the close of his life , lie died on the 19th of June , 1786 , at the premature age of forty-four , at the plantation bestowed on him by the state of Georgia . For many years after his death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attract the degree of notice to which it was entitled . Of late , however , the attention of the nation has been excited by several publications , which profess to do justice to his character , but , as if an unrelenting fate were never to cease from pursuing this unfortunate man , he has been brought for- // 1822.3 Johnson 's Ljfe of Greene . ivard , to contend with a more dangerous enemy than he had before had to encounter , in the indiscreet and officious zeal of his biographers . We have heretofore noticed a crude production , bearing the title of a Life of general Greene , and have only to add at present , that its extreme inaccuracy and want of minuteness would alone be sufficient to condemn it . These are faults which we have not to charge upon the work before us . Two volumes , containing one thousand quarto pages , are certainly sufficient , without comment , to shield the author from the imputation of want of diligence and research . The writer , from his personal acquaintance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his most interesting campaigns , and his high personal consideration in the community . had at command great advantages for the undertaking . The zeal and assiduity with which he has pursued his task can not be too highly praised , and had his skill and taste in the arrangement of his materials equalled his industry in collecting them , we should have had one of the most entertaining and useful works our country has produced . Reserving our remarks on this point to the close of the article , we shall follow the author in his course , and point out such portions of the work as particularly deserve to be considered . We should observe here , that most of the objectionable passages are to be attributed to an extreme anxiety to do honor to his hero . This is particularly the case in the first instance we shall quote , which occurs in the introductory chapter . General Greene was descended from one of the individuals who accompanied Gorton in making the settlement of a part of the state of Rhode island . This expedition is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was originally settled by religious sectarians , who sought in the wilderness that freedom of conscience or of speculation , which was denied them in the parent colony of Massachusetts . Although the settlers of the latter colony had fled from the persecutions which disgraced England in the commencement of the seventeenth century , yet scarcely had they effected a settlement in their place of refuge , before they exhibited an additional proof that fanaticism , whether in a city or a wilderness , is still cruel , selfish , and tyrannical , or that the corrupting influence of power may taint even the purity of the christian relioion . Roger Williams was the first who fled , and led off with him a colony to found the city of Providence . Next Mrs Hutchinson an ( I her followers acquired and settled the island of Aquetnet , or Rhode Island proper , and built the town of Newport . 2V*w &amp;ries , No. 12. 53 // And lastly , Samuel Gorton , and his eleven followers , descending the Narragansett Bay on the west side , settled on Warwick Neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious or official zeal of governor Winthrop , and a captain Cook , with an armed party of treble Gorton 's number , was despatched with strict orders " to bring the heretics to Boston dead or alive . " At the head of this crusade in miniature , marched a holy man with strict injunctions to keep his soldiers regularly to their prayers , and to explain to Gorton and his deluded followers the whole enormity of their errors before they put them to death . What these errors were , it is immaterial to relate . Suffice it to say , they had reference to the most abstruse and speculative doctrines , and were wholly immaterial to christian piety and a good life . Gorton persisted sturdily in the argument against the nuncio of Winthrop , and thinking he had the best of it , refused to acknowledge himself convinced . Cook accordingly gave the word for the onset , and that Greene , the protosire of our hero , was not then a quaker , is proved by their having made a brave resistance against the Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made prisoners and conveyed to Boston . *fh women and children were dispersed in the woods , and as it was at a time when the ground was covered with snow , several of them actually perished . The rest of these helpless fugitives , after sustaining incredible hardships , were protected , clothed , and hospitably entertained-by savages . ' We are not disposed to censure the laudable desire of the author to record whatever is praiseworthy in the ancestry of general Greene , and we shall not be suspected of a wish to deprive them of any portion of the honor which is justly their due . It is matter of regret , however , that the writer should , in his zeal , have been unmindful of the characters of others . It is not our intention to deny that our ancestors in New England are chargeable with bigotry and fanaticism . These were the passions of the age . We even admit that their pursuit of Gorton beyond the boundaries of their own province was unjustifiable , and the punishment inflicted on him unreasonably severe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Gorton was a saint . A very little research into the historians of that period would have shown to the biographer , that this moving tale of persecuted innocence was one of good Sir Roger 's cases , in which ' much may be said on both sides . ' The writers on the history of New England are unanimous in their execration of Gorton . We cite Hutchinson , because he is // more mild in his expressions than any other historian . His account of this person and his principles is as follows . A new sect springing up from the ashes of the Antinomians made great disturbance about this time . Samuel Gorton , who came from Boston in 1686 , was at the head of it . Mr Cotton says , his principles were the very dregs of familism . It is certain that he was artful enough to explain them in such a manner , that his judges in the Massachusetts were divided in the opinion , whether they were heretical or no . He staid not long in the Massachusetts , but went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped and required to find sureties for his good behaviour ; which not being able to do , he removed , Mr Winslow says , was driven , to Rhode Island . There he treated the court with contempt , and by order of the governor , Mr Coddington , was first imprisoned , and afterwards whipped . From Rhode Island he went to Providence , where Roger Williams , with his usual humanity , although he disliked his principles and behaviour , gave him shelter . Here he found several of his own disposition fond of novelties in religion , and they first set down at Patuxet , near Providence ; but some of the inhabitants there applied to the . Miassachusetts that they and their lands might be received into protection , and complained that Gorton and his company , under pretence of purchase from the Indians , were going about to deprive them of their estates , of which for several years they had been in the lawful possession . The governor and three of the assistants signed what was called a warrant or notification to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Massachusetts . This was dated in October 1642 . Gorton sent a very contemptuous answer , and told them they had no authority over the people of Providence . But either for the sake of being more out of the reach of the Massachusetts or from discord among them - selves , Gorton and eleven more purchased of Miantinorno , the Narragansett sachem , a tract of land called Shawamet , and removed thither . The price they paid was one hundred and fortyfour fathom of Wampum . Shawamet was then claimed by Plimouth government as within their jurisdiction . Two of the chief of the Indians , who dwelt there and at Patuxet , and who were called Sachems , Pomham and Sachonoco , came to Boston with their interpreter to complain of Gorton and his company , for taking their lands from them , and offered to subject themselves and their country to the Massachusetts , which by an instrument under their hands was accordingly done. * Of all the sufferers in the cause of toleration who have come within our knowledge , we are free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unfortunate ; for he // was not only driven out from every place of refuge , but pub1ic-* ly whipped by order of the magistrates in three different provinces . We should not have brought forward this subject thus formally , had not the biographer afterwards alluded to it in a still more offensive manner . We refer to the following passage ; Indeed when posterity shall distribute justice with impartial hand among the states , Rhode Island , diminutive as it is in territory , will stand pre-eminent for the spirit and vigor , with which she supported the revolutionary war . It was not with her the cause of Massachusetts ; there was nothing to be ascribed to contiguity or consanguinity ; jealousies and ill will had prevailed between these two states . Rhode Island viewed Massachusetts as the oppressor and persecutor of her forefathers ; and Massachusetts , in addition to the feelings which accompany the consciousness of having done an injury , never cordially forgave the Rhode Islanders , for having eluded her claimsofdoniinion . These early causes have left their traces so deeply engraven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordial feeling plainly to be discovered , at least among the less enlightened classes in these two states . But every disagreeable recollection was magnanimously sacrificed by Rhode Island , ' &amp;c . We acknowledge we were at first somewhat at a loss to interpret the meaning of this paragraph . If it is intended merely to convey a compliment to our neighbors of Rhode Island , we shall not be ill natured enough to dispute it with them , equivocal as it is . We know not , however , what authority the author has for the assertion he confidently makes , of a want of cordiality between the people of the two states . For ourselves , we were not a little surprised at the intimation , and still more , that it should have reached us for the first time through an inhabitant of a very remote part of the nation . We were induced to set about an inquiry into the grounds of this allegation , which we have prosecuted with all the diligence in our power , and have the satisfaction to declare , that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been utterly unable to discover any foundation for it . We can not undertake to answer with equal confidence for the good citizens of Rhode Island , but until some evidence is brought forward of the existence of such feelings as are imputed to them , we believe they will heartily concur with us , in pronouncing the whole to be a misconception on the part of Mr Justice Johnson . General Greene accompanied the commander in chief to New York , and shared with him the arduous and distressing // campaign in the Jersies . With the exception of the expedition to Rhode Island , he continued until his appointment to the command of the southern army , under the immediate command of Washington , by whose influence he obtained the very difficult and vexatious appointment of quarter master general . The trials , to which Greene was exposed in the exercise of the duties of this office , are detailed at great length , and many pages are unnecessarily perhaps occupied in refuting charges against him , which however serious and afflicting at the time , are long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high stations he afterwards obtained , at the recommendation of those best acquainted with his character , have precluded the necessity of reverting to calumnies , from which no public servant is exempted . In the absence of Washington , Greene was in the command of the American army at the time Arnold 's treachery was detected . This leads our author to a recital of the circumstances of that disgraceful affair . Several particulars are mentioned which are new to us . With respect to Andre , we should be glad if less had been said , for he seems to have been introduced merely for the purpose of removing the veil , which the tenderness of friendship or charity has endeavored to draw over his fate . The apology offered for this course is , that Andre has been too long the object of undeserved eulogium . We are not about to enter into a discussion of the merits and faults of this truly unfortunate man . We shall only add , that whatever may have been his offences , an execution on a gibbet in pursuance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , is surely an expiation which ought to satisfy the most scrupulous . The appointment of general Greene to the command of the southern army , after the defeat of Gates , gave him an opportunity to display the resources of his mind , and to render services which his country can never forget . This event is introduced by a recapitulation of the leading occurrences in the history of the province of South Carolina , which occupies one chapter . Another very interesting one is devoted to the progress of the war in the southern department , up to the time of general Greene 's taking command . For many of the facts in this period , the author has recourse to the narrative of general Otho 1-lolland Williams , which is printed at length in the appendix , and forms , with the letters of general Greene , a most *raluab1e portion of the work . If these volumes had contained // nothing but the former , the publIc would have been highly indebted to the author for making them acquainted with this spirited little memoir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , to enter into a detail of the events of the war in the southern department . We shall , however , present our readers with general Greene 's energetic description of the condition of the troops when he assumed the command . To the Marquis de la Fayette he writes , It is now within a few days of the time you mentioned of being with me . Were you to arrive , you would find a few ragged , half starved troops in the wilderness , destitute of every thing necessary for either the comfort or convenience of soldiers . Indeed , my dear sir , the department is in a most deplorable condition , nor have I a prospect of its mending . The country is almost laid waste , and the inhabitants plunder one another with little less than savage fury . We live from hand to mouth , and have nothing to subsist on but what we collect with armed parties . In this situation I believe you will agree with me there is nothing inviting this way , especially when I assure you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and properly equipped does not amount to eight hundred men . ' To colonel Coxe he writes The condition of this army for want of clothing would move your compassion were you here to observe their nakedness . This country is very extensive and thinly inhabited , which renders it exceedingly ( lifficult getting supplies , if every thing were managed in the best manner with the most perfect arrangement . But the loss of the army in Charleston and the defeat of general Gates alarmed North Carolina to such a degree , that they have kept on foot such hosts of militia as have ravaged the country from one end to the other ; and to pay the expense of subsisting them , this state has been obliged to strike such quantities of money as have almost rendered it worthless . Thus with an army without clothing or provisions in a country exhausted , its currency ruined , the inhabitants divided , and our force less than one third of the enemy 's , I believe you will agree with me the situation is disagreeable and the prospect disirmal rfhe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than savage fury , an ( I such a spirit of plundering prevails as threatens the depopulation of the whole country . The whigs and tories are continually out in small parties , and all the middle country is so disaffected that you can not lay in the most trifling magazine , or send a wagon through the country with the least article of stores without a guard . I am subsisting the army by // small daily collections made by the credit and influence of individuals who have charitably engaged in the business . Nor have 1 the least aid of government in the business of transportation , and not a shilling to help myself . Our situation is still more wretched than I have described it , and must soon terminate in the ruin and loss of this country , unless some more perfect arrangements can take place for support of the army. * Such arrangements never did take place , and Greene was left to struggle to the close of the war with want , sickness , and disaffection , opposed to an army superior in numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most skilful officers in the British service . His conduct in this arduous situation is very minutely and faithfully related by the author , and speaks more for his military character than the most splendid victories , in the course of the work , the statements and opinions of earlier writers are frequently called in question . As the author , to use his own expression , is entrenched behind a mass of four thousand original letters , ' besides other documents , we should not undertake , if we were disposed , to dispute his positions . We remark , however , that he is very apt to take the alarm at any expressions which may be supposed to extenuate the conduct of the enemy . This is particularly observable in the strictures on the narrative of general Lee . To confess the truth , a degree of implacability pervades the work , which we were very sorry to discover . We do not intend to attack the standing theme of the cruelties of Cornwallis , and the bloody Tarleton . But it is to be lamented that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own countrymen who differed from us on the propriety of resistance , which we believed to have long since subsided . We are aware , that great allowance is to be made for the difference of circumstances at the two extremities of the union . The war in the south was conducted in a manner to give rise to feelings , of which the people of New England can form no conception . Fortunately for the cause of freedom , the struggle commenced in a quarter , where the voice of liberty may be said to have been unanimous . The very small number among us who , from motives of interest or affection , adhered to the royal cause , either retired , or maintained a prudent silence . One spirit pervaded the community ; one object , the expulsion of the common enemy , gave vigor to every arm . This object accomplished , // the passions , which had been excited by the contest , subsided ; the flame of resentment was extinguished , and the odious appellatives of whig and tory , were soon forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the case was far different . Whether it was owing to the nature of their connexion with the mother country , or to accidental circumstances , certain it is , that in the more southern colonies from the commencement of the dispute , parties were much more equally poised . In several provinces the loyalists nearly outnumbered the whigs , and in all , they formed a numerous and formidable body . Mutual recrimination soon led to more fatal consequences , and in some districts , before the British troops made their appearance , the contest had already assumed the frightful features of civil war . The enemy did not fail to foment these unhappy divisions , and the rage of the combatants was at length inflamed to the degree , that it seemed as if these miserable people were doomed to be exterminated by the hands of each other . Neighbor was armed against neighbor , and in some instances , members of the same family looked upon each other with suspicion and hatred . The return of peace could not bring with it immediate oblivion , to minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison still rankled in the bosoms of both parties , and excited jealousies which are hardly yet eradicated . We have noticed with pleasure , in some late publications in the south , from the pens of individuals who were attached to the army , a spirit of conciliation and impartiality . We had hoped , that our biographer would have thrown the weight of his name into the same scale . It is not surprising that in the heat of contention , both parties should have been hurried into excesses , which are revolting to their sober feelings . After a lapse of nearly fifty years , however , we may surely be allowed to look back with some degree of calmness upon that distressing period . Such a review will diminish our surprise at the large proportion of the population , who hesitated to adventure upon the hazardous measure of open resistance . When we consider that the question of the expediency of a resort to arms was one on which reflecting men might very fairly differ , and the attachment all men naturally feel to the authority they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impute an adherence to the mother country in every instance to a dastardly or mercenary spirit . Loyalty and patriotism are kindred sentiments ; // and it is no great proof of discernment to imagine , that we recommend our own principles , by charging on another as a crime , a disinterested , though mistaken partiality to a government which he has been taught to respect . Having said thus much on this delicate topic , it will be expected that we should point out some of the passages in the work before us which have given rise to the foregoing remarks . We admit that the prejudice of the writer discovers itself more in a disposition to palliate on the one hand , than to exaggerate on the other . Whether we are right in our conclusion the reader will judge from the following extracts . From the first commencement of the revolutionary ferment a partisan warfare had occurred in the interior between the whigs and tories . The royal governors had , at a very early period , established a correspondence with several populous settlements in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melancholy consequences which resulted from these internal dissensions , it can not be denied that in both North and South Carolina the loyalists were the aggressors . As early as November 1775 , a party of loyalists between Broad and Saluda. rivers , under Patrick Cunningham , rose in arms and seized a quantity of gunpowder which the whigs were forwarding as a present to the Indians . The royal governor of the province apprehending that this peace offering would detach the savages from the royal interests , and defeat the plan which had already originated . of bringing them upon the backs of the whigs while the royal army attacked them in front , excited this settlement ( the only one in the southern states in which the tories outnumbered the whigs ) to commit this act of aggression . This was the first link in that chain of causes , whic hl ed to the depopulation of this beautiful tract of country . ' Let us set aside for a moment the question of right and wrong between these two parties , and take into view a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brother of this Patrick Cunningham was already a prisoner in the hands of his adversaries , and threatened with harsh treatment , and that both sides were exasperated by mutual injuries , and in constant dread of some act of violence. , Under such circumstances , we can hardly imagine an incident more calculated to excite alarm and justify prompt measures ; than a peace offering in the shape of gunpowder to a neighboring tribe of Indians . The author proceeds to relate the dispersion of a body of loyalists in Georgia , under a colonel Boyd . A number of the party were taken prisoners . After stating that seventy of // the prisoners were condemned to suffer death as traitors , and that five of them were actually executed-he adds , Colonel Brown , soon after this event , was placed in command at Augusta . History has preserved the memory of too many monsters in the human form ; but this man has been surpassed by none . Yet his history conveys some useful lessons . It proves the danger of committing wanton outrage on the meanest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from indulging popular licentiousness , and the vindictive passions that predominate in times of civil commotion . In the hour of festivity , Brown had indulged himself in indiscreet censure of the revolutionary party . He had done worse ,  --  he had committed a fault less easily forgiven ; he had ridiculed them . Being apprised that their resentment was excite ( I , he attempted to escape ; but he was closely pursued , brought back to Augusta , tried before a committee of surveillance , and sentenced to be tarred and feathered and carted , unless he recanted and took the oath of allegiance prescribed by the administration of Georgia . Brown was a firm man , and resisted with a pertinacity that should have commanded the respect of his persecutors . But the motions of a mob are too precipitate to admit of the intrusion of generous feeling . After undergoing the painful and mortifying penance prescribed by the committee , without yielding , it is too true , that he was doomed to have his naked feet exposed to a large fire , to subdue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length turned loose by a group of men , who never once dreamed that the simple Indian trader would soon reappear , an armed and implacable enemy . He first visited the loyalists of Ninety six , concerted his measures with them , then made his way to St Augustine , received a colonel 's commission , placed himself at the head of a band of desperate refugees , and accompanied Provost in his irruption into Georgia . His thirst for revenge appeared afterward insatiable , and besides wantonly hanging many of his prisoners , he subjected the families of the whigs who were out in service , to accumulated sufferings and distress . It was not long after he was left in command at Augusta by the British general , that colonel Clarke , with a determined party of the militia , whose families he had persecuted , aimed a *well directed blow at his post . But Brown proved himself a man of bravery and conduct ; and he well knew that at all times he was fighting for his life . After a severe and partially successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark to retreat , and leave his wounded behind him , with a letter addressed to Brown , requesting that he would parole them to their plantations . But Brown 's thirst for revenge knew no bounds . it had been irritated in this instance by a wound , which confined him to his bed . The unhappy prisoners , twenty-eight in number , were all // hung , thirteen of them were suspended to the railing of the staircase , that he might feast his eyes with their dying agonies . This he justified on the ground of the execution of the prisoners taken at the defeat of Boyd , and a sanguinary order of lord Cornwallis , which will hereafter be noticed . Among the prisoners thus executed , were many of high respectability , and one youth whose conduct merited a better fate . lie was but fifteen years of age ; his brother , but two years older , was wounded and fell beside him . He refused to leave him , and they perished together on the gallows . The outrage did not end here ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalped , mangled , and thrown into the river . ' This narrative speaks for itself . The impartial reader will shudder to reflect on the dreadful consequences which result from the unrestrained indulgence of the malignant passions but he will hardly undertake to decide which of these parties is most chargeable on the score of inhumanity . We have great pleasure in taking leave of this subject to remark , that from the time that general Greene assumed the command , it was his endeavor to suppress this barbarous warfare , and we never find , under any circumstances of irritation , that he was for a moment insensible to the dictates of benevolence . We have had occasion to notice the invidious comparisons between neighboring states at the north . Something of the same propensity is to be discovered in a subsequent part of the work . The troops of Virginia and Georgia are more than once placed in a disadvantageous light by the side of those of the Carolinas . Such distinctions are , to say the least , unnecessary , and especially to be avoided at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but too prone to indulge in illiberal reflections . The events which succeeded the battle of the Eutaws , are related with more distinctness and precision than by any other writer , and we think this portion of the work a very valuable accession to the history of the revolution . This praise does not extend to the account of the measures which followed the preliminaries of peace . Party feeling , if not personal pique , gives a tinge to this part of the work , which can not be very agreeable to the great majority of readers . We can account in no other way , for the attempt to shift the authorship of the Newberg Letters , from the individual who has been content to stand under the imputation of it or forty years , to the late Mr Gouverneur Morris . To substantiate his claims to this discovery , the // author produces such extracts as suit his purpose , from two letters written by Mr Morris to general Greene ; in which he dwells on the imbecility of the government ; and urges the necessity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on some permanent provision for the payment of their arrears , before they were dishanded . The Newberg Letters , which may he found in Marshall 's Life of Washington , were written , as is well known , for the purpose of inciting the officers of the army to enter into a combination for the same purpose . This coincidence , together with some hints thrown out by Gordon , that Mr Morris was employed as an agent in directing the arrangements between the public creditors and the army , our author considers as conclusive evidence that he was the writer of the Newberg Letters . With regard to the charge brought by Gordon , it is acknowledged to he mere conjecture , and the letters to general Greene only prove , that two individuals agreed in an opinion , which is known to have been prevalent in the army . That body , after having achieved the deliverance of their country , by the sacrifice of every personal consideration , found themselves ready to be cast upon the world , without employment or resources . Congress was unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their demands . In such a moment , it is not wonderful that the thought should have been suggested , of making use of the means they still possessed , to extort by force , what had been denied to their remonstrances . To their eternal honor , the impulse , though stimulated by the specious reasoning of the letters in question , was transient and feeble . The officers , guided by their good principles , and the prudent advice of the commander in chief , came to an unanimous resolution , to throw themselves upon the justice of their country . That the gentleman , to whom these letters are imputed by our author , was of the number who were jealous of the intentions of congress , there is no doubt . How far such jealousy was justifiable , every individual may judge for himself . We think , however , notwithstanding the authority of our author , that we can discern a difference , in a moral point of view , between the disclosure of an opinion in a confidential letter to a friend , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspersions on the commander in chief . Mr Gouverneur Morris , may , for aught we know , have been the author of the Newberg Letters ; but no one has a right to found such a charge on the evidence // which is here adduced . Mr Morris is not the only victim to our author 's shrewdness ; the whole party , which governed during the first years of our national existence , is introduced , awkwardly enough , and disposed of , in a way not very consistent with the professions of impartiality which appear in the preface . We have expressed our opinion that the style of this work is below the dignity of the subject , and detracts from the praise to which the indefatigable perseverance of the author is justly entitled . It is tumid and involved , and abounds in figures of speech which will hardly bear the test of criticism . The writer seems to be constantly on the stretch for expressions adequate to his ideas . He appears to have adopted a notion , but too prevalent among us , that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery vomits death , ' and his heroes are robed like Hercules . ' We are told of reinforcements melting into visions , ' of folding up events in the involutions of ambiguity , ' of the residium of sophistry when separated from its gazeous constituents , ' and of liquidating a balance of prisoners . ' We occasionally meet with such phrases as embalmed tears , ' winged adversaries , ' and the watchful eye consuming the midnight lamp . ' We have to complain , however , that he sometimes makes use of metaphorical terms of a more low and vulgar stamp . He says of lord Cornwallis , in one instance , that he was visited with his yawning fit . ' Of the Pennsylvania troops , who were mutinous , he observes : La Fayette foresaw that the junction of these troops might prove to him the shirt of Nessus . ' He afterwards says , all the world was at a balk to conjecture the motive of lord Coruwallis , ' &amp;c . We sometimes meet with a word which has not yet found its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' protosire , ' aggressive , ' and bread-stuffs ; ' others of doubtful authority as proclivity , ' sciolous , ' &amp;c . He says of general Greene , that he was born and " raised " in obscurity , ' an expression sometimes applied to the brute creation , but never we believe to the human species . Had this work been the production of an obscure and inexperienced individual , we should not have been thus minute in pointing out faults of this description , but the name of the author carries with it an authority , which we are unwilling to see enlisted in the propagation of a vicious taste . Before we take leave of this publication we should apprise our readers that the blemishes we // have selected are scattered over a wide field which will richly repay the labour of research . An ardent patriotism and an enlightened liberality in religious opinions are conspicuous throughout . We shall be allowed in a more particular manner to acknowledge our obligations to the author for the decided language in which he expresses his detestation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man , whose opinions are entitled to respect , who will lift up his voice against a practice which not only violates the laws of religion and society , but has begun to set common decency at defiance , and seems likely to level the distinction which has hitherto existed between civilized man and the savage . The following extract will show that the opinion of general Greene upon this subject accorded with that of his biographers . It is from a letter written after the fall of a colonel IMalmady , who commanded the North Carolina militia on the day of the Eutaws . The fate of colonel Malmady I suppose you will have heard of . He lost his life by that stupid custom which has in many instantes disgraced the history of the American war , and deprived the public of the services ot many valuable men . it is thus , ' adds Judge Johnson , that all the respectable men who ever were involved in duels , yield to the usurpations of fools over the practices of the times . It is the same weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfortunate widow upon the pile that is lighted under the body of a husband she despised . Can the folly be named which has not at one time or other , tyranized over man , under the auspices of impudent usurpation on the one hand , and the too slavish deference that governs our actions , on the other ? How few dare to act from their own convictions of rectitude , and set at naught the obligations which have no foundation but in fashion or popular opinion ! ' We have already said that we look upon the letters of general Greene as the best part of the book . We prize them highly hot only for the views they afford of the true character and sentiments of the writer , but for the insight they give us into the private opinions of the leading men in the country , respecting the grounds of the controversy , the progress of the contest , and the ultimate views of both parties .
