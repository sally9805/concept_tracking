txt ART . XI. -. iI Sketch of the internal Condition of the United States of . , hneriea , and of their Political Relations with Europe . By A RUSSIAN . Translated from the French . By AN AMERiCAN . With notes . Baltimore . 1826 . Svo. pp. 163 . A FOREIGNER 'S account of our institutions and manners always finds eager readers in America . We entertain this curiosity in common no doubt with all other people ; but in us it has been heightened by some accidents in our situation , into a sort of impatient anxiety . Our portrait has been drawn by those , for the most part , whom some very intelligible feelings have prevented from regarding us with much good nature , while , at the same time , certain affinities existing between us , have encouraged a hope of better treatment at their hands . What has magnified the provocation is the respect we entertain for them at heart , and the means they possess , through the diffi*sion of their language // and literature , of giving currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , that has most sorely moved the spirit of Brother Jonathan . That sturdy personage is no favorite , indeed , nearer home , nor is the dislike of him , among his continental neighbors , to be dated only from the era of Lord Castlereagh . Long before that time he had acquired the unlucky fame of over pertinacious nationality ; would quarrel with the skies of Italy for being too bright , and with his neighbors of France for being too gay ; and , with that insular prejudice , which the most philosophicaj of his own historians has remarked in him , was always mightily inclined to think that there was little worth having out of England . Noxv we can not allow the wealth of our kinsman to be any apology for his ill manners ; and it is with a kind of amazement , that we see him wandering over the world , and every where piquing himself on sullying his national reputation with his individual peculiarities , and , above all , by a sulkiness , which , making every allowance for the vapory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if our elder brother regards with scorn all deviations from his own standard of notions , even in those who speak a different tongue , and live under different laws from his own , he suffers a sort of angry surprise , when he sets foot on these shores of his own planting . Here every thing is at once aliud et idern , the same , yet not exactly the same , with what he has been accustomed to see at home . Where language , dress , manners , and modes of all sorts , are wholly different , comparison is less easy , or their respective merits must be adjusted by that general fitness of things , ' which always leaves much to be said on both sides . But here , where he sees a prevailing similarity to his own institutions , and where the general imitation on our part seems an implied acknowledgment of superiority on his , the particular differences , arising out of physical and moral circumstances , are apt to strike him rather as awkward resemblances , than as intended deviations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , that he ridicules more unsparingly a Scotchman 's or an Irishman 's blunders , in English , than those of a Spaniard or an Italian . It is pretty obvious , in short , without recuVring to more serious causes of difference , why we should meet less grace at the hands of England , than of countries , which , having fewer affinities with ourselves , might seem at first , less likely to appreciate us fairly . In justice . however , it must be o*vned , that a part of all this // must be set down to ignorance . There is , for instance , a strange incapacity of learning American geography in John Bull ; an appellation , by the way , which we bestow on him so often , not in the spirit of reproach , but because , for sonic reason or other , he seems to take a pride in it . We do not refer now to any particular mistake , as when his reviewers enumerate Philadelphia among the States , or his poets make the aloe indigenous in Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labor under , of distinguishing one part of our country from another , and of conceiving that they may have different shades of culture , manners , and civilization . To him it is all as a single point , a wilderness without limits or distinction . He thinks , we believe , that the buffalo runs wild in Boston , and a murder on our remote frontier is enough to give him an ill opinion of the police of Ne*v York . An American could not blunder more , were he to fancy that half naked Highlanders walk about brandishing their claymores in Re* cut Street . He seems quite to forget , that when our progenitors left his shores , they left it with the same refinements that he himself had , or , to use the language of our author , that though our country is new , yet its civilization is old . ' It should not seem incredible , that a country , planted by civilized Englishmen two centuries ago , should have made considerable advances since . These reflections ought to calm the alarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rashness to bethink them of a tour among the North American Indians ; and may perhaps serve to explain how it happens , that a country where men gouge , and stab , and shoot , and play the regulator , ' should have policed cities , and well dressed women , and halls , and assemblies , and operas . But in truth we give oir*elv* quite too much concern about this matter . Time will tell all the truth at length , and place us in the true light , however our critics may darken the picture on the one hand , or we ourselves seek to throw in false glares on the other . For it may he , that we sometimes put forth exorbitant pretensions ; and xvhile enjoying that general content and competence , which seem destined to exist but at one stage in the progress of a community , would claim credit for refinements , which are purchased mostly at the price of too abundant population , of inequality of property , and of all the unpalatable fruits of these to the less fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English kinsmen to correct theit ' // prepossessions at leisure , out readers may be curious to know in what light we appeal to the native of a country , much more widely remote both in situation and manners . The gentleman to whom the work is attributed , whose title stands at the head of this article , is well known in the United States , where he resided and travelled during several years , at different periods , and where his situation and associations were certainly very favorable to just observation . On some points , indeed , it is hardly to be expected , that the subject of a monarchical government will take the tone we could wish . His Sketch , ' however , and it is a mere sketch , will , on the whole , lose him no favor with the moderate and impartial . It adds nothing , to be sure , to our stock of facts concerning ourselves , but it has , at least , Ihe merit of being generally correct ; and if the reflections , which are judicious and temperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves to show , that their author has associated intimately with us , and thus become faq ' *iiiar with tOl ) ics , which are frequent in our political and social circles . Perhaps the best compliment we can pay him is to say , that , fortunately placed as he was for collectin* the materials , we should have been well pleased to see his glance ( aperfu ) extended to more numerous and minute details . The following passages contain some of his remarks on the permanent and the accidental causes of our national prosperity , and of the comparative depression felt at this moment . If not very new to American readers , they may at least please us , by the conviction they express of the stable foundation of our commercial importance . The author speaks thus , in his Preface , of the progress of the country . Wretched villages , which I had left in the midst of impenetrable forests , had assumed the appearance of flourishing towns . Cultivated fields had taken the place of heaths , which not long before seemed impassable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in country wagons , mail stages were to be seen whirling along with the greatest rapidity . Such changes are particularly remarkable in the western part of the state of New York . Preface , p. ii . He next proceeds to account for this surprising prosperity . Natural and imnuitable causes , joined to others entirely acci dental and transient , have concurred in the extraordi nary developement of industry , in a country so recently emaii // cipated , and so far from the great focus of civilization . Among the permanent causes , we must assign the first rank to the geographical situation of the United States , which gives them all the advantages of an insular position , in regard to external security* without excluding those which result from the possession of a territory , immense in extent , and susceptible of every species of culture . ' The great extent of fertile lands , and the abundance of the means of subsistence in the United States , are the more favorable to the population , as it is naturally active , laborious , and enterprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty years succeeding the war of their Independence . This single fact in their statistical annals , has not since been repeated . ' pp. 5 , 6 . After speaking of the establishment of the federal constitution , he proceeds , Under the a*gis of this government , as defective as it would appear at the first glance , the United States have presented themselves to the nations of Europe , to claim their part in the great commerce of the world and the navigation of its seas . This participation would have been inconsiderable , taking into consideration the spareness of the population , the excessive dearness of every species of workmanship , without the long and bloody wars , of which the French revolution was either the cause or the pretext . Seeing nothing to fear from the eruptions of this political volcano , the North Americans profited by the misfortunes of Europe ; and having by a series of favorable circumstances , become the only neutral nation of the civilized world , they soon appropriated to themselves the universal coasting trade , concurrently with the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , to subdue the coasts , from which they were constantly repulsed . Whether the neutral commerce or the coasting trade proved most advantageous to the Americans , or to the other nations with whom it was carried on , certain it is that the profits derived from it by the former were so enormous , that after having paid for all the consumptions of the United States , in foreign merchandise , there still remained enough to gratify the expensive taste of a rising luxuriousness and the no less costly refinements of fashionable life . ' pp. 10 , 11 . Having reviewed successively the interruptions to our neutral navigation , the trade to Spain and Portugal , and finally the pacifleation of Ghent , he says , When the great avenues to these two sources of national wealth were opened to all the nations of Europe , and when they // hastened successively to reclaim their share , that of the Amentans diminished as rapidly as it had increased . ' p. 15 . The disappearance of specie , the invariable consequence of too great an emission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all branches of industry , the depreciati*n of every species of property , the reduction of salaries , were all the bitter fruits of unsuccessful and inordinate speculation , by which it wis attempted to replace commerce in its former prosperous condition . having made enormous fortunes during the space of about a quarter of a century , either by the coasting trade or by other commercial enterprises , the inhabitants of the United States persuaded themselves that this state of things would last forever ; and when the pacification of Europe restored commerce to its natural channels , the thirst after gain and the want of luxury had made too great progress , not to cloud the councils of prudence in the minds of the merchants . Such is , even at this moment , the internal condition of that country . A general depression is felt throughout the populous cities on the shores of the Atlantic , as well as in the rising towns on the banks of Ohio and Mississippi . Every where is heard the complaint of the hardness of the times , the depreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil . But this state of suffering and depression can not be otherwise than temporary , since all the natural means of prosperity which result from local circumstances , such as the extent of territory , the richness and variety of its productions , the advantages of geographical position , possessed by the United States in an eminent degree , remain untouched . When the effects of a sudden transition from war to peace shall have ceased to operate throughout all the countzies of the civilized world ; when commerce and general industry shall have found their natural level ; the part to be acted by the UnitedStates will be sufficiently important to assure them a distinguished rank among commercial nations , and to afford every requisite encouragement to her domestic agriculture . ' pp. 17 , 18 . We can not forbear adding here to our author 's remarks , that in fact the staple commodities of our country have for the most part been disposed of with such facility , that our agriculturists have never tasked their invention in the introduction of new articles of husbandry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Political events , however , will hardly ever ngoin concur in a way so favorable to our commerce , and the effect of a general pacification of Europe must always be sensibly felt by our agriculture ; eircumstanccs which , while they may lead us to coubratulate ourselves on the extent of our domain . // and the variety of products which it insures to us , should induec us to draw from these untried sources , and l ) 1omote a wide system of domestic exchange . The commercial importance , and tile commercial independence , too , of the United States , are , indeed , founded on circumstances , whose results are constant and inevitable ; for they occupy a large space in climates in which the most precious commodities of trade are indigenous , or may be easily naturalized , and are inhabited by a population , whose e*-terprise is not merely the result of temporary success , but must for ever be fostered by the nature of their institutions . But while we have been indebted , we doubt not , to our peculiar institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a question full of interest , on the other hand , in what degree we owe to this general prosperity the fortunate operation of our polity , and how it would withstand the encounter of less propitious circumstances . On this subject the tone of our author is not very confident ; hut on this , and some other defects , which he thinks he detects in our system of government , let him speak for himself . Vie*ved at a distance , this constellation of republics pleases the eye and satisfies the mind ; the principles on which they are based ? , reflect honor upon humanity ; the apparent eff*cts of these popular forms of government , present the image of happiness and contentment ; but as soon as you examine them more closely , you discover serious imperfections , and even anomalies . In watching over individual rights thus tenderly , justice is rendered incompetent to the suppression of many offences committed in the daily transactions of life . Without being very important in themselves , they nevertheless affect public order and tranquillity ; a well or*anized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily , at least in a considerable degree , have prevented their occurrence . In guarding against the abuse of executive power , they have made it incapable of fulfilliag the obligations they have imposed upon it , whether it concerns the conduct of the foreign relations of the country , or those of the confederated states among themselves . In their anxiety to restrict the expenses of government , they have excluded from public employment men of education and talents ; for it is certain , and all those who have sojourned any time in the United States will concur in the opinion , that a seat in Congress is little sought after by lawyers and physicians in possession of an extensive practice. * // This is not , however , the place to enter into a tritical examination of popular governments . Like every other work of man , it bears the stamp of imperfection . But if , as the author believes , limited and constitutional monarchies better guarantee individual safety and public tranquillity than democratical states ; yet it is certain , at least , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adopted ; and whatever we may think of it in other respects , this must be admitted to be a very important advantage in a country which , meteor like , is just bursting from obscurity . ' pp. 39-41 . After all , the institotions of which they seem so proud , having as yet stood the test of but forty years ' experience , can not be regarded as having been submitted to a conclusive experiment . They have yet to pass through the ordeal of the immediate vicinity of a great power like that of Mexico , when this kingdom , after having entirely severed its political ties with Spain , shall be permanently erected into an independent state , either in the form of a constitutional monarchy , or an indivisible republic . The first effect of this change of character on the United States , would be to create an absolute necessity for a considerable increase of their regular army , and thereby of the influence of the federal government . ' p. 4*2 . Of course we do not give our assent to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the experiment of our policy is not yet complete and conclusive ; but if its defects are not all yet brought to light , so neither are its virtues ; if time , as we doubt not , shall expose the principles which tend to dissolution or decay , it will also , we hope , elicit others , which are , so to speak , preservative and curative . r1*hus much there is in its favor , that it seems intrinsically rational and just , and may be exJ ) ected , as in other cases where the fundamental principle is right , to surmount , as occasion may present them , the partial or temporary obstacles , which all systems of human government are liable to encounter . It were uncaudid to deny , that the quiet operation of our government , a government whose hand , as has been often remarked , is hardly discernible among its citizens , may be imputable , in a good degree , to the general facility of subsiste ice . But so , too , it were unreasonable to suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To prevent any misunderstanding on this point , the author does not hesitate to declare it as his conviction , that a republican government alone suits the United States in their present situation , and is the only one which could subsist in that country . ' // institutions , looking at once to the interests of the people and to the diffusion among them , by education , of a ju5t sense of those interests , will not find , in their att ebment , the palliation or cure of defects which may be peculiar to them . Under these impressions , we can neither feel much alarm , from the proximity of Mexico , nor allow that our republican system recommends itself most powerfully by its small expenditure , nor agree that a well organized police is a thing incompatible with American institutions . ' We would set the good order of New England , the spot in which our republican institutions exert , according to our author , their greatest force , in competition with that of any country in the world . The following passages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller , however little accustomed to observe what is passing around him , the interior of the United States offers , un4eniably , a most interesting spectacle . On leaving the maritime cities , where all the conveniences of life have been carried to a high degree of refinement , he sees them insensibly diminish , and civilization grow fainter and fainter , in proportion as he advances westward . After having left splendid and prosperous cities , and travelled for some time , he arrives at regions where the footsteps of the first civilized settlers ( if I may be allowed the expression ) are yet imprinted on the soil . At length he finds himself in the depths of forests , until then , visited only by Indian hunters , and among whom , at long intervals of space , he here and there recognises colonists , but lately arrived with their families , who have no other dwellings than their wagons , and scarcely any other food than the salt provisions they brought with them . Thus , in travelling through the interior of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascend and descend the scale of civilization . The English character may he distinctly seen in all the customs of the inhabitants of that country . The construction of their houses , their dress , food , and even amusements are the same as in Engh.nd , excepting those stronger or weaker shades of difference , which local circumstances and the nature of a government purely democratical , necessarily impress on the character and habits of the North Americans . To these natural affinities , we may add the identity of language , the influence of which is more felt than that of any other ; and we may then easily understand , how the moral sympathies prevail over the political antipathies which exist , in a. signal degree , between England and the // United States . England is not generally beloved by the people of the United States ; yet the English are better received than any other foreigners , especially when they bring with them the air and manner wiuch characterize a good education . Among the shades of difference between the English and American manners , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanliness in the latter . This deficiency arises from various local causes . In the northern , middle , and western states , where the influence of slavery is but faintly visible , the dearness of every species of labor affecting all domestic services , renders them sometimes insufficient for the maintenance of great cleanliness in the interior of the houses . Wherever the law sanctions or even tolerates slavery , uncleanliness is in some measure incurable , because it is the inevitable result of that social disease . What traveller in passing through the American colonies , has not felt surprised at the difference , in point of cleanliness , between those states in which slavery exists , and those in which it is abolished . It might be said that in the former , the blacks , who execute all domestic services , communicate their color to everything they touch . However , it is proper to observe that the preceding remarks apply particularly to inns , taverns , and other public places which are most apt to attract the notice of a traveller . For the houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maritime cities , but also in the interior of the country , exhibit a degree of cleanliness which scarcely leaves anything to be desired , in thc eastern and in some parts of the middle states , even the laboring classes are so remarkable for their cleanliness , that we should seek in vain for the same degree in more than one country of Europe . The daily dress of the Americans differs also from that of the English in being less neat . The Americans are too much occupied with their business , which , in consequence of the dearness of labour and the value of time , would be deranged by neglect , to permit them to devote the same degree of attention to the toilet as is customary in England . it is for the same reason , that they do every thing in a hurry , even to eating their meals , which , under differeiit names , they take four times a day . When Sunday comes to suspend the general bustle , the streets of the large cities and public places , are filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom they invariably communicate the ennui with which they themselves are oppressed . The rudiments of knowledge being very generally diffused throughout the United States , it is not usual to meet , even in the laboring class , with persons who are ignorant of reading , writing , and // arithmetic . English travellers acknowledge that their language , as it is spoken by the generality of the inhabitants of the United States , is purer and more correct than in the mother country , where each province , or in other words county , differs from the rest by its peculiar dialect . But if , after havin* made this concession , we proceed to the examination of the state of the arts and sciences , at the first glance we discover , that as reards them , tfle country is still far behind Europe . The price of labor and time concur in producing such a result . This as ' *ertion requires explanation . We know that the population of the United States , since the period of their independence , has constantly increased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their territory has advanced in a still more rapid progression ; to be convinced of which , it is only necessary to consult the map of the United States , such as they were in 178 ' $ , and afterwards that which has just been published for the use of schools . The first effect of so vast an acce*sion of territory , has been the dispersion of a number of men over an immense surface . ' pp. 110-115 . In those states of the union , in which negro slavery is sanctioned by law , and where consequently all labor is performed by that heterogeneous race , we frequently find , among the opulent planters , men accomplished in education and manners . We can account for this circumstance by remarking , that these planters , relieved by their slaves from all the grosser details of rural and domestic economy . have more leisure to devote to the study of the usefti ! and ornamental sciences , than the citizens of states in which slavery does not exist . Besides , they associate among themselves exclusively , entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are assimilated to other domestic animals ; although in Virginia , South Carolina , and some other states , the proporthrn z blacks amounts to one half the population , and in Louisiana to even more . In this way , the rich living a*i*ng themselves , reciprocally improve each other in civilization ; whilst elsewhere the whole l ) opulation , or at least the great majority of it , being composed of free citizens , the relations between the jich and poor are materially modified by a spirit of equality , and the continual tendency of property to subdivision . If this tendency exist likewise in states tolerating slavery , at least property is retained in the same class ; whilst elsewhere it is distributed throughout all ranks of society . But this advantage enjoyed by the southern planters , is nhnost counterbalanced by the moral iafluonce of slavery over those who profit by it . pp. 119 , 1i20 . With the estimate of our manners contained in these extracts we are disposed to find little fault . As Americans , we can not // hear without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home as well as abroad , that our laws of descent , by which , among other means , we have sought to fortify our republican scheme , are in a fair course to sweep off the whole race of gentlemen ; and , as lovers of mankind , we are loath to admit that cultivation and good manners , though they may be and are found in the proprietors of slaves , are the proper fruif of slavery . Much more sound , and accordant. with experience , seems the sentiment elsewhere advanced by the author , and judiciously suonorte d his * that from such a state of 1 by auno*ator , things tney must contract habits of indolence and effeminacy , which will exert a pernicious influence on their moral and physical faculties . ' As to leisure , afforded by large hereditary estates , it is egregiously apt to be abused . Primogeniture , if we may believe the wits of England , though they for the most part , it must be owned , have been younger brothers , has never been upheld there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters . Yet the aristocracy of England is the best in the world , thanks to the competition of a powerful and intelligent Commons . The following passage will be pronounced a very melancholy one by our countrywomen . The beauty of the women of the United States , is generally acknowledged . But it is of so frail and transient a character , that a sentiment of compassion immediately mingles itself with the pleasure you experience in beholding the young and numerous American beauties , who assemble together in their evening entertainments . You involuntarily compare them to delicate flowers that wither before the slightest breath of a northern wind . The frequent changes in the temperature of the air which distinguish the climate of the United States , exert a fatal influence on the health of the inhabitants and the beauty of the women . pp. 1*29 , 130 . We might add much to lighten the shades of this picture , but our disquisitions have exceeded the limits we intended , and they shall be closed after only one more remark . In our country all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish ; neither its moral nor physical developement is complete ; and the theorist can only pronounce , that thus far it has , in an admirable degree , subserved the substantial ends of human society . But as yet we have fairly proved neither the productive power of the soil , nor the auspiciousness of the climate to heman life , nor the capacity of the country foi commerce . Neither have // we yet seen the full play of the political machine , nor its whole effect on manners and society . Nor have we modified the habits , manners , and tastes received from our ancestors , so as to adapt them in all respects to the climate we have found , or the polity we have established . In our turn of thought and prevailing opinions may yet be found something of the English leaven , even , sometimes , when it contravenes our own institutions ; as in our hahitations , . our dress , and many other physical circumstances , there is yet a spice of English taste , not always very suitable to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ease and spirit , and with a discernible and very proper adherence to the style of the original , which is , however , not exactly the French of a Frenchman . To this adherence to the original may he attributed a few Gallicisms here and there . Some errors of haste are also observahle both in the translation and in the typography ; and as haste is hardly a legitimate excuse for errors in the eyes of reviewers , we hope there may be an opportunity for correcting them in a second edition . The notes appended are respectable , and , besides some corrections of the author 's mistakes , contain judicious reflections . On the whole it is a modest and sensible book , which its translator has given to us in an agreeahle style ; and which we hope will be read , if it be only to see with what candor and discretion the subject of a despotic prince can speak of a republic and its institutions .                  @ @ @
