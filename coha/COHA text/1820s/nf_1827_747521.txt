txt FIVE years having elapsed since the first publication of the American Builder ; during which time I have been constantly employed in drawing and executing plans for buildings . The experience of that time enables me to confirm some , and reject other former methods . Sixteen plates , which were in the first edition , I have laid aside , and have added twenty-nine new ones ; which almost make this a new work . I have first laid down and explained such problems in Geometry , as are absolutely necessary to the well understanding of the subject . I have next treated on the origin of building , of mouldings , and of the orders . I have endeavoured to explain them so clearly and fully , that they can not be misunderstood . At first they were selected from several authors , drawn at large , and wrought . After careful examination , such parts as I did not approve , were altered , by drawing and working them over again , and repeating this process several times , till after the most minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , I was confirmed in the opinion , that no further alterations for the better could be made ; for the result of which experiments see these orders as they are severally laid down . I have given the Tuscan column eight diameters in height , in imitation of the Trajan and Antonian columns at Rome , which are of that height , and reckoned of the Tuscan order ; and have regularly progressed , by giving the Doric nine , the Ionic ten , the Corinthian and composite eleven diameters each . 1 expect it will be said by some , who rigidly adhere to the proportions of the ancients , that the Tuscan column ought not to be but seven , the Doric eight , the Ionic nine , and the Corinthian and Composite ten Diameters each in height . /z/ Experience has taught me that no determinate rule for columns , in all situations , will answer ; they must be proportioned according to the weight , or apparent weight they are to sustain . I do not recollect , in the course of seventeen years extelisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the proportion here given ; and in but few cases so large . My principal aim has been directed toward explaining with perspicuity , the foundation of this art ; the orders , and their particular parts . For this explajiation I am principally indebted to Sir William Chambers 's incomparable Treatise on Civil Architecture ; how far I have succeeded in my attempt , 1 must submit to the judgment of others . I have given examples of sashes , sash frames , and shutters ; and how to set them in a brick wall ; have also treated fully on stairs ; for which , I must acknowledge myself indebted to P. Nicholson 's excellent books on that subject . Several plans and elevations of buildings of different kinds , are to be found in this work , with observations on their several and particular parts . Note . It may perhaps be asked , why Mr. Raynerd 's name , which appeared in the first edition , docs not appear in this ; I answer , he sold all his right and title to the work soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were drawn and explained by him , have his name affixed to them . March 1814 . PUBLISIIEllS ' ADVERTISEMENT , /z/ Since the copy right of this work has been transferred to the present proprietors , they have with the advice of the editor and other eminent architects and builders , enlarged this work by additional matter and plates , on Stairs , and on Grecian Doric and Ionic Architecture from the most celebrated remains of antiquity , and an additional plan and elevation for a Meeting-House or Church . The new plates are numbered alphabetically . . July 1827. /z/ Geometry , is that Science which treats of the discriptions and proportions of magnitudes in general . A point is that which has position , but no magnitude nor dimensions ; neither length , breadth , nor thickness , as A. A right line , is length without breadth or thickness , as 1 . A mixed line , is both right and curved , as 2 . A curve line continually changes its direction between its extreme points , as 3 . Parallel lines are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ever so far produced , as 4 and 5 . Oblique right lines change their distance , and would meet , if produced , on the side of the least distance , as 6 . One line is perpendicular to another , when it inclines not more on the one side than the other ; or when the angles on both sides of it are equal , as 7 . A surface , or superfices , is an extension , or a figure , but without thickness , as 8 . A body , or solid , is a figure of three dimensions ; namely , length , breadth , and thickness , as 9 . A hne , or a circle , is tangential , or a tangent to a circle , or other curve , when it touches it without cutting , when both are produced , as 10 . An angle is the inclination , or opening of two lines , having different directions , and meeting in a point , as 1 1 . A right angle is that which is made by one line perpendicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equal to one another , as the lines a b , and a c , on 16. ' /z/ An acute angle is less than a right angle , as 12 . An obtuse angle , is greater than a right angle , as 13 . Plain figures that are bound by right lines have names according to the number of their sides , or of their angles ; for they have as many sides as angles ; the least number being three . A figure of three sides and angles , is called a triangle , as 14 , 15 , 16 , and 17 ; and they receive particular denominations from the relations of their sides and angles . An equilateral triangle , is that whose three sides are all equal , as 14 . A right angled triangle , is that which has one right angle , as 16 . An isosceles triangle has only two sides equal , as 15 . A scalene triangle has all sides unequal , as 17 . An obstuse angled triangle has one obstuse angle , as 17 . Of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 8 , which is a plain regular figure , whose superfices are limited by four equal sides , all at right angles with one another . The parallelogram 19 , receives its name from its opposite sides and ends , being parallel to each other ; the parallelogram is also called a long square , or oblong , in consequence of its being longer than it is wide . The rhomboids 20 , is an equilateral parallelogram , whose angles are oblique , as 20. * A trapezium is a quadrilateral , which has neither of its sides parallel , as 21 . A trapezoid hath only one pair of its opposite sides parallel , as 22 . Plane figures having more than four sides are in general called polygons , and receive other particular names , according to the number of their sides or angles . A pentigon , is a polygon of five sides , as fig. 13 , plate 2 . A hexigon , is a polygon of six sides , as fig. 14 , plate 2 . A heptagon has seven sides ; an octagon eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undecagon eleven ; and a dodecagon twelve . A regular polygon has all its sides and its angles equal ; and if they are not equal the polygon is irregular . An equilateral triangle is also a regular figure of three sides , and a square is one of four : the former being called a trigon , and the latter a tetragon. /q/ A circle , is a plain figure , bounded by a curve line , called the circumference , which is every where equidistant from a certain point within , called its centre . The radius of a circle , is a right line drawn from the centre to the circumference , as a b , 23 . A diameter of a circle , is a right line drawn through the centre , terminating on both sides of tile circumference , as c d , on 23 . An arch of a circle is any part of the circumference , as a b , 24 . A chord is a right line joining the extremities of an arch , as a b , 24 . A semicircle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by diameter , as c d , 25 . A section , is any part of a circle , bounded by an arch and two radii , drawn to its extremities , as 26 . A quadrant , or quarter of a circle , is a sector , having a quarter of the circumference for its arch , and the two radii are perpendicular to each other , as c a , and o c , 27 . The measure of any right lined angle , is an arch of any circle contained between the two lines , which form the angle , and the angular point being in the centre , as 30 . The height , or altitude of any figure , as perpendicular let fall from an angle or its vertex to the opposite side , called the base , as the line , a b , 28 . When an angle is denoted by three letters , the middle one is the place of the angle , and the other two denote the sides containing that angle ; thus , let a b d , be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a b and b d , are the two sides containing that angle . /z/ To draw a perpendicular to a given point in a line , a b is a. line , and d a given point ; take a and b , two equal distances on each side of d , and with your compasses in a and b , make an intersection at c , and draw c d , which ife the perpendicular required . /z/ To erect a perpendicular on the end of a line .

Note . - If mouldings are only composed of parts of a circle , and straight lines , they are called Roman ; because the Romans , in their buildings , seldom or never , employed any other curve for mouldings , than that of a circle ; but if a moulding , is made of part of an ellipsis , or a parabola , or any hyperbole , the mouldings are then in the Grecian taste ; hence it appears , that mouldings of the Grecian taste , are of much greater variety than those of the Roman , where only parts of circles are concerned . Although I have made use of the Roman ovolo and ogee iu all the orders , I do not generally use them in practice ; the bending , or turning inward , of the upper edge of the Grecian , ot quirk ovolo , when the sun shines on its surface , causes a beautiful variety of light and shade , which greatly relieves it from plane surfaces ; and if it is entirely in shadow , but receive a reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top , will cause it to contain a greater quantity of shade in that place , but softened downward around the moulding to the under edge . In the Roman ovolo there is no turning inward , at the top ; therefore , when the sun shines on its surface , it will not be so bright , on its upper edge , as the Grecian ovolo ; nor will it cause so beautiful a line of distinction from the other mouldings , with which it is combined , when it is in shadow , and when lighted by reflection . /q/ In the Greek ogee , the turning in of its upper edge , and the turning out of its under edge , will , when the sun shines bright , cause it to be very bright on these edges , which will greatly relieve it from other perpendicular surfaces when combined together ; and when it is in shadow , and lighted by reflection , the inclination of the upper and under edges will also make a strong line of distinction , on both edges , between it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; whereas the upper and under edges of the Roman ogee , being perpendicular to the horizon , the lightest place on its surface will not be lighter than a perpendicular j ) lanc surface ; nor will it be better relieved in shadow than perpendicular plane surfaces , also in shadow . /z/ To describe the Grecian ovolo , the tangent a b , at the bottom , and the point of contact and the greatest projection of the moulding at c , being given .

Scripture informs us that Cain built a city ; and soon after the deluge we hear of many cities , and of an attempt to build a tower that should reach the sky . A miracle stopped the progress , and prevented the com.pletion of that bold design . The first men , living in a warm climate , wanted no habitations ; every grove afforded a shade from the rays of the sun , and shelter from the dews of the night ; rain fell but seldom , nor was it ever sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or necessary , even in the hours of repose . They fed upon the spontaneous productions of the soil , and lived without care , and without labour . But when the human species increased , and the produce of the earth , however luxuriant , was insufficient to supply the requisite food . When frequent disappointments drew on contention , with all its train of calamities , then separation became necessary , and colonies dispersed to difterent regions , where frequent rains , storms , and piercing cold , forced the inhabitants to seek for better shelter than trees . At first they most likely retired to caverns , formed by nature in rocks , to hollow trunks of trees , or to holes dug by themselves in the earth ; but soon disgusted with the damp and darkness of these habitations , they began to search after more wholesome and comfortable dwellings . The animal creation pointed out both materials and manners of construction . Swallows , rooks , bees , and storks , were the first builders . Man observed their instinctive operations ; he admired ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a structure suited to mechanical purposes , he soon outdid his masters in the builder 's art . Rude and unseemly , doubtless , were the first attempts ; without experience or tools the builder collected a few bows of trees , spread them in a conic shape , and covering them v ; ith rushes or leaves and clay , formed his hut ; sufficient to shelter its hardy mhabitants at night , or in seasons of bad weather . But in the course /q/ of time man naturally grew more expert ; they invented tools to shorten and improve labour ; fell upon neater , more durable modes of construction ; and forms better adapted than the cone , to the purposes for which their huts were intended . They felt the want of convenient habitations , wherein to taste the comforts of privacy , to rest securely , and be effectually screened from troublesome excesses of weathers . They wanted room to exercise the arts , to which necessity had given birth ; to deposit the grain that agriculture enabled them to raise in abundance ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced them to collect and dompsticate . Thus stimulated , their fancy and hands went arduously to work , and the progress of improvement was rapid . That the primitive hut was of a conic figure it is reasonable to conjecture ; for of that form do the American Aborigines build their wigwams ; and from its being simplest of the solid forms , and most easily constructed . And wherever wood was found , they probably built in the manner above described ; but , soon as the inhabitants discovered the inclined sides , and the want of upright space in the cone , they changed it for the cube ; and as it is supposed , proceeded in the following manner . Having , says Vitruvius , marked out the space to be occupied by the hut , they fixed in the ground several upright trunks of trees to form the sides , filling the intervals between them with branches , closely interwoven , and spread over with clay . The sides thus completed , four beams were laid on the upright trunks , which , being well fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides firm ; and likewise served to support the covering , or roof of the building , composed of smaller trees , placed horizontally like joists , upon which , were laid several beds of reeds , leaves , and earth , or clay . By degrees , other improvements took place ; and means were found to make the fabric lasting , neat and handsome , as well as convenient . The bark and other protuberances were taken from the trees that formed the sides ; these trees were raised above the dirt and humidity , on stones ; were covered at the top with other stones and firmly bound round at both ends with ozier , or cords , to secure them from splitting . The spaces between the joists of the roof , were closed up with clay or wax , and the ends of them either smoothed , or covered with boards . /z/ The dift'erent beds of materials that composed the covering , were cut straight at . the eaves , and distinguished from each other by diiferent projections . The form of the roof too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatness , unfit to throw oft ' the rains which sometimes fell in great abundance , it was raised in the middle , on trees disposed like rafters , after the form of a gable roof . This construction , simple as it appears , probably gave birth to most of the parts that now adorn our buildings : particularly to the orders , which may be considered as the basis of the whole decorative part of architecture ; for when structures of wood were set aside , and men began to erect solid , stately edifices of stone , having nothing nearer to imitate , they naturally copied the parts which necessity introduced in the primitive hut ; insomuch that the upright trees , with the stones and cordage at each end of them , were the origin of columns , bases , and capitals ; the beams and joists , gave rise to architraves and friezes , with their triglyphs and metops ; and the gable roof was the origin of pediments ; as the beds of materials , forming the covering , and the rafters supporting them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , modillions , and dentils . As , in many other arts , so in architecture , there are certain elementary forms , which , though simple in their nature , and few in number , are the principal constituent objects of every composition , however complicated or extensive it may be . /z/ Of these there are , in this art , two distinct sorts ; the first consisting of such parts , as represent those that were essentially necessary in the construction of the primitive huts ; as the shaft of the column , with the plinth of its base , and the abacus of its capital , representing the upright trees , with the stones used to raise , and to cover them . Likewise the architrave and triglyph , representing the beams and joists ; the mutules , modillions , and dentils , either representing the rafters , or some other pieces of timber employed to support the covering ; and the corona , representing the beds of materials which composed the covering itself All these /z/ are properly distinguished by the appellation of essential parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived for the use and ornament of these , and intended either to support , to shelter , or to unite them gracefully together , which are usually called mouldings , constitute the second class . Of regular mouldings , there are eight , which are , the fillet , the astragal or bead , the cimareversa or ogee , the cimarecta , the cavetto or hollow , the ovolo or quarter round , the scotia , and the torus . The names of these are allusive to their forms ; and the forms are adapted to the uses which they are intended to serve . The ovolo and ogee , being strong at their extremities are fit for supports ; the cimarecta and cavetto , though improper for that purpose , as they are weak in the extreme parts , and terminate in a point , are well contrived for coverings to shelter other members ; the tendency of their outline being very opposite to the direction of falling vater , which , for that reason , can not glide along their surface , but must necessarily drop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bind and strengthen the parts on which they are employed ; and the use of the fillet and scotia , is only to separate , contrast , and strengthen the effect of the other mouldings ; to give a graceful turn to the profile , and to prevent that confusion , which would be occasioned by joining several convex members together . An assemblage of essential parts and mouldings , is termed a profile ; and on the choice , dispositions , and proportions of these , depend the beauty or deformity of the composition . The most perfect profiles , are such as consist of few mouldings , varied both in form and size ; fitly applied , with regard to their uses , and so distributed , that the straight and curved ones , succeed each other alternately . In every profile , there should be a predominant member , to which all the others ought to seem subservient ; and made , cither to support , to fortify , or to shelter it from injuries of wcathcr ; and whenever the profile is considerable , or much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or more , other principal members ; in form and dimension , calculated to attract the eye ; create momentary pauses ; and assist the perception of the beholder . These predominant and principal members , ought always to be of the essential class , and generally rectangular . Thus , in a cornice , the corona predominate ; the modillions and dentiles are principals in the compositions ; the cimarecta and cavetto , cover them ; the ovolo and ogee , support them . /z/ When ornaments are employed to decorate a profile , some of the mouldings should always be left plain , in order to form a proper repose ; for when all are enriched , the figure of the profile is lost in confusion . In an entablature , the corona should not be ornamented ; nor the modillion band ; neither should the plinths of column , fillets , nor scarcely any square members be carved ; for , o-enerally speaking , they are either principal in the composition , or used as boundaries to other parts : in both which cases their figures should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should reniain uncut , where the ovolo and ogee immediately above and below it are enriched ; for when the dentils are marked , the three members are confounded together and being covered with ornaments , become far too rich for the remainder of the composition , which are defects , at all times studiously to be avoided ; as a distinct outline , and an equal distribution of enrichments , must , on every occasion , be strictly attended to . Ornaments should neither be too frugally employed , nor distributed with too much profusion ; their value will increase , in proportion to the judgment and discretion shown in their application . Variety in ornaments should not be carried to an excess . In architecture they are only accessaries ; and therefore they should not be too striking , nor capable of long detaining the attention from the main object . Those of the mouldings in particular , should be simple , uniform , and never composed of more than two different representations upon each moulding ; which ought to be cut each equally deep ; be formed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same dimensions , in order to produce one even uninterrupted hue throughout ; that so the eye may not be more strongly attracted by any part in particular , than by the whole composition . All the ornaments in the entablature are to be governed by the modillions , or mutules ; and the distribution of these must depend on the intervals of the columns ; and be so disposed , that one of them may come directly over the axis of each column . It is farther to be observed , that the ornaments must partake of the character of the order they enrich ; ued in the Doric and Ionic orders , are to be of simple forms , and of larger bulk than those employed in the Corinthian or Composite . AMERICAN BUILDER 'S COMPAiMO. 29 When friezes , or other larger members , are to be enriched , the ornaments may be significant , and serve to indicate the destination , or use of the building : the rank , qualities , profession , and achievments of the owner . In sacred places , all obscene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for indecent fables , extravagant conceits , or instruments and symbols of pagan worship , are very improper ornaments in structures cou secrated to christian devotion . With regard to the manner of executing ornaments , it is to be remembered , that , as in sculpture , drapery is not estimable , unless its folds are contrived to grace , and indicate the parts and articulations of the body it covers ; so in architecture , the most exquisite ornaments lose all their value , if they load , alter , or confuse the form they are designed to enrich and adorn . The method of the ancient sculptors , in the execution of architectonic ornaments , was , to aim at a perfect representation of the object they chose to imitate ; so that the chesnuts , acorns , or eggs , with which the ovolo is commonly enriched , are , in the antiques , cut round , and almost entirely detached ; as are likewise the berries , or beads , on the astragal , which are generally as much hollowed into the solid of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , shells , and flowers , that adorn the cavetto , cima , ogee , and torus , are kept flat , like the things they represent . In the application of their ornaments , they observed to use such as required a considerable relief on mouldings , that in themselves are clumsy , as the ovolo and astragal ; which , by means of the deep incisions made in them to form these enrichments , acquired an extraordinary lightness ; but on more elegant parts , as the cavetto , and cima , they employed thin bodies , which could be represented without entering too far into the solid . The ornaments of their cornices were boldly marked , that they might be distinguished from afar ; but those of the basis of columns , or of pedestals , being nearer the eye , were more sHghtly expressed ; as well on that account , as because it would have been improper to weaken these parts , and impossible to keep them clean , had there been any deep cavities in them , to harbour dust or filth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and liable to close inspection , every part of the ornament should be expressed , and well finished ; but when they are much exalted , the detail may be slightly touched , or entirely neglected ; for it is sufficient if the general form be distinct , and the principal masses strongly marked . A few rough strokes from the hand of a skilful master , are much more eflectual than the most elaborate finishings of an artless imitator ; which , seldom consisting m more than smoothing and neatly rounding oflf the parts , are calculated to destroy , rather than to produce effect . /z/ The orders of architecture , as has been observed , are the basis upon which the whole decorative part of the art is chiefly built , and toward which the attention of the artist must ever be directed , even where no orders are introduced . In them , originate most of the forms used in decoration ; they regulate most 9f . the proportions ; and to their combination , multiplied , varied , and arranged , in a thousand different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These orders are different modes of building , said , originally , to have been imitated from the primitive huts ; being composed of such parts as were essential in their construction , and afterward also in the temples of antiquity ; which , though at first simple and rude , were , in the course of time , and by the ingenuity of succeeding architects , wrought up and improved , to such a pitch of perfection , that they were by way of excellence , distinguished by the name of orders . Of these there are five ; three said to be of Grecian origin , are called Grecian orders ; , being distinguished by the names of Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian ; they exhibit three distinct characters of composition ; supposed to have been suggested by the diversity of character in the human frame . The remaining two , being of Italian origin , are called Latin orders ; they are distinguished by the names of Tuscan and Roman , and were probably invented with a view of extending the AMERICAN BUILDER 'S COMPAMUX : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward strength and snnilarity : as on the other toward elegance and profusion of enrichments . At what time the orders were invented , or by whom improved to the utmost , remains , at least , doubtful . And of their origin little is known but from the relation of Vitruvius ; the veracity of which has been much questioned , and is , probably , not much to be depended on . " Dorus , " says he , " son of Helenes and the nymph Optica , king of Achaia and of all the Peloponnesus , having formerly built a temple to Juno , in the city of Argos ; this temple happened to be in the manner which is called Doric ; and was afterward imitated in many others , built in the several cities of Achaia . " About the same time , the Athenians , after having consulted the oracle of Apollo , at Delphos , by the common consent of all Greece , sent into Asia thirteen colonies , each under the command of a separate captain ; but all under the general direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being arrived in Asia , conquered all Caria , and founded thirteen large cities ; the inhabitants whereof , having expelled the Carians and Leleges , called the country Ionia , in honor of Ion , their leader ; and erected temples , of which the first , dedicated to Apollo Panionius , was built after the manner of those they had seen in Achaia , which they called Doric , because temples of the same sort had been erected in the cities of the Dorians . " But some time after , building a temple to Diana , different from these , and of a more delicate structure ; being formed upon the proportions of a female body , as the Doric had been on those of a robust man ; and adornino- the capitals of their columns with volutes , to represent the curls of a woman 's hair ; and the shafts with flutings , to express the folds of her garment . They gave to this second manner of building the name of Ionic ; because it was invented , and first used by the lonians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinthian , and represent the delicate figure of a young girl , owe their birth to the following accident . " A young woman of Corinth being dead , her nurse placed on her tomb a basket , containing certain trinkets , in which she delighted , wheq , alive ; covering it with a tile to shelter them from the weather . The basket happened accidentally to be set on a root of the acanthus , which pushing forth its leaves and sprigs /z/ in the spring , covered the sides of it ; and some of them , longer than the rest , being obstructed by the angles of the tile , were forced downward , and by deo-rees , curled into the form of volutes . " Callimachus , a celebrated sculptor , passing near the tomb , observed the basket and in how graceful a manner the leaves of the acanthus had surrounded it ; the form pleased him exceedingly ; he imitated it on the tops of some columns , which he afterward executed at Corinth ; establishing and regulating by this model , the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Latin orders , the Tuscan is said to have been invented by the inhabitants of Tuscany , before the Romans had intercourse with the Greeks , or were acquainted with their arts ; whence it is called Tuscan . Probably , however , these people , originally a colony of Greeks , only imitated , in the best manner they could , what they remembered in their own country ; simplifying the Doric , either to expedite their work , or perhaps , to adapt it to the abilities of their workmen . The second Latin order , though of Roman production , is but of modern adoption ; the ancients never having considered it as a distinct order . It is a mixture of the Ionic and Corinthian and is now distinguished by the names of Roman , or Composite . The ingenuity of man has , hitherto , not been able to produce a sixth order , though large premiums have been offered , and numerous attempts made , by men of the first rate talents to accomplish it . Such is the fettered human imagination ; such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ionic , and Corinthian , have ever floated uppermost ; and all that has ever been produced , amounts to nothing more than different arrangements and combinations of their parts . An order is composed of two principal members ; the column , and the entablature ; each of which is divided into three principal parts . Those of the column , are the base , the shaft , and the capital . Those of the entablature , are the architrave , the frieze , and the cornice . All these are again subdivided into many smaller parts ; the disposition , number , forms , and dimensions , of which , characterize each order , and express the degree of strength or delicacy , richness or simplicity peculiar to it . /q/ Th6 simplest , and most solid of all , is the Tuscan . It is composed of few , tind large parts , devoid of ornaments ; and is of a construction so massive , that it seems capable of supporting the heaviest burdens . There is no regular example of this order among the remains of antiquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found at Rome , but of what date is uncertain . Vitruvius , in an indistinct manner , has mentioned its general proportions ; but through his whole book does not refer to one structure of this order . The Trajan and Antonine columns at Rome are reckoned of the Tuscan order ; they have eight diameters for their height : the torus and capitals are certainly more ornamented than is consistent with Tuscan plainness . The fluting to the necks also are after the most ancient Doric examples . It is somewhat singular there should be no remains of this order ; and were it not for what little Vitruvius has written of it , it certainly might have been lost to the moderns . The plainness of its appearance , no doubt , caused it to be neglected at Rome ; but in no other place has been discovered any truly ancient example . As this order conveys ideas of strength and rustic simplicity , it may very properly be used for rural purposes ; for farm-houses , barns , sheds , stables , and greenhouses ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; also , in colonades and porticos , surrounding squares , markets , and granaries , or storehouses ; and generally , wherever magnificence is not required , and expense is to be avoided . The design , hero annexed , and also the Doric , Ionic , Corinthian , and Composite orders , I have selected from several authors , and have made all the alterations , that in my opinion , were necessary to render them conformable to the practice of the present time . The Doric order , next in strength to the Tuscan , and of a grave , robust , masculine aspect , is , by Scammozzi , called the Herculean . Being the most ancient of all the orders , it retains more of the structure of the primitive huts , in its form , than any of the rest ; having triglyphs in the frieze , to represent the ends of joists ; and mutules in its cornice , to represent rafters , with inclined soffits , to express their direction in the originals , from whence they were imitated . Its /z/ column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a base , in imitation of the trees , used in the first buildings , without any plinths to raise them above the ground . Delicate ornaments are repugnant to its characteristic solidity , and it succeeds best , in the simple regularity of its proportions . Nosegays and garlands of flowers grace not a Hercules , who always appears more becomingly , with a rough club and lion 's skin . For there are beauties of various sorts , and often so dissimilar , in their natures , that those which may be highly proper on one occasion , may be quite the reverse , even ridiculously absurd , on others . The ancients employed the Doric in temples dedicated to Minerva , to Mars , and to Hercules ; whose grave and manly dispositions , suited well with the character of this order . Serlio , says it is proper for churches dedicated to Jesus Christ ; to St. Paul , St. Peter , or any other saints , remarkable for their fortitude , in exposing their lives , and suffering for the christian faith . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial men ; in mausoleums erected to their memory ; likewise in all kinds of military buildings ; as arsenals , gates of fortified places , guard-rooms , and similar structures . The Ionic , being the second of the Grecian orders , holds a middle station , between the other two ; and stands in equipoise between the grave solidity of the Doric , and the elegant delicacy of the Corinthian . Among the antiques , however , we find it in different dresses ; sometimes more simple , and bordering on Doric plainness , all according to the fancy of the architect , or nature of the structure where employed . It is , throughout , of a more slender construction than either of the afore described orders ; its appearance , though simple , is graceful and majestic ; its ornaments should be few ; rather neat than luxuriant . As the Doric order is , particularly in churches or temples , dedicated to male saints , so the Ionic is principally used in such as are consecrated to females of the matronal state . It is likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seminaries , and other structures , having relation to arts or letters ; and in private houses ; and in all places dedicated to peace and tranquillity . The- ancients employed it in temples sacred to Juno , to Bacchus , to Diana , and other deities , whose dispositions held a medium between the severe and the effeminate. /q/ The Corinthian . Its proportions are elegant in the extreme ; every part of the order is divided into a great variety of members ; and abundantly enriched with a diversity of ornaments . The ancients , says Dc Chambray , aiming at the representation of a feiiiinine beauty , omitting nothing , either calculated to embellish , or capable of perfecting their work . And he observes , that in many examples left of this order , such a profusion of different ornaments is introduced , that they seem to have exhausted imagination in the contrivance of decorations for this masterpiece of the art . The ancients frequently employed the Ionic entablature in the Corinthian order , as appears by many of the buildings ; and sometimes , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the modillion cornice is employed on large concave surfaces , the sides of the modillions and coffers of the soffit , should tend toward the centre of curve ; but when the concave is small , it will be better to direct them toward the opposite point in the circumference , that the contraction may be less perceptible , and the parts dependant thereon , suffer less deviation from the natural form . The same rules must be observed with regard to dentils , to the abacus and bases of columns or pilasters , and likewise to the flanks of the pUaster itself . But on a convex surface , the sides of these should be parallel to each other ; for it would be unnatural and very disagreeable , to see them the narrowest where they spring out of the cornice , diverging as they advance forward , forming sharp angles , and a sort of mutilated triangular plan , with enlarged solids , and diminished intervals ; all calculated to destroy the usual proportions and beauty of the composition . The Corinthian order is proper for all buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ancients employed it in temples dedicated to Venus , to Flora , Proserpine , and the nymphs of fountains ; because the flowers , foliage , and volutes , with which it is adorned , seemed well adapted to the delicacy and elegance of such deities . Being the most splendid of all the orders , it is proper for the decoration of squares , or galleries and arcades , surrounding them ; for churches , and on account of its rich , gay , and graceful appearance , it may with propriety , be used in theatres , in ball or banqueting rooms , and in all places consecrated to festive mirth , or convivial recreation . /z/ Care must be taken in Corinthian , as well as in Composite capitals , that the feet of the lower leaves , do not project beyond the upper part of the shaft of the column ; because they then hide a considerable part of the upper row of leaves , and give a stunted , disagreeable form to the whole capital . The different divisions of the acanthus leaf , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each leaf , must be firmly marked , and massed in a very distinct manner ; the stems that spring from between the upper leaves , are to be kept low upon the vase of the capital , while rising between the leaves , then spring gradually forward , to form the different volutes . The Composite or Roman order , certainly owes its origin to that constant solicitude after novelty , which ever renders the mind of man restless in an enlightened and highly cultivated age . The desire of variety and novelty , either of new invention , or combination , certainly engaged the Roman architects to unite with the proportions and enrichments of the Corinthian order , the angular volute , and dentils of the Ionic , and by this union to compose a new order . The introduction of the angular Ionic volute , and the omission of the upper row of leaves in the capital , certainly give it a more bold and noble aspect , than that of the Corinthian capital , yet different from any of the other orders , possessing an elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very agreeable and happy effects . There are many examples remaining at Rome , which show the general estimation of this order there , in the height of its splendour and prosperity . In their triumphal arches it was used with good effect , where it produced an agreeable boldness , uniting elegance and ornament . The example here given of the column , its base , and capital , is that executed in the triumphal arch , erected in honor of Vespasian and Titus at Rome . The entablature is nearly a copy of that of Sir William Chambers . The cornice differs from the Corinthian , only in the modillions , which are square , and composed of two facias . The soffit of the intervals between the dentils , may be hollowed upward behind the little fillet in front , which occasions 9. dark shade , that marks the dentil more distinctly . And the same method may be observed in the Ionic and Corinthian orders , for the same reason . The rose ? in the soffit of the corona , are not to project beyond its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frequently in their triumphal arches , than in any other buildings ; meaning to express their dominion over those nations , that invented the orders of which this is composed . It may , with propriety , be used , wherever elegance and magnificence are to be united ; but it is more particularly adapted to buildings , designed to commemorate signal events , or , to celebrate the virtues and achievments of conquerors and legislators ; because the capitals , and other ornaments , may be composed of emblems , and of allusive representations . /z/ To draw the Tuscan order to any given height . Divide E F , fig . B , into thirty nine equal parts ; take four of them for the diameter of the column , just above its base , as the scale i , k , which is divided into sixty equal parts , and are called minutes ; first divide i k into twelve equal parts , then one twelfth , as 5 k , into five , each of which is called a minute ; * then each member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in height or projection . If it should be necessary to add a subplinth , divide the whole height into forty-three equal parts ; give four of them to the diameter of the column , and four , or one diameter to the height of the subplinth ; if a pedestal be required , divide the whole height into forty-eight parts ; take four of them for the diameter of the column , and give nine , or two diameters and fifteen minutes to the height of the pedestal . On plate 21 is a block cornice , which may sometimes be used instead of the plain one , where it is seen at a considerable distance ; draw it by the same scale by which the rest of the order is drawn . To diminish the column , divide its shaft into three equal parts ; leave the lowest third part undiminished ; divide the remaining two thirds into any number of parts , as three at 1 , 2 , and 50 , and divide the difference of the semidiameter e i in B , or b a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal parts ; draw a line from C , at the base of A , to 2 at the top , which will intersect the line 2 , 3 , at 3 ; then draw a line from C to 1 , which will intersect 1 , 4 , at 4 , tack in brads at C , 4 , 3 , and a ; bend a thin lath or strip , round them , and you will have the contour or curve of the column . Note . Figs . A , and B , are diminishing rules ; I have explained that of A , which shows the same thing as B , which is not in its just proportion , but clearer to inspection . * Proceed in the same manner to make the scale of for all the other orders . H . Tuscan Orbek To draw the Doric order . Divide the whole heiglit into sixty-five equal parts , six of which are the diameter of the column , just above its base ; the column , including base and capital , is nine diameters high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . If it should be required to execute this order on a pedestal , divide the whole height into eighty equal parts , six of which are the diameter of the column ; the pedestal is two diameters and thirty minutes high , or fifteen of those parts .

Divide the whole height into forty seven equal parts , four of which are the diameter of the column , just above its base ; the column , including base and capital , is ten diameters high ; the entablature is one diameter and forty five minutes high . If it should be required to execute this order on a pedestal , divide the whole heiiht into twenty nine equal parts ; two of which are the diameter of the column ; the pedestal is two diameters and forty five minutes high ; if necessary to execute it on a subphnth , divide the whole height into fifty one equal parts , four of which will be the diameter of the column ; make the subplinth one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one half , or eleven minutes in front ; place them thirty one minutes from centre to centre ; always the centre of a modiUion exactly over the centre of each column ; to draw the curve of the plancer , or under side of it , see plate 2CL /z/ Divide a 6 , into six equal parts ; on 4 , make the arch 5 , i , on c , which is 1 1-2 part ; from 4 , make the arch , n , on a ; with the same distance in your compasses , complete the arch , 71 , 1 , a . Fig. 1 , is the plancer of the cornice . On plate 21 , is an Ionic cornice , with dentils , which may be drawn from the same scale as the rest of the order , and used instead of the modillion cornice . /z/ To draw the Corinthian order . Divide the whole height into twenty six equal parts ; give two of them to the diameter of the column : if , on a subplinth , divide the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the diameter of the column , and make the subplinth one diameter of the column in height : if a pedestal is to be added , divide the whole height into thirty four equal parts ; two of which are the diameter of the column ; make the pedestal three diameters of the column in height ; the entablature is two diameters high ; cornice , forty eight minutes ; frieze , forty one ; architrave , thirty one ; capital , seventy ; base , thirty minutes ; column , including base and capital , eleven diameters . I have given this order Palladios Ionic base for the sake of variety : but the Attic base may , with propriety , be used in all the orders , except the Tuscan ; if no enrichments are used in the frieze , it may be reduced to thirty six minutes in height ; the modillions are thirteen minutes in front , and thirty five from centre to centre . The directions given for placing modillions , in the Ionic order , are to be strictly observed in this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divide its height into seventy nine equal parts ; take six of them for the diameter of the column .

The modillions are eleven and a half minutes in front , measuring on the lower facia ; and thirty eight minutes from centre to centre . Their plancer may be embellished with eight bells each , like those of the Doric mutule , see a and c. - b represents a pannel sunk up into the plancer between the modillions. /z/ Shows the mouldings , which may be turned , or worked out of a solid plank /z/ Shows the volute and abacus which may be made out of a solid piece of timber .

The dotted line upon the volute , is a section through the side at A B , or through the plan at C D ; the ornamental part is drawn by hand . /z/ How to work the Corinthian capital . The first thing to be done is , to get out four blocks , fig. 1 , firty two minutes square , and sixty one minutes long ; these being formed like fig. 2 , and tacked together , will form the block ; the projection and height of all its parts may be taken from fig. 4 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrought separate . The corners being taken oft ' at C , fig. 2 , will give an opportunity of securing it to the bench ; be much easier to get at to relieve its parts ; be in less danger of breaking ; and likewise save some time in cutting a hole through to fit on the neck of the column . The abacus may be got out of plank in four pieces , in form of A , fig. 3 , and nailed , or dowelled together . The flower , in the centre , must be made separate and nailed on ; all the rest of the parts may be got from fig. 6. /z/ Fig. 1 represents the plancer of the Ionic cornice at an external angle , Fig. 4 is also a representation of the Doric cornice , at an external angle , - a b c and d are representations of pannels , which are sometimes used in the plancer of that cornice , when it is very large and near the eye , but it generally succeeds best plain . Fig. 5 represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been explained . Fig. 2 shews the side and end view of the Ionic modillion ; to draw it , divide a 6 into six equal parts on 4 ; make the arch 5 i on c , which is one and a half parts from 4 ; make the arch i n with ' the same distance on ? * and 1 ; make the intersection at a and on a complete its curves . /z/ On this plate are three examples for cornices , belonging to the Tuscan , Doric , and Ionic orders . That of the Tuscan is represented with blocks , which may be used with success when small , and at a considerable distance from the eye . Those of the Doric , and Ionic , are represented with dentils , and are proper for inside finishing , &c.; Draw each of them from a scale , made on the diameter of their respective columns . /z/ Columns , when well disposed of , are very ornamental , and in some cases of real use ; but care ought to be taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appear to advantage ; and in such numbers , and of such size , as will best suit the building on which they are placed . Columns , when placed within one , or one and a half diameter of each other may be made smaller than if placed singly . There are but few places where they ought to be placed nearer to each other than one half of their diameter . When more than two are wanted , the largest opening ought to be left in the centre ; if more than four are wanted , place two of them about one diameter from each other , at each angle of the portico or building on which they are placed . When placed in front of a building , they ought to stand in front of the pier ; and never before windows or doors . When they are placed one over another , they ought to be exactly so , and the lightest on the top , as the stoutest is best calculated for support . Where one column is placed on the top of another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ought to be taken from the diameter of the neck of the lower one . Columns for the support of galleries in churches , should be no larger than is necessary to support the weight they have to sustain , on account of their occupying too much room in the pews , and obstructing the sight of the congregation ; they , in that case , may be from ten to twelve , or thirteen diameters high ; their entablature , taken from a scale made on their diameter . If columns be placed over thom , for the support of the roof , they must be placed on a pedestal , which will continue around the front of the gallery , and ought to be ornamented with the base and cornice of the pedestal , or some other mouldmgs of their size , or nearly so . Avoid making the cornice of the pedestal from five to nine inches , and placing a small cornice , nearly the size the cornice of the pedestal ought to be , just above the lower columns , which awkward manner of finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in churches and meeting houses , especially in country towns . /z/ tiLASTERS are , I believe , a Roman invention . The Greeks employed antfe in their temples to receive the architraves where they entered upon the walls of the cell . These , though they were in one direction of equal diameter with the columns , of the front , were , in flank , extravagantly thin in proportion to their height ; and neither their bases nor capitals , bore any resemblance to those of the columns they accompanied . The Roman artists disgusted , probably , with the meagre aspect of these anta ; , and the want of accord in their bases and capitals , substituted pilasters in their places , which , being proportioned and decorated in the same manner with the columns , are certainly more seemly , and preserve the unity of the composition much better . They differ from columns in their plan only , which is square , as that of the column is round . Their bases , capitals , and entablatures , have the same parts , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they are distinguished in the same manner , by the names of Tuscan , Doric , Ionic , Corinthian and Composite . Columns are certainly the most perfect . Nevertheless there are occasions , in which pilasters may be employed with great propriety ; and some , where they are , on various accounts , even preferable to columns . Engaged pilasters are employed in churches , galleries , halls , and other interior decorations , to save room ; for as they seldom project beyond the solid of the walls , more than one quarter of their diameter , they do not occupy near so much space , even as engaged columns . They are likewise employed in exterior decorations ; sometimes alone , instead of columns , on account of their being less expensive . When pilasters are used alone , as principal in the composition , they should project one quarter of their diameter beyond the walls , which gives them a sufficient boldness , and in the Corinthian and Composite orders , is likewise most regular ; because the stems of the volutes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cut exactly through their centres . /q/ When pilasters are placed behind columns , and very near them , they need not project above one eighth of their diameter , or even less ; when they are on a line with columns , their projection is to be regulated by that otthe columns ; and consequently , it neer can be less than a semidiameter , even when the columns are engaged as much as possible . This extraordinary projection , however , will occasion no very great deformity , as the largest apparent breadth of the pilaster will exceed the least , only in the ratio of eleven to ten , or thereabouts . But if columns be detached , the angular pilaster should always be coupled with a column , to hide its inner flank ; because the pilasters will otherwise appear disproportionate , when seen from the point of view proper for the whole building , especially if it be small , and the point of view near . It is sometimes customary to execute pilasters without any diminution ; diminished pilasters arc , however , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their form ; their capitals are better proportioned , both in the whole , and in their parts , particularly in the Corinthian and Composite orders ; and the irregularities , occasioned by the passage of the architraves , from diminished columns , to undiminished pilasters , are thereby avoided ; as are hkevvise the difficulties of regularly distributing the modillions and other parts of the entablature , either when the pilasters are alone , or accompanied with colunms . The shafts of the pilasters are sometimes adorned with flutings , in the same manner as those of columns ; the plan of which may be a trifle above a semicircle , and they must be to the ntmiber of seven on each face , which makes them nearly of the same size with those of the columns . The interval between them must be either one third , or one fourth of the flute in breadth . The capitals of Tuscan or Doric pilasters , are profiled in the same manner as those of the respective columns ; but in the capitals of the other orders , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ionic capital , the extraordinary projection of the ovolo makes it necessary , either to bend it inward considerably toward the extremities , that it may pass behind the volutes , or instead of keeping the volutes flat in front , as they commonly are in the antique , to twist them outward till they give room for the passage of the ovolo. /z/ The same difficulty subsists , with regard to the passage of the ovolo behind the angular Ionic volutes. - What has been said with regard to the passage of the ovolo behind the volutes in the Ionic order , is likewise to be remembered in the Composite ; and in the Corinthian , the lip , or edge of the vase or basket , may be bent a little inward toward its extremities ; by which means , it will easily pass behind the volutes . The leaves in the Corinthian and Composite capitals , must not project beyond the top of the shaft . The diameter of the capital must be exactly the same as that of the top of the shaft ; and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' edges may be bent a trifle outward ; and the large angular leaves may be directed inward , in their approach toward them . In each front of the Composite or Corinthian pilaster capital , there must be two small leaves , with one entire , and two half large ones ; and wrought in the same manner as those of the columns are ; the only difference being , that they will be somewhat broader . The employing of half , or other parts of pilasters , that meet , and as it were , penetrate each other , in inward or outward angles , should , as much as possible , be avoided , because it generally occasions several irregularities in the entablatures. /z/ Is a design for a base and capital to a column , the general proportions of the capital are figured as the plate , the base and necking are composed of squares . This design may be used where fancy is to dictate , and where neither strength or great durability is required . FIG. 2 , 4 and 5 , Are designs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilasters . Their general proportions are figured on the plate , they vv'ere designed to be executed in stucco and may be used where lightness is required , and when the expeuces of the Corinthian capital is to be avoided . Plat.2 : MouLniisras vr Lahge Plau /q/ /z/ Are four designs for ornamental mouldings . If intended to be finished in atucco , they must first be modelled in clay . All the parts should be as open and free as possible , and proper leaves made to finish the mitres , both external and internal . Care must be taken to put them up perfectly straight , and not to show any joinings . In order to model them , or any other moulding , good , fine tempered clay should be provided ( pipe clay is best . ) A templet must be made of wood to fit the profile of the moulding . Then run on a board , a piece of clay moulding about a foot long . This moulding may then be modelled to any pattern , and a wax mould taken of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In modelling mouldings , they ought to be cut as deep as possible , to give them a bold appearance , and the parts not crowded too close together . After they are cast they must be under cut , to relieve . them from their ground , which will give them a rich and bold appearance . Note . They may be a little larger than plain mouldings , and not so much quirked , for it will be difficult to take them out of the moulds . /z/ I hare judged it more regular to treat of the pedestal as a separate body ; having no more connection with the order , than as an attic , a basement , or any other part with which it may , on some occasions be accompanied . A pedestal , like a column or an entablature , is composed of three principal parts ; which are , the base , the dye , and the cornice . The dye is always of nearly the same figure , being constantly either a cube , or a parallelopiped ; but the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer mouldings , according to the simplicity or richness of the composition in which the pedesta is employed ; hence pedestals are , like columns , distinguished by the names of Tuscan , Doric , Ionic , Corinthian , and Composite . Some authors are very averse to pedestals , and compare a column raised on a pedestal , to a man mounted on stilts ; imagining that they were first introduced merely through necessity , and for want of columns of a sufficient length . With regard to the proportion w hich their height ought to bear , to that of the columns they are to support , it is by no means fixed ; the ancients and moderns too , having in their works varied greatly in this respect , and adapted their jiroportion to the occasion , or to the respective purposes for which the pedestals were intended . I have given the Tuscan , two diameters , fifteen minutes ; the Doric , two diameters , thirty minutes ; the Ionic , two diameters , forty five minutes ; the Corinthian and Composite , three diameters each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhere always to this proportion ; it is , however , to be observed , that when pedestals are profiled under each column , and the dye is much less than a square in height , the pedestal has a clumsy appearance ; and when a pedestal of the same kind exceeds one third of the height of the column , it has a lean , unsolid , tottering aspect . But if they are continued without any breaks , this need not be /q/ attended to ; though , indeed , there are very few occasions , in which pedestals , higher than one third of the column , ought to be suffered ; as they lessen too much the parts of the order and become themselves too principal in the composition . The plan of the dye is always made equal to that of the plinth of the column . It is sometimes customary to adorn dyes of pedestals with projecting tablets , or with panels sunk in , and surrounded with mouldings . The former of these practices ought seldom to be admitted , as these tablets alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project much , give it a heavy appearance . The latter should be reserved for large pedestals only . With regard to the application of pedestals , it must be observed , that when columns are entirely detached , and at a considerable distance from the wall as when they are employed to form porches , or porticos , they should never be placed on detached pedestals ; for then they may indeed be compared to men mounted on stilts , as they have a very weak and tottering appearance . On this plate are four designs for impost mouldings* To draw them to a given height , divide that height into twenty , or from that to twenty three equal parts , as judgment may dictate , one of which will be the height of the impost ; divide it into as many parts , as are contained in the imposts to be used ; then each member , either in height or projection , is so many parts of that division , as are . figured on the plate . The four designs for architraves , immediately above those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width into as many parts as are thereon contained . /z/ Ionic /z/ A pediment consists of a horizontal cornice , supporting a triangular , or curvilineal space , either plain or adorned , called the tynipan , which is covered either with two portions of straight , inclined cornice , or with one curvilineal cornice , following the direction of its upper outline . Pediments owe their origin , most probably , to the inclined roofs of the primitiv e huts . Among the Romans they were used only as coverings to their sacred buildings , till Caesar obtained leave to cover his house with a pointed roof , after the manner of temples . In the remains of antiquity we meet with two kinds of them , viz. triangular and circular . The former of these are promiscuously applied to cover small or large bodies ; but the latter being of a heavier figure , are never employed but as coverings to doors , niches , windows , or gates , where the smallness of their dimensions compensates for the clumsiness of their form . It is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cornice , are always omitted in the horizontal one of a pediment ; that part of the profile being directed upward to finish the inclined cornices . This difference of direction , increases the height of the cunarecta very considerably , and makes it far too large for the other parts of the entablature ; to obviate which , it will always be better , whenever the whole object is covered with a pediment , to make the profile of the cimarecta lower than usual , by which means it may , notwithstanding the increase occasioned by the difference of its direction , be made of a size suitable to the rest of the cornice . But if the inclined cornice of the pediment be , on each side , joined to the horizontal ones , the only good method of lessening the abovementioned deformity is , to give very little projection to the cimarecta ; by which means the increase in its height may be rendered very trifling . The modillions , mutulcs , dentils , and other ornaments , of the inclined cornice must always answer jjcrpendicularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be always perpendicular to the horizon . /z/ The proportion of the pediments depends upon their size ; for the same proportion will not succeed in all cases . When the base of the pediment is short , its height must be increased ; and when long , it must be diminished ; for if a small pediment be made low , the inclined cornice , which is always of the same height , whatever may be the dimension of the pediment , will leave little , or no space , for the tympan ; consequently , little , or no plain repose , between the horizontal and inclined cornices . And if a large pediment be made high , it will have too lofty a tympan , and the whole composition will appear straggling , and too heavy for that which is to support it . The best proportion for the height , is from one fifth to one quarter of the base , according to the extent of the pediment , and the character of the body it serves to cover . The face Of the tympan is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frieze ; and , when large , may be adorned with sculpture , representing the arms or cypher of the owner ; trophies of various kinds , suited to the nature of the structure ; but , when small , it is much better left plain . /z/ /q/ /z/ Make the lower diameter of the shaft of the column one eighth of the entire height of the order ; divide the diameter of the column into two equal parts , then one of these parts is a module ; divide the module into thirty equal parts , and each of these parts will be a minute ; make the height of the column twelve modules , the height of the capital one module ; divide the height of the capital into five equal parts ; give one to the hypotrachelion , and two parts to the annulets and echinus ; make the annulets one quarter of the echinus , and the remaining two parts to the abacus : make the upper diameter of the shaft three quarters of the lower diameter of the shaft ; the length of each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two modules and twelve minutes ; the height of the entablature will be four modules , of which the height of the cornice will have one module , and the frize , and architrave , each forty-five minutes , or one module and a half ; divide the height of the frize into eight parts ; give the upper one to the capital of the triglyph , and the three lower for the channels ; make one edge of the triglyph in the columns at the angles of the building , directly over the axis of the column , the breadth of the triglyph twenty-eight minutes , having the other edge of the triglyph directly at the angle of the building ; and make the distance between the triglyph , or width of the metopes , equal to the height of the frize , forty-two minutes ; place all the colunms between the two extreme ones , directly under the middle of the triglyphs . Make the height of the taenia one tenth of the height of the epistilium ; and the height of the rcgula , together with the guttae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the cornice being one module ; make the height /z/ of the small bead on the lower part of the cornice one minute ; the height of the mutules , including the guttae , four minutes and a half ; the length of the mutules equal to the breadth of the triglyphs , and their projection beyond the faces of the triglyphs two-thirds of their length , observing that one should be directly over the middle of every triglyph , and one over the middle of every metope ; make a fillet above the mutules one minute and a half high , to project beyond the mutules half of a minute over this fillet ; make the height of the corona one third of a module , or ten minutes , having a projecture over the fillet one minute ; make the height of the small echinus one minute and a quarter ; over the echinus , make a fillet of the same height ; over the fillet , make another echinus six minutes and a half high , and two minutes will remain for the height of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions and true taste of the original Doric order , the following example is taken from one of the most celebrated buildings now remaining of this order . The module is divided into thirty parts , or minutes ; the measures are all numbered in these parts ; the projections are reckoned from a line representing the axis of the column , and are figured at the extremities of each member . /q/ /z/ Elevation of the Doric Order on the Temple of Minerva , at Athens , culled Parthenon . Minerva , to whom this temple was dedicated , was the chief goddess of the Athenians . This temple is the most beautiful piece of antiquity remainir g ; it was built by Pericles , who employed Ictimus and Callicrates for his architects ; the entablature is charged with historical figures of admirable workmanship ; the figures of the pediment , though seen at so great a height , appear to be as large as life , being in alto relievo , and well executed ; the figure in the middle seems to have been made for Jupiter , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder ; it is likely that between his legs was placed the eagle ; for the beard and majesty , and expression of his countenance , and the figure being naked , as he was usually represented by the Greeks , sufficiently shows it to have been made for Jupiter . At his right hand is another figure covered half way down the legs , coming towards him ; which perhaps was a Victory , leading the horses of Minerva 's triumphal chariot , which follows it ; the horses are finished with great art ; the vigour and spirits peculiar to these animals seems here to receive addition , as if inspired by the goddess they draw ; Minerva , in the chariot , is represented rather as the goddess of learning than of war , without helmet , buckler , or a Medusa 's head on her breast , as Pausanius describes her image within the temple . Behind her is another figure of a woman sitting . The next two figures in the corner , are the Emperor Hadrian , and his Empress Sabina. * On the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be an assembly of the gods , where Jupiter introduces Minerva , and acknowledges her his daughter . The pediment at the other end of the temple , was adorned with figures , expressing Minerva 's contest with Neptune , about who should name the city of Athens ; of which there only remains a part of a sea-horse. /z/ The frize is charged with basso lehevos of . excellent workmanship , on which are represented the battles of the Athenians with the Centaurs : those appear to be as old as the temple itself . Within the portico on high , and on the outside of the cella of the temple , is another border of basso relievos round it , at least on the north and south sides , which is , without doubt , as ancient as the temple , and of admirable workmanship , but not in so high a relievo as the other ; on it are represented sacrifices , processions , and other ceremonies of the heathen worship . This temple is now turned into a Turkish mosque . /z/ The measures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flank at the angle of the building . The figures in the metope are omitted . Fig. 2 .

In the cornices of every example of the Grecian Doric Order arc mutules , with three rows of drops hung to their under sides ; the mutules are so distributed , that one is over the middle of every triglyph. and one over the middle of every metope ; this is a constant and uniform feature which is never omitted in the Grecian Doric ; but the cornice of what is called a Roman Doric , has no peculiar feature whatever , having in some examples mutules , and in others denteles , and is often executed without either ; neither are the mouldings always the same , but vary in different examples . In the Theatre of Marcellus , which is the most celebrated of all the Roman Dorics , the cornice is a mixture of the Doric and Ionic ; for it imitates the mutules of the Doric cornice , which are seen underneath ; but the denteles below properly belong to the Ionic , and are the most striking features of the cornice of that order ; we find , from what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dioclesian at Rome , an Ionic cornice over Doric triglyphs , which is too trifling for the manly character of the Doric Order ; this erroneous practice has also been followed by some modern authors , particularly Scamozzi , and Vignola in his first example , which imitates the Theatre of Marcellus , at Rome . In the Roman Doric , the proportion of the cornice , frize , and architrave , of the entablature is found to be as the numbers , 4 , 5 , and 3 ; but in the Grecian , the proportion of the cornice , frize , and architrave , are as the numbers 2 , 3 , and 4 ; from this comparison it appears , that if the proportion of the Roman entablature were inverted , it would be much nearer to the Grecian . In the frize of every Grecian Doric Order , two triglyphs meet together at every angle of the building ; so that the scmichannel at the angle of the frize is common to both triglyphs , which are contained upon the two sides of that angle ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triglyph* is over the axis of the column at the angle of the building , and consequently a part of a metope /z/ will be left on each side , next to that angle , and will have their junction at the anorle of the frize , which has a very naked and unmeaning appearance , and is much more so when the frize is ornamented , for no ornament can be disposed in the semimetope , which will correspond with the metopes lying between the columns ; but in the Grecian T ) oric , the two trigiyphs next to the angle upon each side of the objeqt meet together , by which means the angle is more finished , and all the metopes are enclosed with a border ; by this means also the semimetopes are avoided . In the Grecian Doric , the length of the metope is equal to the whole height of the frize ; so that in the Grecian , it seems as if the whole height of the metope was equal to the height of the frize ; and the plain part above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trigiyphs , may be called , since it is the upper part of the metopes , the capital of the metopes , with as innch propriety , as the upper parts of the trigiyphs are called the capitals of the trigiyphs ; but in the Roman Doric , the length of the metope is equal to the height of the frize , excluding the capital of the trigiyphs . In the epistilium or architrave of the Grecian Doric Order , the guttae , or drops , are frustums of very acute cones approaching nearly to cylinders , and the heights of each frustum or drop never exceeds three fourths of the diameter of its base ; but in the epistilium of the Roman Doric , the height of the conical frustums or drops are never less than the diameter of their base , and are always from cones whose vertical angle is very obtuse . In the Grecian Doric , the tenia of the architrave is always in one plane ; but in the Roman Doric , the tenia of the architrave under the triglyph projects forward beyond those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grecian Doric , the architrave is always a uniform plane , which gives the idea of its surface being composed of one strong beam , conformable to its use ; but in the Roman Doric the architrave is sometimes divided into two heights , or facias , which gives the idea of one beam lying over the top of another , contrary to the laws of strength , as the architrave is supposed to be the support of the entablature . In the column of every Grecian Doric Order , the abacus of the capital is always plain , being a solid parallelepiped , of which its two horizontal sides are equal squares , and its verticle or perpendicular sides are equal rectangles ; the inward recesses of the annulets in the capital are in the same curve line as the /q/ ovolo above them , * and their outward extremities are parallel to their inward recesses ; the fluting of the column is always continued through the hypotrachelion , and also through the scape of the column , and terminates immediately under the lower annulet of the capital ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cymatium , and the inward recesses or angles of the annulets are never in the same curve line with the echinus , the hypotrachelion is never fluted , and the fluting of the column always terminates at the bottom of the scape under the fillet or apophygis of the column . In the Grecian Doric , the highest columns which are to be found , are not more than 13 modules and four minutes ; whereas in the Roman Doric the principal example is the Theatre of Marcellus ; the height of the column is 15 modules and 21 2-3 minutes , which is too extravagant a height for columns without bases . In the Grecian Doric the mean diminution of Doric columns is 2-9 of tHe bottom diameter ; but in the Roman , the mean diminution of the column is between 1-5 and 1-6 , or 11-12 of the bottom diameter . /z/ The Proportion of the Grecian Doric compared loith the Roman , each having the same Altitude . In this plate may be seen , at one view the difference between the Grecian and Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness of its parts , and their beautiful arrangement , will render its application to public buildings much more advantageous than the Roman , where its numerous members make it appear poor and trifling ; its columns resemble a wooden pillar , and not a strong and durable marble or stone column , capable of supporting its entablature ; the multiplicity and littleness of its members renders the cornice in mass of confusion , even almost at any distance from the object : but the boldness of the Grecian Doric attracts the attention of the spectator by the grandeur and fine proportion of its parts , the form of its mouldings , and the beautiful variety of light and shade on their surfaces , which greatly relieves them from each other , and renders their contour distinct to the eye.f *The Doric Portico at Athens excepted. /z/ jFVojk the Ionic Temple on the River Ilissvs , at Athens , - With the proportional measures in numbers , including the entablature and capital of the columns . The simplicity and the greatness of the parts , their judicious arrangement , the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hem hanging between them , renders this one of the most beautiful and bold examples of this Order . The elegant base of the column , the grand proportion of the entablature , the massy mouldings of the cornice , and the spacious surface of the frize , well adapted for sculptured ornaments , and the architrave for its strength , as it is not broken into two or more facae , are considerations which should recommend this example. * /z/ From the Inside of the Portico of the Temple of Minerva. , at Athens .

For example , suppose a house to be thirty five feet high , iivide thirty five feet into thirty parts , and one thirtieth will be fourteen inches , which must be divided into as many parts as are contained in the height of the cornice you make use of , and those parts given to the mouldings in height and projection , as figured on the plate . It is sometimes necessary to vary the above proportion . If it be required to proportion a cornice to a basement story house of forty feet high , and twenty five feet front , unconnected with any other building , I would advise to divide the height into forty parts , which would be twelve inches for the height of the cornice . Again , if a house be forty feet high , and from fifty to sixty feet front , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , one thirtieth may not be too large for the cornice ; and if a house of two stories high , say twenty five feet whole height , and from fifty to sixty feet front , one thirtieth would be ten inches , which would not be large enough ; in that case I would advise to make it eleven and a half or twelve inches . A , is a copy of the original drawing for the cave cornice of that very large house which was lately built for Thomas Aniory , Esq . in Park place , sixty four feet on Park street , one hundred and five on Beacon street ; walls sixty two feet high ; cornice twenty inches high , which is about one thirty seventh part of the height ; the drops , or bells , at the foot of the cornice , lie on the brick wall , so that the bricks in the interval between the drops arc plainly seen , and ought not to be considered as a part of the cornice .

' ' ' ' /z/ A , in plate 27 , is intended for frontispieces , and is drawn from the same scale of minutes as the orders , and may be used with some of their columns . H G F E , on plate 26 , and I H G F G , on plate 27 , are intended for cornices for rooms , &c.; They may be made either of wood or stucco . To proportion cornices for rooms , give the cornice one fortieth part of the height of the room . If a room is ten feet high , one fortieth will be three inches , which is to be divided according to directions given for eave cornices. /z/ As cornices make a very considerable part of architecture , there can not be too much care taken to make them appear to as much advantage as possible , and to manage their mouldings so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer the purpose . The projection of cornices , for rooms , ought to be at least one fourth more than their height ; the parts should be as few as possible , and those well proportioned ; not crowd in any moulding that can not be seen . About half of the projections ought to be given to the plancere , which will prevent its looking bulky , and give it a light appearance . Their fillets ought not to be too small , give them a good projection before each moulding ; at least as much as they rise . Their quirks ought to be large , as the principal beauty of plain cornices depends on the shadows of their quirks . When mouldings are ornamented , they may be larger than when plain , as carving lightens them . They ought never to be too much crowded with ornaments , but always leave a sufficiency of plain space to form a contrast . Three embellishments are generally sufficient for any cornice , and one may be in the plancere . Stucco cornices admit of much greater variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both . /q/ Observe that the ornaments be bold , and proportioned to the height of the room : not to make the same mouldings serve for a room of twenty feet high that was modelled for one of ten ; and that they always be such as will appear natural and open . In some cases where the room is low , the plancere may be laid flat on the ceiling , or even sunk level with it . Their projection may , in some cases , be double their height , and their height when enriched , with three ornaments , about a thirtieth part of the height of the room . Their projection ought , in some measure , to be conformable to the size , as well as their height , to that of the room . This will admit of no exact rule ; therefore must , in a great measure , depend on the judgment of the designer . /z/ Are six designs for cornices , calculated to be made of stucco . Make thei height one thirtieth part of that of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirtieth into as many parts as are contained in the cornice you intend to use , and then each member of the cornice is so many parts as are figured on the plate . /z/ To model friezes for stucco , the first thing to be done , is to prepare a ground of clay , of proper size , and about half an inch thick , which must be floated perfectly even on a stiif board . The drawing of the frieze may then be laid on it , and the outlines traced with a tool or pencil , which will leave indented outUnes on the clay . A sufficient quantity of fine clay may then be laid on all the parts which are to be raised , with a small trowel or tool . The artist will then exercise his own skill in embossing it to a proper degree of boldness , according to the height of the room , and the good or bad eflect it may have , depends a great deal on this first emboss . This may be performed with small spear shaped tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers must do a great part in rounding , and softening its bold parts , when it is embossed , to have a proper effect . It may then be finished by smoothing it with the fingers and small tools , using a small quantity of oil . When the modelling is finished , and a mould taken off , it must be cast with plaster of Paris , and neatly undercut and relieved in all the bold parts . The cornice and architrave should be finished before the frieze is put up , and sinking made in the wall to receive the thickness of the cast , so that when finished , the ground of the frieze should be exactly over the line of the wall . The casts must be soaked before put up , and the joinings finished so as not to be seen . The same process will do for any ornament that has a flat ground . /z/ To be used in centrepieces for ceilings , or any other place required . The rules for modelling friezes will do here , except that they must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well trimmed , and made as open in the raffleings as possible . /z/ Is a design for a door case , intended for inside finishing , where the room is so large as to require more than an architrave round the door . Divide the width of the door into eight equal parts ; make the architrave equal to one of them . Make the frieze and cornice equal to one seventh of the height of the door . Make the truss one twelfth of the whole heighl , and make the tablet one eighth of the whole height , in width , and make its length one half of that of blocking course . The side pilasters may be in width equal to the architrave . /z/ Is a front door with only two columns or pilasters . This is intended for a situation that will not admit of more in width , and where there is sufficient height . The entablature may be of the Corinthian order , with fancy capitals of one diameter in height . Make the tablet in length equal to one half of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the expense not regarded , I would always recommend more than two columns , as a single colunm on each side of a door has but a naked appearance . /z/ Is a design for a Venetian entrance calculated for a brick house , where a great deal of light is required . The pilasters may be made fifteen or sixteen diameters high ; make the architrave in width the same as that of the pilasters ; and the side lights in height two thirds of the height of the opening . /z/ Is a design for a front door , calculated for a low story , that will admit of no light over the door . The whole height is seventeen diameters of the column . The blocking , course , and tablet , help to make up the deficiency of the fanlight . It will be seen , that the columns and pilasters of this door are very slender which ought generally to be the case when placed very near each other . AMERICAN BUILDERS COMPANION . Yl /z/ Contains two designs for trusses ; four for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a modillion . It would be absurd to confine the student to any particular proportions for trusses , as their situation must , in a great measure , determine their size and dimensions . We frequently see them , and with propriety too , of every size and dimension . 1 would , however , recommend them to be made with less projection than is commonly practised . Keystones are less used now than they were formerly . The ancients used them in almost every door or window . This might be going to excess , but they are very useful , as well as handsome , in some situations ; serving to wedge and strengthen the arch , as well as to give its centre a bold and conspicuous appearance . If ornamented , they ought to be bold and striking , and emblematical of the building . Masks or heads are proper ornaments for them , if well executed . /z/ To proportion banisters , the highest must be first found , then divide it into six parts , one of which will be the diameter ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . In whatever form they are made , let them be slender at top , and stout at bottom . Banisters , when used for balustrades , may be considered as a pedestal to an order , and the proportion may be the same . When a balustrade is placed over an order , its height must be the same as an entablature it stands on ; there is no situation that requires them to be lower , but it is often necessary to make them higher . The plinth of the balustrade must be placed exactly on the line of the wall ; if on the top of a house , or if on an entablature , it must be perpendicular over the frieze . We frequently see balustrades project out as far as the nose of the cornice , but this is a very bad and unnatural practice , for should another order be put on such a balustrade , it would break down the cornice . Urns admit of a great variety of forms , and when well executed will be very ornamental in their proper places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . The ancients used them to deposit the ashes and bones of the dead , and for sacred uses only ; and while the mind is impressed with these ideas , it can not be pleasing to see them in every situation . Their use ought to be principally confined to monuments , wall pieces , churches , mausoleums , mourn ing pieces , &c.; &c.; for architraves , base and surbases . To proportion base and surbase mouldings to the pedestal part of rooms , divide from the floor to the top of the surbase into ten parts , give one to the height of the surbase . Suppose the height from the floor to the top of the surbase to be two feet eight inches , one tenth would be three inches and one fifth of an inch which divide into as many parts as are contained in the height of the surbase you make use of , and those parts given to the mouldings in height and projection , as figured on the plate . The same scale , or parts , will draw the base mouldings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from five to six inches wide . To proportion architraves to doors and windows , divide the door into eight parts , give one to the width of the architrave . If a door is three feet six inches wide , one eighth would be five and a quarter inches . Divide five and a quarter inches , into as many parts as are contained in the architrave you make use ofj and those parts given to the moulding as figured on the plate . It is very often necessary to vary this proportion , and oftener for inside of windows than for doors , lor example , if a door is three feet six inches wide , the opening between the architraves to the windows of the same room , would probably be as much as four feet four inches ; one eighth of which would be six and a half inches , which would be very improper , as you would have two widths of architraves in the same room . I therefore should advise to make the architrave to the window five and a quarter inches . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eighth of it would be nine inches , which would be too large , and maybe reduced to six and a half , or seven inches . Some judgment should be exercised respecting the situation in which architraves are to be used . If they are on external parts of buildings , and at a considerable distance from the eye , it will be proper to make them larger than if used on internal finishing , and near to the eye . /z/ Arc SIX designs for ornamental stucco ceilings , with some of their parts enlarged . It was not my intention wh ( ! n I first began this work , to lay down any rules for ornamental stucco work , but merely to give a few examples by drawings ; but as it has never before been attempted , to my knowledge , and my principal aim being to explain those parts of architecture which have been overlooked by others , and willing to give the student every information in my power , although it is the most difficult branch in arciiitecture to learn , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hints will be of some use to those who are young in the business , and be no injury to those who are well acquainted with the art of stucco working . When a ceiling or walls of a room are to be ornamented , the first thing to be done after the size , height , and form are known , is to draw a design ; after which , all the parts are to be drawn at large . When this is done , and the plastering finished , which should be floated perfectly even , there are two ways of executing it on stucco work , the first is by what is called laying it on by hand , which is modelling it on the ceihng with stucco , * with small iron or wooden tools . This kind , if executed in a masterly style , is to be preferred ; but where workmen can not be got to execute it , or its expense is too great , the parts may then be modelled in clay , and moulds taken from them , and the ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best method , it is much less expensive , and requires less skill to perform it ; and if well managed will have a very good effect . In ornamenting ceilings , the figure should be of a proper boldness and strength of shadow to the height of the Koom , and be significant of its use . They ought to be such as will appear ornamental , or they had better be left out ; and those parts which were cast with grounds be sunk level with the line of the * The stucco is made of lime putty , mixed with pulverised marble , or raw plaster of Paris , with sometimes a little white sand and a little white hair , to prevent it frou. cracking . The mixture is then put on a dry brick wall for twenty four hours , after which it is taken oft " and well I eajen , and put on again . This is repeated for four or five days , when it will be fit for use . This preparation makes it tough , and prevents it from cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . When a room is low , all the parts of the ornaments should be correctly finished , with very delicate strokes , and light in proportion to the height ; yet to preserve a proper boldness of tint . When a room is very high , there may be bold and well placed strokes , without regard to a great deal of delicacy . The principal object is to show a sufficient quantity of shadow , to give it a rich and bold appearance , without having the parts too large and heavy . A ceiling may sometimes be panelled to advantage , but ought not to be laid out in too many geometrical figures . Regard ought to be paid to the use of a room , as it is as easy to introduce emblematical subjects as those void of meaning . An ornament , however well executed , is not fit to be put in every room . Those that would be exceedingly well adapted to a dancing room , for instance , would be ridiculous if put in a church or a courthouse ; or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fit for a diningroom or a hall . In ornamenting a dining room , there may be mtroduced grapevines , wheat , barley , or fruit of any kind ; cups , vases , &.c.; or any thing that denotes eating or drinking ; but care must be taken to group them in some graceful form . In a drawing room , foliage , wreaths , festoons , or baskets of flowers , with myrtles , jasmines , convolvalus , roses , &c.; displayed with taste , and in a lively manner . Every subject that is introduced , ought to approach as near to nature as art will admit of . A hall , saloon , or staircase , ought to exhibit something of more solidity and strength . Therefore trophies of diflerent kinds may be introduced , and not so highly ornamented as the rest of the house . I would not recommend the last mentioned apartments to be finished higher than the Doric order , if regard is paid to any . It is to be remembered that objects are not to be dispersed about a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great deal of'judgincnt , and care taken to give them as easy and natural an appearance as possible , and introduce nothing that will look stiff or mechanical .

Care should be taken , however , not to overload them with ornaments , as they are exposed and liable to be broken . The proportion of chimneypieces I am obliged to leave to the judgment of the workmen ; for , in my opinion , no exact rule can be laid down that will answer for every room . A room , however small , must have a fire place large enough to be useful , and should the same proportion be used in a room twenty feet high , and large in proportion , it would be so large as not to look well , and be too high in the opening for the smoke to ascend without spreading into the room . It will be found by ( Jount Rumford 's experiments , that the nearer the throat of the chimney is to the fire the better the draft . The smallest opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , and the largest ought not to be higher than three feet two inches , but two feet eleven inches will be found to be a us eful height for common rooms , and the width may be about four feet . /z/ A is a design intended for an inside door . To proportion the frieze panel , divide its width into four parts ; give three of them to the height of the panel . All the other parts are figured in feet and inches on the plate . B is a design intended for an outside door ; divide the width of the frieze panel into five parts ; give four of them to its height . Outside doors ought to be two inches thick , and never less than one and three quarters . Inside doors ought to be the last mentioned thickness , they ought not in any case be less than one and one half inch in thickness .

The reader will take notice , that before the face mould at No. 3 can be applied , the edge of the plank must be first bevelled according to No. 2 ; then the plumb line will be drawn on the bevelled edge of the plank , by the bevel that is drawn at No. 3 . Note . - By this mode of proceeding , a three inch plank will almost be sufficient for any rail of this kind , however it may ramp ; whereas in many cases , by the common method , it may require a plank of five or six inches thick . Many other advantages will attend the setting out of this plan ; I shall mention one or two . In fixing the banisters , they will be all regular , and the stringboard will be as easy as the rail itself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the steps are wider and wider as they go round to the middle of the semicircle ; lastly , a blacksmith may put an iron rail with very little trouble , the banisters being all regular ; whereas , no other plan will admit of it . unless it be set out in this manner . Hate 50 . /q/ /z/ Find the stretchout round half the circular part of the rail , as directed for the foregoing plates , and complete the falling mould as directed in the last plate , for the winding part of the rail , which- is six steps from t to iv ; in order to brinothe rail with an easy turn round to the landing , set off the height to another step from w to 7 , and let the under edge of the rail be half the height of a step above that to C ; or it may be more according to the discretion of the workman ; then the rail will be half the height of a step more upon the landing , than it is upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue the line 2 u , that forms the intersection below the Vv'inders up to D , and ease off the anle u D c by intersecting lines , w ill give the under edge of the mould turning up to the landing ; in order that the last step beyond the quarter should follow the mould , draw a line through 7 , the height of the last step ; parallel to u b , or C c , cutting the underside of the falling mould at A ; through A , draw A , B , parallel to C I ; then M Bis the tread ofthe last step of the rail , which is set from to , E. The face moulds at D and F are completed in the same manner as directed in the last plate , and the moulds in plate 47 ; fig . D , is also laid down by the sametniethod , the height ofthe sections being taken from the falling mould that corresponds to thatplace ofthe rail which the face mould is made for ; and the bevels that are laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must bevel the ed ) -c of you plank , before you can apply the face moulds to the plank ; then draw the plumb of your rail , upon the bevelled edge , by the other bevels that are shown at the sections ; then apply your mould to each side ofthe plank , keeping it fair with the bevelled edge , the same as in other cases before mentioned . /z/ Shows the rail as completely squared upon a cylinder , with the plan of the hollow cylinder underneath from which the rail is formed . /z/ Exhibits the manner in which the elevation of the hehx or spiral line which forms one of the outside arrises of the rail is drawn . Divide the exterior circle into any number of equal parts , or according to the number of steps : and divide the height , or part of the axis intended for one revolution , into the same number of equal parts ; draw lines through the points of division perpendicular to the axis ; and from the points of division in the exterior circle draw lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points draw a curve a h c , &c.; and this curve will form one of the arris lines as represented in fig. 1 . The same curve may be repeated in as many equal heights as the revolutions are in number . This will give some idea of the rail according to the definition I have given of it . Though the figure here exhibited for a rail in the square is supposed to be cut out of a hollow cylinder in one entire piece , in order to conve ; . more readily the idea of the helixal solid ; it is evident , however , that the squaie helix may be cut out of short pieces of wood , so that the fibres of the wood may run in any direction we please . Therefore , since we have this in our choice , the nearer the fibres run in the direction of the length of the piece , or to the arris lines of the helixal solid , the stronger it will be . There are two different kinds of joints ; one is formed by planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other by a plane perpendicular to one of the arris lines of the rail ; those joints that are formed by planes parallel to the axis of the cylinder , are called splice-joints ; and those joints that are formed by planes perpendicular to the arris lines , are called butt-joints. /z/ Shows the thickness of the portion , and the inclination of the cutting planes to the base , which cutting planes will form two equal and similar sections ; and as it is well known that the section of a cylinder is an ellipse , each section or face will be contained between two concentric and similar ellipses ; ' but it is obvious , that as the solid returns to itself , the entire helix can not be made of so great a portion of the cylindrome , unless the cutting planes were extended to a very remote distance from each other ; and consequently the waste of wood would be very great . The solid here exhibited is therefore of no practical utility , but is absolutely necessary in theory , as an idea of the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formed without having a correct idea of the whole . /z/ The same portion of the cylindrome representing the solid obliquely , or as projected on a plane , in such a manner that another plane , which is perpendicular to the planes of the sections of the solid is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the plane of projection . This position presents the most correct idea of the real form of the solid to the imagination . One ol the sectional sides is brought entirely to view , the other being concealed by the body itself ; and a portion of each of the curved sides is shown . The method of representing such a solid will easily be found , by observing that the corresponding letters in the elevations , yj-.y. 1 and 2 , have equal heights , and the distances of the numerals on the plane are equal . /z/ A representation of half the solid ; but even here the waste of wood would be too great ; and as the fibres of the wood are cut across on both sides , the piece would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar floor , twenty seven by twenty-five feet , from out to put . a Cellar , nine by twenty two feet . b Kitchen , sixteen by fifteen feet , c Kitchen closet , six feet square .

Let the kitchen be situated , so as to have as easy a communication with the dining and break fastrooms as possible ; let the pantry or china closet communicate with the diningroom by a door , and with the passage from the kitchen by a door or window . Place the door in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house to the other , as short as possible ; still keep uniformity in view , as it is one of the grentest beauties in architecture ; yet convenience ought not to make too great a sacrifice to it . The eye ought to see , at the same time , every part of the building , and be sure that no one part of it interferes with another ; also , to see that the rooms are properly lighted , and at the same time , that there are a sufficient number of windows , and of a size suitable for the external part of the building . Strength , convenience , and beauty , are the principal things to be attended to . To have strength , there must be a good solid foundation ; and never place piers over openings of windows or doors . Openings of windows or doors in diflerent stories , ought to be exactly perpendicular , one over the oilier . Care ought to be taken , not to i ) lacc heavy girders or beams over doors or windows , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proportion of windows to rooms , I do not believe any certain determined rule can be given for their height and breadth , although there are several European writers , who have given rules for their proportion . I think Sir William Chambers has given the best i ) roportion of any one I have seen , yet I do not find it to answer in all /z/ cases ; he adds the depth and the height of the rooms on the principal floor together , and takes one eighth part thereof for the width of the window . The width and height of doors , depends on the size and height of rooms in some degree , ahhough there is not any room so small as not to require a door sufficiently largo for a person to pass through its opening . In the course of my own practice , I have made doors for rooms of sixteen by eighteen or twenty feet , and ten feet high , three feet wide , and seven feet or seven feet two inches high . When rooms have been twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fourteen feet high , I have made the doors three feet six or seven inches wide , and seven feet eight inches , or eight feet high ; all the doors in the same room ought to be of the same size , except where two doors are placed together between the two principal rooms , which are called folding doors . They ought to be made from eight to twelve inches higher than the other doors of the room , or they will , on account of their width , appear to be lower than the others ; these folding doors arc commonly used in Boston , and are very convenient , particularly so when placed between small rooms , both for the circulation of air , when windows and doors are opened , and for the reception of large companies . The size of the outside doors , must be governed by the building in which they are placed . If in a town house with a narrow front and small windows on each side , like plate fifty two , three feet four or six inches will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a large house , and without side hghts , it ought to be made much wider ; say from three feet ten inches to four feet ; and in some cases , four feet four or six inches wide , and never less than two diameters high . The chimney ought not to project into the room more than from fifteen to twenty inches if it can be avoided , and care should be taken to place them on the most convenient side of the room . For size of fireplaces , see explanation of chimney-pieces . Never make the funnel less than twelve inches square , and if there is sufficient room sixteen inches is a good size where a fireplace is about four feet between the jambs.
