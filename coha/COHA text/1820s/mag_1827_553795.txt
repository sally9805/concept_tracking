txt ART . XIII. - RepoTrtfroln the Commrsssoners appointed to Revise the Statute Laws of the State of New York , prepared in Obedience to a Resolution of the Honorable the */1ssembly . Communicated March 15 , 1826. pp. 112 . Albany . THERE are few questions of internal improvement , upon which sound and liberal minds are more divided among us , than upon the expediency and practicability of substituting a general code for the whole mass of common and statute law . We can not pretend to much consistency in our own pages upon this topic , having already found occasion , as has happened to some lawyers , to ) argue both sides of the case , before the question is well settled . Thei'e is no great evil in this , as respects ourselves or the public , since we do not set up for an inflexible character of individuality ; and as in regard to matters of commerce between men , it is more important to the community that the rules of law be plain and certain , than what those rules may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is far more important that they should be well discussed , than that this or that set of opinions should be uniformly maintained in a journal . The sense of the profession in this country , we think , is against this great scheme of legal reform . Technical jurists are probably less sensitive than others to the alleged inconveniences of the present system ; they are at any rate better aware of the difficulties and dangers of the proposed change ; and they perhaps feel a more solemn attachment to the venerable fabric of the common law , which has sheltered and protected them and their ancestors for a thousand years . Even from the profession , however , we do not hear an undivided voice . On the contrary , VOL . XXIV. - NO. 5Lk 25 // learned and eminent counsellors are ranged on both sides of the controversy ; and in Louisiana , where the task has been entered upon , under the sanction of legislative authority , and is now prosecuting with great zeal , the code has nevertheless been attacked , and is defended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *idlowed to exercise a little of the spirit of prophecy , we think we can perceive in this the coming shadow of a mighty war . The Louisianian controversy we take to be the beginning of a legal feud , which is not to be kept within the narrow pale of a State sovereignty , or bounded by the banks of the Mississippi . Codes are to be proposed , discussed , assailed , defended , throughout the union ; and we look to see the day , when codifiers and anticod*fiers will wage a war as fierce and interminable , as that which raged of yore between the Doctors of Admiralty and his Majesty 's servants of King 's Bench . We do not mean to hasten hostilities ; and having already given our opinion on each side , we choose now to reserve ourselves for decided measures , until we sh 11 have an opportunity of witnessing the affray , and putting out our strength to some purpose on the best side . The subject presented to our consideration by the pamphlet before us , is of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , presenting a question respecting which , in the abstract , there will doubtless be far less diversity of opinion among professional men . We can not suggest it to the reader 's mind more profitably , than by a short history of the origin of this pamphlet , and a statement of its contents . It will be recollected , that in 1824 , the people of New York revised and made some considerable changes in their State constitution ; consequently some alterations of their statutes became necessary and by an act of the legislature passed on the 27th of November , 1824 , three commissioners were appointed to prepare a revised edition of the general laws , with such amendments as might be conformable to the new constitutional requisitions . By an additional act passed on the 21st of April , 1825 , the powers of these commissioners were much enlarged ; they were authorized to consolidate all acts and parts of acts relating to similar subjects ; to distribute the revised and consolidated acts methodically under proper titles and divisions ; to omit what had been repealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution ; to suggest the best mode of reconciling apparent contradictions , and supplying defects , and amending what needed // amendment ; to designate what ought to be repealed as mischievous or useless , and recommend the passage of such new acts as might either be advantageous in themselves , or necessary to the system ; and finally to complete the revision in all other respects in such manner as they might think expedient , in order to render the laws more plain and easy to be understood ; and they are required moreover to lay portions of the revised and newly arranged acts before the Assembly , from time to time , to be examined , and if approved , to he made laws . This extensive , and , as some think , dangerous power , was confided to able hands . The commissioners appointed under the first act were Erastus Root and Benjamin Butler , together with the learned excbancellor Kent . This last gentleman having declined the trust , John Duer was appointed in his room . Mr Root afterwards resigned his place at the hoard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known and indefatigable reporter of the Supreme Court of the United States . This pamphlet is the first report of the commissioners , prepared in obedience to a resolution of the Assembly , calling upon them to exhibit an account of their progress , and state when they should probably he in readiness for a final report . It contains some account of the labor they have hitherto accomplished , with a partial exhibition of its result . The first steps , of course , were to make a classification of the subjects of the public laws , and a brief analysis or digest of the whole , according to their proposed scheme . A subdivision of the first class of laws into a convenient number of chapters was next effected ; and after this the commissioners proceeded to prepare particular chapters at large , subdividing each still farther into convenient articles and sections . A considerable portion of the first great divi*sion has been thus prepared in something less than a year from the commencement of their labors , and was ready to be presented to the legislature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering the natural connexion which exists between its chapters , that the whole of this part be completed , before any portion of it shall be reported for consideratirzmn and enactment . As a specimen of their work , however , they subjoin two complete chapters ; the first , containing the whole proposed statute law , regarding elections other than for town officers ; ' the second , respecting the powers , duties , and disabilities of towns . ' To these are appended a collection of the principal existing laws on those subjects , as they now stand // in the Statute Book ; so that the reader has a fair opportunity of instituting a comparison between the new and the old , and of noting the character of the changes and innovations , which the revisers may have introduced . That the convenience and utilityof the plan may be more extensively understood , we suppose it may he useful for us to present to our readers , distinctly , a general view of the sources and condition of the existing law of New York , a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed code , and a more particular analysis of it as exhibited by the present commissioners . The law of New York , as of most of the United States , has for its basis the common law of England . By the thirtyfifth article of her Constitution , the Convention of 1777 , by the authority of the good people of the State , ordain , determine , and declare , that such parts of the common law of England , and of the statute law of England and Great Britain , and of the acts of the legislature of the Colony of New York , as together did form the law of the said Colony on the 19th of April , 1775 , shall he and continue the law of this State , subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall from time to time make concerning the same ; ' excepting , however , such laws as regarded the ecclesiastical establishment of England , or the l ) reservation of allegiance to the British crown , or such as were otherwise repugnant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than declaring , that the laws of the Colony , whencesoever derived , should continue in force , until altered or abrogated by th' legislative will . The statutes enacted by the British Parliament seldom extended in express terms to the plantations , arid had consequently no intrinsic authority over them . So much of the statute law of England , as was created before the colonization of America , may , throughout the States , be considered as having been originally imported into the country by our English ancestors . They brought with them for their common law the existing law of the mother country , whether written or unwritten , rejecting only such parts as applied exclusively to  --  a condition of things not known , or incapable of existence on this side of the Atlantic . To these are commonly added those British statutes of later growth , which have been considered declaratory or emendatory of the English common law , and as therefore naturally incorporating themselves into the unwritten law of the Colonies ; and a few Qthers , not coming // strictly within this class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent and general conformity . Local usages , morever , must have existed in this as in the other Colonies ; some of which may have had their origin in the notions of law , which were brought by the Dutch settlers from the continent of Europe , or in obsolete ordinances of the early colonial authorities ; and others must naturally have grown out of the condition and circumstances of the people , at different periods of their colonial history . These particular customs , with the vast accession made to the common law of England by the rapid growth of commerce , and consequent adoption in the courts of entire new systems of maritime and commercial jurisprudence , probably completed the body of the common law , existing in New York at the era of the American Revolution . We are not sufficiently conversant with the niceties of local law in New York , to know how extensive was the above supposed infusion of continental law from a Dutch original , or how much of it can still be distinctly traced . The Dutch articles of capitulation of 1664 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other things , that the Dutch shall enjoy their own customs concerning their inheritances ; ' but the Charter of Liberties , pro* mulgated by the first colonial assembly , in 1683 , settles , that an estate of inheritance in lands shall thenceforward be according to the customs and practice of his Majesty 's realm of England ; ' and the Constitution of 1777 , before cited , seems to allow no operation to existing usages as a part of the law of the land , excepting such as either appertained to the common law of England , or had received express sanction from colonial legislation . Yet the same act of the people , which admitted the common law of England , itself a curious aggregate of usages , customs , traditions , and adjudications , to prescribe to them their rules of civil conduct , could hardly have excluded , by mere implication , the partictilar customs of the Colony ; and we can not suppose , that while the traces of this foreign origin are yet distinctly visible in other relations , its impress should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of this people . Such being the condition of the common law of New York at the time of the Revolution , we are not aware that it has since undergone any greater change , than what may be called its natural growth by new combinations and applications of its principles , or else such limited alterations as belong to // the usual progress of legislation , in this country , except , that by an act passed in 1788 , entitled an act for the amendment of the law , and the better advancement of justice , ' it was enacted , that none of the statutes of England , or Great Britain , shall be considered as laws of this State . ' It would be a delicate task , and somewhat foreign to our present purpose , to consider how far this general repudiation of the English statutes fairly extends , and what effect it has had , if any , upon the common law of the State , as existing at the time of its formation ; and whether it ha* really been , conformably to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and calculated for the better advancement of justice . The statute law now in force in New York , is , of course , composed of the Constitution , treaties , and public laws of the United States , and the acts of its own State legislature . These last , with the exception of local and private acts , are in a great measure derived from British statutes of a date preceding the Revolution ; in many instances they are copied verbatim from the English Statute Book , and in others its provisions are adopted with slight alterations of phraseology . The colonial statutes , declared by the Constitution to be a part of the law of the State , have never been rejected , like the British statutes , en masse ; many , on the contrary , have been formally reenacted ; and others probably mingle , unseen , in the current of legislation , and still have a silent operation in pointing out the just construction of existing laws . A large body of new statute law must , of course , have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized ; courts were to be instituted ; the administration of justice , civil and criminal , was to he regulated ; forms of process and of judicial proceedings to be provided ; the whole future course of legislation and judicature to be determined . This sudden influx of new matter , somewhat hastily contrived for the 1 ) resent exigency , must , of course , have led to many errors and imperI*ctions , which were to he remedied from time to time , as experience should suggest them , by additional acts , modifying the former provisions , or wholly re*ea1ing them , and substituting something new , destined itself probably to be in like manner the subject of future amendments , additions , and repeals ; for it is most certain , ' says a learned judge , who was more attentive to his law than his grammar , that time and long experience is much more ingenious , subtil , and judicious , than all the wisest and acutest wits in the // world coexisting can be . ' Besides supplying the defects and repairing the errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity of the nation , and of no part of it more than this distinguished State , the almost incredible growth of population , and immense extension of commerce , a vast and rapid accumulation of wealth , wonderful inventions and discoveries in mechanics and the arts , great public schemes of internal improvement , and innumerable private associations for the employment and security of large capitals in trade and manufactures , have for these forty years past combined to create a real demand for new laws , adapted to the improved condition and modern exigencies of society . It would have been well for the community , and a great relief to courts and counsellors , as well as to revisers and digesters , if the growth of the Statute Book , had arisen wholly from such causes , and only kept pace with the natural demand . But the frequency of popular elections , the minute representation of sectional interests , and the Athenian fondness for novelty among us , have given rise to a very mischievous facility of legislation . It is notorious that a great proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important and extensive operation , are made for particular cases , and are sometimes very ill adapted for any other . It is equally notorious , that an act of incorporation is commonly granted to any set of men , who ask it , for almost any purpose , and wmtb almost any powers , which they are pleased to have inserted in their bill . We do not mean to insinuate , that this is owing to improper influences ; although there has been a shrewd suspicion of such operating , in one or two cases , to a small extent upon the legislature of New York . We apprehend that such instances , if they exist in any legislature of the Union , are extremely rare ; but w* think there is. in all of them a slovenly and careless mode of legislating , to a degree almost as culpable ; for it is a good maxim of the common law , that gross ladies is tantamount to fraud . Private bills are commonly drafted by the petitioner , or his counsel ; are often read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , without amendment , and in fact without any effectual notice of their contents to the house . Important changes of general laws , to subserve a particular , thougb perhaps honest end , are sometimes artfully thrust in by their friends among the matters of little moment , to be hurried through , at the end of a session , without debate , and consequently often without due intelli // Jaii. gence of their necessary operation ; and in other cases , where the principles of a law have been fairly discussed and are well understood , the acts themselves are yet so inartificially and inaccurately penned as to beget great doubt and uncertainty of their true intent ; giving rise to perpetual litigation and innumerable emendatory acts . The legislators themselves are often as much surprised as the courts , to find what has become law ; and the chief business of each succeeding legislature is to patch up or repeal , what was ill done by its immediate predecessor . These remarks are not intended to apply to New York alone ; they are quite as true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , indeed , the whole foregoing history of the origin , progress , and condition , both of the common and statute law or New York , is , with little exception , a history of the law of all the other States of the old confederation . If our statements are not greatly overcharged , it can readily be imagined what a mass of useless rubbish a few years of such legislation must accumulate in the Statute Book ; how many acts are to be consulted , and how mahy doubts of construction resolved , before the most experienced lawyer can instruct his client in what ought to be so plain a matter as the operation of the written law ; and how necessary some system of revision and consolidation must from time to time become . There are few , if any , of the States in which something of this sort , more or less extensive , has not been attempted . In some of of their legislative assemblies , as in the Congress of the United States and the British Parliament , all acts relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with such amendments as experience of their practical operation may have suggested . In others , the whole Statute Book has been put into the hands of commissioners to be arranged for reenactment . Virginia , especially , deserves great praise , both as a Colony and a State , for her uniform attention to the reformation and republication of her statute laws . She has made , according to the statement of Mr Henning , who , as a reporter of her courts and a reviser of her laws , is well known to the profession generally , - no less than twelve entire revisions ; the first of them as early as 1632 ; the last in 1808 . She has besides , under the superintendence of the gentleman abovementioned , recently achieved a great work , of a different ch*racter indeed , but sufficiently connected with our topic to allow us to notice it , as one of great importance to *ie history of the country , as well as the // administration of her own municipal Lw . We allude to the publication of her Statutes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia from the First Session of the Legislature in 1619 ; occupying thirteen octavo volumes , of five or six hundred pages each . No simil ' r work has as yet been attempted in any other State . Maine also deserves commendation for embracing the opportunity afforded by her erection into a separate State , to make great improvements in the Statute Book of Massachusetts . One of her first acts was to appoint a Board of Jurisprudence , consisting of eminent lawyers , to superintend the publication of the laws , with authority to classify and arrange the whole as to them rni**iit appear most convenient . They pursued the autho ity given them by consolidating all laws then in force relative to the sane subject , and rejecting all which were repugnant and contradictory , so as to comprise* the whole in a single moderate volume , containing everything useful for ordinary purposes , which was to be found in the four volumes then existing of Massachusetts laws . Massachusetts , we regret to say , has done less in this matter than she might have done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive revision of her laws for more than forty years ; nor any preceding the last for more than a century . We , of course , do not consider mere collections and republications , by authority , as revisions . The collection of Ancient Charters and General Laws of the Colony and Province of I*1assachusetts Bay , in a single volume , though highly valuable to the historian , and perfectly convenient to the profession , is still but a meagre substitute , as a collection of legal and historical documents , for the statutes at large . The last edition of the General Laws of the Commonwealth , from the adoption of the Constitution , though published after the publication of the Laws of Maine , has none of the improvements of that book , but consists of two considerable volumes , and abounds in acts additional , restraining , extending , repealing , restoring , and rerepealing , without consolidation or method , other than belongs to cli ronological arrangement , and frequent references from act to act . The fault is in the authority given ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to advert again to the laws of New York . The era of legislation , ' as it has been called , in that Colony , was 1683 . But the colonial acts of that and several subsequent years , with a few exceptions , are not to he found in any printed edition of the laws extant ; and it is stated by learned gentle men , // who had occasion to make the research in 1813 , that but few of them are preserved in the Secretary 's office . The earliest edition known of the colonial laws , is Bradlbrd 's , published in 17 10 , and containing the laws from 1691. lIe published another edition in 1726 , bringing the laws down to that time . In 1762 , the colonial laws then in force , were collected , revised , and published under the authority of the General Assembly , by William Smith , Junior , and William Livia&amp;ton . Another authoritative revision and republication of the colonial laws took place in 1774. rJ7he first revision and collection of the laws of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Jones and Richard Varrick , containing , in two volumes , the laws passed fi'orn the adoption of the Constitution in 1777 , and an appendix of certain colonial laws . No other general revision by direction of the legislature took place until 1801 , when James Kent , the late Chancellor , then Chief Justice , an ( l Jacob Radeliff , then a Justice of the Supreme Court , were appointed to prepare for the press , and to cause to be printed in as many volumes , and under such heads , . or divisions , as they shall think proper , all the acts and parts of acts of the legislature of this State now in force . ' This labor was accomplished in two volumes , published the following year , and commonly known in the reports as the Revised Laws of New York . These took effect from the 1st of October , 1801 , from which time all acts and parts of acts , coming within the purview and operation of the revised acts , were repealed . In 1813 , a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on William P. Van Ness and John Woodworth ; and the result of their labors , exhibiting the actual state of the stattite law of New York at that date , appears likewise in two volumes , published the same year . This edition , commonly known as the New Revised Laws , contains references to all the preceding editions of Colonial and State laws , to the English and British acts of Parliament , in pan matenid , and also to the English and American reporters upon points of construction . Both in this edition and that of Messrs Kent and Radeliff , all the provisions then in force relatin to the same particulai* , are consolidated into separate acts ; but there is little attempt at a scientific arrangement or classification of the subjects . A considerable accumulation of laws , passed since 1813 , must now remain wholly without arrangement ; yet what has been done by the former revisers will doubtless abridge considerably the labors of the present commissm*mers , whose plan , as develop* ad in the Report , we now propose to consider . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranging and classifying the laws as follows . I. Those which relate to the territory ; the political divisions ; the civil polity ; and the internal administration of the State . II . Those which relate to the acquisition , the enjoyment , and the transmission of property , real and personal ; to the domestic relations ; and generally to all matters connected with private rights . Iii . Thc*** which relate to the judiciary establishments , and the mole of procedure in civil cases . IV . Those which relate to crimes and punishments ; to the mode of procedure in criminal cases ; and to prison discipline . V. Public laws of a local and miscellaneous character ; including the laws concerning tile city of New York ; acts incorporating cities and villages ; and such other acts of incorporation as it may be deemed necessary to publish . ' p. 7 . This general arrangement , borrowed apparently from Blackstone , is simple , and adequate to its eu&amp; The first part is then subdivided into nineteen chapters , the titles of which sufficiently indicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled , Of the boundaries of the State and its territorial jurisdiction . II , Of the civil divisions of the State . III . Of the census , or enumeration of the inhabitants of the State . IV . Of the public officers , their qualifications , privileges , and disabilities ; the mode of their election or appointment ; and the tenure of their respective offices . V. Of elections other than for town officers . VI . Of tile duties , privileges , and disabilities of the legislative and principal executive officers of the State . VII . Of the powers , duties , and privileges of towns . VIII . Of the powers , duties , and privileges of counties . IX . Of the salaries and fees of the several offices of this States except those connected with the judiciary . X. Of the public property and the funds of the State . XI . Of the assessment and collection of taxes . XII . Of the militia , and the public defence . XIII . Of the public health . XIV . Of public instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XVI . Of highways and bridges . XVII . Of ferries . // XVIII . Of the internal police of the State . XIX . Of the publication and construction of the statutes of this State . ' pp. 9-t*2 We regret , that our limits will not allow us to extract one of the chapters , exhibited in the pamphlet as a specimen , entire . We can , however , briefly exhibit something of the mode of farther subdivision . Chapter VII . Of the powers , duties , and privileges of towns , ' is distributed nader six titles . Title I. Of the powers and rights of towns as bodies politic , and the mode of exercising them . Title II . Of town meetings , and the time , purposes , and manner of holding the same . Title III . Of the qualifications of town officers , and the tenure of their offices . Title IV . Of vacancies in town offices , and the mode of slipplying them . Title V. Of the duties of certain town officers . Title VI . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Some of these titles are again subdivided into several articles ; and each article , or title not divided into articles , is again snbdivided into sections . Title 11. for instance , consists of the four following articles . Article I. Of annual and special town meetings . ' This article directs when and where the meetings shall he held ; what officers shall be chosen ; what notice shall be given and defines the powers of the electors at such meetings . Article II . Of the mode of conducting town meetings . ' This article directs , who shall preside at such meetings ; defines the powers of the presiding officers ; prescribes the duties of the clerk ; fixes the duration of the meeting , the mode of determining questions by vote , *c . Article III . of the election of town officers . ' This directs the manner in which the polls shall be opened and closed , the form of the ballot , the mode of counting , and declaring , and recording the votes . Artick lV. contains all such miscellaneous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed of under the foregoing heads . ' As a short specimen of the phraseology , we will cite the whole of the first title of this chapter . // To sue and be sued , in the manner prescribed in the laws of this State To purchase and hold lands within its own limits , and for the use of its inhabitants ; subject to the power of the legislature over such limits ; To make such contracts , and to purchase and hold such personal property , as may be necessary to the exercise of its corporate or administrative powers ; And to make such orders for the disposition , regulation , or use of its corporate property , as may be deemed conducive to the interest of its inhabitants . 2 . No town shall possess or exercise any corporate powers , except such as are enumerated in this chapter ; or shall be specially given by law ; or shall be necessary to the exercise of the powers so enumerated or given . 3 . All acts and proceedings by or against a town , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ; but every conveyance of lands within the limits of such town , made in any manner , for the use or benefit of its inhabitants , shall have the same effect as if made to the town by name . 4 . The powers of a town , as a body politic , can only be exercised in town meeting , or in pursuance of a resolution there adopted . ' No enacting clause is proposed to be introduced , excepting7 at the beginning of each of the five general divisions , where it is preceded by a short preamble , setting forth the expediency of simplifying , consolidating , arranging , and amending the statutes relative to the subjects of that division . The commissioners have not yet proceeded in theim analysis beyond the first general division , the preparation of which , with the necessary preliminary studies and inquiries , they state had furnished them sufficient employment between the periods of their appointment and of the report . Indeed they add , that more than three fourths of the existing public statutes fall under this head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hope to reduce , however , notwithstanding the addition of many new provisions , to about half their present ex* tent . The task they have undertaken , with the scrupulous fidelity of execution , which we doubt not belongs to them , is indeed a prodigious labor not to be accomplished in a day . Some of its intrinsic difficulties can not be better set forth than in their own words . In the progress of the work , many changes in the arrangement // originally contemplated ; frequent transpositions in the order of the subjects ; and new divisions and subdivisions of the differ* ent parts , became necessary . It is not until successive experiments have been actually made , that it can be satisfactorily ascer* tamed , under what general head the subjects of some of the acts , may most properly be comprised . But the most serious portion of our labor is the drawing up of the text itself . To reduce the sections to a proper brevity ; to distribute them in a suitable manner ; and to simplify the language in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole with our own hands , and often to give our draughts several revisions , before we can so far satisfy ourselves , in regard to arrangement and expression , as to authorise the employment of a copyist . We can therefore derive but little aid from clerks or amanuenses ; nor have we thought it consistent with the great importance of the trust confided to us , to leave to any one of our number exclusively , the completion of any part of the work , though by such a division of labor , out progress might have been hastened . To preserve uniformity of expression , and to make our performances in every sense of the words , joint and several , we have adopted the plan of alloting to each other , from time to time , convenient portions of the statutes ; of committing the draughts prepared by each to the separate and critical revisal of the others ; and then of subjecting them to the joint examination of all . ' p. 14 . From the brief outline we have given of this scheme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissioners , the professional reader can duly estimate the magnitude of the task , and perceive at once the great practical convenience of a code so digested , by such hands , when compared with the clumsy and confused mass of contradictory materials , which now encumbers our statute books . For the difficulty is hardly less with us , than it was with the English in the time of James ; and Lord Bacon , in his proposal to that monarch , for the amendi*ig of the laws of his realm , takes occasion to press upon his Majesty a vigorous argurnentum ad hominem , by reminding him , that there is such an accumulation of statutes concerning one matter , and they so cross and intricate , as the certainty of the law is lost in the heap ; as your Majesty had occasion to experience last day upon the point , whether the incendiary of Newmarket should have the benefit of his clergy . ' Still there is always room to fear , that in the general methodizing and amending even of the statute law alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere method ; or rather too much // new law may be suddenly introduced , from the great temptation of filling out a noble outline and erecting a perfect system ; in short , there is some reason to fear lest systematizing should degenerate into absolute codification . It is remarkable that two such minds , as those of Lord Bacon and Lord Hale , should have concurre ( l , at periods when many of the evils they complain of were certainly less sensibly felt , than at the present day , not only in favorable disposition towards what may be called moderate reform in the law , but in devotin6 themselves to consideration of the means by which it might best be effected . Indeed the latter , as far as we can gather from his preface to Rolle 's Abridgment , seens to have contemplated the formation of a sort of co ? pusjurts conzrnun*s out of the many books of our English laws , for the public use , and for the contracting of the laws into a narrower compass and method . ' Perhaps , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere expresses , we should understand him here as intending nothing more than was proposed by Lord Bacon ; whose plan , in regard to the common law , was first , to compile a select volume of forms and precedents from the ancient rolls ; secondly , to make a perfect collection of adjudged cases , omitting all that were doubted or overruled , or mere repetitions of former decisions , or which were entirely antiquated and obsolete , as well as all idle queries , which are but seminaries of doubts and uncertainties , ' and reducing into a compendious form such as were reported with unnecessary prolixity ; thirdly , to form a book of institutes , and a few other auxiliaries to the study of the law , which he probably would not have thought necessary to propose , had he lived to the days of Sir William Blackstone , certainly not had he seen all the labor saving machines of the present age . In regard to the statutes , his design was simply to repeal and discard from the books all that were dormant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consolidate into one clear and uniform law all those which regarded like subjects . The most strenuous opposer of codes would hardly disagree to these modes of amendment . But the gentlemen of New York are going a step farther , in regard to the reformation of the statute law . They propose , not merely a consolidation , but an entire new order of arrangement , accompanied by changes of phraseology , with a view to greater clearness and precision , and even by provisions wholly new , to supply and remedy what are ifl their judgment palpable // omissions and imperfections . The title , for instance , which we have cited at length , does not contain a single sentence , nor indeed a single provision , which is to he found in any former volume of the laws ; on the contrary , the first section is avowedly extracted from a decision of the Chancery Court of the State ; the third section was suggested by decisions at common law , establishing certain principles in regard to counties , that would probably be extended to towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wholly their own . Now it must he confessed , that this is exercising the powers confided to them in their greatest latitude ; and it is not wonderful , that those who are timid on the subject of innovation , or at least abundantly careful , that every change of the laws he demonstrable to be for the better , and such as can not introduce any considerable inconvenience in the other end of the wallet , ' should be somewhat apprehensive of unforeseen consequences . It is but just , however , to state , that the extract we have given is not a fair sample of the two proposed chapters in this particular . It is the only title which is composed entirely without the aid of the existing statutes . Neither do the commissioners themselves consider these chapters , which contain doubtless a great deal of novelty , as specimens , in this respect , of the whole work . They justly consider , that there is a great distinction between statutes regarding iiectoral franchises and modes of public proceeding , and those which concern private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic relations . With the former , they have felt themselves at greater liberty to fill up what was wholly unprovided for by the existing letter of the Statute Book , under the idea that these laws are of a character peculiarly simple in themselves , and such as ought to be expressed in a form level to the comprehension of all capacities , leaving little or nothing to he supplied by inference or by mere conjecture . They are besides , careful in every section to point out what is substantially new , and to refer , if it he an old provision newly clad , to the precise source from whence it was derived . They admit that these chapters can hardly be- called revisions of existing laws , ' and consider them rather as suggestions to the legislature in the most convenient form . With respect to the class of statutes falling under the second general division , namely , those which relate to the acquisition , the enjoyment , and the transmission of property , real and personal : // to the domestic relations ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissioners appear to be duly sensible of the increasing difficulty of their task , and by no means indicate an overweening confidence of success . These are statutes of which they say , almost every line has been the subject of judicial interpretation ; and by a salutary * in the act from which they derive their authority , they are expressly restrained from making any change in th' phraseology or distribution of the sections of any statute , that has been the subject of a legal decision , by which its established construction might be affected or impaired . if in this portion of their labor , they should observe the same scrupulous regard to the duty of forbearance as they have thus far to a most diligent and indefatigable exercise of their extensive powers upon the first class of laws , and yet succeed in reducing them into an equally simple and methodical arrangement , they will have achieved a work which will do infinite honor to them and their constituents , and 0 be of great service not only to the profession , but to the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded and deliberate labor , taken in connexion with their known professional learning and practical skill , as well as the specimen they have laid open to our examination , of dangerous innovations ; and we believe , that the final completion of this great work will constitute a new era of legislation'in New York , the benefits of which will be experienced , crc long , by the necessary force of example , in her sister States , if not in other portions of the civilized world . Yet , not being prepared to go all lengths with the reformers of the day , and perceiving a disposition in the commissioners to exercise their right of suggesting new things to the legislature pretty extensively , we can not take our leave without recommending moderation in this particular , and reminding them , in the language of Lord Hale , that the business of amendment or alteration of the laws is a choice and tender business , neither wholly to be omitted when the necessity requires , and yet very cautiously and warily to be undertaken though the necessity may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
