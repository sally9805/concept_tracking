txt NAPOLEON BONAPARTE . BY JOHN S. C. ABBOTT . SAINT IIELENA- ( coacluded . ) DECEMBER 10 , 1815 . The Emperor was this day conducted to his new residence at Longwood . In cheerful spirits he rode on horsehack along the rugged path of harren volcanic rocks , a distance of two miles , until he arrived at his final prison-house . Here he found , in the midst of bleak , storm-washed crags , a long , low , onestory house , rudely put together , hut far too small for the accommodation of the few yet devoted friends who had come to share his captivity . The Emperor examined his prison with serenity and good-nature , seeming to think more of the comfort of his companions than of his own . About a mile from Longwood , on the road to the Briars , there was a small hovel , called Hut 's Gate , which General Bertrand , with his wife and son , was permitted to occupy . General Gourgaud and Count Las Cases eagerly solicited permission to sleep in teats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tent under the windows of the Emperor , was pitched for General Gourgaud ; and an unfinished room was hastily prepared for Las Cases . Dr. O'Meara was also under the necessity of dwelling in a tent . In process of time a room was prepared for each of these gentlemen . For the subsistence of the imperial captive and his exiled court , the British Ministry appropriated sixty thousand dollars a year . This was a small sum , considering the enormous expense of provisions , and of every comforl , upon that distant and barren rock . The followers of the Emperor resolutely persisted in treating him with all that deference and respect which were due to his illustrious character and to his past achievements . They refused to acquiesce in the insult cast upon France , upon them , and upon Napoleon , by addressing him as if he had been but a successful general , who , by the energies of the sword , had usurped sovereign power .

The other was a young man , the Abb6 Vigimli , who was also a physician . Sept. 22 , 1819 . Dr. Antommarchi had his first interview with Napoleon . He found him in bed , in a small , dark room , very meanly furnished . It was a quarter past two o'clock in the afternoon . The room was so dark that when the Doctor first entered he could not see Napoleon . The Emperor perceiving this , in gentle tones requested him to approach . He questioned him very minutely respecting his parentage , his past history , his motives for consenting to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Satisfied with his replies , the Emperor entered into a frank and touching conversation respecting his friends in Europe . He then saw the two Abb6s . At the close of a confiding and an affecting interview , the Emperor said , in the tones of a man upon the verge of the grave : " We have been too long deprived of the ordinances of religion not to be eager to enjoy them immediately , now that they are within our power . Hereafter we will have the communion service every Sabbath , and we will observe the sacred days recognized by the Concordat . I wish to establish at St. Helena the religious ceremonies which are celebrated in France . On these occasions we will erect a movable altar in the dining-room . You , Mons. Abb* , are aged and infirm . I will select the hour which will be most convenient for you . You may officiate between nine and ten o'clock in the morning . " In the evening the Emperor was alone with Count Montholon . The Count was not a religious man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps I forgot religion . " Napoleon , with great joy , informed Montholon of his intention to attend mass the next day . He then uttered the following remarkable confession : " Upon the throne , surrounded by generals far from devout , yes , I will not deny it , I had too much regard for public opinion , and far too much timidity , and perhaps I did not dare to say aloud , I am a believer . ' I said , Religion is a power  --  a political engine . ' But , even thep , if any one had questioned me directly , I should have replied , Yes ! I am a Ghristian . ' And if it had been necessary to confess my faith at the price of martyrdom , I should have found all my firmness . Yes ! I should have endured it rather than deny my religion . But now that I am at St. Helena , why should I dissemble that which I believe at the bottom of my heart ? Here I live for myself . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord 's Supper . and to confess what I believe . I will go to the mass . I will not force any one to accompany me there . But those who love me will follow me . " General Bertrand was an avowed unbeliever. and often displeased Napoleon by speaking disrespectfully of sacred things . The Emperor was one day , about this time , conversing with him upon the subject of atheism . " Your spirit , " said he , " is it the same as the spirit of the herdsman , whom you see in the valley below feeding his flocks ? Is there not as great a distance between you and him , as NAPOLEON A OARI ) ENER. // between a horse and a man ? But how do you wishes that I may also he like him , a lump of know this ? You have never seen his spirit , clay ? " qwq The conversation at St. Helena very frequently turned upon the subject of religion . One day Napoleon was speaking of the Divinity of Christ , General Bertrand*said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man like you can believe that the Supreme Being ever exhibited himself to men under a human form , with a body , a face , mouth , and eyes . Let Jesus be whatever you please  --  the highest intelligence , the purest heart , the most profound legislator , and , in all respects , the most singular being who has ever existed . I grant it . Still he was simply a man , who taught his disciples , and deluded credulous people , as did Orpheus , Confucius , Brahma . Jesus caused himself to be adored , because his predecessors , Isis and Osiris , Jupiter and Juno , had proudly made themselves objects of worship . The ascendency of Jesus over his time , was like the ascendency of the gods and the heroes of fable . If Jesus has impassioned and attached to his chariot the multitude-if he has revolutionized the worldI see in that only the power of genius , and the action of a commanding spirit , which vanquishes the world , as so many conquerors have doneAlexander , C*sar , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon replied : " I know men , and dl tell you that Jesus Christ is not a man . Superficial minds see a resemblance between Christ and the founders of empires and the gods of other religions . That resemblance does not exist . There is between Christianity and whatever other religion the distance of infinity . " We can say to the authors of every other religion , You are neither gods nor the agents of the Deity . You are but missionaries of falsehood , moulded from the same clay with the rest of mortals . You are made with all the passions and vices inseparable from them . Your teml ) les and your priests proclaim your origin . Such will be the judgment , the cry of conscience , of whoever examines the gods and the temples of paganism . " Paganism was never accepted , as truth , by the wise men of Greece ; neither by Socrates , Pythagoras , Plato , Anaxagoras , or Pericles . On the other side , the loftiest intellects , since the advent of Christianity , have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mysteries and the doctrines of the gospel ; not only Bossuet and Fenelon , who were preachers , but Descartes and Newton , Leibnitz and Pascal , Corneille and Racine , Charlemagne and Louis xIv " Paganism is the work of man . One can here read but our imbecility . What do these gods , so boastful , know more than other mortals ? these legislators , Greek or Roman , this Numa , this Lycurgus , these priests of India or of Memphis , this Confucius , this Mohammed ? Absolutely nothing . They have made a perfect chaos of morals . There is not one among them all who has said any thing new in reference to our future destiny , to the soul , to the essence NAPOLEON RECEIVING THE PORTRAIT OF HIS SON . // of God , to the creation . Enter the sanctuaries of paganism . You there find perfect chaos , a thousand contradictions , war between the gods , the immobility of sculpture , the division and the rending of unity , the parceling out of the divine attributes mutilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presumption , polluted fetes , impurity and abomination adored , all sorts of corruption festering in the thick shades , with the rotten wood , the idol , and his priest . Does this honor God , or does it dishonor him ? Are these religions and these gods to be compared with Christianity ? " As for me , I say no . I summon entire Olympus to my tribunal . I judge the gods , but am far from prostrating myself before their vain images . The gods , the legislators of India and of China , of Rome and of Athens , have nothing which can overawe me . Not that I am unjust to them ! No ; I appreciate them , because I know their value . Undeniably princes , whose existence is fixed in the memory as an image of order and of power , as the ideal of force and beauty , such princes were no ordinary men . " I see in Lycurgus , Numa , and Mohammed only legislators , who , having the first rank in the State , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see nothing there which reveals divinity . They themselves have never raised their pretensions so high . As for me , I recognize the gods and these great men as beings like myself . They have performed a lofty part in their times , as I have done . Nothing announces them divine . On the contrary , there are numerous resemblances between them and myself ; foibles and errors which ally them to me and to humanity . " It is not so with Christ . Every thing in him astonishes me . His spirit overawes me , and his will confounds me . Between him and whoever else in the world there is no possible term of comparison . He is truly a being by himself . His ideas and his sentiments , the truths which he announces , his manner of convincing , are not explained either by human organization or by the nature of things . " His blith , and the history of his life ; the profundity of his doctrine , which grapples the mightiest difficulties , and which is of those difficulties the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his empire , his march across the ages and the realms-every thing is , for me , a prodigy , a mystery insoluble , which plunges me into a reverie from which I can not escape  --  a mystery which is there before my eyes-a mystery which I can neither deny nor explain . Here I see nothing human . " The nearer I approach , the more carefully I examine , every thing is above me-every thing remains grand , of a grandeur which overpowers. his religion is a revelation from an irtelligence , which certainly is not that of man . There is there a profound originality , which has created a series of words and of maxims before unknown . Jesus borrowed nothing from our sciences . One can absolutely find nowhere , but in him alone , the imitation or the example of his life . He is not a philosopher , since he advances by miracles , and from the commencemeat his disciples* worshiped him . He persuades them far more by an appeal to the heart than by any display of method and of logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any knowledge of letters . All his religion consists in believing . " In fact , the sciences and philosophy avail nothing for salvation ; and Jesus came into the world to reveal the mysteries of heaven and the laws of the spirit . Also , he has nothing to do but with the soul , and to that alone he brings his gospel . The soul is sufficient for him , as he is sufficient for the soul . Before him the soul was nothing . Matter and time were the masters of the world . At his voice every thing returns to order . Science and philosophy become secondary . The soul has reconquered its sovereignty . All the scholastic scaffolding falls , as an edifice ruined , before one single wordFaith . " What a master , and what a word , which can effect such a revolution ! With what authority does he teach men to pray ! He imposes his belief . And no one , thus far , has been able to contradict him ; first , because the gospel contains the purest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obscurity , is only the proclamation and the truth of that which exists where no eye can see , and no reason can penetrate . Who is the insensate who will say No to the intrepid voyager who recounts the marvels of the icy peaks which he alone has had the boldness to visit ? Christ is that bold voyager . One can doubtless remain incredulous . But no one can venture to say , it is not so . " Moreover , consult the philosophers upon those mysterious questions which relate to the essence of man , and the essence of religion . What is their response ? Where is the man of good sense who has ever learned any thing from the system of metaphysics , ancient or modern , which is not truly a vain and pompous ideology , without any connection with our domestic life , with our passions ? Unquestionably , with skill in thinking , one can seize the key of the philosophy of Socrates and Plato . But to do this , it is necessary to be a metaphysician ; and moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But good sense alone , the heart , an honest spirit , are sufficient to comprehend Christianity . " The Christian religion is neither ideology nor metaphysics , but a practical rule , which directs the actions of man , corrects him , counsels him , and assists him in all his conduct . The Bible contains a complete series of facts and of historical men , to explain time and eternity , such as no other religion has to offer . If this is not the true religion , one is very excusable in being deceived ; for every thing in it is grand and worthy of God . I search in vain in history to find the similar to Jesus Christ , or // any thing which can approach the gospel . Neither history , nor humanity , nor the ages , nor nature offer me any thing with which I am able to compare it or to explain it . Here every thing is extraordinary . The more I consider the gospel , the more I am assured that there is nothing there which is not heyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the impious themselves have never dared to deny the sublimity of the gospel , which inspires them with a sort of compulsory veneration . What happiness that hook procures for those who believe it ! What marvels those admire there who reflect upon it ! " All the words there are imhedded and joined one upon another , like the stones of an edifice . The spirit which hinds these words together is a divine cement , which now reveals the sense , and again vails it from the mind . Each phrase has a sense complete , which traces the perfection of unity and the profundity of the whole . Book unique , where the mind finds a moral beauty before unknown , and an idea of the Supreme superior even to that which creation suggests . Who , hut God , could produce that type , that idea of perfection , equally exclusive and original ? " Christ , having hut a few weak disciples , was condemned to death . He died the object of the wrath of the Jewish priests , and of the contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own disciples . " They are about to take me , and to crucify me , said he . I shall he ahandoned of all the world . My chief disciple will deny me at the commencement of my punishment . I shall he left to the wicked . But then , divine justice being satisfied , original sin being expiated hy my sufferings , the bond of man to God will he renewed , and my death will he the life of my disciples . Then they will he more strong without me than with me ; for they will see me rise again . I shall ascend to the skies ; and I shall send to them , from heaven , a Spirit who will instruct them . The spirit of the cross will enable them to understand my gospel . In fine , they will believe it ; they will preach it ; and they will convert the world . " And this strange promise , so aptly called by Paul the foolishness of the cross , ' this prediction of one miserably crucified , is literally accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigious than the promise . " It is not a day , nor a battle which has decided it . Is it the lifetime of a man ? No ! It is a war , a long combat of three hundred years , commenced by the apostles and continued by their successors and by succeeding generations of Christians . In this conflict all the kings and all the forces of the earth were arrayed on one side . Upon the other I see no army , hut a mysterious energy ; individuals scattered here and there , in all parts of the globe , having no other rallying sign than a common faith in the mysteries of the cross . " What a mysterious symbol ! the instrument of the punishment of the Man-God . His disciples were armed with it . The Christ , ' they said , God has died for the salvation of men . ' What a strife , what a tempest these simple words have raised around the humble standard of the punishment of the Man-God ! On the one side , we see rage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , there is gentleness , moral courage , infinite resignation . For three hundred years spirit struggled against the brutality of sense , conscience against despotism , the soul against the body , virtue against all the vices . The blood of Christians flowed in torrents . They died kissing the hand which slew them . The soul alone protested , while the body surrendered itself to all tortures . Every where Christians fell , and every where they triumphed . " You speak of Ciesar , of Alexander ; of their conquests , and of the enthusiasm which they enkindled in the hearts of their soldiers . But can you conceive of a dead man making conquests , with an army faithful and entirely devoted to his memory . My armies have forgotten me , even while living , as the Carthaginian army forgot Hannibal . Such is our power ! A single battle lost crushes us , and adversity scatters our friends . " Can you conceive of Cusar as the eternal emperor of the Roman senate , and from the depths of his mausoleum governing the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the inv*ision and conquest of the world by Christianity . Such is the power of the God of the Christians ; and such is the perpetual miracle of the progress of the faith and of the government of His church . Nations pass away , thrones crumble , but the church remains . What is then the power which has protected this church , thus assailed by the furious billows of rage and the hostility of ages ? Whose is the arm which , for eighteen hundred years , has protected the church from so many storms which have threatened to engulf it ? " Alexander , C*sar , Charlemagne , and myself founded empires . But upon what did we rest the creations of our genius ? Upon force . Jesus Christ alone founded his empire upon love ; and at this hour millions of men would die for him . " In every other existence but that of Christ , how many imperfections ? Where is the character which has not yielded , vanquished by obstacles ? Where is the individual who has never been governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of the times , who has never compounded with any customs or passions ? From the first day to the last he is the same , always the same ; majestic and simple , infinitely firm and infinitely gentle . " Truth should embrace the universe . Such is Christianity , the only religion which destroys sectional prejudice , the only one which proclaims the unity and the absolute brotherhood // of the whole human family , the only one which is purely spiritual ; in fine , the only one which assigns to all , without distinction , for a true country , the bosom of the Creator , God . Christ proved that he was the son of the Eternal , by his disregard of time . All his doctrines signify one only , and the same thing , Eternity . " It is true that Christ proposes to our faith a series of mysteries . He commands , with authority , that we should believe them , giving no other reason than those tremendous words , I am God . ' He declares it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and all the fabricators of religion . What audacity , what sacrilege , what blasphemy , if it were not true ! I say more ; the universal triumph of an affirmation of that kind , if the triumph were not really that of God himself , would be a plausible excuse , and the proof of atheism . " Moreover , in propounding mysteries Christ is harmonious with nature , which is profoundly mysterious . From whence do I come ? whither do I go ? who am I ? Human life is a mystery in its origin , its organization , and its end . In man and out of man , in nature , every thing is mysterious . And can one wish that religion should not be mysterious ? The creation and the destiny of the world are an unfathomable abyss , as also is the creation and the destiny of each individual . Christianity at least does not evade these great questions . It meets them boldly . And our doctrines are a solution of them for every one who believes . " The gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth which penetrates and soothes the heart . One finds , in meditating upon it , that which one experiences in contemplating the heavens . The gospel is not a book ; it is a living being , with an action , a power , which invades every thing which opposes its extension . Behold it upon this table , this book surpassing all others ( here the Emperor deferentially placed his hand upon it ) ; I never omit to read it , and every day with the same pleasure . " Nowhere is to be found such a series of beautiful ideas , admirable moral maxims , which pass before us like the battalions of a celestial army , and which produce in our soul the same emotion which one experiences in contemplating the infinite expanse of the skies , resplendent in a summer 's night , with all the brilliance of the stars . Not only is our mind absorbed , it is controlled , and the soul can never go astray with this book for its gnide . Once master of our spirit , the faithful gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , and truly our God . The mother has no greater care for the infant whom she nurses . " What a proof of the divinity of Christ ! With an empire so absolute , he has but one single end , the spiritual melioration of individuals , the purity of conscience , the union to that which is true , the holiness of the soul . " Christ speaks , and at once generations become his by stricter , closer ties than those of blood ; by the most sacred , the most indissoluble of all unions . He lights up the flame of a love which consumes self-love , which prevails over every other love . The founders of other religions never conceived of this mystical love , which is the essence of Christianity , and is beautifully called charity . In every attempt to effect this thing , namely , to make himself beloved , man deeply feels his own impotence . So that Christ 's greatest miracle undoubtedly is , the reign of charity . " I have so inspired multitudes that they would die for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the enthusiasm of the soldier and Christian charity , which are are as unlike as their cause . " But , after all , my presence was necessary ; the lightning of my eye , my voice , a word from me ; then the sacred fire was kindled in their hearts . I do indeed possess the secret of this magical power , which lifts the soul , hut I could never impart it to any one . None of my generals ever learnt it from me . Nor have I the means of perpetuating my name and love for me , in the hearts of men , and to effect these things without physical means . " Now that I am at St. Helena ; now that I am alone chained upon this rock , who fights and wins empires for me ? who are the courtiers of my misfortune ? who thinks of me ? who makes efforts for me in Europe ? where are my friends ? Yes , two or three , whom your fidelity immortalizes , you share , you console my exile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a moment he was silent . He then continued : " Yes , our life once shone with all the brilliance of the diadem and the throne ; and yours , Bertrand , reflected that splendor , as the dome of the Invalides , gilt by us , reflects the rays of the sun . But disasters came ; the gold gradually became dim . The rain of misfortune and outrage with which I am daily deluged has effaced all the brightness . We are mere lead now , General Bertrand , and soon I shall be in my grave . " Such is the fate of great men ! So it was with Ctesar and Alexander . And I , too , am forgotten . And the name of a conqueror and an emperor is a college theme ! Our exploits are tasks given to pupils by their tutor , who sit in judgment upon us , awarding us censure or praise . And mark what is soon to become of me ; assassinated by the English oligarchy , I die before my time ; and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to become food for worms . Behold the destiny , near at hand , of him who has been called the great Napoleon . What an abyss between my deep misery and the eternal reign of Christ , which is proclaimed , loved , adored , and which is extending over all the earth . Is this to die ? Is it not rather to live ? The death of Christ ! It is the death of God . " // For a moment the Emperor was silent . As General Bertrand made no reply , he solemnly added , " If you do not perceive that Jesus Christ is God , very well , then I did wrong to make you a general . " During the spring months of the year 1821 , the Emperor , whose health had been long declining , was evidently approaching death . The British government had now finished a more comfortahie residence for Napoleon than the old house at Longwood ; hut he was too feehle to hear the fatigue and exposure of removal , and it was never occupied hy him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last days . April 21 . " The Emperor , " says Montholon , has again spokeu to me of his will . His im.igination is unceasingly employed in seeking to find resources from which to gratify his liberality . Each day brings to his mind the remembrance of some other old servant whom lie would wish to remunerate . " April 25 . The Emperor slept quietly most of the night . Count Montholon sat at his hedside . At 4 o'clock in the morning , Napoleon started up and exclaimed , in dreamy delirium , " I have just seen my good Josephine . She disappeared at the moment when I was ahout to take her in my arms . She was seated there . It seemed to me that I had seen her yesterday evening . She is not ch*nged . She is still the same , full of devotion to me . She told me that we were about to see each other again , never more to part . I ) id you see her ? " He soon again fell asleep . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie happened to fall upon a very atrocious lihel against Caulaincourt and Savary , as heing peculiar culprits in what the English called the assassiaotiou of the Duke d'Enghien . The magnanimity of Napoleon revolted at the idea of allowing the odium of any of the unpopular acts of his reign to he laid upon his friends . " This is shameful , " said the Emperor , and then , turning to Montholon , he added " hrin* me my will . " Without saying another word he opened the will and interlined the following declaration : " I caused the Duke d'Enghein to he arrested and tried , hecause that step was essential to the safety , interest , and honor of the French people , when the Count d'Artois was maintaining , hv his own confession , sixty assassins at Paris . Under similar circumstances I would act in the same wny . " Having written these few lines , without adding a word he handed hack the will to Montholou . There is something very remarkable in this declaration . In the first place , Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes upon himself whatever may he attached to it which is hiameworthy . In the sccond place , he is very accurate in his statement . He says , " I caused the Duke d'Enghien to he arrested and tried . " The evidence is very conclusive that Napoleon , notwithstanding the undeniahle proof of the treason of the Duke , intended to have pardoned him . His execution LONOWOOn-TuE NEW hOUsE . // qwq had decided the fate of a throne , to sign decrees , and occupy himself with matters purely administrative . But these facts are far inferior to the one which we here attest . But five days later , all that remained of this sublime genius was a corpse . And yet his thoughts were still constantly directed toward the happiness and future prospects of France . " When Dr. Antommarchi came in , he found the Emperor , though manifestly fast sinking , calm and rational . Napoleon spoke again of the cancer in the stomach , with which he had supposed that he was afflicted , and said to the Doctor , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest care . Write down your observations , and deliver them to my son . I wish , at least , to preserve him from the disease . " Antommarchi suggested the suhstitution of a blister for the plaster which he had applied to the epigastric region . " Since you wish it , " said the Emperor , " he it so . Not that I expect the least benefit from it . But my end is approaching , and I am desirous of showing , hy my resignation , my gratitude for your care and attention . Apply , therefore , the hlister . " The feverish state of his stomach induced him to drink much cold water . With characteristic gratitude he exclaimed , " If fate had decreed that I should recover , I would erect a monument upon the spot where the water flows , and would crown the fountain , in testimony of the relief which it has afforded me . If I die , and my body , proscribed as my person has been , should he denied a little earth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ajaccio , in Corsica . And if it should not be permitted me to rest where I was horn , let me he buried near the limpid stream of this pure water . " May 2 . The Emperor was in a raging fever during the night , and quite delirious . His wandering spirit retraced the scenes of the past , visited again his beloved France , hovered affectionately over his idolized . son , and held familiar converse with the companions of his toil and his glory . Again the lurid storm of war heat upon his disturbed fancy , as his unrelenting assailants comhiued anew for his destruction . Wildly he exclaimed , " Steingel , Dessaix , Massena ! Ali ! victory is declaring . Hun , hasten , press the charge ! They are ours 1 " Suddenly collectin* his strength , in his eagerness he sprang from the bed ; but his himhs failed him , and lie fell prostrate upon the floor . At nine o'clock in the morning the fever abated , and reason returned to her throne . Calling the Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Recollect what I have directed you to do after my death . Proceed very carefully to the anatomical examination of my stomach . I wish it , that I may save my son from this cruel disease . You will see him , Doctor , and you will point out to him what is best to he done , and will save him from the cruel sufferings I now experience . This is the last service I ask of you . " At noon the violence of the disease returned , and Napoleon , looking steadfastly and silently upon the Doctor for a few moments , said , " Doctor , I am very ill . I feel that I am going to die . " He immediately sank away into insensibility . All the inmates of Longwood were unremitting in their attentions to the beloved sufferer . He was to them all , from the highest to the lowest , a father whom they almost adored . The zeal and solicitude they manifested deeply moved the sensibilities of the Emperor . He spoke to them in grateful words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered from this insensibility he spoke faintly to his companions , enjoining it upon them to be particularly careful in attending to the comforts of the humbler members of his household after he should be gone . " And my poor Chinese , " said he , " do not let them be forgotten . Let them have a few scores of Napoleons . I must take leave of them also . " It is refreshing to meet such recognitions of the brotherhood of man . Mey 3 . At two o'clock in the afternoon the Emperor revived for a moment , and said to those who were appointed the executors of his will , and who were at his bedside , " I am about to die , and you are to return to Europe . You have shared my exile . You will be faithful to my memory . I have sanctioned all good I ) rinciphes , and have infused them into my laws and my acts . I have not omitted a single one . Unfortunately , however , the circumstances in which I was placed were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to postpone the execution of my plans . Our reverses occurred . I could not unbend the bow ; and France has been deprived of the liberal institutions which I intended to give her . She judges me with indulgence . She feels grateful for my intentions . She cherishes my name and my victories . Imitate her example . Be faithful to the opinions we have defended , and to the glory we have acquired . Any other course can only lead to shame and confusion . " He then sent for the Abbd Vignali . A movable altar was h ) laced at the Emperor 's bedside . All retired except the Abbd . Napoleon then , in silence and solitude , upon his dying bed , received the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper . After the solemn ordiiiance Count Montholon returned to the room . The tranquil tones of the Emperor 's voice , and the placid expression of his countenance , indicated the serenity of his spirit . He conversed a few moments upon religious subjects , and peacefully fell asleep . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Open the window , Marchand ; open it wide , that I may breathe the air , the good air , which the good God has made . " May 5 . The night of the 4th of May , dark , cheerless , and tempestuous , enveloped St. Helena in even unwonted gloom . The rain fell in torrents . A tornado of frightful violence swept the bleak rocks . Every tree which Napoleon had cherished was torn up by the roots , and laid prostrate in the mud . The dying Emperor , // unconscious of every thing which was passing around him , tossed restlessly upon his pillow . And now occurred the most affecting scene which had yet been witnessed in this chamber of suffering . The children of the family were introduced , to look , for the last time , upon their friend , now insensible , and breathing heavily in death . They had not seen him for more than a month . Shocked at the change which had taken place in that countenance , which had ever been accustomed to contemplate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment gazed upon the pallid and emaciate features with hesitation and terror . Then , with flooded eyes and loud sobbings , they rushed to the bedside , seized the hands of the Emperor , and covered them with kisses and with tears . All present were overpowered with emotion and the heavy breathing of the dying was drowned in the irrepressible lamentations of the mourners . Young Napoleon Bertrand was so overcome by the heart-rending scene that he fainted , and fell sefiseless upon the floor . In the midst of this death-drama one of the servants , who had been sick for forty-eight days , rose from his bed , and emaciate , pallid , delirious , and with disor ( lered dress , entered the room . In fevered dreams he imagined that the Emperor was in trouble , and had called to him for help . The delirious and dying servant stood tottering by the side of his delirious and dying master , wildly exclaiming , " I will not leave the Emperor . I will fight and perish with him The dying hours lingered slowly away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips of the illustrious sufferer . " Twice I thought , " says Montholon , " that I distinguished the unconnected words , Francearmy-head of the army-Josephine . ' This was at six o'clock in the morning . During the rest of the day , until six o'cThck. in the evening , he was lying upon his hack , with his right hand out of the bed , and his eyes fixed , seemingly absorbed in deep meditation , and without any appearance of suffering . A pleasant and placid expression was spread over his features , as if he were sweetly sleeping . A dark and tempestuous night succeeded the stormy day . The gale , with increasing fury , swept the ocean and the black rocks , and wailed as mournful a dirge as could fall on mortal ears . The very island seemed to shake before the gigantic billows , hurled against its craggy cliffs by the spirit of the storm . In the midnight darkness of that terrific elemental war the spirit of Napoleon passed the earthly vail , and entered the dread unknown . " Isle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and loving Josephine . " France - the army-Josephine , " were the last images which lingered in the heart , and the last words which trembled upon the lips of the dying Emperor . NAPOLEON REcEIvINe TuE SACRAMENT OF TUE Loan 's SUPPER . // Napoleon had earnestly expressed the wish that his body might be buried on the banks of the Seine , in the midst of the French people whom he loved so well . Bnt if that privilege were denied his remains , he prayed that his body might be taken to his native island , and deposited in the tomb of his father at Ajaccio . But if the English government declined also that request , he entreated his friends to bury him in a secluded spot , which he had selected , at St. Helena , beneath a weeping willow , which overshadowed the limpid spring from which Nal ) oleon had received so many refreshing draughts of cold water . With his glowing affections he loved this spring as if it had been his personal friend . Application was immediately made to Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He informed the friends of Napoleon that the orders of his government were imperative , that the body of Napoleon was to remain at St. Helena . He , however , gave the assurance that it was quite a matter of indifference to him in what part of the island Napoleon was buried . They entreated him almost with tears , for permission to take the body home to his relatives and friends . But Sir Hudson Lowe , obedient to the requisitions of his government , was necessarily inexorable . He could not consent , notwithstanding the most affecting supplications and entreaties on the part of Madame Bertrand , to allow even the stomach and the heart to be removed . After a very careful post mortem examination the body was prepared for its buriaL The valet de chambre dressed the Emperor , as he was usually dressed in life , with white waistcoat and breeches , black cravat , long boots , and cocked hat . He was thus placed upon the bed , in his small bedroom , which was shrouded in black . The cloak which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A silver crncifix was placed upon his chest . Behind his head was an altar , where the Abbf Vignali stood , reciting the prayers of the church . Napoleon had won the respect and affection of all the inhabitants of that bleak rock . There was no one at St. Helena , save Sir Hudson Lowe , who did not speak in his favor . Rapidly the tidings of his death spread to every individual . An immense crowd was soon assembled at Longwood . During the afternoon of the 6th , and the whole of the 7th , an unending procession passed slowly *nd solemnly through the room , gazing in silent and religious awe upon the lifeless remains . Even Sir Hudson Lowe said , in this sad hour , " lIe was Enqiand 's greatest enemy , and mine too , but Ifargive him . " The morning of the 8th of May dawned with unusual brilliance . A perfect calm had succeeded the storm , and not a cloud obscured the brightness of the sun . At an early hour all the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last tribute of respect to the remains of the Emperor . At half past twelve o'clock the grenadiers placed TIlE DYING SCENE . // the coffin upon the hearse . The fnaeral car was drawn hy four horses , richly caparisoned , and each led by a groom . The f*ided cloak he wore at Marengo was his fitting shroud . Four of his devoted friends held the corners of the pall . Twelve grenadiers walked by the side of the hearse , to carry the coffin , where the bad condition of the path along the crags prevented the wheels from advancing . The Emperor 's horse , caparisoned in black , was led by a groom . The household of Longwood , dressed in deep mourning , followed sadly behind , weeping , with heart-rending grief ; as children at the grave of a father . Next after them came the Admiral and the Governor , on horseback , accompanied by the officers of the staff . In long procession the inhabitants of the island , men , women , and children , reverently joined the funeral train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been stationed upon the island to guard the Emperor , lined the whole of the left side of the road from Longwood nearly to the grave . Bands of music , at appointed intervals , breathed their requiems over the crags bathed in the silent sunlight . As the procession passed along , the soldiers , two by two , fell into the line , and with reversed arms solemnly paced the dead march to the grave . The roar of the ocean was hushed . Not a leaf trembled upon the gum-wood trees . And not a sound , save the death dirge , fell upon the listening ear , as the burial train moved slowly amidst the blackened crags . The whole career of Napoleon constitutes the wildest romance which imagination can conceive . But no events during that wondrous history are more touching and sublime than his death and burial on this lone , barren isle . At length the hearse stopped . Huge blocks of blackened lava , precipices , and towering crags obstructed the further advance of the wheels . Twelve grenadiers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy triple coffin of tin , lead , and mahogany , and carried them along a narrow path , which had been constructed on the side of the rugged mountain , to the place of burial . The booming of minute guns , from the Admiral 's ship in the harbor , reverberated from pinnacle to pinnacle of this gloomy rock , adding inconceivable sublimity to the scene . Every heart was vanquished by uncontrollable emotion . The coffin was placed on the verge of the grave . The Abbd Vignali recited the burial service . As the body was then lowered to its resting place , three successive volleys from a battery of fifteen cannon discharged over the grave , resounded in thunder peals along the crags of St. Helena . This was responded to by a simultaneous discharge from the ships in the harbor and every fort upon the THE GRAVE OF NAPOLEON .
