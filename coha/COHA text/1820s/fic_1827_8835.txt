DEDICATION . To J. B. Booth , Esq . I am indebted to the good offices of Mr. W. H. Wallack , for this opportunity of expressing my respect for your character , and for your talents which are so eminently suited to the daring attempt I have made to introduce , to the American public , a modern dramatic production , in which the Theatrical beau ideal is made to consist rather in the unity and strength of language of the piece , than in that perpetual excitement of the passions and variety of incident which have hitherto been deemed essential to its perfection . Not doubting that Sylla will by your personation have all the success to which its new dress will entitle it , I subscribe , Your obedient servant , THE TRANSLATOR . CHARACTERS At the Chatham Theatre . Sylla , Mr. J. B. Booth . Faustus , Mr. Blake . Claudius , Mr. Scott . Roscius , Mr. Wallack . Catiline , Mr. Wray . Metellus , Mr. Stevenson . Lnas , Mr. Isherwood . Aufidius , Mr. T. Placide . Balbus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Blake . HISTORICAL PREAMBLE . By E. Jouy . Reputations are formed by chance ; contemporaries receive them ready made , and generally transmit them without discussion and without examination . Years and ages roll away , and the echo of the passions of the moment , by being reverberated from age to age , form that equivocal and monotonous noise , which we term History . Cyrus , Alexander , Sylla , Csar , Mahomet , Gengiskan , are names which strike the ear and mind with a vague and little comprehended idea of greatness . A thousand writers have entertained us with their virtues , crimes , and glory ; their personal character , nevertheless , remains a problem . The same clouds which envelope the destiny of men , cover that of nations . What was Egypt ? a vast monastery , were a few hundred hypocritical monks , of whom kings were but the principal subjects , governed a credulous and stupid people . Are not the Historians , who have espoused this opinion , more rational than those who represent to us the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of the sublimest wisdom ? What shall we think of Rome ? This Republic , mistress of the world , had a cavern for her cradle ; but she produced heroes as other states produced men , and greatness in every thing appeared to be her element . If we call to mind her crimes , they are contrasted with unheard of virtues ; if we give reins to the enthusiasm which her virtues inspire , we shall not want proof that her crimes , as a nation , have surpassed those which the tribunals of justice , amongst every people of the earth , have pursued and visited with the severest chastisement . In raising doubts like these , it is not my intention to resolve them , but to show that they are equally applicable to Rome , and to her most extraordinary citizen  --  to the terrible and mysterious Sylla . It may almost be imagined , that it was in the destiny of the Roman republic to personify herself under the figure of this Dictator . He , like her , was great ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , and like her to attain immortal renown . She arrived at this double end by the enslavement and ruin of other nations ; he attained it by the proscription and murder of his fellow citizens , and by his heroic abdication . The early life of Sylla was passed in the midst of public dissensions . The depravity of the people , the impunity of the crimes of the tribunes , venality become a custom in the higher ranks , the intolerable pride of an aristocracy corrupted at its source  --  in short , the extertions of the Proconsuls , announced , that , tired of virtue , intoxicated by glory , satiated with riches and power , equally incapable of enduring labour or rest , the citizens of Rome were only the degenerate descendants of Brutus and Paulus Emilius . In this state of depravity , they only wanted a leader , to enter on the bloody career which the death of the Gracchi had opened before them . Marius presented himself . A ferocious courage had revealed the existence of this obscure soldier . Nature made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sunk into his soul as into a bottomless gulf . " He was a drunken brigand , whom blood and triumphs could not sober , and who could not bear a rival 's glory . Marius , having conquered the enemies of the state , wished to render himself master of the republic ; and to accomplish that , he flattered the Hydra of the populace and dissolved their allegiance , inflamed every passion , and became the chief of a bloody anarchy , to which the descendant of the Scipios , the proud Sylla , thenceforth resolved to set bounds . Jealous of the power of Marius , Sylla wished , at first , to create a rival glory in the field , and consign to oblivion the victor of the Cimbri . Whilst the soldier of Arpinum tarnished his trophies by the bloody orgies in which his last days rolled away , Sylla destroyed entire armies ; attached to himself by all the arts of a dexterous politician , the legions he commanded ; took by assault every town of the enemy before which he appeared ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of destiny . At sixty years of age Marius resumed his arms , and wished to march against the most formidable enemy of the Romans ; he humbled himself to solicit the command of the troops sent against Mithridates . Rome was divided into two great factions ; the Senate pronounced in favour of Sylla , and nominated him to the command of the army of Asia . This act of the Senate gave the signal for a civil war . Marius unchained his banditti , at whose head the tribune Sulpicius placed himself . Sylla , on whom the choice had fallen , whose cause was this time just , joined his army in Campania , led it back to Rome , and content with having struck terror into his adversaries , having seen Marius fly , he hastened to more glorious triumphs against the enemies of his country . Marius re-entered it , favoured by the dissensions that arose between the two Consuls , and the most horrid vengeance signalized his return to the city of Romulus . It was not until he had surpassed the glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after having triumphed over Mithridales , and subjugated Greece , that Sylla re-appeared under the walls of the Capitol , at the head of his victorious legions . Marius was dead ; his son did not fear to oppose the progress of the conqueror of Asia ; he was defeated , and forced to shut himself up in Preneste , where he put himself to death . Sylla gave siege to this town , rendered himself master of it , exterminated all its inhabitants , and re-entered Rome in triumph , where he proclaimed himself perpetual Dictator . Marius had opened the field of proscriptions , and entered it as a furious monster , who murdered to glut his rage . Sylla , more coldly , run over this frightful career ; in it , lie showed himself more vindictive than cruel , more politic than ferocious . Indifferent to the sufferings of his enemies , a bitter irony seemed to direct his poniard ; it was said , that in the choice of victims , he punished the Romans for their vileness . Five hundred patricians were immolated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the consuls . He pushed to extremity his triumph over the baseness of his fellow-citizens , and thought that he could not awaken in them the sentiment of existence but by pains and punishments . The proscriptions devastated Rome , Spoletta , Sulmone , Boviane , Esernia , Telesia , Florence , Preneste ; and yet among so many men , immolated at the voice of the mexorable Dictator , the two historians of that terrible epoch , Plutarch and Appian , do not cite a single truly celebrated name . Sylla , the dominator of nations subjugated by his arms ; master of Rome , where he had founded his power on the ruins of factions which he had choked with their blood , without any other support against so much hatred and vengeance heaped upon his head , than the Dictatorial authority with which he had clothed himself  --  Sylla , suddenly took a resolution , the most sublime and daring which the spirit of power has ever evinced ; he convoked the people at the forum , and insolently abdicated the sovereign power . " Behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , " ready to render an account of all the blood that I have spilt . " Such are the great traits in the life of Sylla : I have selected them from Plutarch , Appian , Valerius Maximus , Valleius-Paterculus , and others , None of these historians were able to penetrate his terrible character ; and Montesquieu is the only one who has enlightened this abyss with a ray of his genius . Under the pen of the immortal author of " the greatness and declension of the Romans , " Sylla became the reformer of Rome ; he enslaved the Romans , and made them hate their bondage ; he wished to bring them back to the love of liberty by the horrors of tyranny ; and when he had sufficiently abused power , in the interest of the republic , which he did not separate from , his personal vengeance , satisfied with the bloody lessons which he had given to his compatriots , he himself broke the Dictator 's plam which he had usurped , and came with a terrifying smile . to confound himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to account for some cruel act of his Dictatorship . Thus this whole life is a combination ; this tyranny is a calculation ; all this daring , is sang-froid and judgment . The more I have meditated on the astonishing contradiction in the character of Sylla , the more I am convinced that the spirit of illumination , which knew how to explain the enigma of Roman grandeur , has equally penetrated the soul of this extraordinary man . It is not the Sylla so imperfectly sketched by Plutarch , it is the Sylla so admirably pointed out by Montesquieu , that I have wished to re-produce on the stage . After having sufficiently established the truth of the whole , I will dwell on some particular traits of the model , with which the ancient authors , whom I have consulted , have furnished me . Sylla , in the exercise of power , was as gloomy , as severe , as he was easy of access , and communicative in private life . He did not seek for danger , he despised it ; he believed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the surname of Faustus , ( the happy , ) which he transmitted to his son . Scorning the priests , he was superstitious , and incessantly consulted divinations and oracles . Nothing pleased him more than the sight of troops manoeuvering under the walls of Rome . The luxury of camps was the only one which he favoured ; and no one was more sure of being well received , than by appearing before him , at the head of a squadron , bristling with gold and steel . By turns , haughty and familiar , he frightened by a look , or seduced by a smile , when he condescended to be willing to please . Remarkable for a rough eloquence , for a striking language , his speeches were always limited to a few phrases . At the commencement of the most celebrated battle which he gained , his troops fled ; he threw himself before them : " I die here , " said he , " return to Rome , and if any ask where you deserted your general , answer them , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish a dangerous mission , which he gave him : " I give you for escort , " answered Sylla , " your brother , your relations , and your friends murdered by Marius , who must be revenged to day . " A dry pleasantry , a bloody irony , revealed the bitterness of his soul ; he spoke with cold contempt of glory and of power ; never did man exercise more empire over minds , and even over hearts . This Lion-for , as Carbon named him , was , according to occasion , ferocious , generous , canning , supple , with an unexampled force of application , or an unbounded activity . Sylla , in the course of his Dictatorship , disposed of five or six kingdoms ; every word from his mouth became a proverb , and had , so to speak , the force of law ; the surnames which he gave , often unintentionally , to his courtiers , attached themselves irrevocably to their persons . He one day said ; Hail to GREAT Pompey ! Pompey , thereafter , was called Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . The superstition of Sylla had nothing of the vulgar in it : he consulted the auspices , and could not regard them without laughing . Before battle he sacrificed to the gods , and pillaged their temples after victory . The statues of Olympia , of Delphos , of Epidamus , rendered sacred by the veneration of the people were taken by Sylla , and transported to Rome ; he seized on the treasure of the temples , which he distributed to his soldiers , saying in derision , that it was impossible he should not be victorious , since the gods paid his troops . Fortune never abandoned him who had declared himself her favourite ; and such was Sylla 's success , that it seemed communicated to his partizans . It is remarked , that in the course of the wars which he conducted , none of his lieutenants experienced the least check . Sylla was the new legislator of Rome ; he made wise laws , whose execution he insured by penalties ; he seized violently on power , and signalized his advent to the Dictatorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he formed his guard . Historians have spoken with just and deep indignation of the tyranny of Sylla ; one only amongst them has mentioned the desperate state in which Rome was found , at the period when the conqueror of Marius had rendered himself its master . Florus is forced to avow that Sylla was regarded as a Saviour ; that he closed the cruel wounds of the republic . This old body , he adds , had need of a firm , skilful , and cruel hand : Sylla was the Physician , and the horrible method of healing which he employed , was the most efficacious . Had Sylla died Dictator , he would have been compared to many celebrated conquerors ; but he abdicated , and in the annals of every people , this trait distinguishes and isolates him ; he abdicated , and , the entire universe , says Rollin , with simplicity , was strangely surprised . Historical parallels are , for the most part , an abuse of the understanding . They may be compared to that game in society known by the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words pointed out by chance , relations much more ingenious than the objects are diverse . Plutarch has , more than any other writer , misused these forced accommodations , which have been for a long time reckoned amongst the necessities of the art of writing : but it is more particularly in his parallel between Lysander and Sylla , that one may remark the inherent defects of this species of composition . In retouching for the stage the portrait of Sylla , I have not , for a moment , turned my eyes from my model ; and was far from believing that I could be supposed to have the intention of calumniating , under such a name , the recent remembrances , which unheard of glory and misfortnnes have consecrated in the memory of the French . But as this tragedy has become , with some writers , the motive , or rather the pretext , for comparing the victor of Orchomenus with him of Austerlitz , I shall examine , in a few lines , the resemblances between them , and at the same time contrast them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their own handiwork  --  ardent friends of liberty before the epoch of their greatness , they both believed that they had purchased at the price of glory and triumphs , the right of enslaving their country . The one seized violently upon power , the other received it as a deposit , and used it as an inheritance . Napoleon and Sylla marched to their object without ostentation as without mystery ; they took empire as property which fortune bestowed on them and mankind appeared to recognise the mark of power on the front of these two dominators of the world . Sylla , in the exercise of power , displayed a ferocious and implacable soul ; his cold and calculating cruelty was , with him , only the most simple and ready means of attaining his object . The policy of Napoleon , in the course of a much longer reign , had but a single sanguinary act with which to reproach itself . His will , not less immovable than that of the Roman Dictator , had its origin in a genius of a superior order , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here by a sublime reason , the faculty of combining , with equal daring and wisdom , the elements of success ; the same indifference to contemporaneous opinion , the same desire for the esteem of posterity , the same sang-froid in danger , the same disdain of men , the same strength , and same weakness of an intelligence which could not sustain itself constantly at the same elevation . The systematic coldness of these two men was the result of different principles : With one , it was the egotism of vengeance ; with the other , the egotism of greatness . The desire of renown , which preyed upon them both , entirely dried up the soul of Sylla ; that of Napoleon remained accessible to the pure pleasures and sweet affections of domestic life . Napoleon restored severity to manners , and set the example of respect for public morality , at a time when it had been corrupted by the Directorial government to which he succeeded . For Sylla , on the contrary , sovereign power was but an occasion to give a scandalous eclat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thoughtful , fled the society which his compatriots adored ; the other , licentious and fond of pleasure , of easy access , surrounded himself with courtezans , buffoons , and Greek artists , whom his fellow-citizens despised . Perhaps , however , there will be found at the bottom of this contrast , an interior sympathy , and a common contempt for vulgar popularity . Sylla , whose object was the re-establishment of the ancient aristocracy , and the triumph of the patricians over the popular party , at first employed only the nobles and consular men ; but suddenly turning from the lightness of their affections , and the little dependence he could place upon them , he cast himself on the side of the people , and surrounded himself with obscure men . Napoleon followed an opposite road ; the result is known . Sylla was the most fortunate General , and Napoleon the greatest Captain that has yet appeared on the earth . Sylla , fatigued by his own tyranny , said to the Romans , " You , whom I have butchered like vile herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I am become one of you ! " He abdicated power ; Napoleon lost it ; and this single circumstance , altogether to the advantage of the Roman Dictator , re establishes a sort of equilibrium between two characters , whose inequality refuses any other parallel . Sylla terminated his life peacefully at Rome , in the midst of a generation whose fathers he had proscribed . Napoleon died a prisoner to the English , on a rock lost in the bosom of the ocean , where he himself marked out the space for his tomb . After having established on historical facts , and on the idea of Montesquien , the truth of the character of Sylla , which I have dared to produce on the French stage , will it be permitted me to reply to the criticisms , and I am bold enough to say to the eulogies , which have been passed upon this Tragedy , by a succinct exposition of a theory , in which , I believe , I have glanced at the solution of the great dramatic question , which at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human life : we ought there to find a faithful copy of the stage of the world . Why should this representation of life , with but one object in view , be considered in different parts of the world under such different aspects ? Man is the same in all latitudes ; but the portrait of him in society varies with the latitude , and you have only to pass a strait , a river , or a chain of mountains , to find a change in the Theatrical system . The causes of this variety are evidently in the genius of nations , in the greater or less degree of freedom of their institutions , in the degree of civilization which they had attained at the period of the establishment of their Theatre . With one , it is a hasty picture , and without the choice of the events of life , a perpetual shock of events and passions , which appears to constitute the dramatic art . Ask of him who dwells on the borders of the Thames , a definition of the bean ideal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , a rapid succession of tender situations , powerful , noble , or vulgar ; philosophical contrasts , resulting from the conflict of characters of every description , the caprices of fortune , the fantasies of the human heart . At the sight of this chaos , the inhabitant of the borders of the Seine smiles with contempt . His dramatic beauty is simple and regular ; an action , clear , unique , always growing : a skilful distribution of parts , a profound art in the conduct of the work , a progressive interest whose power combines so as to converge , ( if I may so express myself , ) to a single point , and to a single personage ; a sustained elegance , a style noble and chaste ; these are amongst the inseparable conditions of the beautiful in the dramatic art . Instructed at the school of the Corneilles , Molires , Voltaires , and Racines , I show , but do not measure the immense distance which separates them , in my view , from the adversaries which the English , the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Amongst a people instructed by the Greeks , the scenic art is naturally divided into three parts ; Manners , Intrigue , Character ; this classification , so simple , so just , is not less applicable to Tragedy than Comedy , and it is matter of astonishment that no Poet has thought of submitting them to this common division . The Comedy of Manners , are Turcaret , the Femmes sovantes the Prcieuses ridicules , the Philosophe sans le savoir , etc. etc . The Tragedy of Manners , are the Orphelin de la Chine , Bajazet , Britannicus , Alzire , in which Racine and Voltaire 's object was to paint the manners of the people with whom the action of their drama passed . The Mariage Figaro is the chef d'oeuvre of the Comedy of Intrigue ; the Tragedy of Intrigue has , for its unique model , the sublime enigma of Heraclius . Voltaire has warmed , with all the ardour of the passions , Zaire and Tancrede , which are only tragedies of intrigue , happily modified by a delicate portrait of manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions ; and the Tartufe and the Misanthrope , where the genius of Molire has surpassed the limits of his art , remain above all comparison . To seize an entire character ; to pluck , in the energetic language of Locke , the monster from his den ; to probe the human heart , to exhibit it in a single individual , under all its aspects , in its strength , in its weakness , in its pride , in its shame ; what a task ! and what glory for the man who knew how to accomplish it ! The Tragedy of Character is glanced at by Racine in the character of Nero , yet he offers under this resemblance , only an admirable sketch , in the midst of a composition of another order . The Mahomet of Voltaire might perhaps be considered as a Character , if in this admirable picture , historical truth had not sometimes been sacrificed to the high philosophical thought which reigns in this master-piece of the stage . The character of Augustus , in the Tragedy of Cinna , is more historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which this character is the pivot and not the cause , Corneille , who reserved only a single monologue for the development of this character , of necessity , could not search into it . Seduced by the idea that I have attempted a new path , indicated , however , by the three great masters of the stage , I have endeavoured to portray for the stage , one of the greatest characters that has astonished the world . If I ought to have believed that such an enterprise was beyond my strength , I entertain the hope that the public will duly estimate my efforts . Some licentious critics , resembling those Parisiens desheurs , of whom the Cardinal de Retz speaks , were much embarrassed by this piece . Some have called it romantic ; others found it too severe ; at one time they censure the weakness of the plot , which I could not render stronger , without injury to the development of the character of Sylla ; at another , they find it embarrassed , obscure ; on this head I have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to this reproach . In the uncertainty in which the difference , or rather the contradiction of the critics leaves me , I ought to admit that the public approbation has acquired more value in my eyes . I have been reproached with the innovations with which this piece is filled , and am sensible of the unfavourable idea attatched to this word ; I must bear all the blame of it . Hitherto , pathos and terror have been made to arise from the combat of the passions , from the fatality of events ; I have endeavoured to make them spring from the force of a single character , to open to the spectator the abysses of the human heart in an extraordinary man , and thence solely to draw the whole interest of my work . I have endeavoured to put in action the explanation which is always made in narrative . I have introduced to the levee of Sylla , Kings , Ambassadors , Clients of all ranks , who come in silence to pay their court to the Dictator . I have made the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have even dared to make it pronounce some of those words which , in every country of the world , escape simultaneously from the crowd . The scene of a tyrant 's dream , that of his abdication , are innovations , whose boldness the public has sufficiently welcomed , to encourage attempts of the same kind , for the benefit of an enchanting art , the genius of which has no fixed rules , but has no limits . In calling to mind , in this place , the success of a tragedy where so many things have been hazarded it is my duty to acknowledge the obligatious I am under to the performers at the first French Theatre , whose talents and zeal have so easily triumphed over the difficulty which this work presents in its execution . But the most decided element of favour , which the public has accorded to this tragedy , is the sublime playing of the actor , who does not represent , but resuscitates on the stage , the character of Sylla . It is rare to render entire justice to living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have limited their comparisons of him , to Lekain , to Garrick , to that illustrious Roscius whom I have introduced in my piece , and whom Mr. Damas represents with so much warmth and attractiveness . In placing Talma above all that the annals of the stage offer of the greatest , I believe I most faithfully interpret the public admiration in his behalf . He is not an actor ; he does not wear either the purple or diadem of the theatre ; he lives for two hours enery day in the life of the person whom he represents . It is Augustus , Hamiet , Nero , Sylla ; never was transformation more complete . He rejects all studied gesticulation , and geometrical attitudes  --  it is nature in all her simplicity , passion in all its transport , thought in all its recklessness , that he exposes to the eyes of an idolatrous public . He advances with a quiet step , his mantle negligently crossing his breast presents only a drapery after a severe taste ; his countenance is calm ; nevertheless , as he gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fixed attention ? He does not make a single gesture , he does not speak a word  --  he looks . He is seated , supports himself on his arm chair , his voice strong , quick , and deep , speaks oracles . By what marvellous faculty does this acctor render disdain terrible , irony frightful ? How does his burning eye appear at the same time , covetous of glory , of blood , and of repose ? By what delusion do we read in his face the ennui of power in a soul atrocious and fierce , the crafty combinations of the mightiest spirit , the daring of a warrior , and the fears of a timid child ? The profession of a player , which some have thought proper to despise , since it has become honourable , was for a long time exercised only by the lowest orders in Rome ; and yet this profession , in which are reckoned tumblers , mimics , and mountebanks of every species , gave to him , who distinguished himself by talent and conduct , all the consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls the most virtuous man of his time , was the idol of the Roman youth , one of the favorites of the Dictator . He used his credit only to temper , as much as possible , the horror of proscriptions , and to bring back at times to more humane sentiments , the inexorable soul of Sylla . What more beautiful character than that of a man celebrated by his talents and resources , with whom , the imitation of an ideal nature , and the expression of heroic virtues , are connected in their practice in real life ! By a singular coincidence , which can not have escaped my readers , Talma was like Roscius , the honourable friend of the most distinguished personages of his age , and lived in intimacy with the man who , during fourteen years , was the Dictator of Europe .

But on Tyber 's banks I found none other willing to be free . The Tribunes were become the Consuls ' rivals . Intrigue and bribery , bore the fasces off : All offices were venal ; and I found Insulting slaves , long saturnalia , Unpunish 'd crimes , degenerate hearts , Without a blush pursued their private ends . Our high-born nobles wore a soldier 's yoke , Who basely boasted he had put it on . I gave the Tribune , Marius , then my word , That some day he should reckon for his crimes . More than one , Victory had rais 'd his name : I turn 'd his glory pale by greater deeds , And saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank the gods .

Curtius , ambitious of unknown renown ; The victor , Cincinnatus , at his plough ; Camillus , saving Rome , ( the Gauls o'ercome ) ; The death of Decius , crowning his exploits ; Brutus , affecting an insensate life , Whilst he matur 'd the hardiest designs , And freedom , with Lucretia 's dagger arm 'd , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains ; And Scipio , your ancestor , who took On Carthage such severe revenge :  --  By these recitals every heart is mov 'd , Transported with me to the age of glory  --  Glows with the fires of a renewed life , And is regenerate .

The troops of Pompey are around the Forum , The oracle of Antium is consulted . Val . Valeria What fear ye Romans ? Is there one plague with which youv'e not been scourg 'd ? Oh , if your hearts would bind themselves to mine , This day should see the last of Sylla 's crimes . Are you fatigu 'd with dragging on your chains , Degrading in yourselves the Roman majesty ? I 'll lend my arm to cut the tyrant off ; When country perishes , then I must die . Yes , let your day of freedom be my last ; ' T was here , where I expect my husband soon , My brothers lately perish 'd in your cause . Envious of their fate , I owe to Rome , The generous remnant of Cornelia 's blood : If you will second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood shall flow , and here shall Sylla die . ( Faustus and Claudius advance , surrounded by Lictors , who force Lnas to a distance from Claudius , to whom he is approaching . ) Claud . Claudius ( to Val . ) Oh , cruel fortune ! All I hold dear are chained to my fate . Val . Valeria Why does my presence so afflict my love . When I could gaze on him till death should blind ? Faust . Faustus ( to Claud ) Behold this crowd , their eyes are fixed on us , From us expect a bright example now , And we can give it , can not we not my friend ? Claud . Claudius What , Faustus ! you partaker of my fate ? Faust . Faustus Have I done less that is deserving death ? Victim , like you , of a tyrannic law , I die with you when the republic dies . Certain of sharing it ; I bless your fate . Just at the instant when you would have struck , Your arm 's arrested , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips , On you , for having caus 'd his father 's death . Nature accuses friendship to my heart , We die together , and the crime 's aton 'd . Claud . Claudius You might have liv 'd , dear Faustus , liv 'd for Rome . Faust . Faustus I can not save  --  I give her up my life . Claud . Claudius Forgive the recollection which is mix 'd With glorious hope on this my day of death . ( To Valeria . ) Thou sovereign mistress of my fate ! oh Gods ! Valeria ! Val . Valeria Valeria is a Roman wife . Wife of Claudius , worthy of her sires . She who could firmly take your last adieu . Knows how like you with an unalter 'd mien To wait th ' inevitable touch of death . Claud . Claudius There 's shouting in the streets . Shouting heard . Enter Sylla , Metellus , Roscius , and suites , Soldiers , Lictors , Priests , Populace . People . People He comes ! he comes ! A group . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hail divine Sylla ! ( Sylla advances slowly in the midst of the crowd , ) Val . Valeria Oh , slavish baseness ! shameful sacrilege ! ( Darts forward to stab Sylla , is prevented by Roscius . ) Die , Tyrant ! Claud . Claudius Strike ! Faust . Faustus Hold ! ( making a movement to assist his father . ) Sylla . Sylla ( Coldly to his suite . ) Bear this woman back  --  for I am here To avenge the laws , the Romans , and the state . She would have none hereafter be like me . The greatest criminals require my justice . Claudius is one , my son is his accomplice . They have betray 'd the laws , and are henceforth United in the crime and penalty . I will not use my Dictatorial power ; The people shall pronounce their fate . Bal . Balbus Dost hear ? ( to Catiline . ) Cat . Catiline Fear nought from this his seeming lenity ; The people never yet have sav 'd their friends . Sylla . Sylla ( Ascends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribune ) Romans ! On this great day the world will ascertain If your Dictator has been worthy life ; And if the mighty works he this day crowns , Have made you worthy in your turn of him . Ros . Roscius What , ye great gods , can this high speech portend ? Cat . Catiline ( To Balbus . ) See what dark horror lowers on his brow ; Darting around a spirit-quelling glance , He picks his victim , marks him with his eyes . Met . Metellus Around the Forum , Sylla , all the tribes , At your command , are rang 'd by Curi . Sylla . Sylla ( Standing on the rostrum . ) Citizens , Knights , Pontiffs , Senators , And you , Illustrious defenders of our country , Hear : I owe it to you all , I owe it to myself , To render my account of sovereign power ; And to exhibit to your wondering eyes The mighty works which I alone conceiv 'd . Pontus , Epirus , Bosphorus ! wear the yoke : The streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is subject to our law ; And I have chas 'd from Lybiaevery king : The fall of Carthage gave a shock to Rome ! I have repair 'd the ills a great man wrought . Jugurtha 's conquer 'd , Mithridates yields : Fortune is bountiful beyond my hope . A warrior 's laurels were too pale for me ; I sought a glory , rarer , and more dear : Rome , made a prey to every party feud , Dying of wounds inflicted by her sons , Invok 'd at once my genius and my arm ; I made myself Dictator  --  sav 'd the state , Restor 'd the ancient senate to its power , Brought the rebellious people back to duty . I never have been known the rabble 's slave , Courting the people only to betray ; I 've flattered little , and made discord cease , Whilst Marius had no other end in view , I 've offer 'd victims for the common weal . Let what I 've done for Rome and liberty Be branded violence or cruelty ; Reproach like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood that I have spilt ; Yes  --  if I 've hush 'd the sound of Mercy 's voice , It was to make you bend before the laws . I know not what surname I 'll have in history ; Posterity will judge , what Rome examines . I 'm gall 'd by power , much more than you have been ; I come to break the yehat tires us all : I 've conquer 'd , reign 'd  --  and now I wish to live ! I spurn th ' intoxicating cup of power ; I 've rul 'd a subject world , silenc 'd all foes  --  Their hatred can not reach my memory : My glory is th ' abyss that they must pass . The Dictator is no more .  --  The Senate Takes the authority and reins of state . Hark ! Let my voice this spacious concave fill : I 've fearless govern 'd  --  abdicate unaw 'd ; I restore your Consuls . Choose them , Romans . ( Exit Metellus . ) The Dictatorship is call 'd my refuge ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here divest me of the sovereign power . I here depose the purple . ( Takes off the robe . ) Lictors , retire . Behold me now unarm 'd ! I put my life Into your hands , and to all plots oppose My genius Brutus ' virtue , Scipio 's soul , Cheronea , Orchomenus  --  the terror of my name . The Senate has my fortune and my glory ; Let Sylla in your memory ever live . I conquer 'd Marius , I surpass 'd him , too , And I have won the rank to which I rose . Romans , I break the knots of your obedience , But in your memories I guard my power , And that Dictatorship shall never die : Sylla , his fasces gone , is Sylla still . He descends the tribune . Ros . Roscius Until this hour he only was Rome 's master : The universe , to day , proclaims him a great man . Faust . Faustus My father , at your knees Sylla . Sylla I 've quitted power  --  Bal . Balbus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cat . Catiline ( To Balbus . ) I still have hope , for he has mark 'd the road : Perhaps , ere long , I 'll profit by the map . Sylla . Sylla This bloody struggle now must have an end . You are fatigu 'd with fearing , I with punishing . A citizen like you , obedient to the law , I haughtily abase my pride of fortune , And henceforth , all , reliev 'd from every fear , May come , complain , revenge themselves on me . Val . Valeria Frightful compound of virtue and of vice , You tame my hate , and break my courage down . I tremble , yet admire ; I blush with shame At thought of favours that have cost so much . The price  --  oblivion of your many crimes . ( drops the dagger . ) Claud . Claudius This is your only day of righteous power . Acquir 'd by magnanimity of soul . Met . Metellus ( Entering . ) Faustus and Claudius are the Consuls nam 'd By all the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great destiny , end a mighty work . I 've mark 'd my passage o'er this wondering world . Never tell it , Romans , to posterity , That Sylla made you free !  --  FINIS . End note : 1Kb
