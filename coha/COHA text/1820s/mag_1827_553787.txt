txt ART . V.-. - Some *6Iccount of the L*fr , Writings , and Speeches of William Pinkney . By HENRY WHEATON . New York . C. &amp; C. Carvill. 8vo. pp. 616 . MR WIIEAToN 's hook had been long enough before the public to have required , perhaps , a notice in our last number . We were the less anxious about the delay , however , as its interest is not of a transitory sort , but allied with a great and abiding name . That of Pinkney must attract a curiosity , as permaneat as the tradition of his eloquence , and as the juridical records in which * it so often and conspicuously recurs . Of a life so engrossed by strenuous intellectual labor , all students especially , in every department of knowledge , will he desirotis to know something . They will he curious to learn , whether these extensive conquests in the domain of professional learning were accomplished by irregular and abrupt incursions , or hy methodical and disciplined approaches ; what influence they cast on his temper and habits ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their connexion with genius . Many a doubting aspirer will seek , in the life of such a man , wherewithal to solve the question so often debated betwixt ease and glory , how far these trophies of learned fame are worth the cost of their acquisition . Readers of this description , and all , indeed , who love to observe conspicuous genius nearly and familiarly , complain that the present volume is by no means so abundant in those characteristic touches , from which we love to combine for ourselves the portrait of genius , as might have been expected from the celebrity of its subject , and his recent death . The life of the studious and the contemplative seldom furnishes , it is true , that variety of interest which arises out of one of action and business . But Mr Pinkney , they observed , was not merely a closet man . He was conspicuous , and the subject of // some obloquy , on the political theatre ; he was long engaged in negotiations full of expectation and interest , which brought him into contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he travelled in famous and classical countries ; and the results , too , of these advantages , and of his untiring application , were not read silently in books , but were heard in courts of justice , and in senates , where they may be supposed to have left vivid and various impressions on the auditors . Many anecdotes , they think , illustrative of the character formed , and of opinions gathered , during this busy course of action , must be floating among his contemporaries , which , had they been more industriously sought by his biographer , would have relieved the dry and documentary air of his book . All this is very specious , but we are not sure that it is entirely just . The circumstance , that Mr Pinkucy resided so long abroad , removed him from among his contemporaries at home ; and his habits of life and thought were such , when in this country , as to bring him scarcely more under their close observation . But , besides this , who would think to measure the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been played by its hero ? A Reynolds in this respect surpasses a Hume . Even where the theatre is the same , the parts equally sei*iovs and important , and the personages inseparably connected in the eyes of mankind , a Pitt shall leave scarce any traces of himself , but those which are engraved by the pen of history , while a Napoleon shall bequeath us the most ample and interesting of all the memoirs of men . Some accident of circumstance , hut more often of character , determines this point beyond the control of the most gifted biographer . The title of Mr Wheaton 's work is very unpretending . The work itself presents us , however , with some interesting fragments of the correspondence , writin s , aud speeches of a very remarkable man ; and it is as wise , perhaps , to thank him for having collected and preserved what might otherwise have perished , as to amuse ourselves with disquisitions on what he might have done . We shall proceed therefore , from our author 's volume and from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some brief notices of the character of this celebrated jurist , in connexion with a hasty sketch of the principal events of his life . William Pinkney was born at Annapolis , in Maryland , on the // mind , was an Englishman by birth , and took the part of the parent country during the revolution . The boyish ardor , or wilfulness , of young Pinkney was pleased with the adoption of opposite sentiments ; and one of the freaks of his patriotism was to escape from the vigilance of his parent , and mount night guard with the soldiers at the fort in Annapolis . He retained , to the end of his life , a strong partiality for his native town , and took a pleasure in pointing out to his intimates , especially the young , the scenes of his childsh toils and sports . His early education was imperfect ; but this was less owiiig to the narrow circumstances of his fattier , who spared no pains for his son , than to the disturbed state of the times . His private teacher , Brathand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affection , which his pupil always continued to entertain for him , was warmly reciprocated by the preceptor , who , after the lapse of several years , expressed the greatest pleasure at meeting in England an acquaintance of Pinkney 's , and was eager in his inquiries about him ; one of my greatest regrets , ' said he , in leaving America , was that I had to part from my promising pupil . ' They , who remember him at this period of life , describe him as already animated by that impatience of a superior , which characterized him at a later day , and which was , in some sort , both the strent*th and the weakness of his character . This temper was not confined to the rivalries of study , but extended to the rougher competitions of boyhood . One anecdote of the former he used to relate of himself , as a ruse which might be pardoned in a youth . There was a debating club in the town , of which Piuikney was a member . A question had been assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the place was expected to attend ; and our orator repaired early one morning to a secluded place in the vicinity , to prepare himself in solitude , against the coming occasion . His antagonist in the debate , who was also his chief competitor in the club , was there , however , before him ; and our young aspirer took the benefit of some friendly skreen to overhear his declamation unobserved . The result , ' said he , was brilliant . In the evening my antagonist 's speech , which was well enough seasoned with rhetoric , was received with acclamation . But when I came to make my extempore reply , which I had very earnestly prepared during the day , I was at home , as yon may guess , on every point . The night was mine , and thenceforth I was king of the club . ' It was a like display of rare talents in another society of the // same kind , which determined him to seek his fortune at the bar ; and , like Chancellor King , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted to the notice and friendship of discernmg genius , for this fortunate change in his views . At the time we speak of , he was a student of physic under Doctor Goodwin , then an extensive practitioner in Baltimore , and was one of a small debating society of students of medicine , at one of whose meetings the late Judge Chase of Maryland happened to be present . Struck with the genius , the musical voice , and the energetic manner of Pinkney , as yet a mere lad , and quite unknown to him , he earnestly advised him to the study of law , inviting him to Annapolis , and offering him the free use of his library , and whatever other aid he could afford him . Under this not least distinguished of the eminent lawyers who have been the boast of Maryland , Pinkney was deeply imbued with the learning of the realty , ' and in special pleading , that logic of the law , of which he afterwards became a master ; and in 1786 he removed to Harford county , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his profession . From this time he rose rapidly in public confidence and honors . He was chosen in 1788 a delegate from Harford to the state convention , which ratified the constilution of the United States ; and , in the October of the same year , a member of the house of delegates . In 1790 he was elected to Congress ; a station , which for professional reasons he declined ; and he was several years a member of the executive council of Maryland . He was afterwards a delegate from Anne Arundel county , having removed to Annapolis , the county town , in 1792 . He had married in 1789 , the sister of Commodore Rodgers , a lady who still survives him . His professional assiduity continued , meantime , unabated ; and while he held a distinguished rank in the councils of his native state , he rose gradually to the head of its bar . In his dress and personal habits , at this time , he was very wide of that niceness and minute precision , which , on his return from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He indulged freely in the use of the sovereign weed , ' and cultivated his popularity by mingling carelessly with his rustic constituents . At a later day he was very far from admitting society on the same easy terms , and punctiliously affected all the outward observances , which he conceived to belong to the manners of a gentleman , and to denote a perfect knowledge of high breeding . // In 1796 he received a flattering evidence of the public sentiment in his favor , in an unsolicited appointment by Washington , as one of the commissioners for the United States , under the seventh article of Jay 's Treaty with Great Britain . He accepted this appointment , hut not without reluctance , and embarked for London with his family , where he arrived in July of the same year . In the questions , which arose in the adjustment of the claims under this article of the treaty , his opinions , ' says his biographer , were finished models of judicial eloquence , uniting powerful and comprehensive argument with a copious , pure , and energetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr Wheaton 's work . He was engaged at the same time , in adjusting the claim of the state of Maryland , to certain stock in the Bank of England , of which he succeeded in making a satisfactory arrangement . Of his observations on this new theatre , and at a period , too , of great political interest , we find little in the fragments of correspondence collected in the present volume . The extent and perfection of the arts of life , the active industry and splendid wealth , which he found in England , produced on him the usual impression . 1 have seen much , ' he says , that deserves the atteiition of him , who would be wise or happy . ' He was pressent at the debate in the House of Commons on the rejection of Bonaparte 's overtures for peace in 1800 , and often mentioned Mr Pitt 's speech on that occasion , as the most powerful and eloquent he had ever heard . Of that energetic politician he always spoke as the greatest man he had ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much overrated . But he doubted the power of the allies to force the ancient dynasty on France ; an event , which , though eventually accomplished , was postponed so long , and with such important effects on the condition of Europe , as to justify his doubt , and to beget suspicion of the policy of the memorable statesman , who led the combined force of Europe to the attempt . His strong inclination to his professional pursuits , rendered Mr Pinkney very impatient of the delays of the commission , and anxious to return home ; but his wishes in this respect were not gratified till August 1804 , when he arrived in America , improved , indeed , in knowledge , but embarrassed in circumstances , and with the ' dreary prospect , ' to use his own words , of commencing the world at forty . ' Shortly after his return , he removed to Baltimore , and attended , for the first time , the Supreme Court of the United States at Washington . In // 1805 he was appointed attorney general of Maryland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , with unwearied assiduity , till the growing differences of this country with Great Britain , on the subjec.t of neutral trade , brought him again on the theatre of diplomacy . In April , 1806 , he was appointed , by Mr Jefferson , Minister Extraordinary to the court of St James , to arrange , if possible , in conjunction with Mr Monroe , the resident minister there , the many important questions then at issue between the two cabinets , or , we should rather say , the two countries , as the interest , which they excited on both sides of the water , was diffused and violent in the highest degree . The progress , and unfriendly issue of this memorable negotiation , are familiar to most of our readers . That Mr Pinkney shared , in its full extent , the solicitude which was felt in this country , is discernible in the tone of his correspondence , and might be inferred from the perplexing circumstances , in which both the government of the United States , and its agents in France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two powers . At this day , when we perceive that a war under such a conjuncture was inevitable , and have gathered from it so many fortunate results to public rights and national reputation , it is perhaps to be regretted that our disputes were not sooner referred to the arbitrement of arms . Many circumstances however , some of which it is not very pleasant to recall , led our maritime enemy into mistakes , both as to the spirit and strength of this country , and no doubt deferred the step which we took in the end . Had it not been for these circumstances , the instructions to our ministers at St James 's would have been less conciliatory , for taking the tone of which , in his communications with that cabinet , Mr Pinkney has been sometimes accused of want of firmness and decision . To this subject Mr Madison alludes , in a passage of their correspondence quoted in the work ; from which it may be gathered , also , that neither was insensible to the dissatisfaction , which was felt at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile our niggard frugality towards our foreign embassies , was adding pecuniary embarrassment to the other cares of his weary and respot*tsible post . His youthful earnings were dissipated , while the prime of his life was passing away in barren toil and anxiety . ' It is thus that he writes to Mr Madison ; and he adds , in another letter , the compensation ( as it is oddly called ) , allotted by the government to the maintenance of its representatives // abroad , is a pittance which no economy , however rigid , or even mean , can render adequate . ' Under these circumstances he solicited his recall ; and took his audience of leave at Carlton House , in February , 1811 , expressing the regret , which he probably felt with some acuteness , that his efforts to effect a good understanding between the two countries , had proved so unavailing . He arrived at Annapolis the following June , and war was declared a year afterwards . From this period commer*es the most brilliant part of Mr Pinkney 's career , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to his particular endowments of mind . Having availed himself , with singular diligence , of the opportunity which his residence in England afforded him , to become familiar with the forms and practice of its courts , and having consecrated to his favorite study all the leisure , which he could steal from less congenial employments , he returned to our courts fraught with all the resources which , experience , reflection , and intimate converse with the most eminent lawyers and civilians of the time , may be supposed to have added to a vigorous and fertile genius . In the progress of our maritime war , many interesting questions of public law gave scope to his learning and ability ; and the aid that he contributed to the erection of the system of Prize Law , which , in the absence of precedent , the Supreme Court was under the necessity of building up , is prominent in the judicial records of the times . In the December succeeding his return , be was appointed , by Mr Madison , Attorney General of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bill having been introduced into the House of Representatives , requiring the residence of that officer at the seat of government , he resigned his office as incompatible , under such a restriction , with his other engagements . He had previously been chosen to the Senate of Maryland , and in 1815 he was elected from Baltimore , as its Representative in Congress . During our short but harassing war with Great Britain , he commanded a battalion of militia riflemen , and was severely wounded at the affair of Bladensburg . In March , 1816 , he was once more called to a diplomatic station , being appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia , and charged also with a special mission to Naples , at which city he landed in July , 1816 . The business of this mission was completely evaded by the artifices of the Neapolitan court , who hastened his departure by pretences , which they had no difficulty // to lay aside when he was fairly out of Naples . He proceeded through Rome , and the other principal Italian cities , to Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor of Russia , from the arrest of Kosloff , the Russian consul general in this country , in consequence of which Mr Harris , our Charge d'Affaires at St Petersburg , had been forbidden to appear at court ; and Mr Pinkney doubted the propriety , under such circumstances , of presenting himself in Russia as the American minister . But learning at Vienna , that this affair had been arranged , he proceeded , by a long and comfortless winter journey , through Poland to St Petersburg . He remained there about two years , and returned finally to the United States in 1818. in 1820 he was elected a senator in Congress from Maryland , in which post he delivered his celebrated speech on the Missouri Question , and took part in the preliminary discussions on the Bankrupt Bill . Neither had years nor travel diminished the ardor of his professional pursuits . On the contrary , he continued them , if possible , wi$still greater eagerness , endeavoring , he said , to compensate for the little of life that was left him , by economizing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for his family contributed , as much as his unquenchable love of reputation . But death surprised the champion in his vigor . It is well known that he spared no toil in the study and management of his causes . On the seventeenth of February , 1822 , he was attacked by a severe indisposition , in consequence of an effort of this sort . He had over exerted himself in the investigation and arguing of a case in the Supreme Court , in which he felt peculiar interest . He mentioned to a friend that he had sat up very late in the night on which he was taken ill , l*o read the Pirates , which was then just published , and made many remarks respecting it , drawing comparisons between the two heroines , and criticising the narrative and style with his usual , confident and decided tone , and in a way which showed that his imagination had been a good deal excited by the perusal . From this period till his death he was * considerable part of the time in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverted to his favorite studies and pursuits , on which , whenever the temporary suspension of his bodily sufferings enabled him , he conversed with great freedom and animation . Lie seems , however , to have anticipate ( l that his ilness must have a fatal termination , and to have awaited the // event with patient fortitude . After a course of the most acute suffering he breathed his last on the night of the twentyfifth of February . ' pp. 171-172 . Thus terminated the life of William Pinkney , a life so shared between public business and studious labor , that the hasty sketch which we have given , comprises nealy all its prominent inci* dents . At his death he had not quite completed his flftyeighth year , an age at which men begin to reg*ird the termination of life , as an object hot very remote . But his person was yet robust , his complexion florid , and his general appearance such , aided as it was by the stndied carefulness of his toilet , as to give a strong impression of vigorous health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , which were not only unimpaired , but seemed only then to have attained full ripeness ; the brilliancy of a career in which , though so long a victor , he was every day winning fresh laurels by fresh exertions ; the very keenness of his relish for these gathered fruits of*his fame , and for the eharms of a life eminently successful ; all these , as they appeared to promise a long postponement of the common fate , rendered it more affecting to the imagination , when it thus suddenly arrived . Apparently , however , he did not himself regard the seeds of his fate as so fat ' from their developement . His sanguine temperament , and plethorie habit of body , led him to apprehend a sudden decay of life , or , at least , of his faculties ; and he has been heard to speak of the fate of the celebrated Luther Martin in this particular , as not unlikely to be his own . He was spared , however , this worst of the maladies of age . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the receding tide of life , but seemed to rush to the termination of his course , as the busy torrent dashes onxvard to the sea . His death produced , both in the metropolis and through the country , a deep arid remarkable sensation . We call it remarkable , because it is seldom that mere professional renown , disconnected as it is from popular passion , obtains for itself , in so gre at a degree , this last and melancholy reward of genius . Nor can we impute it , certainly , even in the case of the remarkable individual in question , though he had rendered distinguished services at the bar , in the senate , and in diplomacy , to any fear that the business of either would suffer a pause from his death . The theatre of busy life never wants actors , and few are they , who may flatter themselves , that their exit will produce either // disorder or vacancy in the scene . These losses of society , however grief or flattery may declaim on such occasions , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Giber talents , till then crowded from the stage , or unkindled by reward , press forward in the ever eager competition ; and we daily sce the tomb close on virtue and genius , with as little perceptible effect on the great social machine , as on the sun and tbe breeze , which are feigned in the elegy of poets to darken , and siTh over their decay . It is a very few master spirits , that have the fortune to xveave the destinies of their race with their own , and to derange or suspend the business of life by their fall . We must re1*r , then , to a more poetical source , our emotion on the death of one of these intellectual heroes . Perhaps the harsh contrasts , always suggested by death , are heightened by oar conception of the mental power and activity which belong to genius . We contemplate with pain the extinction of this subtle spirit , the defeat of its eager aspirations , its insensibility to its slow won honors , this sudden and wasteful dissipation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounding in the hasty close of a career characterized , like Mr Pinkucy 's , by such untiring energy to the last , and animated by the consenting applauses of partisans and competitors . He seemed to be cut off in medjo *patio , while men yet looked for other triumphs , and ere he had reached , in his fervid course , the regular and appointed goal . Few men ever earned these garlands of the tomb , ' by a more inflexible l ) ursuit of them through a whole life . In him the zeal of reputation was not one of many impulses obeyed by turns , and exciting him at intervals to unusual exertions* it was , as we believe it almost always has been in those who have *ar outgone their fellows , ever present and predominant , urging him , even more than that appetite of knowledge which grows by what it feeds on , to tbe perpetual accumulation of his intellectual stores . His emulation was infinite . I never heard him allow , ' said a friend of his , that any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in music , in drawing ; especially *n oratory , on which his great ambition rested . ' As this ea*cr ambition thrust him early into the career of action , so it never seemed in any degree abated by success . it was the pabulum of his life ; and , as if to verify a notion of medicine , the stinmulant itself at length brought the decay- of the spirit , xx hich it had fed and vivified ; for he sickened in the act of emulous exertion. // In this respect , his whole life is a lesson to those ambitious spirits , that , like him , are consumed with the fever of renown , ' nd that would learn by what efforts continually repeated , by what earnest and fervent toil , the abrupt summits of fame , and more emphatically of legal fame , are overcome . While in England , and indeed during all his residence abroad , Mr Piukney applied himself indefatigably to law studies . He seems to have appreciated justly his own mind , and , though diverted from the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to it constantly , as to the proper theatre of his particular abilities . Of his acquisitions in the vast and various field of professional learning , it would be idle in us to speak . But it will not be uninteresting to mention , that the wealth of his mind was never so unosteutatiously displayed , as in those unpremeditated disquisitions , which , as amrcus curiw , or in the progress of a cause , he was frequently called on to make . It was remarkable to observe at such times , how his knowledge seemed to have passed out of his memory into his judgment ; ' in what abundance he heaped his analogies before you ; and with what a precise logic he made them converge on his point . With all these previous accumulations of knowledge , he approached every new cause with the ardor of one , who had yet his reputation to earn . He was never satisfied , ' says his biographer , with exploring its facts , and all the technical learning which it involved . ' Nor was he inattentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fictitious works with which he amused his leisure , or , to speak more justly , recreated his mind for new efforts , any allusion or image that could be turned to account . Towards the end of his life , he devoted himself almost wholly to intellectual exertion of some kind . Thought , ' to borrow the phrase of one who knew him well , appeared to be the very breath of his mind . ' Study was necessary to his spirit , and so far from laborious , that when not engaged in it , or in some active corporeal exercise , he evinced very restless and uneasy feelings . On journeys , he read constantly in his carriage , and even studied his causes there . A life thus wholly dedicate to closeness , and the bettering of his mind , ' did not require that methodical distribution , which inferior minds resort to , as a substitute for the power of constant application ; nor did his various engagements permit it . His hours of study varied with his circumstances ; but they increased progressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a light in his chamber : ; . // and might be heard stirring there at the earliest dawn , often retiring to bed again after several hours ' reading . lie ate rapidly , drank wine freely at his meals , but never sat long at table , except on special occasions ; and could retire at all times to his study with a mind disposed to severe labor . His general attainments were very considerable , and he was ambitious of showing , that he had wandered wide of the severe limits of techaical learning . He knew well the Latin classics , and had been flimiliar with the Greek ; but the latter we are disposed to think , he neglected in later life . Of French literaturn his knowledge was extensive . He was especially well versed in ancient and modern history , and in the belles lettres generally . Out of the natural sciences , in which it is believed his attainments were inconsiderable , he seemed to have read all th' standard works of our language ; and most of this miscellaneous learning he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few . Johnson , if he had a preference , was his favorite prose writer , chiefly , perhaps , because he thought his elaborate and elevated style a proper model for an orator ; and Shakspeare , Pope , and Milton were his chosen poets . In the copy of the last in the possession of his family , all the remarkable passages are underlined ; and he quoted them with readiness from memory . Comus be distinguished as the best sustained of English poems , in the elegant and curious felicity* of its diction , and was fond of reciting aloud the passages , which he thought most remarkable for harmony or sonorousness . He piqued himself on knowin critically the elegancies of his own tongue ; and , though he probably overrated his taste , his knowledge on this point was minute . His table was gencrally furnished with half a dozen works on prosody , and as many dictionaries ; and he had a fancy for coining new words , or reviving obsolete ones , and then defending them by analogy , or by the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may call it , which he sometimes displayed at the bar , to the annoyance of his less literate brethren , he has left a somewhat diverting record . tt is a copy of a bulky dictionary published some years ago in this country , all grievously underscored , and full of marginal remarks , petitions , and interrogatories addressed to the author , written with playful spleen , and craving to know the reason of the multifarious impurities which he had cast into the well of English undefiled . ' He possessed , in an eminent degree , that robustness of constitution , // which is hardly less necessary in study , than Napoleon deemed ii in war . On this point he displayed some vanity , and was very solicitous of personal nicety , on the score both of health and ap*earance . His recreations were mostly of the same robust so*t ; he was attached to field sports , and excelled in them ; and , though lie seemed almost indefatigable , generally returned from his sportIng excursions overcome with fatigue . But as he was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ill . At such times he diverted himself with games of skill , in wWch he was a proflelent , such as chess , ( Iraughts , and the like . lie was once quite a capital billiard player , and seldom met his equal in whist . In England lie amuseU himself very much with his children , mixing occasionally in their most childish sports . He used there to draw , for one of his sons , almost every night , and , what perhaps few persons know , be handled the pencil like a master . He assisted , moreover , in teaching one of his daughters niusic , to which task he brought a good deal of skill , and an admirable ear . He was fond of the best novels , and , by way of mental dissipation , sometimes liked to hear the worst ; and when exhausted in mind , or depressed in spirits , would listen to any trash , romances from the Minerva press , French novels , and fairy tales . We have frequently seen him at the theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he could be entertained only by their absurdity ; and next day he would amuse himself with writing a Critique on the performance . The company of young persons , especially those of talent , was very attractive to him ; and when occasion presented itself , he was pleased to do them any service . When they were assembled at his house , he would saunter from his study to the adjoining parlor , mingle in the topic or the jest of the moment , and then return . This he would repeat a dozen times in an evening . The reader perhaps may be pleased to compare these recollections of his private pursuits and habits , with those from another source . The foHowing passage is from a letter written hy a friend of his biographer , who was a good deal in his society at St Petersburg . I arrived in St Petersburg in the month of June , 1817 . I cairied a letter of introduction to Mr Piukucy from our friend , Mr Justice Story . Mr P. received me at once with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time I saw him , that lie should not make a single dinner for me , or receive me with ceremony ; but if I would consider myself a member of // his family , and take a scat at his table constantly , when not otherxvise engaged , he should be gra*ifred . As I 500fl foun ( l he was in earnest , I accepted his offer almost to its full extent . I passed about two months in the city , lod*ing at the same hotel with him , and domesticated with his family . I saw him every day , and at almost every meal ; and the recollections 1 have of the pleasure enjoyed in his society , are amongst those I shall lon test retain . Of his past life he did not speak much . I inferred , however , that he had always been a hard stu1ent , and considered himself a laborious and thorough scholar in those branches of human knowledge to which he had more particularly devoted himself I remember that he once said to rae , that he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in America who had thoroughly studied and understood Coke Littleton . He appeared to estimate the legal acqilirements of our professional men as of little extent , generally speaking , arid to think he gave himself but little credit in thinking that he had learnt more law than any other man in the country . He kept himself very much in private , living so ( as he said ) from motives of econoc*y. tie was in lod*in gs at the Hotel de l'Europe , and saw no company ceremoniously-that is , he gave no dinners , &amp;c . He had made it known to the diplomatic circle there when he first arrived , that he should live in that style , and therefore could not recil ) rocate their civilities . They , however , visited him a good deal , and he accepted their invitations frequently . I understood from various quarters , arid inferred from what I saw , that he stood very particularly well with the Emperor , his family , and l ) rincipal ministers . his l ) ersonai habits were very peculiar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , were carried to an extreme , which exposed him while at home to the charge of foppery and affectation . But it should be remembered how large a portion of his life he had spent abroad , and in the highest circles of European society . Though he undoubtedly piqued himself upon being a finished and elegant gentleman , yet his manners and habits of dress were , as it always seemed to me , acquired in Europe ; and so far from being remarkable there , they were in exact accordance with the common and established usages of men of his rank and station . All who havebeen at any of the European courts know that their statesmen and ministers consider it a necessary part of their character to pay great attention to the clegancies and refinements of life and after a day passed iii the laborious discharge of th ir duties , will spend their evenings in society , and contribute quite theft share of pleasant trifiin*. it is their mani*re d'ctie , Ii // During the summer that I passed with Mr Pinkney , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he retired to his study , and we saw him no more until dinner at six o'clock . The evenin. * he passe ( l with his family , or in visiting , lie took very little exercise , eat and drank freely , and I thought suffered occasionally from the usual effects of a plethoric habit , with much indulrence as to food , and no attention to exercise . Undoubtedly his extreme attention to personal cleanliness contributed much to preserve his health . His family saw little company at home or abroad ; he appeared to be extrernely fond of them , and satisfied with passing his evenings in their society . ' pp. 157 ,  --  158 . It might be inferred from his fondness for history , that he was a eur*oi* traveller , especially in the classical region of Italy . He spoaks , in a conversation quoted by Mr Wheaton , of his desire to visit that classic land , and of the feelings with which he should set foot on its shores . ' His enthusiasm , however , was very moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but eight days in Rome , an ( l exhibited , we are told , nothing more than a decorous curiosity . He had an interview with the Pope , and was treated by him with rent distinction . He was not much addicted to discourse on the character of the countries he passed through , or make comparisons between them , thinking , perhaps , as those who see the most are often apt to think , that their essential differences are small . Of company he saw much more , both in England and Russia , than in his own country , perhaps from the nature of his station at their courts , and the weight of his avocations at home ; but more probably from a ly , acdjnire ( l by long residence in it . preference of foreign socie He has sketched some of the members of the ruling family of Russia , in the following letter to his daughter , Mrs Williams . The Empress Mother is still a charming woman , and when young must have been extremely handsome . She may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is fit that she should . Her manners are infinitely pleasing , at the same time that they are lofty ; and she is a perfect mistress of the arts of conversatiomi . She is , moreover , exemplary in all the relations of life , and is beloved for her goodness by all classes . Of the reigning Empress it is impossible to speak in adequate terms of praise . It is necessary to see her to be able to comprehend how wonderfully interesting she is . It is no exaggeration to say , that with a slight abatement for the effects of time and severe affliction ( produced by the loss of her children ) , she // combines every charm that contributes to female loveliness , with all the qualities that peculiarly become her exalted station . Her figure , although thin , is exquisitely fine . Her countenance is a subduing picture of feeling and intelligence . her voice is of that soft and happy tone that goes directly to the heart , and awakens every sentiment which a virtuous woman can be ambitious to excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is graceful , unaffectedly gentle , winning , and at the same time truly dignified . Her conversation is suited to this noble exterior . Adapted with nice discrimination to those to whom it is addressed , unostentatious and easy , sensible and kind , it captivates invariably the wise and good , and ( what is yet more difficult ) satisfies the frivojous without the slightest approach to frivolity . If universal rel ) ort may be credited , there is no virtue for which this incomparable woman is not distinguished ; and I have reason to be confident from all that I have observed and heard , that her understanding ( naturally of the highest order ) has been embellished and informed to an uncommon degree by judicious , and regular , and various study . it is not , therefore , surprising that she is alike adored by the inhabitant of the palace and the cottage , and that every Russian looks up to her as to a superior being . She is , indeed , a superior being , and would be adored , although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 155 , 156 . The ensuing sketch of Mr Pinkney 's person is , with some other particulars , from the hand of a gentleman , who , during a few years preceding his death , was on a footing of intimacy with him . In frame Mr Pinkney was robust , square shouldered , and firm set . His complexion was clear and florid , disclosing the smaller veins under the skin . His face full , his eye of a ( lead blue , variable iu its expression , and quickly lighted up by excitement . His nose was small , turning a little upward ; the eyebrow thinly clothed , and forming a marked protuberance , which was very conspicuous in his profile . His forehead was low and retreating ; his lips thin , the corners of his mouth pointing downward a very little ; his chin small . His head was oval , thinly covered with short brown hair of a silky texture ; it was flattened on each side , arid showed his ears in high relief ; in that , and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembling the head of La Fayette . Although the habitual expression of his face was mirthful , it was deeply furrowed with the lines of thought . Under his eyes hung heavy circles , and his cheeks were defined by strong boundaries passing from // each nostril . These two were the predominant characteristic . of his countenance . His carriage was more than erect ; it might be called perpendicular . His action and gesture , emphatic at all times , seemed to bear defiance as if by habit , and to denote a temperament almost incapable of fatigue . He was always on his feet , even in his study , and his walk was firm and elastic . Sickness scarcely deprived him of this quality . his ardor was irrepressible , and nature seeu ) ed to have given him personal vigor , correspondent to the aspirations of his mind . He took the utmost pains with his dress , and encouraged the same particularity in this respect , among his young friends . His toilet was seldom made less than twice in the day ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havin6 adopted that style , I suppose , which he thought best adapted to show off 1115 1 son . As he carried his head high , his cravat was adjusted to that position . He constant1 ) 7 wore a white vest , huttoned up to the chin with gilt buttons ; a blue frock and black stock in the morning , a la militaire , a style that he seemed to be fond of ; but he appeared generally in the evening nearly in full dress , his garments adjusted almost to constraint , though they suhjected him , apparently , to no inconvenience . In short , his exterior was that of a man of leisure and fashion , and seemed to show the training of high and formal company . It was after the English school , with its regulated movement , disciplined patience , and , to my taste , ungraceful constriction . Of his genius , whether in diplomacy or in the forum , the estimate has , we believe , been very correctly made hy the public . Such as are curious to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allied with such force of mind , may carry a man in a particular science , will regret , perhaps , that he ever wandered beyond the rugged tracts of his profession ; while others may lament , that so happy a genius should l1ave been expended on a kind of learning wholly technical , and which , being therefore remote from vulgar apprehension , neither allows the uninitiated to estimate the acumen it requires , nor enriches the mind proportionably to the toil of acquisition . We shall not inquire , whether the laborers in the mine of the law , are rewarded lbr their expense of toil in skill , nor whether we are to assi n it a first rank among sciences which humanize the mind . Be this as it may , Mr Pinkney seemed horn for his profession ; and he would probably have made the pyramid of his re // flown ' yet broader and higher , had he never been tempted aside from his task by less congenial pursuits . In diplomatic ability , so far as it is constituted by a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions arising on it , and skill to disentangle their complexities , be did not fall short of any of the great names opposed to him . That he failed in address , is likely enough from the general turn of his character , especially a tincture of personal vanity , which , while it gave to more adroit negotiators an assailable point , would not permit him to suspect that he could be deceived or circumvented . rrhence , even a cunning Neapolitan diplomatist might be an overmatch for him . No diplomatic position could be imagined , however , more embarrassing and vexatious , than the precise one he was placed in at St James 's . TWO colossal belligerents mutually encroaching on the rights of a neutral , whose true place in the political scale was not yet understood , its own government hardly prepared for the last resort , and the nation itself distracted by two fierce parties ; these were circumstances in which the most consummate adroitness might have failed to unite all suifrages in its favor . As a statesman his views were sound ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points connected with his professional studies . But , ' as his biographer remarks , in tracing the principal outlines of his public character , his professional talents and attainments must necessarily occupy the most prominent place . To extraordinary natural endowments , Mr Pinkney added deep and various knowledge in his profession . A long course of study and practice had familiarized his mind with the science of jurisprudence . His intellectual powers were most conspicuous in the investigations connected with that science . He had felt himself originally attracted to it by invincible inclination ; it was his principal pursuit in life ; and he never entirely lost sight of it in his occasional deviations into other pursuits and employments . The lures of political ambition and the blandishments of polished society , or perhaps a vague desire of universal acomplishment and general applause , might sometimes tempt him to stray for a season from the path which the original beat of his genius had assigned him . But he always returned with fresh ardor and new delight to his appropriate vocation , lie was devoted to the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuits , so far as they had a serious object , were valued chiefly as they might minister to this idol of his affections . It was in his profession that he found himself at home ; in this // consisted his pride and his pleasure ; for as he said , " the bar is not the place to acquire or preserve a false and fraudulent reputation for talents . " And on that theatre he felt conscious of possessing those powers which would command success . ' This entire devotion to his professional pursuits was continued with unrem'itfmg perseverance to t'he end of his career . if the celebraLd Denys Talon could say of the still more celebrated D'Anguesseau , on hearing his first speech at the bar , " that he would willingly END as that young man COMMENCED , " every youthful aspirant to forensic fame among us might wish to begin his professional exertions with the same love of labor , and the same ardent desire of distinction which marked the efforts of William Pinkney tiiroughout his life . ' The editor well remembers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court , remonstrating with him upon the necessity of his refraining from such laborious exertions in the actual state of his health , and with what vehemence he replied , that he did not desire to live a nzoinent after the standing he had acquired at the bar was lost , or even brought into doubt or question . What might not be expected from professional emulation directed by such an ardent spirit and such singleness of purpose even if sustained by far inferior abilities ! But no abilities , however splendid , can command success at the bar without intense laior and persevering application . It was this which secured to Mr Pinkney the most extensive and lucrative practice ever acquired by any American lawyer , arid which raisedhim to such an enviable height of l ) professional eminence . For many years he was the acknowledged leader of the bar in his native State ; and during the last ten years of his life , the principal period of his attendance in the Supreme Court of the nation , he enjoyed the reputation of having been rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon legal subjects . This was the faculty which most remarkably distinguished him . His mind was acute and subtle , and at the same time comprehensive in its grasp , rapid and clear in its conceptions , and singularly felicitous in the exposition of the truths it was employed in investigating . ' Of the extent and solidity of his legal attainments , it would be difficult to speak in adequate terms , without the appearance of exaggeration . He was profoundly versed in the ancient learning of the common law ; its technical peculiarities and feudal origimi . Its subtle distinctions and artificial logic were familiar to his early studies , and enabled him to expound with admirable force and perspicuity the rules of real property . lIe was familiar with every branch of comumercial law ; and superadded , at a later period of // his life , to his other legal attainments , an extensive acquaintance with the principles of international law , and the practice of the Prize Courts . In his legal studies he preferred the original text writers and reporters , ( * fontibus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary treatises , which Lend so many convenient helps and facilities to the modern lawyer , but which he considered as adapted to form sciolists , and to encourage indo .. lence and superficial habits of investigation . His favorite law book was the Coke Littleton , which he had read many times . Its principal texts he had treasured up in his memory , and his argumeats at the bar abounded with perpetual recurrences to the prmciples and analogies drawn from this rich mine of common law learning . ' pp. 176 , 183 . He was , indeed , a wonderful legal logician . As an orator it is a more delicate task to estimate his pretensions . On this point he was eminently ambitious ; the more so , perhaps , as he might consider it less certain . In the parliament and courts of Great Britain , the last then adorned by Sir William Scott and Lord Erskine , he found a style of oratory more classical and embellished than was usual at the bar of America ; and , if we may trust tradition , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease of his natural rhetoric . Mr Wheaton tells us , that he always continued to declaim in private , and that it was his habit to premeditate , not only the general order of his speeches , and the topics of illustration , but the rhetorical embellishments ; which last he sometimes wrote out beforehand . We have been informed by one well acquainted with his habits , that he seldom or never wrote any part of his speeches . But the discrepancy may be reconciled by remembering , that the premeditated compositions of so trained a mind would be little the less perfect , in not being committed to paper . But , though his law papers might have been drawn up with much care , ' and might have exhausted the subjects committed to his consideration , ' it does not appear that they , or any of his written productions , cost him much effort . On the contrary he composed with great rapidity , writing his letters , diplomatic papers and opinions extremely fast , and with so heavy a hand as to cut constantly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second mission to England , that we had the opportunity of witnessing ourselves any of his forensic displays . His manner , at that time , was certainly very peculiar ; but , to our apprehension , it seemed not so much tinged with foreign imitations , as by his own peculiarities of mind // and taste . It was apparently studied to the minutest action and we knuw that he practised much before the mirror . The defects of his manner may be imputed , therefore , to a vicious taste ; for no man seemed to enjoy more self-possession , and few , a greater facility of reaching what he intended . At the beginning , he spoke in low and indistinct murmurs , as if he were conjuring up the spirit of his elocution by muttered incantations . During this period his action was constrained , and there was a show of timidity , which notwithstanding his usual confidence , was sometimes unaffected . In some of his latest efforts at the bar , where the occasion had drawn public expectation towards him , his lips have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn pale , and his knees to shake . He has often said , that he never addressed an audience without some painful and embarrassing emotions in the beginning . As he advanced , these boyish tremors disappeared ; he became bold , erect , and dictatorial ; his voice swelled from its low notes , which were extremely musical , always parting with its charm as it rose ; though his high notes were rather inarticulate and imperfect than harsh . He spoke with great vehemence , rushing from thought to thought with a sort of ferocity ; his eye fiery , his nostrils distended , and his lips covered with froth , which he would wipe away . His gesture was quite as peculiar . His right arm was not brandished in the usual manner , but brought in frequent sweeps alon0 his side ; his right foot advanced , and his body alternately thrown back , as if about to spring , and heaved forward again , as if in act to strike down his adversary ; big drops of sweat all the while coursing along their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passion , ' he would sustain through periods , that might have mastered the sturdiest frames . The impression , which this violence made on his auditory , was of course , not always advantageous to the orator . It was too much the habit of his manner , to gain the credit of being excited by his subject , and threw over his best efforts a frigidness , which was not diminished by the circumstance , that he never seemed so lost in the current of his thought , as to forget altogether the eagerness-of display . He never pressed so earnestly to his goal , as not to be turned aside by the golden glitter of an ornament . He became sensible to the vices of his elocution at a later day , and in some of his speeches avoided those of his manner almost entirely . His success in this reform , at an age when most men find their habits too rigid for change , proves how much he could fashion himself to his own taste . // With all these faults of manner , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an orator . Neither the wit , nor the thought , nor the harmony of Pope , has , in the opinion of some critics , enrolled him among poets , because he wanted the invention and the passion of his art . In the same qualified sense we might , perhaps , deny to this great champion of the bar the prize of oratory , which be so earnestly contended for , and to which he brought so many important pretensions , extent of learning , compass of thought , a forcible logic , felicity of illustration , and a correct and polished diction . To some , who remember the vehemence of manner which we have described , and the ambitiousness of his illustration , it may seem a strange heresy to deny him the praise of true fervor and rich invention ; yet , as his warmth appeared to us to be that of the rhetorician , so his figures seemed cold , and rather embroidered on the web of his discourse , than woven into it . Nor do we impute this , we acknowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original deficiency of some of the qualities neccessary to eloquence , and , among the rest , that undefinable power of enchaining the sympathy of the hearers . His ambition of display sometimes weakened the force of his argument , engaged him in the pursuit of too remote analogies , and retarded his approach to the point , at which he aimed . Even his diction , admirable as it was , can not be entirely commended ; wearing often the air of too much elaboration , and being sometimes disfigured by affectations ; so that this vehicle of his thought did not always move easily along , from the number and quaintness of its ornaments . His kits , if we may be allowed the word , were sometimes felicitous and witty , but they often ended in a cold conceit , and were not always edged with courtesy . Yet no man could hear him for an hour , without owning , that he was a noble genius and an elegant scholar ; and the instances were very rare , in which any person , who had listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manner and peculiarities , would not return with renewed delight to witness his successive efforts . To the time of his last public appearance in Washington , the court room was always thronged with the wise , the learned , the fashionable , when it was known tIfat he was to speak ; and he uniformly riveted the attention of his auditors , through the technical details of his longest and dryest arguments . The combined causes of this charm we shall not *tttempt to analyze ; they may all be ultimately traced to the workings of an intellect , po*verful in its original gifts , adornvon. xxrv. - No. 54. // ed by culture , and enriched with acquisitions gained by a life of studious toil and active experiment . We insert the following passages from a pamphlet , published by him under the signature of Publius , after the commencement of the late war , and in defence of its policy , as among the best specimens of the style of his written compositions . " Nothing is more to be esteemed than peace , " ( I quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in possession of our houor and rights ; but when it is joined with loss of freedom , or with infamy , nothing can be more detestable and fatal . " I speak with just confidence , when I say that no ti*deralist can be found who desires with more sincerity the return of peace than the republican government , by which the war was declared . But it desires such a peace as the companion and instructer of Scipio has praised ; a peace consistent with our right.s and honor , and not the deadly tranquillity which may be purchased by disgrace , or taken in barter for the dearest and most essential claims of our trade and sovereignty . I appeal to you boldly ; are you prepared to purchase a mere cessation of arms by unqualified submission to the pretensions of England ? Are you prepared to sanction them by treaty and to entail them upon your posterity , with the inglorious and timid hope of escaping the wrath of those whom your fathers discomfited and vanquished ? Are you prepared for the sake of a present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precarious , to cripple the strong wing of American commerce for years to come , to take from our flag its national effect and character , and to subject our vessels on the high seas , and the brave men who navigate them , to the municipal jurisdiction of Great Britain ? I know very well that there are some amongst us ( I hope they are but few ) , who are prepared for all this and more ; who pule over every scratch occasioned by the war , as if it were an overwhelming calamity , and are only sorry that it is not worse ; who would skulk out of a contest for the best interests of their country to save a shilling or gain a cent ; who , having inherited the wealth of their ancestors without their spirit , would receive laws from London with as much facility as woollens from Yorkshire , or hardware from Sheffield . But I write to the great body of the people , who are sound and virtuous , and worthy of the lega*y which the heroes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer , that the only peace which they can he made to endure , is that which may twine itself round the honor of the people , and with its healthy and abundant foliage give shade and shelter to the prosperity of the empire . ' As the war was forced upon us by a long series of unexampled // aggressions , it would be absolute madness to doubt , that peace will receive a cordial welcome , if she returns without ignominy in her train , and with security in her hand . The destinies of Ainer ' ica are commercial , and her true policy is peace ; but the su6-stance of peace had , long before we were roused to a tardy resistance , been denied to us by the ministry of England ; and the shadow , which had been left to mock our hopes and to delude our imaginations , resembled too much the frowning spectre of war to deceive any body . Every sea had witnessed , and continued to witness , the systematic persecution of our trade and the unrelenting oppression of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway of the neutral world ; and our citizens traversed it with all the fears of a benighted traveller , who trembles along a road beset with banditti , or infested by the beasts of the forest . The government , thus urged and goaded , drew the sword with a visible reluctance ; and , true to the pacific policy which kept it so long in the scabbard , it will sheathe it again , when Great Britian shall consult her own interest , by consenting to forbear in future the wrongs of the past . The disposition of the government upon that point has been decidedly pronounced by facts which need no commentary . From the moment when war was declared , peace has been sought by it with a steady and unwearied assiduity , at the same time , that every practicable preparation has been made , and every nerve exerted to prosecute the war with vigor , if the enemy should persist in his injustice . The law respecting seamen , the Russian mission , the instructions sent to our Charg6 d'Affaires in London* the prompt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the solemn declarations of the government in the face of the world , that it wishes for nothing more than a fair and honorable accommodation , would be conclusive proofs of this , if any proofs were necessary . But it does not require to be proved , because it is self evident . What interest , in the name of common sense , can the government have ( distinctly from that of the whole nation ) in a war with Great Britain ? It is obvious to the meanest capacity , that such a war must be accompanied by privations , of which no government would hazard the consequences , but upon the suggestions of an heroic patriotism . The President and his supporters have never been ignorant that those who suffer by a war , however unavoidable , are apt rather to murmur against the government than against the enemy , and that while it presses upon us , we sometimes forget the compulsion under which it was commenced , and regret that it was not avoided with a provident foresight of its evils . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this //
