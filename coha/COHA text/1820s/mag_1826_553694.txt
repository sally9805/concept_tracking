txt ART . 111. - Reports of Cases , argued and determined in the Supreme Judicial Court of the State of Maine . By SIMON GREENLEAF , Counsellor at Law . Vol. 11 . Containing Cases of the years 1822 and 1823 . Hallowell. 1824 . THE attendance of courts , ' says Lord Bacon , is subject to four bad instruments ; first , certain persons that are sowers of suits , which make the court swell and the country pine ; the second sort is of those that engage courts in quarrels ofjurisdiction , and are not truly " amici curi* , " but " parasiti curiae , , ' in puffing a court up beyond her bounds , for their own scraps and advantages ; the third sort is of those that may be ac // counted the left hands of courts ; persons that are full of nimble and sinister tricks and shifts , whereby they pervert the plain and direct courses of courts , and bring justice into oblique lines and labyrinths ; and the fourth is the poller and exacter of fees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bush , whereunto while the sheep flies for defence in weather , he is sure to lose part of the fleece . ' Had the learned chancellor continued to our own time , he might have found at least one more subject for his grave wit , in the multitude and increase of law reports . To say nothing of the luxuriance of the English press in this department , our own country has become the field of so much legal disputation , and , consequently , of judicial decision , that it requires no despicable share of money and leisure , to supply our libraries with volumes , that publishers are continually laying before us , or to keep pace with the emphatically written reason , ' which they tacitly demand of us to examine as well as to purchase . But hard as it is to pay so dear for what we may call technical books , and which the world cares so little about , we want our own reports . Our age is not peculiar in its complaint of the increase of law books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , referred to the multiplication of this species of human industry with infinite complacency . His remark was , that though the increase was great , it did not increase the quantity of necessary reading ; as the perusal of the new , frequently superseded the necessity of that of the old production . If this remark of his Lordship was true in his own time , it has certainly gained force since the period his splendid intellect adorned the British bench ,  --  and whether he referred to books of reports or elementary works , all of our age , and especially those of our countrymen , who are destined for the bar , will feel the peculiar pertinency and meaning of the observation . Indeed , in this country , where there is a score of independent sovereignties , each supporting its own system of judicature , and more than half of them their reporters of decisions , there is consolation in the thought , that the plan of systematisina the science , and reducing the disjointed and rambling principles of the system , to the subjection of essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // whether done by Englishmen or Americans , they both deserve the thanks of the profession . in this country , therefore , we may well entertain a special regard for all elementary works of the law . And the value of such works , for the concentrating character which they are intended to possess , is yearly increasing with us . It is not a matter of little surprise , that twentyfive years ago , the best library of American reports that could be summoned by money or magic , within the circumference of the Union , might have been borne the circuits in a portfolio , while now , there are hardly less than two hundred within our territories . Valuable , then , must be such collections of legal principles , and dissertations upon them , while they serve to keep sacred and distinct the doctrines they discuss ; and doubly valuable , when by the patience , and industry , and investigation of their authors , we find decisions upon those principles , collected from different parts of our country , and the reasons of those decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions of those , whose fame is in the Year Books , and who may almost be said to have fixed the immutable axioms of the law . Numerous , however , as are the books of reports that are daily soliciting our attention , many of them are the vehicles of decisions , interesting and important in public estimation , so that , while we need not fear , with Mr Justice Buller , the shipwreck of the law ' from the intervention of hard cases , ' we may well hope for the safety of it in those high authorities , which our own time has seen erected like fortifications around its principles . High political excitements , and political emergencies , give occasion for legal dilemmas ; and though we should he slow to believe , that any situation of things would raise questions between l ) arties , that could hide the old landmarks ' from the penetration of our learned jurists and judges , still the opinion may be ventured , that under circumstances of national tranquillity the science advances with surer , because soberer steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our peaceful times , as the periods of the most important decisions , and the highest juridical learning , as developed in our books of authorities . As it is , the principles of the common law are becoming every day , from such frequent application , better understood , and our judicial character more effectually established . // The character of an accomplished reporter is no ordinary acquirement . To win this reputation requires legal penetration and acumen , as well as a familiarity with principles and forms , and an adroitness in reference and application . A faithful and able reporter of judicial reasoning , gives a dignity and weight to the tribunal under whose adjudications he may sit . The method of compressing the arguments of counsel , which Mr Greenleaf has in some instances carried to an extreme , has been matter of complaint in the mouths of some men , too eminent in the walks of judicature to need such arguments at all . But we are sure , that neither the rights of parties , nor the reputation of the law , is jeoparded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable , from listening to the arguments in extenso , and we must he content to hope , that students will go to the fountains , to which the books of decisions will so frequently direct them . Our readers need scarcely be told , that this is not the first time that Mr Greenleaf has been before the public in a legal character . His Collection of over-ruled Cases , ' which appeared in 1821 , bore good testimony to his industry , and entitled him to high credit , as well as to the thanks of the profession . The present is the second volume of the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine , which has appeared under l ) i5 auspices , since the separation of that State from Massachusetts . Mr Greenleaf is of the order of compendious reporters . He is lucid and direct in his statement of cases ; his arguments of counsel are arranged with logical exactness , and a well conceived brevity , which give us their outline well defined , and yet without any sinuosities . He is happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his consequent exposition of it . Mr Greenleaf is always concise , while throughout he never fails to be just ; and this is no small praise , when the longest , or most important case in the volume , will be found to allow not above two pages to the arguments of counsel . The present volume contains about one hundred cases , within the limits of little more than four hundred pages . Many of them are important as well as interesting . The book indicates great industry in the Court , and the decisions bear marks of precision and emphasis , which give to the ac // curate and intelligent opinions of Chief Justice Mellen the character of strong authority . The opinion of the Court is delivered , in almost every instance , by the presiding Judge . Though a plain case , the opinion of the Court in Frothing/tant vs Dutton deserves notice . The defendant in that action did not disclose the matter of his defence , but tendered issue , and claimed trial by jury , yet for withholding such disclosure , his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause before the Supreme Court , upon summary exceptions pursuant to the statute , the Chief Justice observed , under these circumstances we are of opinion , that the defendants ought not to have been defaulted . They had a constitutional right to a verdict of the jury , and to call on the plaintiff to prove before them the demand , on which he founded his action . ' The default was set aside . Now , however excellent a thing a code of the Bar , or the usage of a Court may be , yet when any of the provisions of the one , or the nature of the other , may go to impair a constitutional privilege , few will deny that , by such decisions , they should be virtually abolished . A Court can hardly be supposed to judge of a case , until it is laid before them , and if the party can not make one out , it is at his own risk that he undertakes to do it . Charles Butler has said , That the right of interpretation should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but to what extent it should be allowed , or , in other words , to ascertain the exact point , where judicial interpretation should stop , and legislative interpretation intervene , is a question of extreme difficulty . ' The observation of this learned lawyer may be very true ; but a case of difficulty has not arisen , when we are merely called on to solve the question , is or is not the trial by jury our right , whenever we choose to demand it ? ' Better , at once , that we have a French jury , such as that distinguished jurist has represented to us , and better that interpretation were declared by arr*ts , than that such an invaluable privilege should for a moment be jeoparded . The case of The Proprietors of the Kennebeck Purchase vs Laboree &amp; als , ' which is the most elaborate authority in the book , is one of more than common consequence , as well from the doctrine of disseisin , which is involved in it , as from // the judgment that is passed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the defence is founded . That section contained a provision , declaring in substance , that in all real actions then pending , or which should afterwards be brought , it should not be necessary for barring the action , that the premises defended should have been surrounded by fences ; but that , if the possession of the tenant , or those under whom he claimed , had been such as comported with the ordinary management of a farm , and satisfactorily indicative of such an exercise of ownership , as is usual in the improvement of it by the owner , it should be sufficient ; thus changing the principles of the law of disseisin , in regard to past transactions , and virtually taking away the rights of the proprietor . The opinion is long , and ably supported by numerous authorities and strong reasoning . We can here introduce but a few passages from it . The decision has declared that portion of the law retrospective and unconstitutional . After some preliminary observations , the Chief Justice goes on to say *rJ ? he doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well settled ; a possession must be adverse to the title of the true owner , in order to constitute a disseisin ; the possessor must claim to hold and improve the land for his own use and exclusive of others . ' We are inclined to believe , that upon cxamination it will be found , that the principles of the common law are applied in England and New York with more strictness as regards the occupant of the land , than they have ever been in Massachusetts or with us , upon the doctrine of disseisin ; at least so far as relates to the presumption of law in reference to the intentions of the possessor . ' The facts relied on to prove the possession exclusive ' must , however , be such , as at once to give notice to all , of the nature and extent of the po5sessor*s improvement and claim . ' It must be such an open and visible occupancy , that the proprietor may at once be presumed to know the extent of the claim and usurpation of him , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent to obtain a title to them by *vrong. * These are plain principles , and well known ; nor are they introduced for their novelty , but tnerely for the directness of their statement , and as preparatory to the train of reasoning which leads to the decision . According to existing laws , ' says the Chief Justice , deeds of conveyance of real estate must be under seal . Such deeds , to pass // afee simple estate , must contain certain legal terms ; viz  --  the conveyance must be to the grantee and his heirs . To entitle a widow to dower in her deceased husband 's estate , he must have been seized of it during the coverture . Now if our legislature should at the next session pass a law , declaring that all deeds of conveyance of real estate , that had before that time been executed , or sh ouldin future be executed , should be considered and adjudged sufficient in law to pass the estate therein described , in fee simple , though such deeds were not under seal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , in all cases be entitled to dower in her deceased husband 's estate , where he had died , or might in future die , seized of such estate , at any.time before as well as during the coverture ; - wihl the principles on which a free government is founded-will the principles of common honesty and justice , sanction such a law , so far as to give it a retroactive effect , and t hereby disturb , impair and destroy the vested rights of those , who had become the owners of the estates under then existing * Let us further suppose that the action had not yet been tried but was to be tried at this term . Let us further suppose that the legislature , at their last session , had passed a law declaring that in all actions , then pending or that might be commenced after the passing of such act , no adverse , notorious , and exclusive possession of the demanded premises , although surrounded with fences , should be a bar and constitute a good defence in such action ; unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued for forty years , next before the commencement of such action . Now would the tenant , or any other man , understanding and respecting principles , consider such a law constitutional ? On the contrary , would it not be at once pronounced unjust and void ? if such an act of the legislature could be sanctioned , not only the tenant , in the circumstances we have supposed , would be deprived of his estate by a destruction of vested rights , but a large class of citizens , similarly situated , would suffer under similar deprivations . The more the principle of the section in question is examined , the more distinct become its objectionable features . ' In a word , the whole section taken together appears to have been enacted with a view , and for the purpose , of abolishing the distinction , well known to have then existed between a possession under a claim of title on record , and a possession without any such claim or pretence of title . ' Again he observes ; The section is certainly retrospective as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes then pending , as well as those which might in future be commenced , shou ldbe decided . It l ) rofesses to operate on past transactions , and to give // to facts a character , which they did not possess at the time they took place ; and to declare that in the trial of causes depending on such facts , they shall be considered and allowed to operate in the decision of such causes , according to their new character . It professes to settle rights and titles depending on laws , as they existed for a long series of years before the act was passed , by new principl es , which for the first time are introduced by its provisions . It professes to change the nature of a disseisin , and thereby subject the true owner of lands to the loss of them , by converting into a disseisin , by mere legislation , those acts which , at the time the law was passed , did not anount to a disseisin . It professes to punish the rightful owner of lands , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , when , by the existing laws , he was not barred , nor liable to the imputation of any laches , for not sooner ejecting the wrongful possessor. * After illustrating his subject by a few examples , the Chief Justice concludes in the following independent strain . It is always an unpleasant task for a judicial tribunal , to pronounce an act of the legislature in part or in whole unconstitutional . We agree with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Fletcher vs Peck , that " the question wbether a law be void for its repugnance to the constitution , is , at all times , a question of much delicacy , which ought seldom , if ever , to be decided in the affirmative in a doubtful case . But the Court , when impelled by duty to render such a judgment , would be unworthy of its station could it be unmindful of the obligation which that station imposes. ** We can not presume that the legislature , which enacted the law , considered the section in question , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their powers . Be that as it may , the oath of office , under which we conscientiously endeavor to perform our duties , imposes upon us as solemn an obligation to declare an act of our legislature unconstitutional , when , U*Ofl mature deliberation , we believe it to be so , as it does to give prompt and full effect to all constitutional laws , in the administration of justice .
