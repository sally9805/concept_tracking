txt ART . XXIIT. - *1 Discourse on the Early History of Peunsylva .. nia ; being an dunual Oration delivered before the american Philosophical Society , held at Philadelphia , for pro .. moting useful Knowledge , June 6 , 1821 . By Peter &amp; Du Ponceau , LL . D. THE history of almost every people begins in fable . It is not in the first weak struggles of a barbarous tribe , for ascendancy over its neighbors , that the future conquerors of mankind are to be discerned ; nor is it in the execution of petty schemes of traffic or plunder , that we can foresee an opulent maritime power , which is to cover the sea with her ships , and the land with monuments of her commercial splendor . Great as may be the destinies of the infant nation , there is nothing to arrest attention in the obscure events of her early growth , as she slowly and painfully emerges from insignificance , until her subsequent wealth , power , and refinement have imparted an interest to the minutest incidents of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flatter the pride of his countrymen , and to excite his own imagination by swelling the little chieftains of his ancestry into heroes , and peopling the dark void of his country 's origin with demigods , whose pretensions , like objects viewed through mist , are magnified by the very darkness in which they are enveloped . To the rhapsodies of the bard succeed the legends of the annalist , or the researches of the antiquary , each supplying the defect of authentic records by fanciful reasonings , by conjectures whose far-fetched ingenuity is not always enough to redeem them from the imputation of folly and falsehood , and by vain attempts to throw light upon that which the unsparing hand of time has long since consigned to perpetual oblivion . Such are the thousand mystical tales , which Herodotus received from the Egyptian priests . Such are the apocryphal expeditions , wars , and conquests of the Greeks , and the deities , whose combats and intrigues have , at least , furnished the subject of many a beautiful fiction to Homer , Hesiod , orApollonius . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small part of the history of the kings of Rome , which Livy confesses to rest upon slender prooFs , and which Dionysius and Plutarch narrate with a particularity more suspicious than even the silence of older historians . The same cloud of uncertainty hangs over the rise of the mo // dern nations of Europe , whose minstrels will point out to you , in the obscure and broken traditions of their forefathers , some Trojan hero like Brute , or Scandinavian god like Odin , to render their first beginning illustrious . The only exceptions to this are in the case of colonies I*1anted in a foreign country by populous and flourishing nations , which , being at the time in possession of arts and literature , can transmit to posterity an account of the origin of their colonies , of the causes which led to their establishment , and of the distinguished individuals who communicated dignity and splendor to the enterprise . If such a colony should outlive the perils and hardships to which its commencement was exposed , if it should gradually rise up to the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the people which gave it birth , and if , having attained the strength and robustness of manhood , it should throw off the dominion of its parent state , and boldly place itself among the independent nations of the earth , it may then look back with sentiments of honorable pride upon the patriots who founded it in the wilderness , the heroes who defended it from hostile aggression , and the statesmen by whom it was lifted up to its subsequent elevation and grandeur . We , therefore , who trace the very beginning of our national being to a period when mankind had already become polished by civilization ; who sprang from a land where science was even then fostered and flourishing ; whose progenitors brought with them across the ocean a share of the knowledge , refinement and letters of their contemporaries in Europe ; and who , from the first morning that an American sun rose upon our fathers to light them on amid the unexplored deserts of the west , down to the day which is now passing over our heads , have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who are to come after us , by cultivating literature and science ,  --  we have no occasion to call upon the doubtful aid of fiction for the celebration of our ancestry , devoid as it is of the false brilliancy which a series of deified heroes may have thrown upon the lineage of Europeans . The curious and learned , indeed , may contend for the rival claims of Spain or Portugal , of England or France , to the dominion of the new world ; they may dispute on the priority of the voyages of Vespucci or Columbus to this continent ; they may speculate on the expeditions of Biron from Norway , or of Madoc from JV'ew *S*eries , . /Vo . JO . 49 // 386 April , Wales ; or they may ascend higher , and amuse themselves with seeking for the N*oo* Mc*I ' *4e0v. the Blessed Isles of Pindar , or the Atlantis of Plato , in the fertile regions of tropical America ; hut their discussions , strikingly as they tend to show how many of the events which to-day are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow , do not shake the credibility of the general facts of our early history , nor cast any douhtfulness upon the characters and deeds of those , who laid the foundations of our public prosperity . We have been led into this course of reflection by the perusal of Mr Dut Ponceau 's eloquent discourse on the early history of Pennsylvania , and especially by his remarks on the chai'acter of William Penn , in which , if he displays an enthusiastic admiration of this great apostle of peace , it is certainly an enthusiasm equally honorable to his head and to his heart . If I had not already trespassed too much upon your patience , ' he observes , I would with delight pass in review before you some more , at least , of the interesting traits with which this history abounds , and which an abler pen than mine will , I hope , at no distant day , fully delineate . Above all , I should love to dwell on the great character of our immortal founder , and to point out , by numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of mankind , which enabled him to raise a flourishing commonwealth by means of all others the most apparently inadequate . To acquire and secure the possession of an extensive country , inhabited by numerous tribes of warlike savages , without arms , without forts , without the use or even the demonstration of physical force , was an experiment which none but a superior mind would have conceived , which none but a masterspirit could have successfully executed . Yet this experiment succeeded in a manner that has justly excited the astonishment of the whole world . " Of all the colonies that ever existed , " says Ebeling , " nono was ever founded on so philanthropic a plan , none was so deeply impressed with the character of its founder , none practised in a greater degree the principles of toleration , iil ) erty and peace , and none rose and flourished more rapidly than Pennsylvania . She xva* the youngest of the British colonies established before the eighteenth century , but it was not long before she surl ) assed most of her elder sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This our author justly ascribes to the genius of XX ' i1lia*n Penn , who , disdainino vulo'ar means , to dared // found his power and his commonwealth on the nobler feelings of man . ' Discourse , pp. 26 , 27 . Again , in another part of his discourse , Mr Du Ponceau observes The character of William Penn alone sheds a never-fading lustre upon our history . No other state in the union can boast of such an illustrious founder ; none began their social career under auspices so honorable to humanity . Every trait of the life of that great man , every fact and anecdote of those golden times , will be sought for by our descendants with avidity , and will furnish many an interesting subject for the fancy of the novelist , and the enthusiasm of the poet . ' Ibid. p. 13 . If any thing could induce us to qualify the panegyric here bestowed on the great founder of Pennsylvania , it would be the rare combination of propitious circumstances under which his was conducted ; for , although one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ability to discern and profit by the favorable occasions that chance may throw in our way , still we should do wrong to attribute entirely to a native energy of soul , those consequences , which flowed in part , at least , from birth , fortune , opportunity , or any other accidental advantages . When , therefore , we advert to the early establishment or speedy growth of Pennsylvania , as redounding to the peculiar glory of William Penn , we ought to consider that he was not , like the primitive settlers of Massachusetts , a fugitive from the justice , or more truly speaking , the injustice of his native country , when that country would scarcely grant the poor boon of obtaining a shelter from ecclesiastical oppression in the wilderness of the west . Born of distinguished parentage and the heir of large possessions ; admitted to the familiar converse of one king , and honored with the personal friendship of another ; rather conferring a favor on his master , than receiving one from him , in consenting to accept a grant of wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family from the crown ; and , although a persecuted sectarian , yet elevated by that very persecution to the rank and influence of a prophet among his enthusiastic associates in religious faith : - uniting , as he did , all these extraneous advantages with a ready eloquence and unbounded zeal , it would have been extraordinary if he had not effected more , than it was possible to do with the scanty resources of those who planted most of the sister colonies in America . // We do not wish , by these remarks , to be understood as calling in question the merits of a legislator , whom Moniesquieu has honored with the title of America 's Lycurgus . The keenness of foresight , the sagacity and penetration of judgmeat , the fertility in inventing and clearness of discernment in applying resources , which the events of his life display , are no less remarkable , than the pure spirit of universal benevolence , which seems to have been the governing principle of all his actions , as it was the leading tenet in his particular views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity in the establishment of his commonwealth , he secured it against many of those violent shocks , which at that time threatened the dissolution of some of the older and robuster colonies , especially from the hostility of the savages , over whom , by pacific measures , by kind treatment , probity , and equitable dealing , he gained an ascendancy far more complete than any exhibition of military force could have imparted . It is not strictly true , indeed , which some foreign writers have asserted , that he was the first of the colonists to treat with the savages on an equal footing , and to obtain their lands by honorable purchase ; for numerous instances occur , in the history of other colonies , where the same respect was shown to the primeval lords of the soil . Dr Belknap , in his excellent American Biography , observes , that it had been a common thing in New England , * for fifty years before the time of Penn , to make fair and regular pi*rchases of land from the Indians . ' But although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderation , he and his followers alone persisted in the practice of it , and thus preserved the goodwill of their savage neighbors , while , in other parts of the country , a different course of conduct on the part of the colonists subjected them to a series of wasteful and vindictive wars , which ended only in the extermination of some of the most powerful among the aboriginal tribes . There is little doubt , for instance , that , if all the colonies had entertained the same ardent love of peace which actuated the settlers of Pennsylvania , our ancestors would have avoided the cruel wars waged against first the Pequot , then the Pokanoket , and afterwards the Penobseot indians , which , for more than a hundred years , were the source of constant apprehension , expense , and sufferin0 to the inhabitants of New England . The same enlightened spirit of benevolence , which led // Penn to consult his true interest in adopting peaceful means of avoiding the enmity of the savages , dictated the memorable clause in the code of laws drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all persons living in the province , who confess and acknowledge the one almighty and eternal God to be the creator , upholder , and ruler of the world , and hold themselves obliged in conscience to live peaceably and justly in civil society , shall in no wise be molested for their religious persuasion or practice in matters of faith and worship . ' The constant assertion of this golden rule of civil society , and that too by one whose life and fortune were devoted to the task of gaining proselytes for that peculiar sect , of which he was the illustrious chief , evinces a liberality of feeling , which , in that age , seldom accompanied a high degree of religious enthusiasm . The character of William Penn , upon which we have been tempted to pause for a moment , is adduced by Mr Du Ponceau , among other things to the same effect , in illustration and enforcement of his belief , that the colonial history of Pennsylvania affords much to instruct and to please , that is worthy to be handed down to posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meagre compilations , in which it is now for the most part recorded ; and if Mr Duponceau s zeal in the cause of learning were not so honorably employed in another department of historical research , we might regret , with him , that his age or professional avocations should prevent his becoming the historian of Pennsylvania . That the history of that , as well as of the other colonies , abounds with a variety of striking and curious incidents , we think no one , who is familiar with the old memorials and records of our origin , will be disposed to deny , when he considers the traits of individual daring and national firmness , of private and public virtue , of dignified resolution in suffering , and of noble moderation in prosperity , of which the whole course of our colonial history furnishes unnumbered examples . And we have every reason to express the same hope as to Massachusetts , which Mr Dii Ponceau has expressed with respect to Pennsylvania , that the history of our name and race may ere long be rescued from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it now lies buried , and be consigned to monuments more worthy of its intrinsic value . // In conclusion , we will only add one more extract from Mr Du Ponceau 's discourse , which forcibly illustrates the consid .. erations that we have just now suggested , and would serve as no unfit introduction to the delightful descriptions of scenery and manners in Gertrude of WyonAng . Let it not be imagined that the annals of Pennsylvania are not sufficiently interesting to call forth the talents of an eloquent historian . It is true , that they exhibit none of those striking eveits which the vulgar mass of mankind consider as alone worthy of being transmitted to posterity . No ambitious rival warriors occupy the stage , nor are strong emotions excited by the frequent description of scenes of blood , murder and deVastation . *:ut what country on earth ever presented such a spectacle as this fortunate commonwealth held out to view for the space of near one hundred years , realizing all that fable ever invented , or poetry ever sang of an imaginary golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thy history the interest of romance ! Should Pennsylvanians hereafter ( legenerate , they will not need , like the Greeks , a fabulous Arcadia to relieve the mind from the prospect of their crimes and follies , and to redeem their own vices by the fancied virtues of their forefathei 's . Pennsylvania once realized what never existed before , except in fabled story . Not that her citizens were entirely free from the passions of human nature , for they were men , and not angels ; but it is certain that no country on earth ever exhibited such a scene of happiness , innocence , and peace , as was witnessed here during the first century of our social existence . I well remember them , those patriarchal times , when simple , yet not inelegant manners prevailed every where amou* us ; when rusticity was devoid of roughness , and polished life diffused its mild radiance around , unassuming and unenvied ; when society was free from the constraint of etiquette and parade ; when love was not crossed by avarice or pride , and friendships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle which Pennsylvania offered even in the midst of the storms of our revolution , and which she continued to exhibit until a sudden influx of riches broke in upon the land , and brought in its train luxury more baneful than war .
