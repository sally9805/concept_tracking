txt ART . X.-Sampson 's Discourse and Correspondence with va* learned Jurists upo*'i the History of the Law , with the . /lddition of several Essays , Tracts , and Documents relating to the Subject . Compiled and published by Pishey Thompson . Washington City . 8vo. pp. 202 . UPON the leading article of this collection we have already commented at length in our fortyflfth Number ; and we have no reason to alter our opinion of its merits or utility . We have no doubt that it has had much influence , and been instrumental in bringing about that change , which is evident in the public mind // and that of many of the profession , in respect to the important subject of our jurisprudence . The principal object , which Mr Sampson proposed in his Discourse , delivered before the Historical Society of New York , on the sixth of December , 1823 , was , as he expressed it , to challenge into the noblest field of exertiou the talent and genius of our country , much of which is now lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear from the various pieces to which his Discourse has given rise , many of which are contained in the volume under consideration . For the embodying of these pieces in a permanent form , the publisher is entitled to his share of credit , although , as he states in his preface , in the series of the commumcations he has not been able to observe an exact order , as several of them were not obtained till after the book was in the press . ' The dedication of the publisher to the nineteenth Congress , being in a single sentence , for its brevity 's sake we here insert ; To the Senate and Representatives in the Nineteenth Congress of the United States now assembled , charged by the Sovereign States and People of the Union to guard their interests , promote their wellbeing , provide for their wants , and effectuate their wishes , this volume is respectfully dedicated , by the Publisher . ' Whether the subject of the book might not usefully have occupied the time and attention thrown away upon other matters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say ; the public may , and probably will , judge of that . And how far it belongs to the national legislature , with its limited jurisdiction , to lead the way , or for the State legislatures to make the necessary reforms in their respective codes , is a question upon which we are not prepared to give any opinion ; but we are very well pleased to see the public feeling alive upon so important a concern , and shall do what we can to keep it so , and to promote free , fair , and liberal discussion . Before the publication of Mr Sampson 's Discourse , there was a prevailing idea , not merelywith the profession of the law , who imbibed it at the outset of their studies and cherished it from habit ever after , that there was some mysterious excellence in the common law ; that it had its source in the purity and simplicity of some ancient but undefined epoch ; that as letters were not much used in those times of wise simplicity , it had been handed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation ; and that though the corrupt learning of the // schools which obtained in late ages , and the false refinements of modern innovation , had greatly impaired its original purity and pristine vigor , yet its regenerating principle was gradually operating to restore its primitive virtues , and original sanctity . And what gave most authority to this notion was the eloquent and persuasive manner in which it was set forth by Sir William Blackstone , in his otherwise excellent and elegant Commentaries on the Laws of England . It required both industry and courage to encounter such authority , and to array , in opposition to opinions of so long standing , however weak their foundation , the overwhelming proofs which were necessary to do away those ancient prejudices . In neither of these qualities was the author of the Discourse deficient . These proofs were to be found in history , and the occasion was propitious . Mr Sampson was invited by a learned society , instituted for the purposes of historical knowledge and investigation , and he contrived by the power of rigorous condensation to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all going to prove that an ideal perfection had been ascriI ) ed to times and persons quite inconsistent with any correct view of the history of those persons or those ages . It was , however , natural to suppose that so bold and animated an attack upon actual opinions and prejudices would excite attention ; and so it accordingly happened , as the various pieces in the collection before us manifestly show . Some , without thinking it necessary to argue upon what they considered as fixed and first principles , thought of nothing but the pious duty of crying down the new heresy and the heretic ; others , who had before inclined to such opinions , and rejoiced to see their own thoughts so fully developed , abounded in the sense of the author ; others commended the style and manner , and even the matter , but cautiously , and without saying why , reserved their judgments . We have had the curiosity to look back upon the opinion we ourselves then formed , and we find ( Vol. xix. p. 416 ) these words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part the views he has taken of an important subject , and admire the generous zeal with which he has thrown himself into the front ranks of those who contend for the cause of truth and reason with lit*le chance of honor or success. * We are now glad to find that this latter qualification might have been spared . If the reprinting of the Discourse in this // country and in Europe , with so much encomiurn and such favorable notice , be an honor to the author , or the influence it has had on opinions , be success , these objects have been attained ; and if we have duly estimated the character of the author , narrow views of self interest do not belong to it . Certain it is , that a great point has been gained . The ablest jurists in our country are now agreed , and this agreement is now open , declared , and manifest , that it was a vain superstition to impute the wisdom of the common law to the ancient inhabitants of Bri*&gt;v or to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own Saxon princes . ' For this it will be sufficie*t to cite the work of Mr Du Ponceau on the Jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States . This learned author , and the other jurists of our country who vindicate the principles , but not the defects of the common law , expressly exclude from their admiration the common law of the Saxons , Danes , and Normans , as also that which prevailed during the reigns of the Plantagenets and the first Stuarts ; but they are for upholding that which took its rise in the middle of the seventeenth century , to which the second revolution in 1 68S gave shape and figure , which was afterwards improved in England , but received its greatest lustre in this country . We have already commented upon Mr Du Poncean 's work , and we are not ashamed to say , that upon the great and re*naining question of substituting entire new textuary codes of positive enactment in the place of this traditional and judicial law , we have hesitated , or even vacillated somewhat in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our readers , that we will be attentive to the subject , and as proper opportunities occur , apprize them of its progress , and endeavor to form an opinion in which we can ourselves confide , upon full and mature consideration . Already the enactment of new and en-* tire codes , each part made with a view to the whole , has been recommended by two state governors , Mr Wilson , late governor of South Carolina , and Mr Clinton , governor of New York . Why the recommendation has not been acted upon in the legislature of either of those states , we do not know . Things less honorable to the legislators who have passed them by , have certainly been debated . England has , to her honor be it spoken , done more within these few years ; and we fear , in this , as in too many other things , our dependence will appear . It would lead us too far , at present , to follow this Gonsidera .. // lion to its proper limits ; and we only notice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much useful reasoning and many important facts , of which every statesman , legislator , lawyer , merchant , and citizen , should be apprized . To treat the writings and opinions of such men as those , whose letters or essays compose this collection , with disregard , would be blameable ; to controvert them by argument would be fair ; to deny the facts which are authentic , would show imbecility and ignorance . It may be worth remarking , that the question now agitated , and with daily increasing interest , is not altogether the same as that which divided the Sabinian and Proculian sects , namely , whether reason or precedent should govern ; nor can it be resolved by the example of the Herciscundi , who endeavored to steer a middle course , and avoid the absurdities into which the violence of opposition had carried each of the contending parties . For we have written constitutions paraixiount to all other law , which have for a fundamental principle , that the three departments of the government should be kept entirely distinct , each rigorously confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prohibited from legislating ; and yet it can not be denied , that the greater , and we do not scruple to say the better part of our law is neither traditional , for there could he no such traditions ; nor statute , for there are no such statutes ; but judicial law , enacted by the sole authority of the judges , and the records of it are the books of reports . It may then be asked , Why not leave it entirely to the judges to proceed , and let the law go on improving under their hands ? It would he a sufficient answer , that it is not consistent with the principles of our constitution ; but enough will be found in the little volume which we recommend , to satisfy inquiry on that head . The reader will there find the suggestion of the committee appointed by the legislature of Louisiana to revise their civil code ; namely , that the judges ' decisions , when made in the exercise of their discretionary power in cases not provided for , should be reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , but the means of improving the laws .
