txt ART . IV. -A Collection of Cases overruled , doubted , or limited in their application . Taken from . lmerrcan and English Reports . By Simon 6*reenleaf , Counsellor at Law , Portland , 1821 . THE number of cases in this collection is nearly six hunwired . Still it is by no means complete . Our own recollection and minutes furnish at least one hundred more ; and it is prob'ttble that the full number of such cases , in American and English Reports , is one thousand . This statement may surprise some of our readers , and give occasion for new jests about the glorious uncertainty of the law . If , however , the number of reported cases , and the series of years during which they have accumulated , are considered , it will not be deemed strange or unfortunate , that a thousand legal errors have been corrected in half as many years . There are about four hundred volumes of cases decided in England and Ireland , since the reign of Edward II . We , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder times , which may be gleaned from the old abridgments , and which reach back to the days of Henry III , nor the numerous little volumes containing accounts of a single case . There are also about one hundred and forty volumes of American Reports , all published since the organization of the federal government , and four fifths of them within the last twenty years . That in all the courts in England and Ireland , with such extent of jurisdiction and press of business , there should be an average of two errors of judgment in a year , is surely no just cause of wonder or alarm . But our assumption , that there are // a thousand cases , which might be inserted in a collection like Mr Greenleaf 's , included the American as well as the English decisions . Of course , the proportion of errors , on that assumption , is less than we have above supposed , for that our own official jurisconsults are infallible , we have not the vanity to believe , nor they the folly to pretend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , which have been overruled , but those , also , of which , while the general principle is adhered to , the extent of its application only has been subsequently limited , and others which have been merely doubted . Again , many of these overruled cases are judgments , which have been reversed in the higher tribunals , and therefore ought not to swell the list of errors ; as such judgments are annulled , and never cited or regarded as authorities . That more errors have not been corrected is a cause of regret and humiliation . An index expurgatorius is needed for many a volume of reports . It has perhaps been true throughout the history of the English law , that judges have been less reluctant to correct the errors of their predecess6rs , than their own ; but it is peculiarly true of American judges . It is , however , with admi .. ration of the magnanimity , which attends great talents and 0 thorough learning , that we have witnessed , on more than one occasion , a full and voluntary retraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurist of our own country whose official labors we have heretofore noticed , and to whose powers and acquisitions we have paid our sincerest homage . True wisdom , ' says another great judge , should induce us all to retrace our steps where we are wrong , and not for the sake of consistency persist to hold our adjudications to be oracles of the law . Judges are not infallible ; and from a thousand causes their adjudications are sometimes erroneous . Great talents induce them , on some occasions , to repose too much on themselves . They feel that their contemporaries will b* slow to doubt whatever they decide . But in a short time their decisions will be discussed by their weight , and not hy their mere authority . ' The truth and justness of this last remark are daily before our eyes ; and the wisdom recommended in the first , is exemplified in the practice of the author ft is humiliating and pitiable to see a judge cling to his errors* with a convulsive grasp , and search for strained and dttrksome analogies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half admits the existence of the doctrine which // he combats , and questioning the sagacity of the most accom. pushed jurists of the age . If this is ever seen , it is in men of little minds and small acquirements . The pride of infallibility belongs only to such . The law is a progressive science ; and ' all rational sciences that are subject to argument and discourse , ' says sir John Davis , must needs be subject to uncertainty and to error . Howbeit , there is no art or science that standeth upon discourse of reason , that bath her rules and maxims so certain and infallible , and so little subject to divers interpretations , as the common law ; so certain , sure , and without questions , are the principles and grounds thereof . ' If the rules and maxims of the law were a thousand times as many as they be indeed , yet would they carry no proportion with the infinite diversity of men 's actions , and of other accidents Which make the cases that are to be decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of singular judgment to apply the grounds and rules of the law , which are fixed and certain , to all human acts and accidents , which are in perpetual motion and mutation. ' -* . ' But for all this , it is objected that our later judgments do many times cross and contradict the former directly in one and the same point , which is a manifest argument of incertainty in the law . Assuredly , there are very few precedents of such contrary judgments-. scarce two in one age . And yet if the reasons of the later judgments did appear of record , we should find them grounded upon mischiefs and inconveniences arising since the former judgments ; or upon other weighty considerations respecting tho good of the commonwealth in general . ' - ' And thus much may suffice to he spoken , to remove that scandal of uncertainty which ignorance doth unworthily cast upon the common law . ' Contrary judgments , in one and the same point of law , ' are as rare in these days , as in the times referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection of the cases collected by Mr Greenleaf will shew , that in a great majority of instances , it is only an incidental dictum of a judge that has been denied or limited in its application . The cases are few , in which the very point in judgment has been afterwards decided in a different manner . Lord Coke says , that in all his time there were not two questions moved , touching any of the fundamental points of the common law . Sir John Davis says , exchequer-chamber cases were so rare in his day , that the judges were drawn out of their proper // courts scarce twice in a year to deliver their opinions on those doubtful points . And it is asserted by chancellor Kent , that according to Colle 's and Brown 's parliamentary reports , which have collected all the cases to be found , there were from the year 1697 to the year 1778 , ( a period of eighty years , and that too the most happy and flourishing in the English history , ) only sixty-four cases in error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a small number only of these cases was there a reversal ofjudgrnent . In Shower 's Parliamentary Reports of an earlier period , there are thirtyseven cases , and but seven reversals . The facility of appealing from one tribunal to another , which is furnished by the statutes of the United States , and of the several states , has a direct and fatal tendency to impair confidence in the subordinate courts , to foster a litigious spirit , and to impress the minds of suitors , and of the people at large , with the notion that there is no certainty in the law . To the honor of the common law , it should be sounded in every ear , that an appeal is not known in that system . Upon judgments given in our ordinary courts of justice , * says an ancient sage , the law doth admit and allow writs of error to be brought , without any touch or dishonor to the judges . ' To a more litigious spirit than prevailed in earlier days may perhaps be , in part , ascribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into the House of Lords . In part , too , it may be attributed to the increase of important questions , which originate in the other courts , from a more numerous population , more extended business , and new relations , produced by political changes . Upon a comprehensive survey of the subject , we shall find cause rather for exultation in the stability and certainty of the law , than for wonder or regret at the occasional conflict of judicial decisions . The causes of the greater diversity of decisions in this country , than in England , are obvious to the most superficial notice . Each state in the Union has its own courts , that are subject to no common revision , except upon national or constitutional questions ; and those courts are composed of men of very unequal talents , experience , and learning . On questions of common law , therefore , we must expect there will always be contradictory adjudications by the courts of the different states . There is little or no hope of an uniform national common law . Ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still more wide .. ly different in those which are remote from each other . In every state , statutes have altered the common law , but not in the same particulars in any two of them . In some , the doctrines of chancery are incorporated with the common law ; n others , they are kept distinct . For these and numerous similar reasons , we can not anticipate ( perhaps we ought not to desire ) the uniformity which distinguishes the administration of the common law in England . In each state , however , and especially in Massachusetts , for which the suggestion is intended , additional securities might be furnished for the stability and certainty of the law . We ought to derive wisdom for future use , from the experience of the last seventeen years , and not sit down contented with past and present good . While the law , or the administration of it , is susceptible of improvement , it ought not to retrograde nor remain stationary . Reports of adjudged cases are called by Bracton the judgments of the just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were published in this commonwealth , consisted principally of hasty opinions on half-argued points that were raised in the progress of jury trials . Are the reports of such decisions , by whomsoever made , entitled to this high appellation ? Since 1805 , law-terms have been held in the several counties , and the advantages have been immense . The junior part of the profession can never duly estimate them ; though from the first volume of Massachusetts Reports , they can learn a part of the evils from which they are exempted . In our judgment , however , the system so happily commenced is not half finished . In a wor4. we believe there ought to be only two places at which law-terms should be held , at Boston and in the interior ; and that all legal questions ought to be argued thoroughly , and considered maturely , before they are decided . We are aware of the objections of delay and expense ; but a tardy decision is better than a wrong one , and nothing is more manifest than the impolicy and mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , nor believe that the change we propose would produce delay . On the contrary , we are certain that it would produce greater despatch , and earlier decisions . The calm and settled attention of eight weeks is sufficient for the determination of any earthly question , but the hurried glance of az* evening or two , on the circuits* affords no ade // quate means of correctly deciding important and intricate causes . They , of course , are continued for months , under the present system , for the purpose of allowing to the court the means , which we propose to furnish in all cases . Nor Reed the expense he more burdensome to suitors , than it is at present . The legislature can guard this point . As several decisions reported by Mr Tyng have already been overruled , we trust it is not indecorous to intimate that there may be several others which would not have been made , had the causes been more fully argued , and more maturely considered . And we know of no method so eligible as that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar and the bench . It is not true , as is too often supposed , that the court only are responsible for incorrect adjudications . It is often the fault of counsel , as might easily be shown , and as every lawyer will admit . The bar was instituted to assist the court , and whenever the proper assistance is withheld , the bar is false to its trust . The reputation of the profession , in Massachusetts , is deeply concerned in the plan that we have proposed . They will not be scandalized by the suggestion , that the Reports do not present them , as a body , so prominently , either in point of learning or accumen , as to cause exultation when compared with the bar of some other states , as they are exhibited by their own reporters . This , we fully believe , is the effect of the present system , under which questions are often submitted for the sake of despatch , or to avoid labor , without argument , or at best but carelessly and superficially discussed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without reward . But we will not at this time pursue these remarks further . An earnest wish for the advancement of our jurisprudence , and an unalterable persuasion that the plan we have suggested is one of the easiest , and most obvious to effect it , have elicited these few suggestions . It is time a distinction was made , broad and everlasting , between the trade and the profession of the law . It has sometimes been thought that certainty in statute law might be promoted by reducing all that has been enacted upon one subject , though at distant intervals , into one chapter . We trust the ill success of such attempts will prevent their repetition . The present Probate Law of Massachusetts is a // standing , monitory memento on this subject , and justifies the following sensible and modest suggestion in the advertisement to Foley 's Poor Laws. - ' It has been for some time proposed to reduce all the laws relating to the Poor into one . But I humbly submit it to better judgments , whether it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and xneaning have been determined by various decisions , and to go on making supplemental acts , where these are found defective , than to run the hazard of a new one , which perhaps may be liable to as many misconstructions as the former have already gone through . ' Two very recent decisions , one in the court of king 's bench , the other in the supreme court of Massachusetts , on the construction of the statute of frauds and perjuries , strongly evince the different effect , on different judges , of doubts strongly expressed and often repeated . At the very time that the court in England unanimously held that all the doubts concerning the decision in Wain vs . Warlters , 5 East 10 , were idle and not to be regarded , the court in Massachusetts denied that decision , and anticipated its reversal whenever it should be again brought directly into judgment in the court where it was made . Mr Greenleaf informs us , in the advertisement prefixed to his book , that the present edition is a very small one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain the judgment of the profession as to the utility of the work and the manner of its execution , and their aid , in augmenting the collection , should this attempt he favourably received . ' Of the utility of the work there can be but one opinion . A manual , which should present at a glance , or furnish the means of readily ascertaining what has been repudiated , denied , doubted or limited in its application , in the voluminous and evergrowing volumes of judicial decisions , has long been a desideratum . It is obviously , however , a work which no single hand can rationally hope to render complete . The aid of the profession is therefore wisely solicited , and we hope will be liberally imparted . For accomplishing so much , Mr Greenleaf is entitled to great credit. - In the execution of the work , we find one great fault , which we doubt not will be corrected in a future edition . The point overruled , doubted , or limited in its application , is frequently omitted . This omission occurs seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : . /lnon&amp;mous Say . 70.  |p1.  145 . Overruled in Doe vs . Redfern , 12 // East 113 . ' A reader who is destitute of Savile 's and of East 's reports would derive no benefit from this information , and if he possessed both , he ought not to be obliged to examine them to ascertain what Mr G. states to have been overruled . We have noticed some errors in fact , but they are extremely few . In the 67th page , the case of the king vs . Young * Glennie , 2 Anst. 448 , is said to be overruled by by that of Iggulden vs . . IVIay , 2 N R. 452 , and by other cases which have not the slightest bearing upon it . This may he a typographical error . We know of no case that overrules that of the king vs . Young * . al . We believe it to be sound law , and confirmed by subsequent decisions . See 3 Anst . SI 1 , 2 Taunt. 254 , and several cases in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 766 , impugns it . We trust Mr Greenleaf will show us , in a future edition , the differences in the decisions of different states on the same question . This might be done with small labor , and would greatly enhance the value of the work . For instance , that in New York and New Hampshire , the officer who presides at a popular election is not answerable for rejecting the vote of a *ualifled elector , unless he acts maliciously or corruptly . In Massachusetts the contrary is determined . The departures from the common law of England , in the different states , might also be added without more labor than the addition would repay . Indeed there is in the present edition some information of this and , but it is not so full as is desirable . The law , ' says lord llardwicke , does not consist of particular instances only ; but in the reason which runs through and governs those cases which have been determined . ' A single judgment , therefore , should not disincline the court to review their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subsequent discussion . Optima legum interpres est res perpetue similiter judicata . The freedom and intrepidity of Mr Bacon Wood , as ( lisplayed in XVightwick 's reports , are worthy of all commendation . Mr Greenleaf will have rendered to bis profession a most eminent service , if by presenting so many examples of corrected error , he shall induce his brethren to examine decisions without fear , and the courts to revise them without reluctance .
