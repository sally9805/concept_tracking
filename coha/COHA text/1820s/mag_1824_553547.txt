txt ART . 111. - Letters from Paris , on the Causes and Consequences of the French Revolution . By WILLIAM C. SOMERVILLE . Baltimore . Edward J. Coale. 1822 . Svo. pp. 390 . Tuis work , containing a review of the recent political history of France , is obviously the production of one familiar with the literature and language of the French , and industrious in obtaining correct sources of information . An American , returning from a tour in Europe , can hardly perform a more useful service , than by publishing a dispassionate examination of the civil condition of the continental states . This is a subject about which we need information , and such information as can not be easily collected except in the countries themselves . It is the leading object of Mr Somerville to show , that the French Revolution was justified by sufficient causes , that the spirit of liberty has not to bear the reproach of the enormities which attended it , that it has been followed by many permanent effects beneficial to France , and , finally , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must under some form at last be triumphant . We hope that all these positions are true- ones . Some of them certainly are so . Our author 's remarks extend to a wide range of former history and present politics , and we must content ourselves with touching on some of the general topics which they suggest . Whoever considers the state of Europe about twenty years before the close of the last century , can not but perceive that all the forms of government were ripe for change . A desire for civil liberty began to be active among the nations , just as three centuries before the understanding had revolted against the tyranny of the church over the conscience . But at the time of the reformation , there were no examples of a successful vindication of the freedom of faith ; while now the government of England had served for two centuries as a monument of the tranquillity and glory , which are secured by free institutions ; and a recent yet splendid revolution , in a distant quarter of the world , bad established the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Whatever remained of the forms of the middle ages had // 51 ceased to be respectable , because it was no longer sustained by the state of society . It needed not much of the prophetic spirit to foretell the speedy dissolution of the German empire . And even in the few free governments , the Dutch republic was weakened and distracted by the collisions of armed factions , and the fatal invitation given by each party to foreign princes to join in the struggle ; while Venice , like a merchant who has withdrawn from business , was no longer enumerated among the influential powers . Morals and honor had long since lost their control over politics . For a statesman to have been a philanthropist , or a man of strict integrity in his public functions , would have been an anomaly . The different kings , possessed of scattered dominions , and passionately desirous of consolidating their power and connecting their territories , made exchanges of provinces , as if allegiance and willing submission to government were matters of barter and trade . The strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral energy of nations was entirely forgotten . All the princes of the continent had their standing armies , and the people was everywhere defenceless . But the finances of no one were in a condition , which promised permanent security and prosperity ; and no government was strenuously supported by the affections of its subjects . The power of public opinion , which is now universally conceded , was just beginning to make itself felt and known . Salutary principles were finding their way slowly among the people , but had not yet been defended by loud expressions of general assent . The principles of a liberal democracy began to be at work in the monarchies , and it was seen , not only that the interests of the people and of the princes , but also their desires and purposes were at variance . The ruler and the ruled were arrayed against each other , and even to the superficial observer there seemed no doubt , which party would be the uppermost . But though the advocates of ancient usage had their armies already organized and at command , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , it was still obvious , that hereditary rank had lost its control over the mind , and that the resources of the people , when brought into action , would produce results of incalculable importance . // It was easy therefore to foresee , that a struggle would ensue between hereditary privileges and natural rights ; and it was also to be expected , that the defenders of the former would be confident in maintaining what long usage had yielded to them , would feel strong in the forces , which were at their disposal , and despise opposition from a party , which had no public representatives , no influence in the government , and no means of organizing or wielding an army . Add to this , that the manners of the higher orders had grown thoroughly dissolute ; the sanctity of marriage contracts was treated as a jest ; the connexion between parent and child was dissolved at birth ; the bonds of natural fondness served no longer to restrain or guide the energies of the young . And yet the nobility claimed the same superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of contemplative devotion sanctified and elevated the character of woman , and disinterested valor , and honor , and education , conferred real superiority , no less than a poetic interest , on the champions of chivalry . The spirits of men rose against this tyranny of vice and rank . The kiws , unjustly administered , left the mechanic and the tradesman to defray the expenses of the government , and feed the vices of the nobles ; and justice and prudence demanded opposition to so unequal a condition . The haughty superiority claimed by the nobles , was now a superiority of birth , not of intelligence and benefits ; and therefore the pride of men could endure it no longer . A word from a minister , a scrap of paper signed by royalty , could imprison at pleasure , without reason , and without termination . Science and poetry were restrained in their efforts , and truth could not make her appearance in the world , unless she too paused , and asked permission in the antichambers of the powerful . Is it strange then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were held ? They felt , moreover , that the cords which bound them were decayed , and that it needed only a strong arm to rend them asunder . The remarks , which we have made , do not apply to France alone , but to nearly the whole of the European continent . For when the revolution commenced in that kingdom , the other nations were watching its progress with the deepest anxiety , prepared to imitate its institutions if they should prove to be wise and salutary . // In tracing the causes of this state of things in France , Mr Somerville ascends far into anterior history , and shows the gradual operation of evils , which had long been increasing . The greatest and best kings of France , ' he observes , have been those who were not born with a certain prospect of wearing the crown , but caine into possession of it by accident , after having learned wisdom in the school of adversity . ' p. 72* Louis Twelfth , Francis First , and Henry Fourth , are the princes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France prior to the revolution . The benevolent character of Louis Twelfth , which made him desirous of promoting the happiness of the nation , and careful to avoid oppression , secured to France internal tran .. quillity and prosperity , though his unhappy desire of Italian conquests continued the ruinous expeditions against Milan . After all his reverses it would still seem , that at his death , little was wanting to the domestic prosperity of France , but the lustre of the fine arts and letters . The influence of Francis First on the character of his nation was great and permanent . He rendered his own age miserable by his ambition of conquest , and his headstrong chivalrous courage , but he gave an impulse to learning , and introduced the fine arts from Italy . The first of the Lombard artists , the incomparable Lebnardo , is said to have died in his embrace , and Benvenuto Cellini , that most ingenious , interesting semibarbarian , was for a considerable time his pensioner . Yet he was too much a voluptuary to be either truly great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to burn , even while policy dictated an alliance with protestant Germany . The years , which succeeded the death of Francis , exhibit France distracted by internal factions , disgraced by the atrocious crimes of the Guises , and deprived of all foreign influence during the decline of the kingdom . At length Henry Fourth appeared to save and restore her . He had been disciplined in the school of persecution and adversity , and his natural qualities were so excellent and so amiable , that , but for the stain on his morals as a libertine , we might rank him among those , whose memory good men should cherish and defend . Mr Somerville , who is no admirer of Louis Fourteenth , dwells with complacency on the excellence of Henry 's // character , the order , regularity , and justice which he introduced , and the plans for future improvement which he devised . He encouraged agriculture , promoted learning , proposed improvements in the inland navigation , and was instant in his endeavors to promote toleration and annihilate the influence of fanaticism . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity of France , and its safety from disnemberment and civil murders . In 1624 , the ministry of Cardinal Richilieu commenced , and during the eighteen years that it continued , his powerful influence was pernicious to liberty . To increase the royal authority at home , and extend the . influence of France on the councils of Europe , were the guiding principles of his policy . Richilieu endeavored to destroy virtue by converting honest men into courtiers . In order to weaken the influence of the nobles in the provinces , and destroy their popularity , be obliged them to live in Paris . ' His system of policy , which went to invigorate the head at the expense of all the other members of the body politic , created the fatal ascendency of Paris over France . ' p. 85 . Yet , at the death of Richilien and Louis Thirteenth , France was beginning to gather some of the fruits of the wise administration of Sully . ' The state of society , of industry , and of letters , was improving . Corneille had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his reputation . The nation , however , was still involved in superstition , and the laws enjoined death as a punishment for whatever superstition might convert into crime . Of Louis Fourteenth we have never been able to hold a very elevated opinion . Admiration is lavished on kings , for whom fewer virtues , than are necessary to ensure respect as a private man , gain the reputation of justice , clemency , and a liberal fondness for the arts . Louis was educated to play the king , and this he learnt to do with success . He knew how to impose by a stateliness of manner , but that very stateliness betrays a weakness of character , and a consciousness of wanting direct superiority ; and the pleasure , which he received from observing that others were intimidated by his deportment , betrays all the insignificance of vanity . As a politician he was unjust and cruel ; criminally ambitious ; still more criminally fanatical ; prodigal and improvident . He found a kingdom in opulence , and at his death he left the // nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the merits of his ministers and their claims to public gratitude , the most different estimates have been formed ; but during his long career the administration had no unity of character , a sure proof that his own mind did not direct it . When Louis Fourteenth read Telemachus , he called it a libel on his reign . What severer censure can be passed on his character as a king ? As to the arts , he encouraged them in so far as they were subservient to his own vanity . Some of the first artists of his age were employed in decorating the palace walls of Versailles ; but the subjects given them were of a nature to chill the warm impulses of genius . And in letters it is melancholy to learn , that Racine , the finest poet of his age , could be so weak as to pine under royal censure ; still more melancholy to find the virtuous Archbishop of Cambray rejected and persecuted , for inculcating simple lessons of morality . But not to insist on his particular hostility to one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not read , that Louis called forth original genius , or rewarded it very bountifully , nor that he rewarded any but such as repaid his protection by flattery . It is right , that the French should regard the age , in which Louis sat upon the throne , as an age of national glory . But it was glorious , not for the extended dominions of his kingdom , nor for the splendid victories , which were followed by as disastrous defeats ; but because the men of letters gave to France a moral influence throughout the continent . The Grecian masterpieces in tragedy were imitated , and dramas were composed in rivalship of them , with the same severity of invention and careful execution , the same unity of design and manner , the same nobleness and heroic efforts of passion , and the Grecian heroes reappeared on the stage in their ancient sublimity , having lost only so much of their peculiar characteristics , as was needed to secure for them the sympathies of a modern nation . The French taste became the European taste ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated person of each sex , and thus the intelligence and literature of France were successful in gaining universal sovereignty , which was the more secure because *willingly conceded . This command over the mind was // achieved by the men of letters , not by Louis ; and the Muse never manifested her superiority more remarkably . And why should not the truth be spoken plainly of the character of Louis Fourteenth as a private man ? He was a libertine , and yet a superstitious devotee . He was duped by his courtiers , governed by his mistress , beloved by nobody . How could he have heen amiable , in whose hour of death not one friend was present ? Mercenary hands closed the eyes of the monarch , who had at one time made Europe tremble for her independence . There is but one passage in his life , which is full of moral interest . It is the moment , when just before his end he calls his grandson to his bedside , and gives him the advice as of a man , whom approaching death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ' says he , in the taste which I have had for war ; follow good counsels ; endeavor to be a solace to your people , that which I was so utterly unhappy as not to have been . ' Louis Fourteenth died , as one ambitious of conquest deserves to die , a disappointed man . His history teaches the necessity of making a noble end the grand object of life , so that , if it be not attained , the mind may at least be saved from misery , through a consciousness of noble purposes . We do not desire to investigate the impiety and profligacy of the succeeding regency and reign . Religion , justice , sound policy , human nature , even the majesty of God , were wilfully outraged , mocked , and profaned . It is known , that the licentiousness of the East was renewed at Paris ; but under what a difference of circumstances . In the East the voluptuousness of the sovereign is countenanced by hereditary usage , by the established laws , by the national religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide spreading , desolating profligacy , in opposition to public morals , in violation of the laws , and in defiance of the religion , whose precepts should intimidate the audacity of libertinism , and teach the necessity of selfdenial . With respect to the revolution , we may observe , that it was accelerated during this period by the increasing derangement of the finances , by the profligacy of the court , which took from religion its sanctity , from the nobles their ancient respectability , from the throne its dignity and its terror , and lastly by the misrule of corrupt ministers , who weakened the // government at home , and deprived it of all foreign influence . Louis Sixteenth , it has often been observed , in a peaceful situation might have exercised all the virtues of philanthropy . But he had not mind enough to perceive in what condition be was placed , nor resources and energy enough to act with promptness and decision in the emergencies , which were continually rising . His adhesion to the popular measures came too tardily to inspire gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at one time he seemed to recognise the folly of opposing the public will ; and at another to entertain a secret hope of successfully counteracting it . He showed some traces of magnanimity in overstepping ancient prejudice , and making a protestant , a foreign republican , and still worse in the view of hereditary pride , a merchant , his minister of finances ; but the appointment of a plebeian was followed by his dismission and banishment , so that the king exposed his feebleness by yielding , while he alienated all confidence by attempting to recede . Mr Somerville is always careful to vindicate the spirit of liberty from participation in crime , and his remarks on the crisis now under consideration are more circumstantial . Two points become clear from considering the preceding periods of history . France needed to be relieved from the weight of feudal oppression , and the moral and intellectual condition of the nation was such , as could have been expected from the long continuance of a depraved and depraving despotism . The government was weak ; the national religion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce was restricted by unjust laws ; agriculture was injured by the multitude of holidays ; the court was licentious ; vague and perhaps perverse notions of liberty were circulating among the people ; the throne was supported by few men of untarnished integrity ; opinion had ceased to be the support of monarchy ; the demands of the treasury surpassed its resources ; and feudal usage still exempted the nobles and the clergy from taxation . Add to this the condition of the nation ; that the nobles were for the most part ignorant and corrupt ; fond of their privileges and vain of their distinction ; that the people , little advanced in civilization , only felt themselves oppressed and on the verge of ruin ; // that wit and genius were busy in throwing ridicule on the false pretensions of the higher orders , and the absurdities of despotism ; that men of cunning , reason , and overpowering eloquence were engaged in discussing the character of governments and the methods of reform ; and that politicians of most acute understandings , some of them ingenious in sophistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical experience , were investigating every subject connected with education , government , and religion . As an expedient against present ruin the States General were assembled . This was the moment , when it became possible for the people to express their discontent , to enforce their just demands , and to secure for themselves a guarantee against future oppression . Yet several circumstances were of inauspicious omen . The privileged orders were still infatuated with a love of their rank and immunities ; the king and the royal party were never prudent enough to foresee what would be imperatively demanded ; and , instead of conceding in season to excite confidence in the people , they retained everything till it was violently claimed . The States General , formed into a Constituent Assembly , were prepared to reform ; yet in a country where no free institutions had ever existed , how was it possible to collect a class of practical statesmen ? Moreover , they began a reform , to which no limits were set , and where there were no landmarks to guide . Yet the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity has no cause to blush for the principles which the assembly maintained . The Constituent Assembly , ' says Mr Somerville , proclaimed universal toleration in matters of religion , and thus made virtue the test of piety , and took away from hypocrisy the mask of truth ; it rendered monastic seclusion obligatory only on the consciences of devotees , and thus relieved many from the intolerable hardship of being imprisoned for life , in spite of repentance . It abolished Lettres de Cachet , and thus deprived the king of the power of exiling and ruining any individual , or of shutting him up for life in solitary confinement to gratify private resentment , or the persecuting caprice of any great man ; it forbade the future use of torture , and thus deprived the amateurs of cruelty of all opportunity of enjoying spectacles of agony ; it ordered all criminal prosecutions to be carried on in public , and thus stript prosecutors and false witnesses of the chance of perjuring themselves with impunity ; whilst , // by adopting the trial by jury , it secured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent , but that most beautiful privilege of a British subject , the right of being presumed innocent until proved guilty . By establishing the liberty of the press , it secured to truth an ultimate triumph over error , in spite of the abuse of that privilege , which followed in the first hours of its fruition . By putting down the peculiar privileges of the noblesse , and by limiting the prerogatives of the crown , it sought to preserve personal freedom . By exploding the whole system of monopoly , it revived industry , and by suppressing the motley group of provincial laws , one of the relics of feudal barbarism , it opened the way for the establishment of a regular tariff , and a general code of laws . By the division and sale of the great estates of the clergy and crown , it brought them into cultivation , and rescued an immense body of people from a state of idleness , which perpetuated their ignorance . By arming the national guards or militia , it covered France with a shield ; and by renouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her neighbors all excuse for assailing her . Such , as far as I can learn from history and tradition , were the principal acts of the Constituent Assembly . ' pp. 148-149 . With this the French revolution , properly speaking , was terminated . Had France been permitted by foreign nations to have matured her institutions in peace , and had her king been honestly and energetically attached to freedom and justice , the nation would have risen at once to a high degree of happiness and power , and other nations would have beer* prompted to imitate her institutions by peaceable reforms . But the members of the Constituent Assembly were not permitted to complete their work . A law prohibited their reelection ; and a host of new politicians , eager to distinguish themselves by farther reforms or innovations , composed the Legislative Assembly . The spirit of liberty now began to be supplanted by that of lawlessness . It has been often disputed* whether atheism or superstition is the worst enemy of religion ; it may in like manner be doubted , whether abject submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the most adverse to liberty . The former ruins the present prosperity of men , but the latter mocks their hopes , and cheats them of success when it seems certain . The French nation had become engrained with the vices of a long continuing des .. postism ; government seemed but another name for oppression ; and thus the nation could be led to acts of cruelty by men , who pretended a fanatical admiration of liberty , and yet // were chiefly influenced by their desire of private aggrandize*. went . A free people is never a merciless one . Mr Somerville analyses the character of the Legislative Assembly , the National Convention , and the fearful governments , which succeeded . During these days the enlightened defenders of liberty were possessed of little influence . Necker was in exile ; La Fayette was obliged to fly for his safety ; and many of the purest advocates of free institutions were massacred , or transported to America . The crimes of this period were the offspring of the corruption , which the ft*rmer despotism had rendered almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely to an evil spirit in the nation , but to pride , excited by foreign invasion . The most atrocious deeds were committed in moments of the greatest peril . The author next proceeds to the advancement of Napoleon , and treats of his character , and the benefits which he conferred upon France in the first period of his elevation . The French people did not submit to him from fickleness , nor from indifference to liberty . He came upon them , when they were exhausted by unnatural efforts , and desired nothing so ardently as repose . In continuation of this subject , Mr Somerville devotes several letters to observations on the govern-. went of the emperor , his fall , the restoration and unwise ad*-ministration of the Bourbons , the return of Napoleon , hi* second abdication , and the second invasion of France by the allies . In 1819 the administration of Decazes gave to liberty an opportunity of developing , its powers . During his short ministry all accounts agree , that the nation received a new impulse , and improved in industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfect , and the government began to gain the confidence of the nation . Decazes seems to have fallen , from a want of sufficient disinterestedness . He could have continued in office , if he had been uniformly true to a liberal policy As the event has shown , the liberal party were not discreet in opposing him . Had they made some sacrifices , and given over contending for points , which they could only contend for , without any prospect of success , they might have upheld a more than moderately liberal ministry* In their sincere love of perfectly free institutions , and their consequent ur*willingness to ma*ke any co*1pxomise with // circumstances , or in their triumphant expectations of soon possessing all authority , they united with their bitterest enemies to bring about the fall of Decazes , and lost the only opportunity of securing present liberty to their country . The insincerity of Decazes , and the imprudence of the liberal party , were followed by the complete annihilation of the political influence of both , by a royalist ministry , a series of arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those changes in the mode of election , which have secured to the aristocracy the continued , and , as it would seem from the character of the members recently chosen , the almost undisputed possession of political authority and influence . Mr Somerville enters largely on these topics ; explains the royalist politics , and speaks of the arguments used in favor of despotism . He closes his work with observations on the internal condition of France , and much valuable and practical information on the progress of agriculture and manufactures . The period of history , through which we have been eonducted , does but increase our admiration of liberty , and our belief of its final triumph . Present prospects are indeed gloomy , not so much because the conspiracy of kings is irre-* sistible , as because the people are passive and content to endure . Perhaps a despot , of powerful mind and large resources , could lull the advocates for reform once more to silence , and bring back the lethargic apathy , from which Europe has but just been awakened . Yet during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have indeed been followed by too few advantages to satisfy the hopes of philanthropy , the general progress of liberal opinion is distinctly visible . The despots have grown more considerate , are cautious in their acts of tyranny , and avoid prodigality and waste . Public opinion is an invisible , but constant and influential power , which makes itself felt in every cabinet of Europe . Farther , that constitutional governments are superior to arbitrary monarchies is a principle , which is no longer questioned . The emperor of Russia has acknowledged it at Warsaw and at Petersburgb ; and the Prussian king pledged his royal faith , that he would act by it . The press is not yet free ; but of old the censorship was a regular , established affair ; now it is defended only as a necessary infringement of the public rights , a temporary exercise of a dictatorial author*. // ity , required by the urgency of the times . The principle is conceded , though the right itself is withheld . For these acts of injustice the party in power quote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strengthen their argument by the recent practice of the English parliament . If we consider the permanent results of the French revolution , they are auspicious and consolatory . What has France gained by it ? C She has gained , ' Mr Somerville replies , a new territorial division of the kingdom , by which her various dissimilar provinces have been melted down into one community ; an abolition of the privileges of the noblesse ; the suppression of an oppressive ecclesiastical system , and of the right in religious corporations to hold landed property ; an equal assessment of taxes over the whole kingdom ; the establishment of a uniform system of jurisprudence , with the trial by jury ; a respect for talents over birth , with a free access of any Frenchman to any employment , civil or military ; the equality of all , in the eye of the law ; the subdivision of the great estates of the kingdom ; the emancipation of industry from the shackles of Jurandes and Maitrisses , and consequently great improvements in manufactures and husbandry ; freedom of conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least for books ; a representative form of government , with a long et cetera of inferior advantages . ' p. 13 . Much progress has , therefore , been made ; and where a representation once exists , the character of the government will be still farther modijied by the character of those who are governed . Yet many causes unite to impede the present establishment of perfectly free institutions . The peasantry of France are extremely ignorant . Whole villages may be found , where not more than three or four can read . Even in the immediate vicinity of Paris , and within the echoes of the legislative debates , there are towns in which not three newspapers are taken , and those not by persons , who actually belong to the people . The eloquent pleas for liberty are of no effect , for they are not heard by the mass of the nation . Hence no general political spirit exists , except when the popularity of individuals is concerned , or as the taxes of the state affect private interests ; and national attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elections , and the free expressions of opinion . So great is the popular ignorance , that the most liberal politicians have // never advocated any very wide extension of the elective franchise , believing it to be first necessary to educate the nation . Thus the first obstacle to the progress of liberty in France is found in the political ignorance and uninstructed condition of the people . It is also a characteristic of that cheerful nation to look at the bright side of a picture , to bear necessary evils with an elastic sprightliness , which is almost magnanirmty . They are always content , if possible , and if there be anything captivating in the party in power , they are willing to applaud and coincide with the majority . The fondness for living at Paris would be productive of good , by promoting the circulation of political ideas , were it not , that Paris exercises an absolute dominion over the mind and tastes of the nation . The country is left without its due influence ; men throng from all quarters to the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form enlarged views from the collisions of various independent parties , but to learn and adopt the principles and tastes of the metropolis . Yet , after all , how can liberty make rapid progress in a country , where the peculiar privileges of citizens are hardly known and little esteemed ? The French have not yet learned to value their political existence ; they have so long been subjects , that they hardly know what it is to participate in governing . They set a disproportionate value on social equality . It is not enough to secure the rights of person and property , liberty of speech , and equality before all tribunals ; they will admit of no difference in the terms of intercourse , and are offended at any attention bestowed on high rank or superior wealth . This is a weakness , which has been very apparent in many parts of recent French history , and has proved injurious , because it has made common courtesies sometimes withdraw the attention from actual injustice . We find another class of causes , which have retarded the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . They have never acted with that perfect union , which resigns all private and peculiar feelings to the great object of the public good . They have mingled their ancient prejudices and enmities with their defence of liberty ; and they have never had any well organized system of cooperation . Their metaphysical refinements in politics have been of no general advantage . They have formed and advocated // July , systems of polity , when there was need of champions for practical reform , and the most ingenious arguments in the chamber of deputies have sometimes been made without effect , because they were founded on the theories of indivi .. duals . But far more injury has been done by an unconciliating , confident course . They relied on the justice and popularity of their cause ; the nation was probably disposed to support them with steadiness ; but it desired peace , was conscious of prosperity , knew that their finances were in a better condition than those of any European nation , and that France was fast regaining prosperity and wealth . The popular leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought , on the sea of political commotion ; but the waves were still . The confidence of the liberals injured their cause , for it excited opposition . The royalists , at the first and second restoration , had been moved by the strong passion of revenge to do some things , which were prohibited by the charter . The liberals urged relentlessly the revocation of such acts ; and in one instance at least , in the case of those who were banished by a royal edict , demanded as a right , what the king was already resolved to concede as a proof of leniency . In these cases they acted as high minded men , yet consulted but poorly for the final advantage of their cause . The liberal side in the chamber of deputies lost much influence , from the circumstance of the various elements of which it was composed . Some were suspected of having formerly been too sincerely attached to the fortunes of the emperor ; some were charged with a design of overturning the regal government ; and the belief was prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference of liberty , the zeal of many was quickened by the expectation of preferment under the new order of things . A third class of causes , impeding the progress of liberty in France , is found in the essential obstacles , which must always exist in a country where monarchical institutions are deeply rooted . The atheism of the last century , and the terrible irreligion of France during a portion of her revolutionary governments , h*td not been able to wear away even the rust of superstition ; and all the enthusiasm for liberty , all the suffering under the despotism of the emperor , all the crosses and dis*. // appointments under the restoration , have not been enough to eradicate the attachment of the nation to a regal government . The desire of a repuLdic in France was never a deeply rooted attachment to that form of government , but only the frenzy of a moment . At present the organization of the army , the church , the municipal and provincial jurisdiction , presuppose a monarch at their head , and a monarch possessed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effaced . It is uncomfortable to many to reject forms , which are associated with stories of ancient valor and renown , to part with a government , which is connected with every tradition , every work of art , every public enterprise . Yet while there is reason to fear , that the constitution of France will not he administered in the spirit of impartial liberty , there is no ground for fearing its absolute , nor even its virtual abolition . The royalists do not desire such an abolition , for it would be to surrender the power they have gained , and to receive from royal caprice the honors and consideration , which they are now alAe to obtain , and to disqense by the laws . The utmost which they can meditate , consists in such niodilkations of the charter , as will secure &amp;ll power to themselves . Hitherto the men of science and letters have been distinguished for the adulation they have paid to royalty . They are so still . But some of them enjoy the rank of peers and counsellors of state ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first eminence in science , is grati. * fled by the dignity , and though they never will advocate the principles of democracy , they will not advocate such an ex* clusive superiority of the higher orders , as would leave themselves without political distinction . We accustom ourselves also to have good hopes respecting the future . The combination of the allied sovereigns can not endure , if any inference may be drawn from the fate of former coalitions , or from the elements of which the present is composed . The respective powers have had , and must continue to have , mutual jealousies . Though the sword of the Prussian now rests peaceably in its scabbard , it can not be forgotten , that it first gained the lustre and keenness of its edge in its contests with Austria . It is , moreover , the true policy *f Prussia to favor liberal principles , and she can not long revOL . X*X. -.  - -  NO. 44. // main untrue to her higher destiny . Her government is administered with unparalleled economy . The king expends , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attendants do not surpass the limits of a moderate private fortune . And as for the execution of civil justice , there is no country where the guiltless is more sure to escape , or the injured to gain redress . Still more may be said in praise of Prussia . She has of late years uniformly and systematically made exertions to diffuse the advantages of education , and promote every liberal science and every elegant art . The private galleries of the king have been collected , the palaces at Potsdam and Berlin stripped of their ornaments , that public schools might be opened to the artists , and a constant source of improvement and delight to the public . A liberal Protestant church is supported by a regular , learned , and sufficiently numerous ministry ; village schools are provided for the instruction of the peasantry ; every considerable town has at least one gymnasium , and sometimes several ; while the universities of Berlin , Halle , Bonne , and Breslau , yield in excellence to none , and have only G6ttingen for a successfi* rival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in th centre of Europe , exposed to an attack on all sides , whether from France , Austria , or the Czar , it has been felt , that nothing but the public spirit of the nation can preserve its existence , and that spirit has been kept up by the gradual abolition of all feudal wrongs , and the general diffusion of intelligence . A government , which entrusts its- security to the keeping of a well instructed nation , is essentially a free one . We do not believe that the Holy Alliance can continue ; and much may be expected from the progress of political knowledge . The principles of government are every day more widely and universally discussed . They are exhibiting themselves also in practice on a grander scale than the world has ever yet witnessed . The new republics , which are start ing* into existence in the American hemispheres , will exercise a powerful influence on the politica condition of Europe . A system of states will be formed , embracing all parts of the civilized world , and , by containing examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide from practical experience , which forms are usually administered with The soundest wisdom , and are productive of the greatest good . // We trust also not a little in the native force of liberty . Its orb may be darkened , but never quenched ; its beams obscured for the moment , but tomorrow repaired . From the days of Marathon to that of Waterloo , whenever the armies of liberty and despotism have been arrayed against each other , the fairest cause has almost always been victorious . A nation rising in arms is not to be subdued by mercenary troops . It was the spirit of liberty , though under the form of enthusi*stic frenzy , which made the arms of the French republic invincible ; the spirit of liberty left to Napoleon in Spain victories without conquest , and trophies without dominion ; it was the spirit of liberty , which animated the German nation when they collected all the zeal and force for which their character is remarkable , and poured across the Rhine to protect their independence . And still at Waterloo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind , and the Prussians , yet the dupes of royal promises , fought , as they believed , for national independence and internal freedom . But , whatever may be the ultimate condition of Europe , the lessons of liberty will continue to be taught . We return home from the review of European governments , with new love for our national advantages , and with new zeal to support them . We recur to this topic , which is , as it should be , a very common one , not from a spirit of national vanity , but that we may feel gratitude to the great Parent of the nations , under whose Providence our republic has grown up to prosperity ; and may cherish with the more sacred love the memory of those who achieved our liberties , and be mutually encouraged to watch for the preservation and integrity of our institutions . In other countries even the best men are divided in their views of politics , but in America there exists and can exist no such division . Here all our feelings are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the memory of our fathers , all unite to inspire the love of a liberal democracy . We have no deluding recollection of the virtues and prowess of chivalry to cheat us into admiration of feudal institutions . Safe from foreign influence , blessed with an even and impartial administration of justice , and feeling our mild government only by the freedom and safety which it ensures us , we can observe with calmness the political career of ' // our public men , and choose the most intelligent and patriotic to administer our laws , dreading no extensions of prerogative ; no unlawful usurpations , no attacks on our private peace and comforts , and acknowledging no triumvirate but the eternal one , of truth , virtue , and liberty .
