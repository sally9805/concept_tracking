txt ART . I.-Redw0od , a Tale . 2 vols. l2rno. pp. 565 . New YorL Bliss and White . 1824 . THIS IS a story of domestic life , the portraiture of what passes by our firesides and in our streets , in the calm of the country , and amidst a prosperous and well ordered community . The writer , who , we understand , is the same lady to whom the public is already indebted for another beautiful little work of a similar character , has not availed herself of the more obvious and abundant sources of interest , which would naturally suggest themselves to the author of a fictitious history*the scene of which should be laid in the United States . She has not gone back to the infancy of our country , to set before us the fearless and hardy men , who made the first lodgment in its vast forests , men in whose characters is to be found the favorite material of the novelist , great virtues mingled with many errors , the strange land to which they had come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they were surrounded , to whose kindness they owed so much , and from whose enmity they suffered so severely . Nor does the thread of her narrative lead us through those early feuds between the different colonies of North America , who brought with them and kept alive , in their settlements , the animosities of the nations from whom they proceeded , and , in the midst of all their hardships and sufferings , contended about the division of the wilderness , with a fierce vOL. xx. -.  - -  r*ro. 47. 32 // ness and an obstinacy exasperated by the difference in the characters of those who composed them . Nor has the writer made any use of the incidents of our great national struggle for independence , at once so calamitous and so glorious , the time of splendid virtues and great sufferings , the war which separated friends , and divided families , and revived the half laid spirit of bloodshed in the uncivilised races about us , and called to our shores so many military adventurers to fight under the standard of Britain , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat under ours . She has passed by all these periods and situations , so tempting to the writer of fictitious history , so pregnant with interest and teeming with adventure , to make a more hazardous experiment of her powers . She has come down to the very days in which we live , to quiet times and familiar manners , and has laid the scene of her narrative in the most ancient and tranquil parts of the country ; presenting us not merely with the picture of what she has imagined , but with the copy of what she has observed . We have called this a comparatively harzardous experiment , and this , because it seems to us far more difficult to deal successfully with the materials which the author has chosen , than with those which she has neglected . There is a strong love of romance inherent in the human mind . We all remember how our childhood was captivated with stories of sorcerers and giants . We do not , in our riper age , forget with what a fearful and thrilling interest we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acts of desperate heroism , followed by incredible successes , of impossible dangers , and equally inpossible deliverances . And when our maturer judgment has caused us to turn with disgust , from the relation of what is contrary to the known laws of nature , we transfer the same intense attention to narratives that keep within the bounds of possibility . We love to read of imminent perils , and hairbreadth escapes , of adventures in strange lands and among strange races of men , or in times of great public commotion or unusual public calamity . Something of this taste exists in every mind , though variously modi. * fled and diversified , and contented with a greater or less degree of verisimilitude , according as the imagination is more or less inflammable . Some preserve a fondness for fictions // almost as wild as those , which amused their earlier years , while others can be pleased Ofli* with the recital of what is strictly probable . Some will listen with interest to stories of antres vast and deserts idle , ' and the adventures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their blood curdle at being told of The Anthropophagi , and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders . In reading narratives of the romantic kind , our curiosity comes in aid of the author . We are eager to learn the issue of adventures so new to us . The imagination of the reader is also ready with its favorable offices . This faculty , always busiest when we are told of scenes and events out of the range of men 's ordinary experience , expatiates at large upon the suggestions of the author , and , as we read , rapidly fills up the outline he gives with bright colors and deep shades of its own . From all these causes it may happen , that by the mere fortunate invention and happy arrangement of striking incidents , a work of fiction shall succeed in gaining the public favor , without any considerable proportion of the higher merits of that kind of writing , without any uncommon beauty of style , or any unusual degree either of pathos or humor , or splendor of imagination , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But with a novel founded on domestic incidents , supposed to happen in our own time and country , the case is different . We have seen the original , and require that there be no false coloring or distortion in the copy . We want to be delighted with the development of traits , that had escaped our observation , or of which , if observed , we had never felt the peculiar significance . It will not do to trust to the imagination of the reader to heighten the interest of such a narrative ; if it ever attempts to fill up the sketch given by the writer , it is not often in a way calculated to increase its effect , for it is done with the l ) lain and sober hues , that color the tissue of our own lives . We are too familiar with the sort of life described , we are too well acquainted with the situations in which the characters are placed , we have stood too long in the very relations out of which grows the interest of the narrative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // they are vividly and strikingly set before us . These are things which have so often moved the heart in their reality , that it refuses to be strongly affected by them in a fictitious narrative , unless they are brought home to it and pressed upon it , with more than ordinary power . They are chords that will not yield their music to the passing wind , they must be touched by the hand of a master . The mere description of ordinary , everyday scenes and events , is too plain a ban-. quet to be relished without some condiment to make it palatable . Readers require not only the exclusion of those tame scenes and incidents , without connexion or consequence , that make up so much of real life , but that the incidents set down be related with pathos , or at least with spirit or humor ; they look for natural and sprightly dialogue , and well drawn characters . On more than one occasion , we have already given somewhat at large our opinion of the fertility of our country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reasonings needed any support from successful examples of that kind of writing , as a single fact is worth a volume of ingenious theorising , we have had the triumph of seeing them confirmed beyond all controversy , by the works of a popular American author , who has shown the literary world into what beautiful creations those materials may be wrought . In like manner , we look upon the specimen before us as a conclusive argument , that the writers of works of fiction , of which the scene is laid in familiar and domestic life , have a rich and varied field before them in the United States . Indeed , the opinion on this subject , which , till lately , prevailed pretty extensively among us , that works of this kind , descriptive of the manners of our countrymen , could not succeed , never seemed to us to rest on a very solid foundation . It was rather a sweeping inference drawn from the fact , that no highly meritorious work of the kind had appeared , and the most satisfactory and comfortable way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such could be written . But it is not always safe to predict what a writer of genius will make of a given subject . Twenty years ago , what possible conception could an English critic have had of the admirable productions of the author of Waverley , and of the wonderful improvement his example has effected in that kind of composition ? // Had the idea of one of those captivating works , destined to take such strong hold on all minds , been laid before him by the future author , he would probably only have wondered at his vanity . There is nothing paradoxical in the opinion , which maintains that all civilised countries , we had almost said all countries whatever , fu**uish matter for copies of real life , embodied in works of fiction , which shall be of lasting and general intercst . Wherever there are human nature and society , there are subjects for the novelist . The passions and affections , virtue and vice , are of no country . Everywhere love comes to touch the hearts of the young , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prudence of the aged , are at hand to disturb the course of love . Everywhere there exists the desire of wealth , the love of power , and the wish to be admired , courage braving real dangers , and cowardice shrinking from imaginary ones , friendship and hatred , and all the train of motives and impulses , which affect the minds and influence the conduct of men . They not only exist everywhere , but they exist infinitely diversified and compounded , in various degrees of suppression and restraint , or fostered into unnatural growth and activity , modified by political institutions and laws , by national religions and subdivisions of those religions , by different degrees of refinement and civilisation , of poverty or of abundance , by arbitrary usages handed down from indefinite antiquity , and even by local situation and climate . Nor is there a single one of all these innumerable modifications of human character and human emotion which is not , in some degree , an object of curiosity and interest . Over all the world is human sagacity laying its plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and fortune is raising up one man and throwing down another . In none of the places of human habitation are the accesses barred against joy or grief ; the kindness of the good carries gladness into families , and the treachery of the false friend ' brings sorrow and ruin ; in all countries are tears shed over the graves of the excellent , the brave , and the beautiful , and the oppressed breathe freer when the oppressor has gone to his account . Everywhere has nature her features of grandeur and of beauty , and these features receive a moral expression from the remembrances of the // past , and the interests of the present . On her face , as on an immense theatre , the passions and pursuits of ' men are performing the great drama of human existence . At every moment , and in every corner of the world , these mighty and restless agents are perpetually busy , under an infinity of ' forms and disguises , and the great representation goes on with that majestic continuity and uninterrupted regularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will undertake to say , that the hand of genius may not pencil off a few scenes , acted in our own vast country , and amidst our large population , that shall interest and delight the world ? It is a native writer only that must or can do this . It is he that must show how the infinite diversities of human character are yet further varied , by causes that exist in our own country , exhibit our peculiar modes of thinking and action , and mark the effect of these upon individual fortunes and happiness . A foreigner is manifestly incompetent to the task ; his observation would rest only upon the more general and obvious traits of our national character , a thousand delicate shades of manner would escape his notice , many interesting peculiarities would never come to his knowledge , and many more lie would misapprehend . It is only on his native soil , that the author of such works can feel himself on safe and firm ground , that he can move confidently and fearlessly , and put forth the whole strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character and action , if executed with ability , will have a raciness and freshness about them , which will attest their fidelity , the secret charm , which belongs to truth and nature , and with which even the finest genius can not invest a system , of adscititious and imaginary manners . It is this quality , which recommends them powerfully to the sympathy and interest even of those , who are unacquainted with the original from which they are drawn , and makes such pictures from such hands so delightful and captivating to the foreigner . By superadding , to the novelty of the manners described , the interest of a narrative , they create a sort of illusion , which places him in the midst of the country where the action of the piece is going on . He beholds the scenery of a distant land , hears its inhabitants conversing about their own concerns in their own dialect , finds himself in the bosom of its families , is made the depository of their // secrets , and the observer of their fortunes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Thus it is that American novels are eagerly read in Great Britain , and novels descriptive of English and Scottish manners as eagerly read in America . It has been objected , that the habits of our countrymen are too active and practical ; that they are too universally and continually engrossed by the cares and occupations of business to have leisure for that intrigue , those plottings and counterplottings , which are necessary to give a sufficient degree of action and eventfulness to the novel of real life . It is said that we need for this purpose a class of men , whose condition in life places them above the necessity of active exertion , and who are driven to the practice of intrigue , because they have nothing else to do . It remains , however , to be proved that any considerable portion of this ingredient is necessary in the composition of a successful novel . To require that it should be made up of nothing better than the manoeuvres of those , whose only employment is to glitter at places of public resort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form plans to outshine , thwart , and vex each other , is confining the writer to a narrow and most barren circle . It is requiring an undue proportion of heartlessness , selfishness , and vice in his pictures of society . It is compelling him to go out of the wholesome atmosphere of those classes , where the passions and affections have their most salutary and . natural play , and employ his observations on that where they are most perverted , sophisticated , and corrupt . But will it be seriously contended , that he can have no other resource but the rivalries and machinations of the idle , the frivolous , and the dissolute , to keep the reader from yawning over his pictures ? Will it be urged that no striking and interesting incidents can come to pass without their miserable aid ? If our country be not the country of intrigue , it is at leastthe country of enterprise ; and nowhere are the great objects that worthily interest the passions , and call forth the exertions of men , pursued with more devotion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shores of Europe ; our countrymen have not attained a sufficient degree of certainty in their calculations to exclude it from ours . It would really seem to us , that these two sources , along with that // proportion of the blessed quality of intrigue , which even the least favorable view of out ' society will allow us , are abundantly fertile in interesting occurrences , for all the purposes of the novelist . Besides , it shnud be recollected , that it is not in any case the dull diary of ordinary occupations , or amusements , that forms the groundwork of his plot . On the contrary , it is some event , or at least a series of events , of unusual importance , standing out in strong relief from the rest of the biography of his principal characters , and to which the daily habits of their lives , whatever may be their rank or condition , are only a kind of accompaniment . But the truth is , that the distinctions of rank , and the amusements of elegant idleness , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid disguises put upon the reality of things . They are trappings which the writer of real genius , the anatomist of the human heart , strips away when he would exhibit his characters as they are , and engage our interest for them as beings of our own species . He reduces them to the same great level where distinctions of rank are nothing , and difference of character everything . It is here that James First , and Charles Second , and Louis Ninth , and Rob Roy , and Jeanie Deans , and Meg Merrilies are , by the great author of the Waverley novels , made to meet . The monarch must come down from the dim elevation of his throne , he must lay aside the assumed and conventional manners of his station , and unbend and unbosom himself with his confidants , before that illustrious master will condescend to describe him . In the artificial sphere in which the great move , they are only puppets and pageants , but here they are men . A narrative , the scene of which is laid at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nobles , and the bright assemblies of fashion , may be a very pretty , showy sort of thing , and so may a story of the glittering dances and pranks of fairies . But we soon grow weary of all this , and ask for objects of sympathy and regard , for something . the recollection of which shall dwell on the heart , and to which it will love to recur ; for something , in short , which is natural , the uneffaced traits of strength and weakness , of the tender and the comic , all which the pride of rank either removes from observation or obliterates. // If these things have any value , we hesitate not to say , that they are to be found abundantly in the characters of our countrymen , formed as they are under the influence of our free institutions , and shooting into a large and vigorous , though sometimes irregular luxuriance . They exist most abundantly in our more ancient settlements , and amidst the more homogeneous races of our large population , where the causes that produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there that the human mind has learned best to enjoy our fortunate and equal institutions , and to profit by them . In the countries of Europe the laws chain men down to the condition in which they were born . This observation , of course , is not equally true of all those countries , but when they are brought into comparison with ours , it is in some degree applicable to them all . Men spring up , and vegetate , and die , without thinking of passing from the sphere in which they find themselves , any more than the plants they cultivate think of removing from the places where they are rooted . It is the tendency of this rigid and melancholy destiny to contract and stint the intellectual faculties , to prevent the development of character , and to make the subjects of it timid , irresolute , and imbecile . With us , on the contrary , where the proudest honors in the state , and the highest deference in society , are set equally before all our citizens , a wholesome and quickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All are possessed with a spirit of ambition and a love of adventure , an intense competition calls forth and exalts the passions and faculties of men , their characters become strongly defined , their minds acquire a hardihood and activity , which can be gained by no other discipline , and the community , throughout all its conditions , is full of bustle , and change , and action . Whoever will take the pains to pursue this subject a little into its particulars , will be surprised at the infinite variety of forms of character , which spring up under the institutions of our country . Religion is admitted on all hands to be a mighty agent in moulding the human character ; and accordingly , with the perfect allowance and toleration of all religions , we see among us their innumerable and diverse influences upon the manners and temper of our people . Whatever may be his religious opinions , no one is restrained by fear of conse // consequences from avowing them , but is left to nurse his peculiarities of doctrine into what importance he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws in those particulars , which offend his conscience , the Moravian finds no barriers in the way of his work of proselytism and charity , the Roman Catholic is subjected to no penalty for pleasing himself with the magnificent ceremonial of his religion , and the Jew worships unmolested in his synagogue . In many parts of our country we see communities of that strange denomination , the Shakers , distinguished from their neighbors by a garb , a dialect , an architecture , a way of worship , of thinking , and of living , as different , as if they were in fact of a different origin , instead of being collected from the families around them . In other parts we see small neighborhoods of the Seventh Day Baptists , retaining the simplicity of manners and quaintness of language delivered down from their fathers . Here we find the austerities of puritanism preserved to this day , there the rites and doctrines of the Church of England are shown in their effect on the manners of the people , and in yet another part of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another 's feet , and profess to revive the primitive habits of the apostolic times . It is in cur country also , that these differences of character , which grow naturally out of geographical situation , are least tampered with and repressed by political regulations . The adventurous and roving natives of our seacoasts , and islands , are a different race of men from those who till the interior , and the hardy dwellers of our mountainous districts are not like the inhabitants of the rich plains , that skirt our mighty lakes and rivers . The manners of the northern states are said to be characterised by the keenness and importunity of their climate , and those of the southern to partake of the softness of theirs . In our cities you will see the polished manners of the European capitals , but pass into the more quiet and unvisited parts of the country , and you will find men , whom you might take for the first planters of our colonies . The de* scendants of the Hollanders have not forgotten the traditions of their fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ballads of Scotland still sung , in settlements whose inhabitants derive their origin from those countries . It is hardly possible that the rapid and continual growth and im // provement of our country , a circumstance wonderfully exciting to the imagination , and altogether unlike anything witnessed in other countries , should not have some influence in forming our national character . At all events , it is a most fertile source of incident . It does for us in a few short years , what , in Europe , is the work of centuries . The hardy and 5agacious native of the eastern states , settles himself in the wilderness by the side of the emigrant from the British isles ; the pestilence of the marshes is braved and overcome ; the bear , and wolf , and catamount are chased from their haunts ; and then you see cornfields , and roads , and towns springing up as if by enchantment . In the mean time pleasant Indian villages , situated on the skirts of their hunting grounds , with their beautiful green plats for dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our extending population , while new states are settled and cities founded far beyond them . Thus a great deal of history is crowded ' into a brief space . Each little hamlet , in a few seasons , has more events and changes to tell of , than a European village can furnish in a course of ages . But , if the writer of fictitious history does not find all the variety he wishes in the various kinds of our population , descended , in different parts of our country , from ancestors of different nations , and yet preserving innumerable and indubitable tokens of their origin , if the freedom with which every man is suffered to take his own way , in all things not affecting the peace and good order of society , does not furnish him with a sufficient diversity of characters , employments , and modes of life , he has yet other resources . He may bring into his plots men , whose characters and manners were formed by the institutions and modes of society in the nations beyond the Atlantic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has observed and studied . If he is not satisfied with indigenous virtue , he may take for the model of his characters men of whom the old world is not worthy , and whom it has cast out from its bosom . If domestic villany be not dark enough for his pictures , here are fugitives from the justice of Europe come to prowl in America . If the coxcombs of our own country are not sufficiently exquisite , affected , and absurd , here are plenty of silken fops from the cr*pitals of foreign kingdoms . If he finds himself in need of a class of men // more stupid and degraded , than are to be found among the natives of the United States , here are crowds of the wretched peasantry of Great Britain and Germany , flying for refuge from intolerable suffering , in every vessel that comes to our shores . Hither also resort numbers of that order of men who , in foreign countries , are called the middling class , the most valuable part of the communities they leave , to enjoy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distempered system of government can not reach them , to degrade them to the condition of the peasantry . Our country is the asylum of the persecuted preachers of new religions , and the teachers of political doctrines , which Europe will not endure ; a sanctuary for dethroned princes , and the consorts of slain emperors . When we consider all these innumerable differences of character , native and foreign , this infinite variety of pursuits and o1 ) jects , this endless diversity and change of fortunes , arid behold them gathered and grouped into one vast assemblage in our own country , we shall feel little pride in the sagacity or the skill of that native author , who asks for a richer or wider field of observation . The author of Redwood seems to be well aware of the extent and value of these resources , and has availed herself of them as amply as suited the purpose of her work . Her delineations of character are generally striking and happy , and the national peculiarities are hit off with great dexterity and effect , though perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too broadly . There is , however , very little overcharging and exaggeration ; the actors in the plot do not come upon the scene in their stage dresses , ready , on every occasion that offers , as in duty bound , to display , resolutely , and with all their might , the supposed peculiarities of the personages they represent , but they are made to look and act like people in the world about us . The characters are not only thus chastely drawn , but they are varied with exceeding art and judgment , and this variety is , for the most part , founded on essential differences . It is not with this , as with some works of the kind , which have fallen in our way , where the parts , which the several personages are made to take in the action , have little connexion with their supposed manners and dispositions , but any part will fit any character , and any character will fit any part , and , bating a few peculiarities in the // dialogue , they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words in the famous sentence with which Mons. Jourdain , in the Bourgeois Gentilhotnme , exercises the ingenuity of his instructer in philosophy . Here , on the contrary , they are made to have a complete and necessary dependence on each other , so complete , that the least change would produce mnnifest distortion and incongruity . We have some fault to find with the general plan of the story , of which we shall speak by and by , but the subordinate incidents are invented and managed with great ingenuity and felicity , and a gentle , and sustained , and gradually increasing interest , never growing violent , and never suffered to become feeble , is kept up from the beginning to the end of the work . Parts are written with deep pathos ; others display no inconsiderable share of comic power . There is much beautiful and striking description , but it is never so drawn out as to be tiresome , nor introduced so as to interrupt the interest of the story . It is evident , that the author has formed to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this does not prevent great indulgence to human error , and compassion for human infirmity , and the utmost good nature and allowance to those , whose speculations on abstract subjects have led them to different results from her own . The qualities we have enumerated are all delightfully chastened and regulated , by great good sense and sober practical wisdom , and the whole is given us through the medium of a style perspicuous and elegant . A minute examination of the work will show the grounds upon which our commendations are founded , as well as the particulars to which we mean to object ; for if in our capa* city of true critics , we should not be able to find something to blame in a work of nearly six hundred fair duodecimo rages , t were pity of our lives . ' Henry Redwood , a native of Virginia , with a mind natu-. rally turned to beneficence and virtue , becomes acquainted in early life with an unprincipled man of the name of Alsop , who succeeds in convincing him that religion is a cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his taste , however , preserve him from the gross and profligate pleasures of the companions , with whom his intimacy with Alsop associated him . Redwood had been destined by his father to be the // husband of Maria Manning , a rich cousin of his residing in the state of South Carolina . He , however , with the usual deference of young men to the arrangements of parents in such cases , becomes enamored of Mary Erwine , a young , beautiful , religious and susceptible female , who , in the excess of her affection and confidence , consents to become his wife by a secret marriage . Not long after taking this prudent step , he is solicited by Alsop to accompany him on a tour to Europe . lie applies to his father for his permission , and receives it on condition that he will claim the hand of his fair cousin immediately upon his return . On embarking for Europe he leaves behind him a packet for his wife , containing a brief note bidding her farewell , and apologising in the best manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alsop , which , in his haste , he had sent her by mistake instead of certain tender letters from Maria Manning , of which he had promised her the perusal . In this correspondence were frequent and direct allusions to his atheism and contempt of the ordinary notions of morality , some expressions of regret for the indiscreet connexion he had formed with her , and a mention of the condition on which he had received his father 's consent to his foreign tour . The packet is too faithfully delivered , and she becomes heart broken at the disclosures it contains . In the meantime Redwood visits Paris . c While he remained in the French capital , there was no suspension of excitement , not an hour for reflection , scarcely a solitary moment for the impertinent whispering of conscience . His wife , the young and innocent creature who had surrendered to him the whole treasure of her affections , abandoned , solitary , sick , and heart broken , was scarce remembered , or if remembered , was always associated with the dark cloud with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had left Paris , in the further prosecution of his travels , there were times in which she was remembered ; the powers of conscience , spell bound by the noise and glare of society , were awakened by the eloquent voice of the Divinity issuing from the eloquent places of nature . The pure streams , the placid lakes , the green hills , and the " fixed mountains looking tranquillity , ** seemed to reproach him with his desertion of nature 's fairer work ; for all the works of nature are linked together by an invisible , " electric chain . " Redwood hurried from place to place ; he tried the power of novelty , of activity ; he gazed on those ob // jects that have been the marvel and the delight of the world ; and when the first excitement was over , he felt that he could not resist the great moral Jaw , that has indissolubly joined virtue and happiness . On his arrival at Rome he found letters awaiting him there . ' vol. i. p. 71 , 72 . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married to Mary Erwine , enclosing a few lines from his wife . They are brief and cold , they intimate that she had forgiven him , but had withdrawn the passionate love she bore him , and inform him that she had gone to die in a retreat , which no endeavors of his would ever be able to discover . Soon after , Redwood returns to his native country , haunted by a remorse that makes him wretched for life . Quite indifferent to his domestic fate , he is easily prevailed upon by his friends to solicit the hand of the rich and beautiful Miss Manning , and she , after glittering a few years as his wife in the circles of fashion , dies , leaving an only child , Caroline Redwood , whom she consigns on her death bed to the care of her mother , residing in Charleston . At the age of eighteen Caroline returns to her father in Virginia , a spoiled beauty , her natural talents and dispositions perverted by a bad education received from a foolish and doating grandmother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no other accomplishments than music , dancing , and French . In a tour through the northern states with this daughter , Mr Redwood meets with an accident , by which his carriage is overturned , and his arm broken , and he is confined for some weeks in the house of Mr Lenox , a hearty , hospitable , question asking yeoman of Vermont . At this period the action of the novel commences . We do not intend to make an abstract of the whole story in this manner ; those who have seen the original will not care to read any abridgment of ours , and those who have not will be more obliged to us for referring them to the work itself . We have gone thus far only in order to make ourselves understood in the further consideration of the work . At the house of Mr Lenox we are introduced to the master of the family , whom we have already mentioned ; to Mrs Lenox , a shrewd , reasonable , intelligent matron , but not very deeply instructed in the refinements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she is familiarly called , Debby , // who by the way is a great favorite of ours , an ancient maiden of Amazonian stature , and a very strikingly drawn and original character ; and finally to the heroine of the story , Ellen Bruce , a beautiful vision of feminine sweetness , loveliness , and rectitude of heart and understanding . In the same house in which Mr Redwood was confined , there lay , on the night after his disaster , the corpse of Edward Allen , a young man who had died of a broken heart ; and his grandmother , Mrs Allen , was performing the customary duty of watching with the dead . We pass over the pathetic scene between the aged woman and a young girl , the object of Edward 's youthful affections , who in the darkness had stolen in to weep over his corpse . Another set of visiters now arrive . Ellen opened the outer door for the two females , who entered , dressed in the Shaker uniform , only remarkable for its severe simplicity and elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with square muslin handkerchiefs , pinned formally over the bosom , their hair combed back , and covered with muslin caps with straight borders , and white as the driven snow . Susan , the elder , was between forty and fifty years of age ; she was tall and erect ; and though rather slender in proportion to her height , well formed . There was an expression of command in all her movements that seemed natural to her , and sat gracefully upon her . Her face had the same character of habitual independence and native dignity ; the hues of youth had faded , but a connoisseur would have pronounced her at a single glance to have been handsome . Her features were large , and all finely formed ; her eye , there , where the " spirit has its throne of light , " beamed with intelligence and tenderness . It was softened by a rich dark eye lash , and of that equivocal hue , between grey and hazel , which seems best adapted to show every change of feeling ; but vain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of strong and rebuked passions , of tender and repressed affections , of disciplined serenity , and a soft melancholy , that seemed like the shadow of past sufferings , which altogether constituted the power and interest of her remarkable face . The younger female was short and slightly formed . Her features were small ; her blue eyes , light hair , and fair complexion , would have rendered her face insipid , but that it was rescued by an expression of purity and innocence , and a certain appealing tender look that suited well her quiet and amiable character . As they entered , Ellen threw her arms around the younger sister , exclaiming in a tone of the tenderest concern , " dear Emily , why did you not come sooner * Emily trembled like an aspen // leaf , and her heart beat as if it would have leaped from her bosom , but she made no reply . The elder sister grasped Ellen 's hand , " Is it even so ? " she said ; she rightly interpreted Ellen 's silence and sadness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our coming would be worse than in vain ; " then turning to her young companion , she said , " put thy hand on thy mouth , and be still , my child . The Mighty One hath done it , strive not against him , for he giveth not account of any of his * A loud groan was heard in the apartment of the dead . Susan Allen started , and exclaimed , " is my mother here ? then , mother Anne be with me ! " She paused for a moment , and added in a calm tone , " fear not , Emily , my child , in your weakness strength shall be made perfect ; we shall not be left without the testimony . " Her words were quick , and her voice raised , as if she felt that she was contending against rebellious nature . She entered the room with a slow and firm step . Emily followed her , but it seemed , not without faltering , for Ellen had passed her arm around her , and appeared to sustain half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as still . " Pray speak to them Mrs Allen , " whispered Ellen ; " yes , speak to them , " said Debby , in a voice of authority , " what signifies it , they are your own children and there is no denying it . " " They were my children , but they have gone out from me , and are not of me " replied the old woman , in a voice scarcely audible . " I am alone ; they are uprooted ; I am as an old oak , whose leaf has withered ; judgment has come out against me . " " She is going clean distracted , " whispered Debby to Ellen , " you can do anything with her ; make her hear to reason , while she has any left , and get her to go out of the room with you . " " No , no , " said the old woman , who had overheard Debhy*s whisper , " have no fear for me , my spirits are a little fluttered , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my rest , and under my wing ; but the Lord 's own peace is in my heart , and none can trouble that . * she continued , bursting into tears , as she turned her eyes from Emily to fix them on Susan , " was it not enough that you were led captive by Satan , enough for you to put on his livery , but you must tempt this child to follow you in your idolatries ? " Strong sensibility is , perhaps , never extinguished ; but Susan 's was so subdued , that obedient to the motion of her will , it had soon returned to flow in its customary channels . She replied to her mother 's appeal in her usual deliberate manner . " The child is not my captive , mother , she has obeyed the gospel , and , " added she , looking at Emily with affectionate complacency , " she has already travelled very far out of an evil nature , and the believers are looking to see her stand in the foremost light , so clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Susan had an habitual influence over Emily ; she felt that she commanded the springs that governed the mind of her timid disciple . Emily felt it too , and was glad to be saved from the effort of self-dependence . She approached Susan , who had seated herself by the bedside , when her grandmother took her by the hand , and drawing her towards her , she said in a voice scarcely audible , for sorrow , infirmity , and despair almost deprived her of utterance ; " Oh , Emily , my child , my only child , has she bewitched you ? " She drew the unresisting girl towards the bed of her brother ,  --  " there , look on him , Emily , though dead he yet speaketh to you , and if nature s not quite dead in you , you will hear him , he calls to you to break to pieces your idols , and to come out from the abominations of the land whither ye have been carried away captive . " Emily sighed heavily , and wept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , and seeming to lose the spirit of controversy in some gentle remembrance , she said , ? * Edward was a good youth , and lived up to the light he had . There is one point where all roads meet ; one thing certain , mother , " she added , an intelligent smile brightening her fine face , " we shall all be judged according to the light we have ; some have a small , and some a great privilege . " " She has hit the nail on the head for once , " whispered Debby to Ellen , " and now , Ellen , before they get into another snarl , do separate them . " vol. i. pp. 89-93 . Ellen interposes her mild exhortations , and has just suc* ceeded in bringing the mother and daughter to regard each other with returning complacency and affection , whenThe outer door again opened , and Reuben Harrington , that one of " the brethren , " whom Debby had characterised as the " master devjl , " entered . He seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the period of self indulgence ; and certainly he bore no marks of having disobeyed the instincts of nature by any mortifications of the flesh . He was of a middling stature , inclining to corpulency ; with a sanguine complexion , a low forehead , deeply shaded with bushy black hair , that absolutely refused to conform to the sleekness of his order ; a keen grey eye , which had a peculiarly cunning expression , from a trick he had early acquired , and of which he could never rid himself ; of tipping a knowing wink ; a short thick nose turning upward ; a wide mouth with the corners sanctimoniously drawn down , and a prominent fat chin following the direction of his nose . In short , he presented a combination and a form to awaken the suspicions of the most credulous , and confirm the strongest prejudices against a fraternity , that would advance such a brother to its highest honors-or , to use their own // phrase , to the dead . Reuben advanced to the bedside quite unceremoniously , and seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he did not belong to their species . No one spoke to him , nor did he speak , till his attention was arrested by poor Anne , who had shrunk away froni the side of the bed , and sat on a low chair at its foot , enveloped in *er shawl , and sobbing aloud apparently unconscious that any one saw or heard her . " Who is that young woman , " inquired Harrington of Debby , " that is making such an unseemly ado , is she of kin to the youth ? " " No ! " uttered in her harshest voice , was all the reply Debby vouchsafed . " Some tie of a carnal nature , ha ? " pursued Harrington . " No such thing , " said Debby , " Eddy was her sweetheart . " Yea , yea , that is just what I meant , woman . " " Well , ** continued he , with a long drawn guttural groan , " the children of this world must bake as they have brewed , they are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own folly has mixed . " After this consolatory harangue , he turned from the bedside , and began , not humming but shouting with the utmost power of his voice , a Shaker tune , at all times sufficiently dissonant , and that now , in this apartment of death and sorrow , sounded like the howl of an infernal ; to this music he shuffled and whirled in the manner , which his sect call dancing and labor worship . Stop your dumb pow-wow ! " cried Debby , seizing him by the arm , with a force that might have made a stouter heart than Reuben 's rejoice in the protection of the convenient principle of nonresistance . " Nay , ye world 's woman , let me alone , " said he , extricating himself from her grasp , and composing his neckcloth , which Deborah 's rough handling had somewhat ruffled ; " know me for a peaceable man , that wars not with earthly powers . " " True , ** replied Debby , " your war is with heavenly powers ; but while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right arm , I 'll keep you peaceable . Peaceable , indeed ! one would have thought all Bedlam had been let loose upon us-peaceable your yells almost scared the old lady 's soul out of her body . " Poor Mrs Allen , to whom Reuben 's singing had sounded like a shout of victory from the infernal host , now really seemed in danger of such a catastrophe . She could scarcely raise her heavy eyelids , and the low moaning sounds that escaped her , betrayed the infirmity of age , and the grief that words can not express . Ellen renewed her entreaties that she would retire to her own room . No longer capable of resistance , she silently acquiesced , and Ellen conducted her to her bed , and watched over her ; till she perceived that her wearied nature had sunk to repose . ' vol. i. pp. 94-9r. // The funeral of Edward Allen , which immediately follows , is a copy from the life , given with a graphic fidelity . We have , however , no room for it , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early history of Ellen Bruce . She had resided , it seems , from a very tender age , alternately in the families of an episcopal tory , and of a calvinistic republican , both of whom had taken a strong affection to this interesting orphan . The lady of the former , a highly educated female , undertook the cultivation of her mind , and the polish of her manners ; while the wife of the latter , a plain , sensible , benevolent woman , initiated her into household arts and domestic duties , and under their mutual and well bestowed instructions she had grown up , accomplished , refined , single hearted , affectionate , beneficent , and religious , in the true spirit of our religion , without bigotry . All this is very well imagined and delightfully told . We must also pass over an excellent colloquy between Mrs Lenox and Ellen , in which the former , with all her sagacily , is unable to coinprehend why Ellen should be unwilling to encourage the addresses of her son , George Lenox , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good son , and who was certain to make a good husband . By and by comes Charles Westall from Virginia , the son of an old friend of Mrs Redwood , a very good , genteel , well educated young man , with nothing peculiar about him , except that he has just completed his professional education , and is ready for a wife . He was accompanied by Mrs Westall , his mother , a polite and affable lady , with a strong spice of worldliness in her composition , and willing to maneuvre a little for the sake of seeing her son well settled in life . Westall is struck with the resplendent beauty of Caroline , and she in her turn is delighted and flattered by his admiration . She soon , however , begins to observe that Westall has eyes for other qualities besides beauty and wealth , and has become somewhat interested by the unpretending goodness and worth of Ellen . The attempts of Caroline to make Westall regard her supposed rival in an unfavorable light , the malignant misinterpretations put by her upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents by which these attempts are rendered unavailing , and these misinterpretations exposed , and the prepossessions of Westall , wrought up into // a passionate attachment for Ellen , furnish many interesting and some highly pathetic scenes . Indeed , nothing can be better than the whole management of the story , during the stay of the Redwoods at the house of Mrs Lenox . The scene now shifts to Lebanon Springs and their neighborhood . The episode of Emily , and her adventures among the Shakers , forms a very interesting part of the book . There is great power shown in the chapter , where Susan , the elder sister , ' in order to fix the wavering faith of her young disciple , Emily , and reclaim a heart , that was relapsing to the world , gives an account of her own conversation , and of the long , and fierce , and exhausting conflict , which her enthusiasm maintained against her affections , till , at length , the strong ties which bound her to the world were broken forever . We can give only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Harwood , a pleasant lad , ' of vthom she tells Emily we have been mates from our infancy , and had loved one another ( loving no one else ) with that faith , which is the boast of the world 's people . ' " He fell into a weakly way , and then he took to ruinous habits . His poor old parents died , I fear , of a wounded spirit ; for they laid his misfortune sadly to heart . After their death , his worldly affairs went fast to destruction , and he became a miserable vagrant . He would come here and sit for hours on the door step ; at these times I kept to my room , for I could do nothing for him ; and if he chanced to see me in his fits of intoxication , he would either upbraid me bitterly , or cry like a child , and both were trying to me . " It is ten years ago the tenth day of last January-it had stormed for three days , and the roads were blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel cold night  --  and in the morning , a sabbath morning too , when we had risen and kindled a fire , one of the brethren opened the outer door , and there was lying a poor wretch across the door stone-frozen to death-we all gathered round him  --  and oh Emily , child , it was " XVilliam ? " Yea-yea-it was William * " Oh misery , misery ! " exclaimed Emily with a burst of sym* pathy , which she could not repress . " Yea , it was misery . I forgot myself-forgot all that stood about me . I saw not his tattered dirty garments , nor his bloated face , but I saw him as in the days of our youth and our love , and I fell on his neck and wept-I could not help it  --  but thanks be // rendered , " she added , raising her eyes , " it was the last struggle of nature  --  and it has been forgiven . " " And have you suffered thus ? " asked Emily , after a moment 's pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Susan , " rather be grateful that I have been accounted worthy thus to suffer ? " ' vol. ii . pp. 33 , 34 . We are not , however , so well satisfied with the circumstances of Emily 's escape from the thraldom in which she is held among this strange community . The adventures connected with the Indian and his cabin are too extraordinary and romantic , to harmonise well with the general strain of the narrative . The least interesting part of the hook is that , where we are introduced to the Armstead party , whom Debby and Ellen fall in with on their way to the Shaker village . There is a great deal of conversation here , that does not help forward the progress of the story , and of consequence the interest suffers . There is something , also , not altogether prepossessing in the first appearance of Grace Campbell , with whose character the author has evidently taken great pains . Something like pertness and flippancy , not to say rudeness , is detected in her sallies and repartees in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but all this is more than compensated for , by her spirit , frankness , and warmth of heart , as they are brought out in the further progress of the narrative . Miss Deborah Lenox , however , acquits herself on this , as on all other occasions , to our entire satisfaction . At last the principal personages in the story are brought together at Lebanon Springs . Here the plot thickens and draws to a conclusion , and the narrative acquires a more fervid interest . Our friend Debby figures here also , to the no small amusement of the good company assembled at the place , as well as of ourselves . Her mixture of intelligence and simplicity , of good nature and decision , of masculine habits with those of her sex , of strong feelings and attachmeats , with a strong understanding , and great warmth of imagination , at times highly poetical , but never leading her astray , and only throwing a stronger light on the object her unfailing good sense points out , altogether form a striking and novel combination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , and we are always glad to observe her agency . If // any should be found who are of opinion , that she sometimes talks a little too long , none , we imagine , will think that she talks too often . On an arrangement made by Ellen , to proceed in the carriage of Mrs Armstead to Mrs Harrison 'S Ifl Massachusetts , Debby is consulted , and acquiesces . " Not but what I am loth to part with you , Ellen " she said , " for the Lord * and she brushed a tear from the corner of her eye , " nobody ever wanted to leave you yet ; but then there is reason iii all things ; you have taken a long journey , all for those that s neither kith nor kin to you , and now that you are happy among your mates , it is but fair you should have a play spell ; besides , it would be rather tough for our poor old horse to draw us all over the hills , and he should be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the bills , but then I have come to that time of life when I had rather ride than walk ; so all is for the best . " ' vol. ii . pp. 175 , 176 . At parting she draws Ellen aside . " *Look here , " she said , undrawing a bag , and discovering one corner of a pacquet , " here is the identical money you refused to receive from Mr Redwood ; he sent it to me last night for a marriage portion for Emily ; it is true , child-God bless him-it is true-he has given it , and I have taken it with a thankful heart and a prayer , ( as in duty bound , ) that the Lord would return it to him a hundred fold , in something better than silver and gold . I shall keep the present a secret till Emily 's wedding day , which I m sure is not far off , and , * she added after a moment 's pause , " I m thinking that another wedding day is coming among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? if there s any body in the land might hold up their heads with a good grace it s you ; for to my notion there is not a nobler man in the * world , view him in what light you will , than this same Charles Westall . " " Deborah , " interrupted Ellen , " 1 am " Engaged-I know that " " Ma'am , your chaise is ready , ** said the servant . Coming in a minute . I know how it stands , Ellen , pretty nearly ; for last night , when I got this pacquet from Mr Redwood , my heart was so full , I thought I could not sleep till I had told you . I looked in your room-you was not there ; I came on to the piazza-you and Mr Charles Westall were standing by the door yonder ; while I was hesitating whether to go back without interrupting you , I heard a few words , just enough to give me a little insight into the business . I thought it fair to tell you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be notional ; for a girl of your sense , Ellen , you are apt to be a little notional , which is not your fault , // but comes of your living with Mrs Harrison , and reading too many verses , which are apt to make girls dreamy . " " Miss Debby , " cried Emily , " everything is ready , and the sun is rising . " " Coming , child , coming . One word more , Ellen "  --  and here Deborah paused , for the first time in her life , at a loss how to express herself . She drummed with the butt end of her whip on the railing , made figures with the lash on the floor , knit her brow , bit ' her lips , but did not speak till spurred by a second call from Emily ; and then the tears gushed from the good creature 's eyes as she said , " Ellen you are rich in nothing but the grace of God ; the best riches I know ; but then there s neither quails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little to the needful . When my father died , ( a thrifty prudent man , ) he left me fifty pounds lawful . It has been in good hands , and has run up to between two and three hundred . I have enough for myself besides , Ellen , laid up for a wet day , so that is all to be yours . Now do n't speak , but hearken to me-besides the money , I have a nice store of table linen for you , and some coverlets and feather beds . " " Oh Deborah , Deborah , ** " Say nothingchild-I ca n't bear it . I wo n't be gainsayed . Good bye , Ellen , the Lord bless you , child , and all that care for you " - *and she strided across the piazza without giving Ellen time tn open her lips . ' vol. ii . pp. 186 , 187* . Finally comes the unraveling of the plot . And here , again , we . must frankly say , that there is a want of perfect verisimilitude in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something a little too strange , for a story of real life , in the obscurity that hangs about Ellen 's birth , and in the mysterious box containing the miniature of her father and the solemn epistle from her mother , which Ellen is under a strict charge not to open until a certain age , or until she had formed a matrimonial connexion . These things remind us too strongly of the machinery of romances . It is not a little extraordinary also , that Ellen 's father should travel from a distant province to the very spot where his daughter was , and should there meet with an accident , by which he was confined for weeks as a patient in the very house where El-. len resided , that the matrimonial connexion , which left her at liberty to explore the mysterious tokens of her birth should be formed during his stay in the northern states , and before he had parted from her society , and that it should he formed with the very man whom , of all others , he most desired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not perhaps to criticise too sternly these expedients for helping out the plot of a novel . The many dispensations granted to the tribe of poets , to overleap certain settled rules , grew long ago into a body of established and unquestionable privileges , under the name of licentia poehica . The right of novelists to bring ahout their catastrophes by extraordinary means , has , we fear , in like manner , been too long and too universally enjoyed to be taken from them at this day . Even the rational , sober , pra&amp; tical , and authentic Miss Edgeworth has not disdained to employ them . In her Ennui , for example , the Earl of Glenthorn suddenly finds himself a mere private man , the son of a hog trotting blacksmith , and after he has undergone a complete renovation of character , and has made an excellent lawyer of himself , as suddenly regains his title , and all this is effected by much stranger means than are resorted to by the author of the work before us , to make Ellen Bruce the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of which nobody ever thought of taxing with poverty of invention , they abound with licenses of this sort . After all , the plot of a novel is little more than a convenient contrivance to introduce interesting situations and incidents , well drawn characters and flne sketches from life and nature . If we have all these , why need we complain of the manner in which they are connected , unless that manner be such as essentially to impair their effect ? If th' picture be beautiful , why should we turn our eyes from it , to find fault with the frame in which it is enclosed ? The work closes with a characteristic letter from Dehorah Lenox , of which we can afford only the following specimen . Little Peggy came here this morning , with a basket of new fashioned early beans , a present from Deacon Martin to me ; the deacon and I have had a strife , which should have the first beans , and he has won the race ; and , by the way , I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made quite a stirring time here at Eton . You must know that a few weeks after the deacon lost his wife , he felt so lonesome without a companion , that lie came to sister Lenox to recommend a suitable one , and she directly spoke a good word for Peggy 's aunt Betty , who is , as it were , alone in the world , and though a poor body , she comes of a creditable stock in the old countries ; and what is more to the purVOL. xx. -.  - -  NO. 47. // ROSe , her walk and conversation among us has been as good as a preached sermon-that is to say a moral discourse . Well , the deacon was quite taken with the notion , for Betty is a comely woman to look to yet , though ivell nigh on to fifty , and he went directly to lay the matter before some of the church members , and they made strong objections to the match , on account of Betty 's so often breaking the third commandment , which comes , I sitppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are by no means so particular about teaching the youth their chatechise as with us . The deacon , however , ht*d set his face as a flint , and there were consultations about it , till at last two of the brethren agreed to go and talk to Betty on the subject , and make her promise that she would put a tight rein on her tongue . Betty promised everything they asked ; but you know when a body always goes in the same track , it makes a deep rut , and it is next to an impossibility to turn out of it ; and so , while Betty was talking with them , every other sentence was , " God help us , gentlemen , ** and " God bless your souls , I 11 do my best , " and so on ; and they came away more dead set against the match than ever . But Martin went on in spite of them , and married her ; and except in the matter of the third commandment , there is not a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' vol. ii . pp 284,285 . The moral of Redwood , as intimated in the preface , is properly a religious one . We had some apprehensions on seeing this intimation , that the moral would be too anxiously and obtrusively brought forward , and pressed with a wearisome frequency and perseverance . The writer of a novel , the design of which is professedly to instruct , is always in danger of falling into this error . He is himself so full of the importance of the lesson he inculcates , that he is apt to suppose that it can not be too often nor too earnestly repeated , nor enforced by too much argument and amplification , nor illustrated by too many or too obvious examples . We must say , however , that we see few if any traces of this fault in Redwood . The moral is well wrought into the texture of the work , but never officiously presented . It is not enough to say of this novel , that the reader is relieved and refreshed at due intervals , by being let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world about him , to amuse himself with what is going on there ; and is then gently recalled to the lesson , which the author wishes to teach . It is doing it better justice to say , that the world itself is only then made to // 1825 . Redwood . the reader , what it ought always to be , the great school and place of discipline , the experience and observation of which should form us to virtue . We have already spoken of the author 's skill in the drawing of characters . Next to the character of Debby , that of Susan is sketched with the greatest spirit and originality . Either of these would of itself suffice to give a reputation to the work . All the others , even the subordinate ones , give ample proofs of a fertile invention , and a wide and close observation . The very persons who seem , at first sight , to be brought forward only for the purpose of exhibiting our national manners , or who are casually introduced , in some sin* gle incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distinguished from each other by some striking peculiarity . The Vermont Yeoman , Mr Lenox , and even the Shaker gardener , though but just seen in the course of the narrative , leave a strong individual impression on the mind of the reader , an irnpressioti that bears witness to the abundance and variety of the author 's resources . The style of the work in that most difficult part , the dialogue , js exceedingly natural , spirited , and appropriate . That of the narrative parts , however , though always flowing and often eloquent , is not in all places equal to that of the dialogue . It may be suggested to the author , whether the anxiety always to express herself pointedly and brilliantly has not , in some instances , taken from the sincerity of her manner , and thus diminished the force and depth of the impression intended to be made . We have also noted some deviations from purity of language , which have doubtless been the more striking in a work written with such apparent care . The peculiarities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been connected with ideas merely low and ludicrous . We complain of our English neighbors for holding them up as objects simply ridiculous and laughable , but it is by no means certain that we have not encouraged them by our example . It is time , however , that they were redeemed from these gross and degrading associations . It is time that they should be mentioned , as they deserve to be , with something else than a sneer , and that a feeling of respect should mingle with the smile they occasion . We are happy to see the author of this work connecting them , as we // find them connected in real life , with much that is ennobling and elevated , with traits of sagacity , benevolence , moral courage and magnanimity . These are qualities , which by no means impair any comic effect those peculiarities may have ; they rather relieve and heighten it . They transform it from mere buffoonery to the finest humor . When this is done , something is done to exalt our national reputation abroad , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of public benefit , to show what copious and valuable materials the private lives and daily habits of our countrymen offer to the writer of genius . It is as if one were to discover to us rich ores and gems lying in the common earth about us . But our readers must by this time be weary of our comments , and we dismiss them , with pleasure , to the perusal of the work itself .
