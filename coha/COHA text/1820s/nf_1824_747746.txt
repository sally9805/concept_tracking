txt In looking over the history of Man , there appears to be no enormity , of which he has been guilty , so great and so appalling , as that of public war . If all the other evils which have afflicted the race , both natural and moral , could be brought together and placed in array , they would fall far short , both in amount and severity , of those which have flowed from this productive and yet producing cause . One of the first philosophers , statesmen , and orators of the last age , in making as accurate an estimate as the nature of the case admits , observes ,  --  " I think the numbers of men now upon earth are computed at five hundred millions , at the most ; and the slaughter of mankind , by means of war upon the smallest calculation , amounts to seventy times the number of souls this day on the globe . " * And yet we can state this fact , and hear it stated , with quite as much stoicism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the death of an individual by the hand of violence . There seems to be something in the evils of war too large in amount , too intense in * Burke 's tv'orks , vol. i. p. 20. degree , to permit the mind to take a close or long continued survey ; it sees " aliquid immensum infinitumque , " and turns aside with a feeling of disgust , hopelessness , and despair . Nevertheless , it is even now said " that war is a calamity , the recurrence of which , no human foresight or exertions can prevent . " t But it is difficult to conceive that an act originating in the exercise of the will of man , can not be prevented by him . To those , at least , who believe that he is a moral agent ,  --  that his conduct is decided by motives presented to his understanding and will ,  --  the opinion that he can not avoid war , is no less absurd than the opinion that he can not avoid theft , robbery , or murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nature of man , as the commission of another . Every offence is the effect of temptation upon his bad appetites and passions . The difference consists only in the magnitude of the transgression . On what principle in the nature or condition of man , does the advocate for war found its necessity ? He has been defined to be a religious animal . But who will find the cause or the necessity of wars in man 's religion ? Every relation he sustains with his Creator  --  every light in which he can be viewed , as connected with his final Judge , leads to an opposite conclusion . He is a reasonable being . Wars are inseparably connected with the highest acts of ingratitude , revenge , cruelty , and crime . Apply the epithet t Wheaton 's discourse before the New York Hist . Society , Dec ; 1829. reasonable to these acts , and you have a string of solecisms . Still , however , it is repeated , " no human foresight or exertions can prevent wars . " They are then founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and acts not from necessity . Evil is in the world ; but it is here as the test of virtue . War is the greatest of evils ; but it is among the moral evils , and therefore subjected to the control of man 's will . There is therefore nothing in those faculties and attributes which distinguish men from brutes , from which wars can spring . As little is there in necessity , or the nature of things , calculated to entail the evils of war upon the human race . The truth is , mankind are misled on this subject , by early instruction ,  --  carried away by numbers ,  - -  overwhelmed by the authority of great names ,  - -  pressed down by antiquity and by precedent . The mind is subjected by a tissue of deceptions and frauds , practised upon it from infancy . It is taught to gaze with admiration upon the great names which war has made . It is taught to estimate character , genius , talents , courage , virtue , every thing which adorns and enobles , by rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ;  --  and thus men acquire what they believe to be almost intuition on this point . War is necessary , because it has been the business of the world ,  --  because it has afforded occupation for one half of the population of the earth in all ages . War is useful , because it has made nearly all the great men that ever lived .  - -  Take awav , thev exclaim , from the history of the /z/ species , all that appertains to war and conquest , and what an uninteresting , barren , desolate retrospect have we left ! Some eminent lawyers and physicians , a few profound divines and learned judges , here and there a great orator  --  doubtful if they would have been so , but from the excitements growing out of the events of war ! Now and then a good poet  - -  questionable even this , if they could not have sung of arms ! Thus men think , talk , and declaim ; and thus are cheated to believe that wars can not be prevented . But where is the man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable to human conduct , or from the nature of things , to prove that war is necessarily entailed upon the race of man ? What moralist has ever come to this result ? What writer , upon the nature or history of man , has ever shewn that a love of war is born with him , interwoven in his very nature , instinctive and incorrigible ? Can any investigation on this point ever terminate in any more sensible or satisfactory conclusion , than that wars always have existed  --  therefore they always must exist . Any view of the subject of public war , which will tend to diminish the number ( I will not say of its friends , for it can have none , but ) of those who believe it can not be prevented , will not be unseasonable on this occasion . A state of peace is that most fitted to be the natural and permanent condition of man . There are indications that peace will , in fact , universally prevail , and become the condition of mankind at large . Nature , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may happen to her productions . She is never at war with herself . Look over her kingdoms ; how nicely the various soils are adapted to the difterent species of plants ; how singularly happy the various fruits of the earth are arranged to suit the variety of climates ,  --  all fitted and subjected to the law of re-production . We find no principle of hostility , or mutual self-destruction , at work here . We may observe the same general law in the animal kingdom . It is true , we see one species preying upon another ; not , however , in the indulgence of brutal and malignant passions , but in obedience to nature 's first law , self-preservation . We see no one tribe pursuing deadly hostilities against another of the same species . That animal , with whose name we associate every savage and ferocious passion , kills but to satisfy the cravings of hunger . From what law , or operation of nature , do men learn the lesson of war ? Are we to listen to the old saiD , that war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the natural ; that because there are volcanoes , hurricanes , whirlwinds , and elemental strife , therefore there must be wars and fightings and social strife ? Wherein consists the analogy ? Are we , then , creatures who act by impulse , regardless of high and honourable motives and objects ? Shall we so easily give up our spirituality ; deny that we are the sons of God ; and so readily descend into the darkness and wretchedness of materialism ? Besides , let us consider this argument for a moment . /z/ It is , that society has a constant tendency to deterioration . That in its tranquil and peaceful state , it generates a multitude of useless and worthless members , who are to be taken off by war ; that it produces a plentiful growth of vices , which are to be pruned and cut away by the sword . But , there is no instance on record where this effect of peace upon the social state has been exemplified . The tendency i  --  the other way . Men , well informed and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go from bad to worse , but proceed from one improvement to another . The natural progress of society is like that of an individual , who is at peace with himself , and with his fellow men . His circumstances become more and more prosperous and happy . But admit , for a moment , what is contrary to fact , history , and common sense , that peace has this deleterious effect upon the social state ; that the noisome scum mantles upon the standing pool . Is war the remedy ? Does this remove the scum only , and leave the waters clear , and pure , and wholesome ? Do the vile and profligate only fall victims to the diseases of the camp ? Do none but the worthless perish in battle ? What compensation does war make to society for the thousands on thousands of young , gallant , and noble spirits , who are swept away in its ferocious career ? War removes all those wholesome restraints upon the passions of men , which it is at once the object and boast of civilization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of comparative /z/ barbarism . Men are invited , encouraged , nay , commanded to hate their enemies . A whole people are instantly to be viewed in this character ; and it becomes not lawful merely , but a duty to sacrifice their property , liberty , and lives . This is the lesson which war teaches ! And is it learning and practising lessons like this , that society , like a poisoned and polluted atmosphere , by the violence of the tempest , becomes tranquillized and purified ? What is the language of experience on this point ? A war ended , and armies disbanded , what does war give back to society ? The principles , feelings , and morals , which are discharged from the camp , are brought home into your villages to contaminate , pollute , and poison . Government is besieged by a throng of suppliants , who exhibit their shattered constitutions , maimed limbs , and wounded bodies , as passports to the doors of the treasury . Pension rolls are swelled and multiplied . The revenues of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain lives painful , destitute , and wretched in themselves , as well as useless to society .  - -  Happy would it be , if the evil stopped here . Happy indeed for society , if the baneful effects of war could be limited to inroads upon the bodies of its agents and victims . But mangled minds , depraved hearts , vitiated appetites , brutalized passions ,  --  on what pension roll shall these be placed ? What asylum can society offer to this mass of intellectual disability , but her hospitals ? What protection can she offer to herself against this tide of mental depravity , but her penitentiaries ? /z/ Another wretched effect of war is to repress industry and enterprise , except that which serves to lav waste the earth , and ministers to the destruction of the human race . The most warlike period of the world was that which succeeded the irruption and final establishment of the northern barbarians over the continent of Europe . Accordingly , we find no period in history so little distinguished for any of the productions of industry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every employment , save that of war . And it is singular enough that the only trade of the world was with the East , and with a people distinguished alike for their industry and their freedom from wars . Indeed , war , indolence , and barbarism are one family ; and their separation is as unnatural as it is absurd .  - -  Wherever men have existed in a state of complete barbarism , their only business , save that of satisfying the calls of hunger , has been war . Peace , on the contrary , softens and subdues the passions . Its first teachings are fraternal . Those passions which it can not subdue by discipline , it seeks to control by legal restraint . It establishes a social compact , which embraces all nations . It brings men together from distant regions , without the weapons of death in their hands , and with the feelings of humanity in their hearts . The great and wretched delusion , that war is necessary , has derived much support from the promulgation of singular doctrines respecting the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is born by the side of his father , and there he stays . This /z/ is society , and the origin of society . " There was too much simplicity and nature in this account of the matter to satisfy the vanity of some philosophers . To account for a condition of things so complicated and happy , as that presented by millions of human beings united under some form of political connexion , seeking to promote the happiness of each and of all , by cultiv ating the arts of civilization and refinement , it was necessary to resort to something more profound , theoretical , and apparently scientific , than the mere supposition of a social instinct . Accordingly , some began by laying it dovvn as a principle , that men naturally hated each other ; and in order to avoid the effect of this principle of hostility ,  --  the total extinction of the race ,  --  they grouped them together , forming them into bands for mutual strength and protection ; and thus the principle of hatred originated or led to the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This theory , instead of changing or ameliorating the principle of hatred on which it is founded , leaves it in full operation . It but transfers it from the individual to society ; and while it contributed to diminish private quarrels , it went to the establishment of public wars . Others , again , rejecting the principle of mutual hatred , find men , anterior to the origin of society , existing in a solitary , lonely , disconnected state . Oppressed by this individuality of condition , and feeling the necessity of association , they are supposed to have contracted with each other to live together , and to unite their powers , means , and /z/ strength tor mutual protection and happiness . jSociety was considered by these philosophers as wholly artificial ,  --  the mere effect of bargain among individuals existing in a state of natural separation ; and the social union was the effect of the Social Contract , It is obvious , that this theory mistakes the origin of government for the origin of society . In some of these afiectedly philosophical methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary wci of the system itself ,  --  in all of them there is room enough left for its necessary existence . In considering this matter apart from all the proud and vain theories of philosophy , we are led to a more consoling result . The voice of truth , of nature , and religion , teaches us , that wherever there are men , there is society . That man is endowed , by nature , with a social principle , as certainly as he is with a rational principle . That he is no more , by nature or necessity , a hater of his fellow , than he is a hater of his Creator ; and no more necessarily at war with the one than with the other . I have said that there are . indications that peace will in fact prevail , and become the permanent condition of mankind . If the existence of any future war between two nations depended upon the free and fair expression of the will of the people who composed them , there is little reason to believe there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ their own interest and happiness . But the world is yet full of bad governments . The maxim , that government was made for the people , and not the people for the government , is admitted in but few countries ; or if admitted , in theory , is not allowed its full practical operation . Amid nations constituted and ruled as they are , what rational ground of belief is there , that wars will cease ? In the first place , many of the most prolific causes or sources of war have , by the progress of improvement and civilization , ceased to exist . That whole class of wars , which may be denominated religious or ecclesiastical , and which at various periods during the whole christian era , have distressed , depopulated , and disgraced the christian world , have vanished before the spirit of toleration . The unnatural and unholy union of temporal and spiritual dominion , the cause of many bloody wars , is at an end . The fetters of the church are broken ; and the eighteenth century has left nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tyranny , which can excite or become the occasion of future wars . Again ; the age of territorial wars , we may hope , has also passed away . The discovery of the new world was a most important event in the history of human affairs . The spirit of that age was despotic , bigoted , ignorant , anti-commercial , and feudal .  - -  The ambition of princes was excited by the display of vast regions of unoccupied territory . The avarice of both princes and nobles was stimulated by powerful descriptions of stores of wealth , not the /z/ less exhaustless , because unexplored . In short , that event , acting upon the peculiar qualities and passions of the age , laid the foundation of a series of territorial wars , which continued , with short intervals , until the establishment of the independence of this country . But there are now no new worlds to discover . Every corner of the earth has been inspected by the light of science . Territorial lines are generally fixed and known , and the boundaries of nations established ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt exists , they are now settled , as we hope ere long to see every point of national dispute settled , by commissioners or umpirage . Further ; the hope , too , that the fruitful source of another class of destructive wars is dried up and closed for ever , is perhaps not too sanguine to be indulged . I mean wars of ambition . The present age has seen a war originating in far other views and objects , but assuming this character in its progress ,  --  a war of frightful extent and desolation , terminated by the disgrace and consequent death of its leader . This war has been followed by a periodical convention of the sovereigns of the principal countries of Europe , and their ministers . At these meetings the great and leading interests of the European family of nations are discussed and deliberated upon , with the professed and declared intention of preserving the peace of society . This is an institution entirely of modern origin . It has no parallel in the history of nations . What effect the establishment of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remains for time to /z/ disclose . It would be rashness to propliesy . Whatever may be its tendencies in other points of view , one great , and , may I not add , happy effect , seems obviously to flow from it , that of terminating for ever wars of individual , unprincipled ambition . If , however , instead of a holy alliance for the preservation of social order and the peace of the world , it should prove the strong hold of despotic power ,  --  an unholy combination to preserve the privileges of the few , against the rights of the many ,  --  it may be the occasion of one war , more furious , desolating , and terrible , than any which has yet existed among men .  - -  The friends of peace , who are also the friends of rational liberty , look with anxiety for the development . If these views are correct , if there are no grounds for any future wars growing out of religious abuses , if national disputes respecting territorial jurisdiction are by the wisdom of modern times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than all , ambition 's ladder is broken down , and that spirit , which could regret that there were no more nations left to conquer , is at length tamed or controlled , we may indeed hope , that the temple of Janus will be permanently closed , and peace visit the nations . But there are other and more striking indications of the prevalence of peace . The universality of commerce , and the consequent distribution of wealth , among all the classes which compose modern communities , has created a great and powerful interest , essentially opposed to wars . The times are not far back , for they belong to /z/ modern Europe , when the whole of society wats composed of but two classes ,  --  the feudal chiefs and their vassals ; in other Avords , captains and their soldiers . The very construction of society was military ; its whole occupation military . The only acknowledged reciprocal right and duty , was that of command and obedience . The wonder is , not that such a state of things should produce wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been enough of peace to have taught mankind its blessings . This constitution of society , literally embracing the whole of modern Europe , continued for ages and centuries . There was but one productive art , that of agriculture , connected with it . This was indeed a humble art , and apparently existed only , because men must be fed , to fight . Into this rugged and iron-bound state of the world , the spirit of commerce insinuated itself . Industry and economy became social virtues . Legislation changed its objects . The occupations of men from being warlike became pacific ; and the whole aspect of society has been changed . When it is considered that this great , and growing , and permanent interest is pacific in its origin , character , and influence , and what it has accomplished even in the course of the last half century , it is not perhaps too much to say , that it forms a decisive indication that peace will finally prevail . The advancement of another great pacific interest within the period I have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too auspicious not to be noticed among the causes leading to a final termin- /z/ ation of war . The interest of agriculture is essentially a virtuous and pacific interest . By far the largest proportion of the population of the earth is , and has been devoted to agricultural pursuits . Numerous as have always been the sons of the soil , they have had , till lately , no political existence . The spirit of the feudal polity viewed them as villians and slaves . The age of chivalry , which succeeded , did nothing for them . Dwelling in the country , and scattered over a lare extent of territory , they had no common points of meeting , no concentration of power and influence . There are no agricultural cities . They had no representative , and , of course , no standing at courts . Held in a state of toil , servitude , and ignorance , they formed a kind of caste , quite as distinct and difficult to be broken as those of modern India . From this state of degradation , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an honourable employment . Men of rank , worth , and science engage in the pursuit . Governments extend not protection merely , but patronage to this now mighty interest . Agricultural anniversaries and festivals , where the great men of the earth meet and mingle with the cultivators of the soil , are substituting for the celebration of military eras . This happy change affords earnest that the dav is not far distant , when rewards and honours , proceeding from the use of the ploughshare and pruning hook , will be worn with more pride and grace , than those derived from the exercise of the sword and the spear . /z/ Commerce , agriculture , and ma:nufactures , considered as the great and leading interests of the many , are the growth of modern times . They are essentially the friends of peace . They have taken the place of tyrannical commercial monopolies , the villanage of the feudal system , and the false and visionary pursuits of chivalry ; all which were the interests of the few , and in their nature friends and promoters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a greater change than their interests ; more marked , decisive , and auspicious in its tendency to abolish the custom of war . If the intellectual and moral condition of society , one century since , is considered in contrast with that condition at the present hour , is there any period in the records of time which can testify to so great an improvement ? Many of the sciences have had their origin within the last century . The science of political economy , which teaches the " raising of the greatest quantity of happiness out of a given territory , " is the growth of modern times . This science , comprehending in it the theory of government , well understood , and thoroughly reduced to practice , would alone put an end to public war . The whole circle of moral duties have been investigated and displayed . Able and elegant waiters have taught political and moral truth to all classes . Where lately were to be seen mere machines , to be impelled in any direction by the holder of the master wire , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , and who will do so . To what but the progress of knowledge /z/ and its consequent diffusion , are to be attributed the many favourable changes and improvements of our times ? What , but this , has caused the discontinuance of many barbarous rites , and abolished many foolish , ridiculous , and cruel customs ? Where , now , are the long continued monastic establishments ,  --  the holy wars ,  --  the bloody tournaments of chivalry ,  - -  the wager of battel ,  --  the fires of persecution ,  --  and the horrors of the slave trade ? What , but this , has redeemed Christianity from the deformities of error , superstition , and bigotry ,  --  and restored it to the purity and simplicity with which it now addresses the heart , as its consoler and guide ? What , but the diffusion of knowledge , has provided , by a natural and happy reaction , the means of education and mental improvement , and placed them within the reach of the poorest and humblest individuals of society ? It is this , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of society in the form of corporations and associations , to embody and concentrate human efforts , in effecting the purposes of moral good , and checking the progress of moral evil ; and it is this , which indicates with unerring certainty , that the period is not remote when the history of human virtues will be read with more interest than the account of human crimes ; when the memoirs of the philanthropist , the christian , and the sage will take place and precedence of the annals of those distinguished only for the exercise of the arts of violence and war . There is nothing , however , which so decidedly marks the benignant influence growing out of the /z/ general dissemination of knowledge , as the power which public opinion has acquired over the conduct of arbitrary rulers . Princes decide upon the leading measures of their governments , without consulting many of their subjects . The advisers of the crowi are more likely to consult the passions , caprices , and vices of him who wears it , than to represent the feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus constituted , it has always been a favorite and leading object to disclose as little as possible , of the views and plans of rulers . In France , how long is it , since a single letter sheet contained all the information of the complicated concerns of a great empire , which w as daily allowed to come to the eyes of the whole people of Paris ? and this comprising little else than a detail of the locomotions of the prince  --  and the transfers of power near his person . Amid such total political darkness , the solemn question of peace and war could , and would be decided , with as little inquiry , on the part of the people , as fear of responsibility on the part of the prince . This dark day is ended . The spirit of inquiry has gone forth . It is at work in the most despotic governments . Princes know it . They are gradually , though reluctantly , conforming to it . They feel the necessity of speaking to their people through the press . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give reasons for important measures . Their disputes with other countries are made known ; the points of difference publicly stated . They negotiate and publish the negotiation , with their justificatory reasons . A case must be made out in the view of the nation . /z/ The dispute must be national , not personal . The appeal must be made to the nation , on the justice and necessity of a war ; and not to the nation merely , but the opinion of the christian and civilized world must now be respected . The interests of science and of commerce have become so identified with social order , and the peace of the world so much the common property of all nations , that no single nation dares compromise them , without attempting to conciliate , in form at least , the opinion of the world . What though a powerful prince may have expressed the vandal wish , that he wanted obedient subjects rather than learned men ? It proves only that the mind of the royal speaker is already under the most salutary fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ; and that he must and does respect the opinions of his learned subjects . I Our own country affords a most interesting example to illustrate the power , which knowledge and public opinion possess in preventing the recurrence of war . Our independent history embraces a period of forty years ,  --  years , too , of more political ferment , civil commotions , revolutions , and wars , among nations , than mark the like number , in the whole range of history . During this period , we have had but one war , and that of less than three years ' duration .  - -  Perhaps  --  the proudest triumph of that war ( triumphant as it was in the opinion of its friends ) is the deep and thorough conviction it has left , of the uselessness of all wars ;  --  the choicest victory it achieved , ( victorious as it was ) was the conquest it made over the spirit of war itself . Tlie government and people of this country are not only thus practically pacific , but they stand forth in the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the free political institutions they enjoy , but as a bright example of the happiness of a people , and the prosperity of a nation , on whom peace is allowed to shed its blessings . It is not sufficiently realized , even by ourselves , how much we are indebted for our social happiness , and national greatness , to the continuance of peace . Suppose we , like the nations of Europe , had passed two-thirds of the last forty years in carrying on public war . Our representative systems might have remained unchanged  --  our elections free as now  - -  but what would have become of the social and political happiness of the people ? How much less burthened , distressed , and despoiled , than the people of those countries devoted to public war ? It is not , therefore , so much owing to the freedom of our political institutions , as to our happy freedomYom. wars , that we are a great , growing , and prosperous people . The wisdom of our example is not lost upon the world . The eyes of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The very fact of our neutrality , amid the wars of the last thirty years , has added much to the influence of this example , -m It presents a truly interesting spectacle , to see our young government stand forward , and upon the strength of its political and moral character , invite the old nations to relinquish some of the odious rights of war , and abolish some of its cruel customs . When war upon private property , on land and sea , shall have ceased  --  and thus the hope of plun- /z/ der shall be cut off  --  and the business of war reduced to the mere work of death , it probably will not lonof continue to exist . Amid the vast treasures which have been lavished in support of wars , it is indeed a melancholy consideration , that nothing has been contributed and set apart expressly to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of peace . In war , men are told they must put forth their utmost strength and means , in order to bring the contest to a close . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope is turned into fruition , it is rung in their ears as a maxim not to be controverted ,  --  in peace prepare for ivar ,  --  and thus in fighting and preparing to fight , men are continually wasting their strength and pouring out their treasures . Is it not time to resolve to follow this fiery meteor no longer ? Shall we not endeavour to kindle and support a purer flame , and devote a portion of our strength and means to a holier cause ? Let it be remembered , that patriotic , social , christian duty acknowledges no obligation higher in its nature , more benevolent and sacred in its object . It is not now , as formerly , that wisdom dies with her children ; that a man 's knowledge avails little beyond the sphere of his voice ; that the treasures of knowledge accumulated by the great teachers of mankind , are left to pass slowly along by means of manuscript copies ,  --  and thus , like distant or transient lights , serving to make the general darkness more visible . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages ,  --  now take a permanent and embodied form . The fountain of knowledge is ever filling and flowing . The maxims and eft'usions of /z/ learned and pious men are , as it were in a moment , made known throuofhout Christendom : and the lijrht of truth and know ledge , by means of the press , is poured out , like that from the fountain of day , in a broad and steady stream upon all the abodes of men . After all , is not war purely the effect of ignorance  --  ignorace of government  --  of the political , civil , religious , natural rights of men ? Is it not ignorance of some kind , which can tolerate so reat a curse even for an hour ? If it can be shown that no good ever come of it ; that it has caused evil  --  and that continually. ; that it is unreasonable , unnatural , without necessity ; against all the interests of man , both temporal and spiritual ; destructive of his happiness here , and his hopes of happiness hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death , and its steps take hold on hell ; " what more can be necessary , than to attack it in its strong hold ? Dispel this ignorance , and the abominable delusion will vanish for ever . This task , gentlemen of the Massachusetts Peace Society , is yours , in common with the wise and good men of every country . The means are before you  --  the dissemination of truth and knowledge , by means of the press . If governments are deaf to the calls of duty , and can not be reached by instruction , begin with the people  --  and with the people 's children . Of the labor and expense bestowed in upholding the delusion you would destroy , what proportion , think you , it would take , to establish peace on earth and good will to men ? You must prevail , for it is written , that all they that take the sword , shall perish by the sword .                    @
