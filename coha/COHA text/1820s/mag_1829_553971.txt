txt ART . VIII. - Pelham ; or tile . zldventures of a Gentleman . In two vols. 12 mo . New York . 1828 . INsTEAD of giving our readers the trouble or the privilege , whichever they might consider it , of reading two or three leaves of speculation about novels in general , and this in particular , we will make the author supply an introduction from his two first chapters , which , besides being the key of some subsequent parts of his story , will , we think , bear reading two or three times , and so will be as acceptable to those who have read the work but once , as anything we could say , and probably more so to such as have not read it at all . It will be perceived that Mr Henry Pelham , the hero of the story , is speaking . I am an only child . My father was the younger son of one of our oldest earls , my mother the dowerless daughter of a Scotch peer . Mr Pelham was a moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman of taste , and particularly fond of diamonds and old china . Vulgar people know nothing of the necessaries required in good society , and the credit they give is as short as their pedigree . Six years after my birth , there was an execution in our house . My mother was just setting off on a visit to the duchess of D- ; she declared it was impossible to go without her diamonds . The chief of the bailiffs declared it was impossible to trust them out of his sight . The matter was compromised ; the bailiff went with my mother to C- , and was introduced as my tutor . " A man of singular merit , " whispered my mother , " but so shy 1 " Fortunately the bailiff was abashed , and by losing his impudence he // kept the secret . At the end of the week , the diamonds went to the jeweller 's , and Lady Frances wore paste . I think it was about a month afterwards that a sixteenth cousin left my mother twenty thousand pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and equip me for Melton , " said Mr Pelham . " It will just redeem my diamonds , and new furnish the house , " said Lady Frances . The latter alternative was chosen . My father went down to run his last horse at Newmarket , and my mother received nine hundred people in a Turkish tent . Both were equally fortunate , the Greek and the Turk . My father 's horse lost , in consequence of which he pocketed five thousand pounds ; and my mother looked so charming as a sultana , that Seymour Conway fell desperately in love with her . Mr Conway had just caused two divorces ; and of course all the women in London were dying for him ; judge then of the pride which lady Frances felt at his addresses . The end of the season was unusually dull , and my mother , after having looked over her list of engagements , and ascertained that she had none remaining worth staying for , agreed to elope with her new lover . The carriage was at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life , got up at six o'clock Her foot was on the step , and her hand next to Mr Conway 's heart , when she remembered that her favorite china monster and her French dog were left behind . She insisted on returning , reentered the house , was coming down stairs , with one under each arm , when she wa* met by my father and two servants . My father 's valet had dis*. covered the flight ( I forget how ) , and awakened his master . When my father was convinced of his loss , he called for his dressing-gown , searched the garret and the kitchen , looked in the maids ' drawers and the cellaret , and finally declared he was distracted . I have heard that the servants were quite melted by his grief and I do not doubt it in the least , for he was always celebrated for his skill in private theatricals . He was just retiring to vent his grief in his dressing-room , when he met my mother . It must altogether have been an awkward rencontre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably unfortunate occurrence ; for Seymour Conway was immensely rich , and the damages would , no doubt , have been proportionably high . Had they met each other alone , the affair might easily have been settled , and Lady Frances gone off in tranquillity ; those d-d servants are always in the way Vol. m. pp. 3 , 4 . Not long after this occurrence , by the death of my grandfather , my uncle succeeded to the title and estates of the family . He paid my father 's debts , and established us in the secure enjoy .. ment of our former splendor. ' p. 5. // Mr Pelbam has been blamed by some persons , and espe* cially by some good mothers , for want of filial respect and affection , of which the above passages certainly do not give a very laudable example ; but thQugh he is not , in this respect , the most dutiful of sons , we must admit that he portrays Lady Pelham , and makes his own debut , with great spirit , and satirical poignancy ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successfully and admirably sustained throughout the work , more particularly in her letters to her son when abroad in France . This work is entitled , The Adventures of a Gent1e* , zart , ' with stress upon the latter word . Now there are Various sorts and definitions of gentlemen ; the Sir Charles Grandison , Sir Roger de Coverly , Uncle Toby , Chesterfieldian , the respectable , the fine , the fashionable , the popinjay gentleman , and so forth , down to the Torn and Jerry ' gentleman . Mr Ford gives a catalogue of gentle qualifications in the Merry Wives of Wjndsor . ' Now , Sir John , you are a gpntleman of excellent breeding , admirable discourse , of great admittance , authentic in your place and person , generally allowed for your many warlike , court-like , and learned preparations . ' The title is sometimes considered as exclusively belonging to such as either have fought , or are ready to fight , a duel . A travelled friend relates , that he overheard a conversation between two cockneys in a London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them said , You may distinguish a gentleman by hi* reposing , complacent assurance of the sufficiency of his own qualifications . ' We meet , in social intercourse , with quite a variety of criteria of gentility ; some referring it to the art of the tailor , hair-dresser , or boot-maker , or the tie of the cravat ; some to the carriage of the body ; others to the *ualities and endowments of the mind ; and , what seems a little singular at first thought , a person of ordinary mind will most probably hht upon that quality or circumstance , as a sine qud non of gen*tility* in which he is either almost or altogether deficient ; the reason of which seems , upon reflection , to be , that his mind , being a little troubled upon this point , runs upon it a good deal , and thus magnifies its importance , and it is sure to be the first idea that offers itself when the subject is started . When therefore the author announces his story to be " The Adventures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // kuow what description of this character he has in hand ; end he proves to be a person of good birth and connexions , who being educated and trained for a man of the world , still seizes from time to time upon some useful branches of study ; a Chesterfieldian in studying and humoring the foibles , and flattering the vanity and self-love of those he intends to gain or use , but deviating from that school and conforming to the modern notions , in waving all parade , pretension , and bustle , steadily aiming at and maintaining the distinction , without any apparent assumption or vindication of it . One essential characteristic of our gentleman consists in his being a man of fashion ; a man , like Sir John Falstaff , of large admittance . ' He moves in the highest circles , of which the manners , characters , and modes of living , make a great part of the materials of the work , contrasted , however , as usual , with the underplot of vulgar persone dramati* , knaves , gamblers , blackguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high life , a man of ton. ; and this , though a very common characteristic among invented heroes , is insisted upon , in his case , as a weighty circumstance . At the age of ten we find him at Eton , where he falls in with a schoolfellow , Reginald Glanville , whose mother made her house one of the most reckerclt6 in London . Seldom seen at large assemblies , she was eagerly sought after in the well winnowed soirees of the elect . Her wealth , great as it was , seemed the least prominent ingredient of her establishment . There was in it flo uncalled-for ostentation , no purse-proud vulgarity , no cringing to great , and no patronizing condescension to little people . ' This a well drawn sketch , which is the reason of our going a little out of our way to bring it in , for it is the son , Master Reginald , who is our subject ; who rescued young Pelbam from the drudgery of washing tea-cups ; *nd who used to wander by the river in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , without any companion but his own thoughts ; and these were tin * ed , even at that early age , with a deep and impassioned melancholy . ' He was reserved in his manners , but to those he loved , open and warm ; watchful to gratify others , indifferent to gratification for himself ; of a slight frame , yet of great strength , and athletic skill , and a lion-like courage . This Reginald will make some figure in our story , being in fact the hero 's hero . At the age of eighteen Pelham leaves J*ton for Cambridge , // when he makes the following inventory of his acquirements , in compliment , as he says , to the modern system of education . I could make twenty Latin verses in half an hour ; I could construe , without an English translation , all the easy Latin authors , and many of the difficult ones with it ; I could read Greek fluently , and even translate it through the medium of a Latin version at the bottom of the page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period ; when I once attempted to read Pope 's poems out of school hours , I was laughed at and called " a sap . " ' p. 8 . His whole stock of historical knowledge was comprised in the story of Queen Elizabeth and Lord Essex , which his mother used to repeat to him , and then sinking back on the sofa , in a languid voice tell him of the blessings of a literary taste , and admonish him never to read above half an hour , for fear of losing his health . We give this schedule of acquirements , because we presume the author intends it as a stricture upon the actual state of education at Eton . After two years spent at Cambridge , he does not exactly know how , in the blue and silver of a fellow commoner of Trinity , with the help of a piano-forte in his room , and a billiard-room in a neighboring village , he quits that venerable university , which he says reeked with vulgarity . The men drank beer by the gallon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and talked slang ; rode for wagers , and swore when they lost ; smoked in your face , and expectorated on the floor . Their proudest glory was to drive the mail ; their mightiest exploit to box with the coachman ; their most delicate amour to leer at the bar-maid . ' On taking leave of his dima . Mater he was complimented by his tutor as an honor to his college ; his conduct had been most exemplary , for he had not *valked wantonly over the grass plats , set his dog at the proctor , driven tandems by day , or broken lamps by night , nor entered the chapel to display his intoxication , or the lectureroom to caricature the professors* ' Thus accomplished , being now twenty , he makes his entde in fashionable life at Sir Lionel Garrett 's , in the country , furnished with his mother 's instructions and hints to her dear Henry , ' to gain as much knowledge de l'art culinaire as he could ; pick a up a little acquaintance with metaphysics , if lie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about just now ; ' and by no means to neglect to have a liaison ( quite innocent April , // of course ) with a woman of celebrity in the world . ' We are here joined by a new bevy of characters , some enlisted during the war , others only for this short campaign at Garrett Park . First , the host and hostess , belonging to a set called respectable , ' whose members are above ton , whenever they do not *rasp*at its possession , but who , whenever they do , fall below it . They might have chosen friends among persons of respectability and rank ; they preferred being chosen as acquaintances by persons of ton . Society was their being 's end and aim . ' Then the guests ;  --  a dull political economist ; a quick , sharp little woman , all sparkle and bustle , with small , gray , prying eyes ; and a noli-me-tangere literary lion , Mr Wormwood , who sowed his conversation , not with flowers , but thorns . ' These are introduced to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed ; as but little is made of the literary lion , and nothing of the economist , whose person is described , and his character given , that we may learn how a short , dark , corpulent man , with a quiet , serene , ' sleepy countenance , and short neck , all head and shoulders , like a cod-fish , is horror-struck at having eaten truffles . T he economist and Wormwood are in fact supernumeraries , who should not have entered , without a more considerable part to act . They are merely what the painters call studies , the rude materials gathered up in the first invention , which ought to be rejected , unless more space is found for them in the piece . We apprehend Wormwood to be a defective conception , that could not be wrought into anything tolerable , as a lion of good society ; for 6n saying he had been in a company where every one said a good thing , and being asked by Vincent , whose figure was rather inelegant , And Mr Wormwood what 4id you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lordship 's figure , and said-grace . ' Now this was one of the good things the author had treasured up for his novel ; as be did that of J. Smith 's largest , grant 1 ever saw from the crown , ' to wit , the fat Mr Grant from the Crown Tavern ; and he must needs put it into the mouth of one of his characters , though the admitting of such an exprsssion , in an acid manner , was reducing the whole company below the degree of ton , and a character into whose mouth it is put , can not be managed in society of this sort . We meet also , at Garrett Park , Lady Roseville and Lord Vincent , both well imagined , and both admirably sustained // through the book . The former is described as possessing great sensibility , and even romance of temper , strong passions , and still stronger imagination ; but over all these deeper recesses of her character , the extreme softness and languor of her manners threw a veil , which no superficial observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true , and at the same time not over frequent in fiction ; though in actual life we meet with persons who have softened and polished manners , and a ready and superficial play of the faculties , which , to an undiscriminating observer , or even acquaintance , may be taken for the whole character , while deep feelings and strong impulses are in reserve , discoverable only to those who have kindred traits , and drawn out only on trying occasions , often to the surprise of the unconscious possessor . We do not intend to imply that this kind of character is novel . It occurs in fact and in fiction , and in either case it is of a high species . Lord Vincent is a more unusual character , the filling out and sustaining of which constitutes much of the merit of this hook . He is a man of fashion , and at the same time the organ for displaying the author 's classical and elegant literature . He not only quotes abundance of Latin and French besides a good deal of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two former languages . Vincent is rarely introduced without a quotation or classical allusion , not usually commonplace , but carefully sought out , and selected . It is accordingly a character rather perplexing to readers not suffi .. sufficiently skilled in those languages to understand the quotations and allusions , that is , to a great majority of the readers and ad* mirers of the work ; and it is a strong testimony of its power , that it is read and admired by so many to whom so much of it must be unintelligible . As an actor in the scene , Vincent does not excite nor indeed call for great interest . Amid the whirl and frivolity of fashionable amusements , he is making steady and laborious preparation for political eminence ; and yet he gains no partisans among his readers , who care but little whether he shall be found in the ministry or opposition , or what shall be his fortunes . But the most important incident , during this residence at Garrett Park , is the reappearance of Reginald Glanville , Pelham 's former melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , where he finds him incognito , in a slouched hat and French cloak , attended by his black dog // Terror , sobbing audibly at a new made grave , distinguished by a small grave-stone marked G. D. , which proves , in the sequel , to be that of Gertrude Douglass , a lovely girl to ' whom Glanville had been devotedly attached , whom he had seduced , lived and travelled with in England and on the continent , for many months ; and finally left in England , to go abroad and attend upon his mother , who was taken ill at Thoulouse . The attachment continued with the utmost intenseness on both sides ; hut during Glanville 's absenc.e , Tyrrell , a gambling companion of his , made addresses to his mistress , and being repulsed , he perpetrated personal violence . The girl becomes crazed and dies . This shocking incident is introduced to make Tyi'rell to the last degree odious and execrable , and justify the black hate and thirst of vengeance in Glanville , which are the moving principle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towards the conclusion Glanville is made to describe his visits to the grave of Gertrude where Peiham encountered him . " Night after night I wandered to that lonely place , and longed for a couch beside the sleeper , whom I z*ourned hi the selfishness of my soul . I prostrated myself on the mound ; I humbled myself to tears . In the overflowing anguish of my heart I forgot all that had aroused its stormier passions into life . Revenge , hatred , all vanished . I lifted up my face to the tender heavens ; I called aloud to the silent and placid air ; and when I turned agnin to that unconscious mound , I thought of nothing but the sweetness of our early love and the bitterness of her early death . It was in such moments that your footstep broke upon my grief ;  --  the instant others had seen me-other eyes penetrated the sanctity of my regret ; from that instant , whatever was more soft and holy in the passions and darkness of my mind seemed to vanish away like a scroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was henceforward to make the very key and pivot of my existence . I again recalled the last night of Gertrude 's life ; I again shuddered at the low , murmured sounds , whose dreadful sense broke slowly upon my soul . I again felt the cold - cold , slimy grasp of those wan and dying fingers ; and I again nerved my heart to an iron strength , and vowed deep , deep-rooted , endless , implacable revenge2 " Vol. ii . p. 148 . The workings of his mind in plotting schemes for tormenting Tyrrell , and making his life and death the most excruciating , are described with great power . Among the thousand schemes for retribution which had VOL . XXVIIL-NO. 63. 54 // chased each other across my mind , the death of my victim was only the ulterior object . Death , indeed  --  the pang of one moment-appeared to me but very feeble justice for the life of lingering and restless anguish , to which his treachery had condemned me ; but my penance , my doom , I could have forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , which irritated and fed the sting and venom of my revenge-that revenge , no ordinary punishment could appease . If fanaticism can only be satisfied by the rack and the flames , you may readily conceive a like unap .. peasable fury , in a hatted so deadly , so concentrated , and so just as mine  --  and if fanaticism persuades itself into a virtue , so also did my hatred . " The scheme which I resolved upon was , to attach Tyrrell more and more to the gaming-table , to be present at his infatuation , to feast my eyes upon the feverish intensity of his suspenseto reduce him step by step , to the lowest abyss of poverty  --  to glut my soul with the abjectness and humiliation of his penury-to strip him of all aid , consolation , sympathy , and friendship  --  to follow him , unseen , to his wretched and squalid home  --  to mark the struggles of the craving nature with the loathing pride-and , finally , to watch the frame wear , the eye sink , the lip grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnawing want , to utter starvation . Then , in that last state , but not before , I might reveal myself-stand by the hopeless and succorless bed of death - shriek out in the dizzy ear a name , which could treble the horrors of remembrance-snatch from the struggling and agonizing conscience the last plank , the last straw , to which , in its madness , it could cling , and blacken the shadows of departing life , by opening to the shuddering sense the threshold of an impatient and yawning hell . " ' Vol. ii . p. 150 . Hurried away by the unhallowed fever of these projects , he repaired to Paris where he learned Tyrrell then was , put on a disguise , engaged the codperation of a blackguard , Thornton , to excite Tyrrell 's passion for gambling , and being introduced to Tyrrell as a young Englishman of great wealth and still greater inexperience , his acquaintance is eagerly gr , asped ; and Glanville thus pursues his prey by all the arts of circumvention , and under his disguise , stands by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees his victim drawing towards his fate . In one of these scenes Glanvill.e is thus described . After dinner , I strolled into the various gambling houses , with which the Palais Royal abounds . In one of these , the crowd and heat were so great , that I should immediately have retired , if I had not been struck with the // extreme and intense expression of interest in the countenance of one of the spectators at the rouge et noir table . He was a man about forty years of age ; his complexion was dark and sallow ; the features prominent , and what are generally called handsome ; but there was a certain sinister expression in his eyes and mouth , which rendered the effect of his physiognomy rather disagreeable than prepossessing . At a small distance from him , and playing , with an air which , in its carelessness and nonchalance , formed ii remarkable contrast to the painful anxiety of the man I have just descried , sate Mr Thornton . At first sight , these two appeared to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by seeing the former in that scene , than I was at meeting Thornton there ; for there was something distingu* in the mien of the stranger , which suited far worse with the appearance of the place , than the bourgeois air and dress of my ci-devant second . " What ! another Englishman ? " thought I , as I turned round and perceived a thick rough great coat , which could possibly belong to no continental shoulders . The wearer was standing directly opposite the seat of the swarthy stranger ; his hat was slouched over his face ; I moved in order to get a clearer view of his countenance . It was the same person I had seen with Thornton that morning . Never to this moment have I forgotten the stern and ferocious expression with which he was gazing upon the keen and agitated features of the gambler opposite . In the eye and lip there was neither pleasure , hatred , nor scorn , in their simple and unalloyed elements ; but each seemed blent and mingled into one deadly concentration of evil passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . He appeared utterly insensible of every feeling in common with those around . There he stood , wrapped in his own dark and inscrutable thoughts , never , for one instant , taking his looks from the varying countenance which did not observe their gaze , nor altering the withering character of their almost demoniacal expression . I could not tear myself from the spot . I felt chained by some mysterious and undefinable interest ; my.attention was first diverted into a new channel , by a loud exclamation from the dark-visaged gambler at the table ; it was the first he had uttered , notwithstanding his anxiety ; and , from the deep , thrilling tone in which it was expressed , it conveyed a keen sympathy with the overcharged feelings which it burst from . With a trembling hand , he took from an old purse , the few Napoleons that were still left there . He set them all at one haz .. ard , on the rouge . He hung over the table with a dropping lip ; his hands were tightly clasped in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitation . I ventured to raise my // eyes upon the gaze which I felt must still be upon the gamblerthere it was fixed and stern as before ;  --  but it now conveyed a deeper expression of joy than of the other passions which were there met . Yet a joy so malignant and fiendish , that no look of mere anger or hatred could have so chilled my heart . I dropped my eyes . I redoubled my attention to the cards  --  the last two were to be turned up . A moment more ! -. the fortune was to the nozr . The stranger had lost ! *Ie did not utter a single word . lie looked with a vacant eye on the long mace , with which the marker had swept away his last hopes , with his last coin , and then , rising , left the room , and disappeared . The other Englishman was not long in following him . lie uttered a short , low laug1* , unobserved , perhaps , by any one but myself ; and , pushing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled that pandmmonium , strode quickly to the door. -I felt as if a load had been taken from my bosom , when be was gone . ' Vol. i. pp. 70-72 . Glanville was unwilling that Tyrrell should have even the consolation of the sympathy of one being in the world . There was one that still clung to him with affection , and for whom he still seemed to harbor the better and purer feelings of less degraded and guilty times . This person ( you will readily guess , reader , it was a woman ) , I made it my especial busi .. ness , ' says Glanville , to wean away from my prey . I would not suffer him a consolation he had denied me . I used all the arts of seduction to obtain the transfer of her affections . Whatever promises and vows-whether of love or wealthcould effect , were tried ; nor at last without success . I triumphed . ' Having contrived to strip Tyrrell of his last shilling and reduced him , as he supposed , to the last extremity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost maddened with my triumph , I yielded to the exultation of the moment , I discovered myself . ' After describing the scene of this discovery , he proceeds . " I went joyfully home ; and for the first time since Gertrude 's death , I was happy . But there I imagined my vengeance only would begin ; I revelled in the burning hope of marking the hunger and extremity that must ensue . The next day when Tyrrell turned round in his despair , for one momentary word of comfort from the lips to which he believed , in the fond credulity of his heart , falsehood and treachery never came , his last earthly friend taunted and deserted him . Mark me , I was by a , ' *d heard her . " ' Vol. it . p. 153 . He supposes his victim soon after to perish , and has a particular // account of his sufferings and miserable end . But On returning to England , after some time , he learned that Tyrrell yet lived ' ' " Lived in honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information was like removing a barrier from a stream hitherto pent into quiet and restraint . All the stormy thoughts , feelings , and passions so long at rest , rushed again into a terrible and tumultuous action . The newly formed stratum of my mind was swept away , everything seemed a wreck , a chaos , a convulsion of jarring elements ; but this is a trite and tame description of my feelings ; words would be but commonplace to express the revulsion which I experienced ; yet amidst all , there was one paramount and presiding thought , to which the rest were as atoms in the heap  --  the awakened thought of vengeance ! and yet , how was it to be gratified ? ' Vol. ii . p. 156 . He challenged Tyrrell who returned a contemptuous reply ; upon which Glanville took an oath that before three days expired hell should no longer be cheated of its prey . ' He accordingly pursues him , intending to bring him to a close encounter in which both should fall ; but on the night of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be near to the accomplishment of his purpose , his prey is intercepted by two ruffians , Thornton and Dawson , gambling companions of Tyrrell , who rob and murder him . Glanville arrives at the spot after the fatal deed , and gratifies his still unrelenting thirst of vengeance with the sight of his fallen enemy ; and that he may seem to appease the manes of his lost mistress , he dips her portrait in the wretch 's blood . The story we have been sketching , includes the main plot of the novel , though mostly distinct from the adventures of Pelham , who all the way hovers on his main action , in which he does not directly mingle until , in the close , he undertakes to clear Glanville from being convicted of murder . The subordinate characters who have mingled in this main actipn , and figure very much in the conclusion , namely , Tom Thornton , Dawson , and Job Johnson , are well conceived and ably sustained . Job Johnson and Thornton are capital in their kind , and Thornton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some atonement for the latitudinarian cast of the rest of the story . In many parts of it the connexions which involve the most reprehensible violations of social and moral obligation , are spoken of as matters of course , and exalted and beautified by the highest coloring of sentiment ; and these de // fects are the more glaring by contrast with the high-wrought lesSons of political integrity , inculcated in the parliamentary episode , - as we may call it , for it has no connexion with the main action , - where great pains are taken to raise the hero , Pelham , above all corruption and subserviency to the leaders of his party or its antagonists , when the principles , opinions , and measures , in question , are very indistinctly and crudely set forth ; plainly indicating the writer to be laboring with a subject too large for him to grasp , and too heavy for him to wield . There is nothing in this political digression to bear out the high and energetic tone of the writer , and it is decidedly the least successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much flask language is justifiable , in excuse of which the writer would probably refer his readers to the dictionary of flask terms , of which , if we remember rightly , we have seen some notice ; the night adventure to rescue Dawson from the prison and infirmary of the thieves , is one of the best things in this book , and reminds the reader of the Waverley novels . If we admit the probability of such a private state prison and asylum of thieves in London , to which they may retire in case of danger , and in which they may immure and make away with troublesome confederates , the whole of this scene ,  --  the long and crooked way to reach this panda*-monium ,  --  the circumspection in admitting the visitors ,  --  the portrait of Brimstone Bess , the priestess of this temple ,  --  the group assembled in the council-room of this infernal society ,  - -  the sick man in his chamber ,  --  and all the incidents of the rescue and escape , are done in admirable style . Though Job Johnson among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both arduous characters to sustain , they are not so much out of the common track , as Pelham and Thornton , each of which seems to us to be somewhat novel , and to make a new variety in fictitious portraits , both of them being . sufficiently natural and true . For an affected languor , levity , and effeminacy of manners , with a studied , artificial , insincere style of conversation , and a sneering and contemptuous regard to the phantasmagoria of fashionable life , united with fixed purposes , steadiness of pursuits , real opinions , and sincere attachments , is by no means an improbable and outr* combination ; and yet we do not remember to have met with one , except Vivian Grey , to which Pelham has any close resemblance . And among all the villains with which the world of fiction is peopled , we do not remember any one who may be considered // a precedent for the vulgar high-life manners , flask accomplishments , vicious dexterity , malicious cunning , remorseless Ponchalance , and innate constitutional turpitude of Thornton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes and exaggeration ; and it is not with him an indication of want of talent and invention , and a subterfuge to hide a deficiency of thought , and want of force of expression . There is something of harshness and overdoing throughout the story , which is carried , in some instances , to an outrageous violence , that passes the mark . Thus Peiham is , as he naturally should be , shocked , and his stern honor is awakened , at the thought of Glanville 's being the murderer of Tyrrell , and in danger of being , and too much deserving to be , hanged on this account ; but the making this sentiment control , and , for the time , blight his love for Ellen , is ungrateful and grating . It is that species of slow torture to the reader , which is the forte of a feeble writer , and the feebleness of a powerful one . And the defect is the more glaring , since the author does not rescue Pelham from the dilemma except by a mere sophism and evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder , the barrier to his love is removed , and he hastens to make his declaration , never relenting through fear that Glanville may be banged for a murder which he did not commit , of which he is in great danger . The lesson is , that he is shocked at the guilt , rather than the imputed infamy ; and yet , by his own showing , his friend has sought the life of his victim , through a long series of schemes and adventures , and finally taken an oath too solemn to repeat , that his enemy shall not live three days . And the reader 's sympathy with Glanville , , and desire of the success of his scheme of vengeance , are secured by the high and generous qualities with which he is endowed , and the atrocity of Tyrrell 's offence , and the long tissue of meanness , cowardice , and loathsome depravity by which it is followed ; so that when Glanville falls upon the trail of this miscreant , most devoutly bent upon the execution of his deadly purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister of justice , executing the vengeance for which the laws would arm him , if they could reach his case . He intends , it is true , to fall himself a sacrifice to the vengeance to which he has devoted his victim ; but this is no atonement for his crime , from which he is only saved by the intervention of Thornton and Dawson , who do the murder which he had been meditating so long . It // is clumsy in the author to load Glanville 's conduct with so much iitfamy , and then affect to purify and vindicate him , on the ground that he did not discharge his pistol at his victim , as he would have done bad he been a few minutes earlier . The atrocity of Tyrrell , which gives rise to the concentrated , deadly , unmitigable hate and thirst of vengeance in Glanville , is also too odiou*s to be an admissible incident *a a novel ; so that the origin and catastr0phe of this tragical part of the story , are both excep*. tionable . But the conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindictive , burning hate , in the mind and on the frame of Glanville ; his devout consecration* of his victim to its appeasement. ; the gleams of satisfaction and exultation at its partial gratificatio*i ; the redoubled and accumulating turpitude and loathsomeness of its object , *. - are all , portrayed with a masterly hand . This work is less dramatic in the conduct of the action , than the best English novels , holding an intermediate place , in this respect , between them and the stories* of Godwin'and Maturin . Scott , and the othe. ablest novelists , though they sketch their characters , by way of introduction , do not frequently interrupt the narrative , and suspen&amp; the notion , with comments and dissertations . Peihani 's so frequently i'eminding you that he has strong nerves , * and is not apt to be frightened at anything , dead or alive , is , after all , too much like writing under the picture , This is a lion * which is. superfluous , if the picture is well drawn , and a poor apology for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should be developed in the course of the action and dialogue , and not expressly* ineulca*d and reiterated by the author . Theeharacters/should rno*ve and bear a part in the action througheut , and not , like stenographers , step aside to take notes of its progress . At the commencement of a literary conversation at Lady Roseville 's , for instance , we are favored with a new introduction of the characters , explaining why such a conversation should be had at her house ; *l of which ought to be superfluous , in regard . to persons who have been your companions through a whole volume . The dialogue sometimes takes up subjects of literary discussion and criticism , too general and abstruse . The conferences between Pelbam and Guloseton  --  a well drawn character , by the way-on the subject of gastronomy ; the discussion of collars with Russelton ; the dissection of vanity at Lady Roseville 's ; the piquant sketches of character at the Cheltenham // party , and a hundred others , are all good materials for a novel ; but when we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dip into philosophy and metaphysics , in ' other parts of the book , comparisons are suggested to the prejudice of the novel . In a work containing so much good writing , we are surprised to find the following phrases , which are wholly new to us , and seem to be as paltry an innovation in the use of words , as we remember to have met with in any respectable book ; viz. directly I or any other of his friends was injured , his anger was implacable . ' ( Vol. i. ch. 2 . ) She pressed me to come and see her directly she returned to London . ' ( Vol. i. ch. 8 . ) Directly Glanville 's door was opened , I saw that I had come too late . ' ( Vol. ii . ch. 23 . ) Thornton said , directly we had passed him , " He is Tyrrell 's enemy . " ' ( Vol. ii . ch. 28 . ) The author is evidently smitten with admiration of this poor grammatical deformity ; for he studiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well sounding , and at the same time good English . Were a good novel a more rare production , we should have much more to say of the excellencies and defects of this , which , liable as it is to the gravest exceptions on account of its moral lessons , is certainly one of very high character for striking portraits , richness of thought , strength and originality of conception , and vivacity and energy of style .
