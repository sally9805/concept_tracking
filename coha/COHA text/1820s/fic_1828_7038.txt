Covers , Edges and Spine Main text THE INDIAN WIFE . BY THE AUTHOR OF HODOMOK.  --  May slighted woman turn , And as a vine the oak hath shaken off , Bend lightly to her tendencies again ? Oh , no ! by all her loveliness , by all That makes life poetry and beauty , no ! Make her a slave ; steal from her rosy cheek By needless jealousies ; let the last star Leave her a watcher by your couch of pain ; Wrong her by petulance , suspicion , all That makes her cup a bitterness  --  yet give One evidence of love , and earth has not An emblem of devotedness like hers . But oh ! estrange her once , it boots not how , By wrong or silence , anything that tells A change has come upon your tenderness  --  And there is not a high thing out of heaven Her pride o'ermastereth not . WILLIS . Tahmiroo was the daughter of a powerful Sioux chieftain ; and she was the only being ever known to turn the relentless old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was owing to her infantile beauty ; but more to the gentleness of which that beauty was the emblem . Her 's was a species of loveliness rare among Indian girls . Her figure had the flexile grace so appropriate to protected and dependant woman in refined countries ; her ripe , pouting lip , and dimpled cheek wore the pleading air of aggrieved childhood ; and her dark eye had such an habitual expression of timidity and fear , that the young Sioux called her the Startled Fawn . ' I know not whether her father 's broad lands , or her own appealing beauty , was the most powerful cause of admiration ; but certain it is , Tahmiroo was the unrivalled belle of the Sioux . She was a creature all formed for love . Her downcast eye , her trembling lip , and her quiet , submissive motion , all spoke its language ; yet various young chieftains had in vain sought her affections , and when her father urged her to strengthen his power by an alliance , she answered him only by her tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of French traders came to reside there , for the sake of deriving profit from the fur trade . Among them was Florimond de Ranc , a young , indolent Adonis , whom pure ennui had led from Quebec to the Falls of St Anthony . His fair , round face , and studied foppery of dress might have done little toward gaining the heart of the gentle Sioux ; but there was a deference and courtesy in his manner , which the Indian never pays to degraded woman , and Tahmiroo 's deep sensibilities were touched by it . A more careful arrangement of her rude dress , an anxiety to speak his language fluently , and a close observance of European customs soon betrayed the subtle power , which was fast making her its slave . The ready vanity of the Frenchman quickly perceived it . At first he encouraged it with that sort of undefined pleasure , which man always feels in awakening strong affection in the hearts of even the most insignificant . Then the idea that , though an Indian , she was a princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri were daily becoming of more and more consequence to his ambitious nation , led him to think of marriage with her as a desirable object . His eyes and his manner had said this , long before the old chief began to suspect it ; and he allowed the wily Frenchman to twine himself almost as closely around his heart , as he had around the more yielding soul of his darling child . Though exceedingly indolent by nature , Florimond de Ranc had acquired skill in many graceful arts , which excited the wonder of the savages . He fenced well enough to foil the most expert antagonist , and in hunting , his rifle was sure to carry death to the game . These accomplishments , and the facility with which his pliant nation conform to the usages of savage life , made him a universal favorite , and at his request , he was formally adopted as one of the tribe . But conscious as he was of his power , it was long before he dared to ask for the daughter of the haughty chief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received with a still and terrible wrath , that might well frighten him from his purpose . Rage showed itself only in the swelling veins and clenched hand of the old chief . With the boasted coldness and self-possession of an Indian , he answered , There are Sioux girls enough for the poor pale faces that come among us . A king 's daughter weds the son of a king . Eagles must sleep in an eagle 's nest . ' In vain Tahmiroo knelt and supplicated . In vain she promised that Florimond de Ranc would adopt all his enmities and all his friendships ; that in hunting , and in war , he would be an invaluable treasure . The chief remained inexorable . Then Tahmiroo no longer joined in the dance , and the old men noticed that her rich voice was silent , when they passed her wigwam . The light of her beauty began to fade , and the bright vermillion current , which mantled under her brown cheek , became sluggish and pale . The languid glance she cast on the morning sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not see his beautiful child thus gradually wasting away . He had long averted his eyes , whenever he saw Florimond de Ranc ; but one day , when he crossed his hunting path , he laid his hand on his shoulder , and pointed to Tahmiroo 's dwelling . Not a word was spoken . The proud old man , and the blooming lover entered it together . Tahmiroo was seated in the darkest corner of the wigwam , her head leaning on her hand , her basket work tangled beside her , and a bunch of flowers , the village maidens had brought her , scattered and withering at her feet . The chief looked upon her , with a vehement expression of love , which none but stern countenances can wear . Tahmiroo , ' he said , in a subdued tone , go to the wigwam of the stranger , that your father may again see you love to look on the rising sun , and the opening flowers . ' There was mingled joy and modesty in the upward glance of the Startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ranc saw the light of her mild eye , suddenly and timidly veiled by its deeply fringed lid , he knew that he had lost none of his power . The marriage song was soon heard in the royal wigwam , and the young adventurer became the son of a king . Months and years past on , and found Tahmiroo the same devoted , submissive being . Her husband no longer treated her with the uniform gallantry of a lover . He was not often harsh ; but he adopted something of the coldness and indifference of the nation he had joined . Tahmiroo sometimes wept in secret ; but so much of fear had lately mingled with her love , that she carefully concealed her grief from him who had occasioned it . When she watched his countenance , with that pleading , innocent look , which had always characterized her beauty , she sometimes would obtain a glance such as he had given her in former days , and then her heart would leap like a frolicsome lamb , and she would live cheerfully on the remembrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect . Never was woman , in her heart breaking devotedness , satisfied with such slight testimonials of love , as was this gentle Sioux girl . If Florimond chose to fish , she would herself ply the oars , rather than he should suffer fatigue ; and the gaudy canoe her father had given her , might often be seen gliding down the stream , while Tahmiroo dipped her oars in unison with her soft , rich voice , and the indolent Frenchman lay sunk in luxurious repose . She had learned his religion ; but for herself she never prayed . The cross he had given her was always raised in supplication for him ; and if he but looked unkindly on her , she kissed it , and invoked its aid , in agony of soul . She fancied the sounds of his native land might be dear to him , and she studied his language with a patience and perseverance to which the savage has seldom been known to submit . She tried to imitate the dresses she had heard him describe ; and if he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was always reserved to welcome his return . Yet , for all this lavishness of love , she asked but kind , approving looks , which cost the giver nothing . Alas , for the perverseness of man , in scorning the affection he ceases to doubt ! The little pittance of love for which poor Tahmiroo 's heart yearned so much , was seldom given . Her soul was a perpetual prey to anxiety and excitement ; and the quiet certainty of domestic bliss was never her allotted portion . There were , however , two beings , on whom she could pour forth her whole flood of tenderness , without reproof or disappointment . She had given birth to a son and daughter , of uncommon promise . Victoire , the eldest , had her father 's beauty , save in the melting dark eye , with its plaintive expression , and the modest drooping of its silken lash . Her cheeks had just enough of the Indian hue to give them a warm , rich coloring ; and such was her early maturity , that at thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elasticity of youth , with the staid majesty of womanhood . She had sprung up at her father 's feet , with the sudden luxuriance of a tropical flower ; and her matured loveliness aroused all the dormant tenderness and energy within him . It was with mournful interest he saw her leaping along the chase , with her mother 's bounding , sylphlike joy ; and he would sigh deeply when he observed her oar rapidly cutting the waters of the Missouri , while her boat flew over the surface of the river like a wild bird in sport  --  and the gay young creature would wind round among the eddies , or dart forward , with her hair streaming on the wind , and her lips parted with eagerness . Tahmiroo did not understand the nature of his emotions . She thought , in the simplicity of her heart , that silence and sadness were the natural expressions of a white man 's love ; but when he turned his restless gaze from his daughter to her , she met an expression which troubled her . Indifference had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawingroom or the wilderness , is painfully alive to the sting of scorn . Sometimes her placid nature was disturbed by a strange jealousy of her own child . I love Victoire only because she is the daughter of Florimond , ' thought she ; and why , oh ! why does he not love me for being the mother of Victoire ? ' It was too evident , that De Ranc wished his daughter should be estranged from her mother , and her mother 's people . With all members of the tribe , out of his own family , he sternly forbade her having any intercourse ; and even there he kept her constantly employed in taking dancing lessons from himself , and obtaining various branches of learning from an old Catholic priest , whom he had solicited to reside with him for that purpose . But this kind of life was irksome to the Indian girl , and she was perpetually escaping the vigilance of her father , to try her arrow in the woods , or guide her pretty canoe over the waters . De Ranc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his daughter , without removing her from the attractions of her savage home , and each day 's experience convinced him more and more of the truth of this conclusion . To favor his project he assumed an affectionate manner towards his wife ; for he well knew that one look or word of kindness would at any time win back all her love . When the deep sensibilities of her warm heart were roused , he would ask for leave to sell her lands ; and she , in her prodigality of tenderness , would have given him anything , even her own life , for such smiles as he then bestowed . The old chief was dead , and there was no one to check the unfeeling rapacity of the Frenchman . Tracts after tracts of Tahmiroo 's valuable land were sold , and the money remitted to Quebec , whither he had the purpose of conveying his children , on the pretence of a visit , but in reality with the firm intent of never again beholding his deserted wife . A company of Canadian traders happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this juncture , and Florimond de Ranc took the opportunity to apprise Tahmiroo of his intention to educate Victoire at one of the convents in Quebec . The Sioux pleaded with all the earnestness of a mother 's eloquence ; but she pleaded in vain . Victoire and her father joined the company of traders , on their return to Canada . Tahmiroo knelt and fervently besought that she might accompany them . She would stay out of sight , she said ; they should not be ashamed of her , among the great white folks at the east ; and if she could but live where she could see them every day , she should die happier . Ashamed of you ! and you the daughter of a Sioux king ! ' exclaimed Victoire proudly , and , with a natural impulse of tenderness , fell on her mother 's neck , and wept . Victoire , ' t is time to depart ! ' said her father sternly . The sobbing girl tried to release herself ; but she could not . Tahmiroo embraced her with the energy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Victoire was the darling child of her bosom  --  she was so much the image of Florimond when he first said he loved her . Woman ! let her go ! ' exclaimed De Ranc , exasperated by the length of the parting scene . Tahmiroo raised her eyes anxiously to his face , and she saw that his arm was raised to strike her . I am a poor daughter of the Sioux ; oh ! why did you marry me ? ' exclaimed she , in a tone of passionate grief . For your father 's lands , ' said the Frenchman coldly . This was the drop too much . Poor Tahmiroo with a piercing shriek fell on the earth , and hid her face in the grass . She knew not how long she remained there . Her highly wrought feelings had brought on a dizziness of the brain ; and she was conscious only of a sensation of sickness , accompanied by the sound of receding voices . When she recovered , she found herself alone with Louis , her little boy , then about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the traders had departed , and having in vain tried to waken his mother , he had laid himself down at her side , and slept on his bow and arrows . From that hour Tahmiroo was changed . Her quiet , submissive air gave place to a stern and lofty manner ; and she , who had always been so gentle , became as bitter and implacable as the most blood thirsty of her tribe . In little Louis all the strong feelings of her soul were centered ; but even her affection for him was characterized by a strange and unwonted fierceness . Her only care seemed to be to make him like his grandfather , and to instil a deadly hatred of white men ; and the boy learned his lessons well . He was the veriest little savage that ever let fly an arrow . To his mother alone he yielded anything like submission ; and the Sioux were proud to hail the haughty child as their future chieftain . Such was the aspect of things on the shores of the Mississippi , when Florimond de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . He was induced to make this visit , partly from a lingering curiosity to see his boy , and partly from the hopes of obtaining more land from the yielding Tahmiroo . He affected much contrition for his past conduct , and promised to return with Victoire , before the year expired . Tahmiroo met him with the most chilling indifference , and listened to him with a vacant look , as if she heard him not . It was only when he spoke to her boy , that he could arouse her from this apparent lethargy . On this subject she was all suspicion . She had a sort of undefined dread that he too would be carried away from her ; and she watched over him like a she wolf , when her young is in danger . Her fears were not unfounded ; for Florimond de Ranc did intend , by demonstrations of fondness , and glowing descriptions of Quebec , to kindle in the mind of his son a desire to accompany him . Tahmiroo thought the hatred of white men , which she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but many weeks had not elapsed , before she saw that Louis was fast yielding himself up to the fascinating power , which had enthralled her own youthful spirit . With this discovery came horrible thoughts of vengeance ; and more than once , she had nearly nerved her soul to murder the father of her son ; but she could not . Something in his features still reminded her of the devoted young Frenchman who had carried her quiver through the woods , and kissed the moccasin he stooped to lace , and she could not kill him . The last cutting blow was soon given to the heart of the Indian Wife . Young Louis , full of boyish curiosity , expressed a wish to go with his father , though he , at the same time , promised a speedy return . He had always been a stubborn boy ; and she felt now as if her wornout spirit would vainly contend against his wilfulness . With that sort of resigned stupor , which often indicates approaching insanity , she yielded to his request , exacting , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Mississippi with her , the day before his departure . The day arrived . Florimond de Ranc was at a distance on business . Tahmiroo decked herself in the garments and jewels she had worn on the day of her marriage , and selected the gaudiest wampum belts for the little Louis . Why do you put these on ? ' said the boy . Because Tahmiroo will no more see her son in the land of the Sioux , ' said she , mournfully , and when her father meets her in the Spirit Land , he will know the beads he gave her . ' She took the wondering boy by the hand , and led him to the river side . There lay the canoe her father had given her when she left him for the wigwam of the Stranger . ' It was faded and bruised now , and so were all her hopes . She looked back on the hut , where she had spent her brief term of wedded happiness , and its peacefulness seemed a mockery of her misery . And was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deserted one  --  was she the Startled Fawn ' of the Sioux , for whom contending chiefs had asked in vain ? The remembrance of all her love and all her wrongs came up before her memory , and death seemed more pleasant to her than the gay dance she once loved so well . But then her eye rested on her boy  --  and , O God ! with what an agony of love ! It was the last vehement struggle of a soul all formed for tenderness . We will go to the Spirit Land together , ' she exclaimed . He can not come there to rob me ! ' She took Louis in her arms , as if he had been a feather , and springing into the boat , she guided it toward the Falls of St Anthony . Mother , mother ! the canoe is going over the rapids ! ' screamed the frightened child . My father stands on the waves and beckons me ! ' she said . The boy looked at the horribly fixed expression of her face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataract . Louis de Ranc was seen no more . He sleeps with the Startled Fawn ' of the Sioux , in the waves of the Mississippi ! The story is well remembered by the Indians of the present day ; and when a mist gathers over the Falls , they often say , Let us not hunt to day . A storm will certainly come ; for Tahmiroo and her son are going over the Falls of St Anthony . ' Back matter PROSPECTUS .
