txt of a science , there have been two schools of construction , the one contending for a literal adherence to the text , and the other supporting a more liberal principle of interpretation , and allowing greater latitude to the spirit of an enlightened Juridical philosophy . This division among the professors of the Roman law , of which we lThve an agreeable history by Heineccius , commenced under the administration of Augustus , and continued until the reign of good Aurelius ; the students of law generally arranging themselves as disciples of one sect or the other , although it was some time before they assumed the permanent appellations , by which they were afterwards distinguished , of Proculeians , and Sabinians , or Cassians . The lawyers of the latter reign , according to Claude Ferri&amp;re , translated by the learned Dr Cooper , affected neither party in particular , for at different times they dispassionately approved the opinions of either sect , as they judged them more or less agreeable to justice and right reason , and they generally ende*rored , hy an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by reason of their great dislike and opposition to each other , had frequently fallen . ' The division may be deemed to have died away during the dark ages , when the books of the law were lost , like those of Livy . The subject was revived , and this question made a conspicuous figure in the discussion of the Code Napoleon ; and , singular as it may seem to those , who are familiar with the sturdy spirit of the old common law , something of this difference has actually crossed the channel into England ; although , as Mr Butler observes , the good sense of English lawyers has prevented them from forming into sects . ' There is ) however , one instructive and nvaluable reading , on a subject of this kind , to which we are referred among the relics of the philosophical mind of Burke , in a report of his on the trial of Warren Hastings , namely , whether in cases for which neither the written nor unwritten law of a nation had provided , courts of law might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and principles to it , or by subtracting from their operation ? ' But this is going a length , to which we have no inclination to be enlisted . And we are moreover aware , that the topic , on which Mr Du Ponceau is engaged , is one about which the public , or at least that portion of it , which enters into the spirit of such // subjects , and concerns itself the most with the genius of the system , is somewhat at a stand ; and we believe there are some of th' fairest , and most intelligent minds in the country , that have not been quite able to come to a satisfactory conclusion . We are not left in the dark to_the trace the origin of our jurisprudence . In seeking to find it by the light of history , we are naturally led back to the municipal institutions of our mother country . These are the gentis incunabula nostre . It has always been considered the privilege of colonies to carry with them the laws of the mother country , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raleigh ; and it is delightful to reflect , that our principles of colonisation , in this respect , were actually drawn from the undefiled fountains of Grecian Jurisprudence , in their present state , as they were exhibited and illustrated in those beautiful images of Greece herself , which successively arose among her offspring in the Archipelago , and were refls*ted on the coasts of Asia Minor and Gra*cia Magna . It is rather an interesting coincidence , that the publication of the great work of Grotius , in which these principles were unfolded , was nearly coeval with the colonisation of this country ; and we consider it quite plain , that the English establishments on this continent were formed more after the model of the Grecian , than the Roman colonies , though it was equally a fact , that the laws of Rome extended with her empire . The points of difference , it does not fall within our present province to define , nor to defend the analogy to which we allude . Upon the soundest principles of public jurisprudence , the colonists considered the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law as their birthright . The same rule of common sense prevailed in regard to this subject , on both sides of the Atlantic ; and the doctrine was recognised in Westminster Hall as it was held here , that the common law of England extended to these colonies , precisely so far as it related to their circumstances . It is perfectly evident , however , that the original constitution of England did not contemplate the extension of its internal jurisprudence to such exterior establishments , as they could not have been foreseen to form component parts of the empire . This was a case , that arose unexpectedly out of // the appropriation of this newly discovered country among the powers of Europe ; and the jurists of England adjusted the question , as well as they could , according to the general analogies of their own system . The regulations adopted for the government of these newly acquired territories were , therdfore , in the first instance , the precipitate result of so much speculative sagacity as fell , for instance , to the portion of that second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his childish exultation over his precious carcanet of colonial rubies , onyx cum prole , entertained a design of consummating their earthly felicity , by a complete codification of his own wise making . The consequences of this simple folly might , however , have been overruled , so as to be rendered less pernicious , than the evil starred projects , and mysteriously guided counsels , of his immediate descendants . By their frames of government , the colonies were forbidden to exercise the powers of legislation , in any manner repugnant to the laws of England . That they should be obliged to avoid all acts in derogation of that sovereignty , upon which they reclined for protection during their infant period , was a perfectly suitable provision ; but that it should have any bearing in matters of a merely municipal nature , having no relation to their dependence , nor connexion with the internal police of Great Britain , nor affecting the interest of the empire , any further than it concerned their own domestic economy and improvement , was at least an absurd and impracticable piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere in these concerns , for the sake of promoting her own exclusive interest and aggrandisement , was unquestionably oppressive and intolerable . The true principle and spirit of this political restriction undoubtedly were , to prevent the passing of any laws inconsistent with the interest , or incompatible with the integrity of the whole empire , of which they constituted part ; and it was analogous to the policy of the present constitution of the United States , by which the independent states are deprived of the power of passing any acts , repugnant to its provisions or its spirit . The colonies , therefore , justly considered it in no wise repugnant to their obligations or allegiance , and as no more a violation of the laws of England , than an infraction of their own char* // tel 's , to adopt all such regulations of a merely municipal nature , as they might find useful or expedient for themselves , and suitable to their condition . It may be the more material to keep these circumstances in view , inasmuch as the common law not composing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a general political and civil nature , at least in regard to ourselves , with as much propriety as it is to be sought in the more authentic records , which it acknowledges , of judicial precedents , and juridical commentaries . Furthermore , it is interesting , that on this circumstance , namely , that it did not constitute a regular , definite , and elaborate code , connected with its contiguous causes , we are to account for , and explain the most singular f ) henomenon , the neque idem man ebat , neque idem decedebat , of American common law . This circumstance itself has been seized , with a prodigious avidity , to prove the incoherence of any hypothesis whatever of common law for the country . It is therefore useful , in this point of view , to advert to the causes of that deflection , which the common law under*vent in this country , as well as to account for the various casts , which it assumed among the different colonies . It is rather desirable , in this respect , to redeem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thes% causes , as being either a very inconsistent or indifferent species of jurisprudence . Our worthy forefathers have enjoyed quite as much credit , as they fairly deserved , for the amusing casuistry , with which they have been accused of construing their charters , and the legerdemain with which they were suspected of changing their tenures . In this respect they did hut practise , in any way , upon the genuine spirit of the common law itself , which is not , after all , quite so crabbed , as some of its adversaries are pleased to suppose ; but is a more flexible and apt species of jurisprudence , containing an internal principle of reformation within itself , and accommodating itself with equal facility to the advances of science and the changes of society . The character of the common law , in this respect , richly justifies all the remarks , which are made by Mr Du Ponceau , in different parts of his work , and especially the well considered eulogium of the late Mr Justice Wilson , in his charge // on the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his preface . Our own opinion on this point , indeed , is sufficiently indicated in our last number but one , in the occasion we had to comment upon an interesting and important branch of maritime law . Concerning the fictions , that were invented by the coidnial lawyers , to sanction or systematise these just and necessary inflections of its rules , to the uses and circumstances of the times and their own peculiar situation , according to their narrow notions and technical conceptions of the common law , they were , without doubt , sufficiently ingenious and absurd ; but they only serve to show the fashion of juridical thinking at that day , and the vague fancy for something like codification , which possesses the spirit of some part of the profession , and from which our most barbarous old common lawyers were not entirely free . As the colonies were settled at different intervals , diversis manipulis , and the common law was in the meantime undergoing considerable mutations from acts of parliament , and modifications from judicial decisions , in cases of more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law at various successive stages of improvement . Actual diversities , without any doubt , resulted from legislative provisions , as well as judicial determinations , in the different colonies themselves . But as they mainly grew out of the different circumstances in which they were situated , and the peculiar interests of their separate sections ; as they were not incompatible with the general welfare of the whole ; and as the colonies constituted altogether one great community , there was nothing in these minute variations , to demonstrate any actual departure from the proper principles of the common law , or to establish absolute dissonance in the character of the system , in respect to which they were , in truth , to be regarded as being in the spirit of the most perfect harmony . As the colonists were collected together under circumstances , essentially different from the condition of their fellow subjects in Great Britain , haviiig mutual interests , accompanied by a j ) erfect intercoinmunity of social rights , and sustaining the same general system of civil relations , there was a general affinity pervading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proper principles of the common law . // These circumstances , therefore , afford no more ground for any conclusion , detracting from the existence of a common law among the colonies , than there is to be drawn from the various customs in England , or the privileges of the counties palatine , against the general power and authority of the common law there . Or they may be *compared , perhaps , more aptly , to the great variety of coutumes existing in France , which it was the favorite object of her most illustrious sovereigns , and enlightened jurists , particularly the Chancellor D'Aguesseau , to condense into one uniform system of jurisprudence . The civil law was nevertheless the basis of all these varieties ; it is , indeed , as Mr Du Ponceau denominates it , the jus commune , or the common law of Europe , the general foundation of the continental systems of jurisprudence . There is another circumstance , which ought not , perhaps , to be entirely omitted , although it may not amount to much in the aggregate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign extraction , and acquired by conquest or cession . These would properly he entitled to preserve their original institutions , until their population became so intermingled with the new inhabitants , that it could no longer be distinguished , and their particular customs became gradually merged in the prevailing law of the land . In fact , there were none of the colonies , in which all traces of foreign jurisprudence were more perfectly obliterated , and the features of the common law more distinctly impressed , than in those middle states , which were formerly in this condition . Indeed , if any difficulty of this kind could have arisen , in regard to this question , it would have been after the conquest of Canada , and its incorporation into our colonial system , where , by the terms of the cession , the French law , founded on the civil , still prevails , and holds , at least , a divided empire with the English common law . Such a case actually exists in Louisiana , where the civil and common law unite , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . We are fully persuaded , that this question , which engages Mr Du Ponceau , can not be thoroughly investigated , and the true body of American common law effectually disinterred , without going back beyond the origin of the constitution , and // 111 digging somewhat deeply into the grounds of our colonial jurisprudence . The period before the Revolution may well be denominated the Antejustinianean era , and in the plinciples of our colonial polity , we may discover the seeds of our present system . There we ni.ay discern the germs of our present establishments , and the stamina of all our civil institutions . There may be some complexity in the principles , and some difficulty in pursuing the details of this inquiry , but ample causes exist for supporting the conclusion , that , though divided into different forms , and distinguished by a variety of particulars , relating to their local interests and usages , in respect to the franchises enjoyed under their charters , and the privileges parcelled out by the proprietors , or those more immediately derived from the prerogative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material respects , one common system of colonial polity . And we are happy to avail ourselves of the opportunity , presented by lVlr Sergeant 's discussion , in its nature a preliminary one , of doing something towards completing the sketch he has given of the state of the judiciary powers in this country , at a period prior to the adoption of the constitution . Among the reasons for entertaining such a supposition , we may advert to the following circumstances , namely , that all the lands were held originally under grants from the crown , which claimed the whole country by virtue of ( liscovery and right of occupation ; that the colonists were all fellow subjects , owing a common allegiance to the king , and claiming a common protection from the crown of Great Britain ; the ( liversities in their condition springing from their charters , and kept up by their forms of government , resulted , also , from the acts of the crown , while at the same time their local differences were adjusted , and their mutual relations harmonised , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing part of the inquiry relates to the power of parliament ; principally because questions were raised , in the course of political disputes , of a practical character , which admitted of no umpire , and which could only be settled at the point of the sword . From jealous apprehension of the designs of the English Commons , to make arbitrary assessments upon their property , the colonists were inclined to put themselves entirely under the protection of // 112 Common Law Jurisdiction . the king , and finding that he entered equally deep into the combination against their rights , they came to the conclusion of rejecting the power of parliament altogether . How parliament ever came by the power , that it actually exercised so long without much question or offence , is foreign from the present inquiry , any further than to remark , that it was one of those jewels of the crown , which were wrested with the diadem from the brow of Charles the First , and that the celebrated Navigation Act , which was so long considered as essential to England in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the earnest of this assumption , and long remained the surviving monument of the usurpation . But whatever the origin of this authority may have been , an inquiry , which finally ceases , like many others , to be of any practical importance , this is certain , that such a power was not only , for a long period , exercised by parliament with impunity , as it respected the external condition of the colonies as parts of the empire , but its authority was also acknowledged to extend by common consent , in general acquiescence , in several instances , so far as to regulate their internal concerns , and control their reciprocal relations . Besides the Navigation Act , anti other salutary provisions of the same description , for regulating the trade and commerce of the colonies , imposing duties on exports , and restraints on manufacturing industry , acts of imperial legislation , which came gradually to be regarded in rather a questionable shape , and which terminated at last in producing a prosperous rebellion ,  --  besides these , there were again others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was never practically contested , nor their principle theoretically disputed . Among these provisions may be enumerated , the acts of parliament ; 1 , establishing a general post office at the beginning of the last century , and raising a revenue on postage for defraying the expense of the establishment , of which Franklin was at the head , just before it was abolished by the Revolution ; 2 , regulating the colonial currency ; 3 , altering the laws of property , by changing real estates in some respects into chattel interests ; 4 , altering the rules of evidence , by requiring the admission of affidavits of creditors , duly authenticated in England , by the courts of justice in the colonies 5 , laying an assessment of hospital money on // American seamen ; 6 , dissolving contracts of service created by indentures , and discharging apprentices from their masters on their enlistment into the army ; 7 , naturalizing all foreign protestants and Jews , residing seven years in the colonies . Mi* Du Ponceau remarks , that until the late Revolution , the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make one whole with the remainder of the Bt'itish empire , and have never ceased to be tinder a national superinten ( Iiflg government . ' Before the Revolution , ' he adds , it was in the king and parliament of Great Britain , whose powers were limited , like those of the government which supplies its place . ' It was a maxim of English jurisprudence , that though acts of parliament did not extend beyond the empire , nor operate upon its dependencies proprio vigore , yet they applied to , and bound them , when they were expressly comprehended in the purview of the act . This was rather an ambiguous authority , which was never either precisely contested nor conceded , never absolutely yielded in any matter of money , nor called in question , when it was exercised for the benefit of the colonies . In consequence of the events of our Revolution , it has probably been silently abandoned in relation to the remaining colonies . However the exercise of a power of executing a general system of internal improvement , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been relished , we have no great reason to suppose it would have been resisted by the stoutest champions of their rights and liberties , so long as the government should have limited itself to the application of its own resources , and abstained from extracting an involuntary appropriation from the colonial treasuries . This was a point on which they were sotnewhat particular and in a matter of that kind , it was very much their manner , rendered rather inveterate by tisage , and somewhat irritable by opposition , to do nothing without asking their own advice . The act requiring the use of stamps in courts of justice , afterwards so odious , differed only from the provision before alluded to , respecting affidavits , in this ungracious circumstance , that it went to raise a revenue against their will . In the act for the general post office establishment , it is a little // remarkable , that even this specific difference was overlooked ; and it is a circumstance of some curiosity , that Franklin , who was the Falkland of our civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was no foe , on the whole , to the temperate authority of parliament , *enjoyed a salary from this source , which did not exactly square with his argument , while he acted as an agent in England . It is another striking illustration , that the celebrated Albany plan of union , which was projected on the eve of the war of 1756 , for colonial defence , and which was finally rendered al4ortive , by the compound jealousy of the English government on one hand , that it gave too much strength to the colonies , and their own suspicious apprehension on the other , that it conferred too much power upon the crown , was to be founded on the final authority of an act of parliament . It will also be remembered , that when that fine territory , 110w distinguished by the general name of the Valley of the Mississippi , which was conquered in that war , was secured by the treaty of peace , it was parcelled out into provinces by a royal l ) roclainatioll in 1763 . The policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title , has been supported by a recent determination of the Supreme Court of the United States . We believe it is also a fact , that the king had his forests interspersed among the provinces , and was accustomed to mark his broad arrow on the trees most suitable for the tall admirals of his royal navy ; and if we are not mistaken in our recollection , the late Governor Wentworth , of New Hampshire , was the last who enjoyed the office of royal ranger , or surveyor . It is , moreover , well known , that the royal domains remaining in the country , or tile crown lands , as they were called at the commencement of the Revolution , were claimed by the United States as common national property , on the ground of conquest in their confederate capacity . To pursue the point , however , through the difficulties that were made by Maryland , dtiring the Revolution , on account of her circumscribed boundary , to the mode in which the subject was finally settled by Congress , although it would not prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the discussion of it , which may as well be passed over . // Throughout the whole of our controversy with Great Britain , the colonists contended for the existence of a general civil constitution for the colonies , to which they constantly appealed for the definition and security of these rights , which they claimed as native horn subjects , and which was founded , and could be maintained , on no other basis , than that of the common law of England . Indeed it can not be contested , that the elements of the En*lish system of jurisprudence , existed in their full vigor in the colonies , excepting such parts of it as related more exclusively to its feudal and ecclesiastical institutions . Governor Pownall , than whom , it is probable , a more constitutional jurist did not exist in the colonies , and whose authority is frequently referred to with the utmost respect by Dr Franklin , lays it down as a rule universally adopted through all the colonies , that they carried with them to America the common law of England , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as were in force at the time of their establishment. * In all the colonies , he says , the common law is received as the foundation and main body of their law . The variegated aspect , which this common law exhibited in the colonies , may be accounted for mainly by two circumstances . The first is , that it was a system of principles , depending chiefly for its form on its judicial administration ; and , secondly , that the jurisprudence itself ; not being contained in any exact code , but in a combined condition with actual jurisdiction , these elements did not so much require to be embodied , as to have a general organ established for their interpretation . These circumstances must be taken into view together , to explain the apparent discrepancies in the colonial system . It is a characteristic principle of the common law of England , that its evidence exists emphatically in judicial exposition . This circumstance naturally gave the common law the complexion of a Jurisprudence dVlrrets , or what is familiarly denominated judicial legislation ; and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is presented in the parliamentary law of France , but for the peculiar structure of the English system , the intercommunication of the courts at Westminster , and the The Administration of the Colonies ; wherein their Rights and Consti tetions are discussed and stated . By Thomas Posvnall , &amp;c , London , 1768. // piedominant capacity of the House of Lords , as an ultimate tribunal to pronounce the common , and expound the statute law of the realm . In England , ' says *lr Du Poncean , ( p. 1.27 , ) there is , in fact , but one great judicature , sitting at Westminster . Although divided into different tribunals , the same spirit pervades them all ; and in important cases the twelve judges meet together to decide . Above them all is the House of ' Lords* whose judgments are final and conclusive . ' But iii that country , again , he remarks , ( p. 6 , ) the jurisdiction of almost every tribunal is derived from the common law , that is , from ancient usage . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of English jurisprudence . Jurisdiction and law flow together in a mixed stream , which in England there is little necessity to analyse , in order to separate its component parts . ' The same intermingled current has passed over to us , it may be added , as it descended from antiquity . Still the natural consequences of this primal constitution of the common law are obvious , and their operation is well illustrated , by the description given of it by Lord Chief Justice Hale , in the ancient county courts , into which England was formerly divided , according to the following enumeration . First , the ignorance of the judges , who were freeholders of the county ; secondly , that these various courts bred varieties of law , especially in the several counties , for the decisions or judgmn ? nts being made by divers courts , and several independent judges and judicatories , who had no common interest amongst themselves , in their several judicatories , thereby , in process of time , every several county would have several laws , customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the business of any moment was carried by parties and factions , and that those of great power and interest in the county , did easily overbear others in their own causes , or in such wherein they were interested , either by relation of kindred , tenure , service , dependence , or application . ' This is certainly a very natural account of the operations of such consequences as would be apt to follow , in the absence of a general controlling jurisdiction , such as did not exist in the colonies , and on this subject Governor Pownall very candidly remarks , that it was no disgrace to many gentlemen , sitting on the benches of the courts of law in the colonies , to say // that they were not , and could not be expected , to be lawyers learned in the law. * Still , in England the common law arose superior to all these circumstances , and vindicated to itself a character , to which causes could not be equally propitious here . Although the common law was thus received in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , Governor Pownall further remarks , that each colony being vested with legislative power , in addition to the circumstance before alluded to , of the exercise of judicial authority , the common law became therehy liable to continual alteration ; so that , as a great lawyer of the colonies , probably a crown lawyer , had said , by reason of the diversity of their resolutions , in their respective superior courts , and of the several new acts or laws made in them severally , the several systems of the laws of those colonies grew more and more variant , not only from one another , but from the laws of England . ' ( p. lOs . ) Upon this point again , Governor Pownall observes , ( p. 102 , ) that where the circumstances of a country and people , and their relations to the statutes and common law differ so greatly , the common law of these countries must , in its natural course , become different , and sometimes even contrary , or at least incompatible with the common law of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both from the statute and common law , ( namely , of England , ) irnist be rejected . This renders the judicatories of these countries vague and precarious , if not arbitrary , and leads to the rendering the common law of the country different , incompatible with , if not contrary to and independent of , the law of the mother country . ' In support of these remarks , the following observations are quoted from an author of one of our colonial histories . The state of our laws opens a door to much controversy . The uncertainty with respect to them , renders property precarious , and greatly exposes us to the arbitrary decision of bad judges . The common law of England is generally received , together with such statutes as were enacted before we had a legislature of our own . But our courts exercise a sovereign authority , in determining what parts of the common and statute law ought to be extended ; // for it must be admitted , that the difference of circumstances neccssarily requires us , in some cases , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also extended even acts of parliament , passed since we have had a distinct legislation , which is adding greatly to our confusion . The practice of our courts is not less uncertain than the law . Some of the English rules are adopted , others rejected . Two things , therefore , seem to he absolutely necessary for the public security ; first , the passing an act for settling the extent of the English laws ; secondly , that the courts ordain a general set of rules for the regulation of practice . ' Governor Pownall observes , that , from this representation of things , it is evident that something is wanting to fix determinately the judicial powers , ' and further , he deemed it important to make an entire new organisation of them , on principles which he suggests , analogous to the general jurisdiction already estahlished hy the laws of England , and corresponding to the political constitution of the colonies . Some objection , he supposed , might he raised in the minds of the colonists against the erection of any new jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realm hut no solid objection seemed to exist , in his view , to the establishment of courts , the laws of whose practice , jurisdiction , and powers , are already settled hy the laws of the realm . ' It was a question , which he anticipated , whether the crown could , or could not , erect in the colonies , without the concurrence of the legislature , courts of chancery , exchequer , king 's hench , common pleas , admiralty , and prohate , or ecclesiastical courts . However that might he , he considered it a subject strongly recommending itself to the wisdom of the imperial legislature . The remarks of Governor Pownall on this subject , are so exceedingly instructive , that we regret that our limits , already considerahly encroached upon , will not allow us to extend them . in order to comprehend the subject fully , and at the same time encounter the appalling exhibition he has presented , concerning the causes of the corruption , as the crown lawyers might he pleased to consider it , of the colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed reform , it may he convenient to advert to the actual judicial constitution of the colonies , as understood in theory , and established in practice . // By the theory of the colonial government , the power of administering justice was unquestionably an emanation from the sovereignty . By the constitution of the empire , the king was the fountain of justice . Witness ourself at Westminster was the style in which the current ran in England ; and it is a familiar anecdote of the same Solomon , who sat upon the English throne , that he was seized with the fancy to preside , according to the flesh , as the absolute personification of justice . Judicial proceedings were all conducted in the colonies in the name of the king , with the exception of a short period , when our ancestors in Massachusetts Bay undertook to coin their money , and lay down the law in the name of their own supreme majesty ,  --  one of those juvenile exploits of state sovereignty , for which they were afterwards fined , in the loss of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a province ; and also of having the province of Maine incorporated with the old colony in her boundaries . This authority of the sovereign , however , was not enjoyed undivided , nor its details undisputed . The crown assumed the power of establishing courts , and retained the actual appointment of judges . This last point was never practically contested , but it was asserted as a principle , by the colonial jurists , that courts could not be erected without an act of their own legislature . It was not contended by the crown lawyers , that the claim of the crown to erect judicatories in the colonies , extended to any right of defining the jurisdiction of those courts , or the laws by which it was to be exercised . They did not assume the power of establishing any new species of authority , unknown to the laws of the realm ; but the ground on which they placed the pretension was this ; The crown names the judge , and establishes the courts , but the jurisdiction is settled by the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution , when it worked itself into the catalogue of grievances . With this limitation of the power of the crown , and this protest against the erection of any tribunal , on principles unknown to the laws , it was evidently the impression entertained , by some of the most liberal and enlightened jurists in the colonies , that there was no constitutional impediment to the establishment of courts , the rules of whose jurisdiction should he previously recognised , defined , and settled , by the laws of // the realm . It appears to be a fact , that all the powers , which existed in the colonies for administering justice , were derived originally from the crown , either through the instru. * mentality of their charters , or by commissions to the govern ors . These latter especially contai*ned an express delegation of all its judicial power , and jurisdictions of chancery , admiralty , and supreme ordinary , as well as of common law , and authorised or directed the establishment of courts. * It is stated by Mr Sergeant , in the sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , from the first settlement of the colonies , that a general superintending power was exercised by the king in council , by way of appeal from the decisions of the colonial tribunals . The reason of this institution , which is very briefly mentioned by Mr Sergeant , is involved in some antiquity , and is to be explained by recurrence to the early history of England . As the feudal system was confined to the mother country , its polity could only be extended to the colonies by fiction . The county palatine of Durham , presented the first model for their formation ; as in the charters of Carolina , Maryland , Maine , and the Caribbee Islands . This was succeeded by a comparison of them of a sudden , to the Dutchies of Gascoign*e , or Normandy , which the king held as his own demesnes , in partibus exteris , not parcels of the realm , nor properly annexed to the crown of England . From that period the condition of the colonies was considered the same as that of Jersey , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , there being no precedent for any judicial establishment out of the kingdom , except those of Guernsey and Jersey , relics of the Dutchy of Normandy , which were not considered as united to the realm , appeals were brought not to the court of chancery , nor to the House of Lords , but were made to the king in council , as though he were still duke , according to the ancient custom of Normandy . The same regulations were adopted for appeals . In Jersey , appeals lay in matters of property above the value of three hundred hivres tournois ; and appeals in the colonies were restricted to cases of three hundred pounds sterling . This // Norman custom , as Governor Pownall calls it , continued to be the corner stone in the construction of their judicial system . Appeals were frequent to the king in council , from the highest courts in the colonies before the Revolution . Mr Sergeant refers to several in *Pennsylvania , and the great case of Vaughan , appellant from a judgment in New Hampshire , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lands in Portsmouth , which was argued by counsel before the committee for trade and plantations of the privy council , and on their report ratifying the verdict , judgment was affirmed by the king in council . This is recorded by Dr Belknap , in his history and appendix . Mr Sergeant surmises , that in some instances , the appeal was first to the governor and council , and refers to a case in Lord Raymond , brought from the island of Barbadoes , after going through this process , before the king in council . According to the late Dr Chris - tian s account of it , this is in fact a court of justice , *vbich must consist of at least three privy counsellors ; and the usual mode of exercising its judicial authority is in committee of the whole privy council . ( 1 BI . Corn . 232 . ) Charles the First , pursuing his idea of managing the colonies , as his own separate concern , delegated this appellate jurisdiction to the council , which he established for governing the plantations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an anomaly in the system , and was properly confined to those cases , which were considered special flowers of prerogative , such as idiocy and lunacy , and by rather an ill omened association , admiralty . By a very natural process , upon this principle , appeals from the vice admiralty established in the colonies , came to be heard before the same tribunal ; and as the jurisdiction of admiralty soon acquired an affinity for matters of exchequer , cases of that kind from the colonies were also carried , by a familiar operation , before the king in council . Sir William Blackstone states , that whenever a question arises between two provinces in America , or elsewhere , concerning the extent of their charters , &amp;c , the king exercised original jurisdiction therein , upon the principles of feudal sovereignty . And in the case of Mostyn and Fabrigas , which was decided in England just before the Revolution , // and after the publication of the Commentaries , ( 1774 , ) Lord Mansfield lays down the doctrine , that no question concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , when a question respecting the seignory arose in the proprietary governments , or between two provinces of America , or in the Isle of Man , t it was cognisable by the king 's courts in England only . The case of the Isle of Man , which was demanded by the Earl of Derby , was in the reign of Queen Elisabeth . The claim of the representatives of the duke of Montague , to the Island of St Vincents , was determined in 1764 . Mr Du Ponceau observes , that the famous case between William Penn and Lord Baltimore , was determined according to the law of England , which in all national matters , he says , never ceased to he the rule of right and wrong . We suppose he refers to the case , as reported by Vesey the elder , which was a bill in chancery , brought by Mr Penn against Lord Baltimore , to compel specific performance of an agreement , relative to difference between them respecting their boundaries . Lord Baltimore was a sort of sovereign prince over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania . Lord Hardwicke entered into an elaborate discussion respecting the jurisdiction , both of the court of privy council and chancery , in relation to questions arising upon subject matters abroad , the result of which was , that the court of privy council could not decree in personam in England , unless in certain criminal cases , and the court of chancery could not decree sn rem out of the kingdom . But notwithstanding the degree of locality attached to the subject of the dispute in that case , the lord chancellor considered it as a matter of contract between the parties , to be executed by their personal acts , in which it was proper for the court to interfere . In cases where the king himself was a party on one side , and where the colonies were concerned on the other , and which , therefore , could not with any propriety he brought before the king in council , the king 's bench exercised original jurisdiction . An instance of this occurred in the famous proceedings of quo warranto , on which the charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of the court of king 's bench . The general seizure of the // charters at this period was so arbitrary an act , that public opinion revolted at the mode in which it was exercised . Nevertheless , the king 's bench was the supreme court of common law in the kingdom ; and besides its general superintending and visitatorial authority over civil or lay corporations , and its prerogative poWer to issue writs of mandamus , its authority was considered , so late as the days of Lord Mansfield , as extending to the extremities of the empire , in order to prevent a failure of justice . If any forum was demanded for determining disputes between the king and colonies , as certainly was expedient under a free system , this tribunal was probably as little obnoxious as any that was established . But the question , concerning the judicial power of the king 's bench , stood on very much the same foundation , as the legislative power of parliament . They ranked very nearly as coordinate authorities . Situated as the colonies were , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied to regard the king 's bench as a constitutional tribunal for this purpose , and its jurisdiction was perhaps about as little relished , as that of the present supreme court of the United States is , by those western states beyond the Allegany , which have no representatives on the bench . As it was , upon the whole , it only pointed to a defect in the system . The king 's bench was also considered the highest court of original criminal jurisdiction in the kingdom , next to the House of Lords , having frill authority to hear and determine all capital and inferior offences of a public nature ; and , being the custos morum of all the subjects of the realm , does not require a precedent in every case to authorise its interference . Several acts of parliament were passed , authorising persons accused of crimes committed in the colonies , to be sent to England for trial . The statute of 35 Hen . VIII was revived for that purpose . The 12 Geo . III contained several capital enactments to this effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of Massachusetts Bay to send to England , or to other colonies for trial , persons indicted for murder in that province . This was complained of as a grievous violation of the principles of common law ; on which it was held , that the inhabitants of the colonies could not be transported for trial , to any other part of the realm ; that there could be no criminal jurisdiction exercised , except // in the province where the crime was committed , or the accused had his domicil , without infringing the right of jury trial from the vicinage , the act of Habeas Corpus , and the common rights of English colonists . On these groun ( ls it was held *o be the general judicial constitution of the colonies , that there existed in them a jurisdiction preeminently competent to the cognisance of all criminal cases , exclusive of the appropriate jurisdiction of the admiralty . * How clear and just a conclusion this was , from the cardinal principles of the common law , as a system of criminal jurisprudence , must be apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such c*ncIusion was adopted , we refer to the authority of Dr Franklin . in regard to the jurisdiction of the admiralty , which was emphatically a jewel of the crown , and ranked among the jura coronv , or rights of sovereignty , it was established in the colonies on its appropriate principles ; with the further peculiarity , however , that some part of the proper jurisdiction of exchequer was engrafted upon it , by virtue of some of the laws of trade ; from which originated a singular usage to dispense with the trial by jury , in cases of this description . This was nmtter of complaint among the recitals in the Declaration of Independence , but the union became a usage , and the practice remains incorporated with it since the Revolution . It has been doubted in England* whether the jurisdiction of the admiralty was not , in its nature , so perfectly definite , as not to be capable of extension by act of the legislature ; but this was in regard to prize , which was held to be an inherent portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of municipal jurisdiction ; the jurisdiction of prize was vested in other courts , however , iii Scotland ; and an act of parliament was required to regulate the practice . Mr D*i Ponceau has some remarks respecting the admiralty , as being a perfect and absolute quantity ; in respect to which , we have only at present to advert to the existing combination of the not very kindred institutions of the admiralty and exchequer , at least in their original creation , under the magnificent title of the former . . Miratur novas frondes et non sua poma . We understand it to be a // fact , not merely on the authority of Mr Burke , that the establishment of the admiralty in this country , before the Revolution , was chiefly as a security for the English navigation laws . But the greatest defect , in the judicial administration of the colonies , was the want , in mosi* of them , of a court of equity . In the king 's governments , as they were called , the governor , or governor and council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many causes contributed to impair the confidence of the community in this arrangement , objectionable as it was , also , on the score of principle . In the charter governments , as of New England for example , there was no chancery at all ; and excepting in the power to give jelief in mortgages , bonds , and penalties , in all other subjects of equity jurisdiction , the crown and the public were equally without resource . This circumstance explains one fact , that has long been an anomaly in our civil jurispru ( lence , namely , the practice of petitioning the legislature for relief , and the usage which has long existed , of interfering to afford it in this summary manner . This power was early exercised , to an extent beyond what that of chancery had ever been carried , even , as it was said , of suspending public laws , by mere orders or resolves passed without much solemnity . The consideration of all these inconveniences , arising from the imperfect system of judicial authority existing in the colonies before the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement ; and there was one it seems , that had been in contemplation , and was matured by some of the ablest lawyers in the colonies ; viz , the establisitment of a Supreme Court of appeal and equity , not confined to any single colony , but itinerating through several circuits . The arrangement was as follows . Nova Scotia and New England were to compose one circuit ; New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Maryland , a second ; and Virginia , the Carolinas and Georgia , the third . It was recommended , that this circuit system should be composed of two persons , at least , for each district , learned in the law not only of the mother country , but of the several governments in such district ; that it should have full powers of a court of chancery , as well as of law , on matters brought before it by writ of error , from the several Superior Courts of the district to // which it extended ; that it should regulate all the courts of law in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior courts ; and thus become an established tribunal of appellate jurisdiction , which should tend to introduce not only a uniformity among the courts of the different colonies themselves ; but also to produce a conformity to the courts of the mother country , in the dispensation and construction of the law. * These details are gathered from the work of Governor Pownall on the Administration of the Colonies ; and the influence of a fact of this kind , which we do not remember to have seen referred to , will be at once estimated by those , who recognise in it a type of the present judicial establishment of the Union . That these opinions , which were undoubtedly not formed without much consideration , were not reduced to actual experirnent , was probably owing to the interruption of the Revolution . Other questions had grown up and become confounded with this , which it was beyond the authority of the civilian to settle . This was gradually assuming a revolutionary shape with the rest , so that the course of reform was necessarily suspended , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preparation , on the eve of the great conflict . In this unsettled state , in which the subject existed at that period , it can not perhaps be contended that the colonial jurisprudence had attained the shape of a system to such a degree , as to sustain the character of a universal system . Crude , nevertheless , as it may have been , it is there that we must seek for the elements of the common law of the country . From this view of the subject it would seem , that the defect in the system of the colonies was one , rather of judicature , than jurisprudence . There was a sufficient fulcrum , the want was a lever . The great desideratum undoubtedly was a general judiciary establishment , with powers properly developed , and well defined , whose province should be to administer those principles of common law , that were equally applicable to their condition under their various local diversities ; and the absence of such a provision is only to he supplied , by reflection upon the principles , which actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also considering the true scale on which the * Pownall 's Administration of the Colonies &amp;c , pp. 113 , 114. // actual institutions of that period were constructed . The colonies at this period had lost their confidence in those , from whom a new organisation would have been expected ; and we believe there was at this period a feeling , prevalent in the colonies , unfriendly to any change proceeding from the crown . Nolumus leges muta*'i seems to have been their motto , and at the same time we observe among the causes of complaint against the king , recited in the Declaration of Independence , that he had obstructed the administration of justice , by refusing to cooperate in the establishment of judiciary powers . From this imperfect review of the state of things before the Revolution , iL seems , however , to result , that the general elements of English jurisprudence , excepting its ecclesiastical portion , existed in the colonies actually , or potentially , to such an extent , as to maintain the positions , that were assumed by the patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the soundest constitutional lawyers since . The Congress of the United Colonies , before they proclaimed their independence , in 1774 , declared them to be entitled to the common law of England . We know by tradition , that Blackstone was received with delight in the colonies , as the expositor of their law ; and that whole editions of the commentary were exhausted in America ; and the active , liberal , and enlightened spirit of the American jurists of that age deserved the noble eulogium , which it drew forth from the eloquence of Burke . We may grant that their attention was principally attracted , at that period , to those points of personal liberty and rights of private property , upon which most of the original causes of controversy turned ; but these were insisted upon only as constituent parts of the general system of common law , interwoven into the constitution of all the colonies ; and where , we may ask , could they have found more genuine and authentic expositions of the truest principles of natural and municipal law combined upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as expressed in Magna Charta , the Petition of Right , the Bill of Rights , and the Habeas Corpus Act ? All the acts and declarations of the period , to which we refer , were founded on this idea of a constitutional code of common law for the colonies , existing like that of England , in those legislative resolutions of // rights , redigested by the colonial congresses , and judicial determinations , legal usages , and established precedents , in which the common law consisted . Upon these followed , of consequence , the adoption of all those rules and doctrines , respecting the rights of persons , and laws of property , the definitions of which could be fonncbin America only in that system . The common law was the only general form , to which the elements before referred to had been reduced throughout the colonies ; and excepting the provisional establishment of equity powers , in some shape or other , in some of the provinces , together with probate courts , there was no other combination into which those principles may properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial power and authority there was , remained in a state of suspension , or in the language of the law itself , in nubi bus . We believe it has never been denied , that the Revolution rendered us , on the principles of the declaration of independence , if it did not find us already constituted , one people . This Revolution did not dissolve the bonds of society , *nor reduce us to a state of nature . The revolutionists were too well read in Locke , and their minds too deeply imbued with the principles of law itself , apart from the authority of writers , to admit a conclusion so barbarous , as that of abandoning all the body they possessed of municipal jurisprudence . There is hardly any person , we apprehend , who has done more to settle this subject , by slow degrees , than the present Chief Justice Marshall . Resorting so little as he does to authority , relying so little on precedent , reposing so much on principle , and drawing so much from the resources of enlightened reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character and the natural moderation of his temper , there is no authority more likely to be referred to hereafter than his own , and there are no propositions , that will * ) robably be found to require less liLnitation , or better bear the test of revision . In the case of Livingston against Jefferson , which is found in the first volume of Hall 's Law Journal , new series , the Chief Justice makes the following observations ; When our ancestors migrated to America , they brought with them the common law of their native country , so far as it was applica // ble to their new situation ; and I do not conceive , that the Revolution would in any degree have changed the relations of man to man , or the law which regulated these relations . In breaking our political connexion with the parent state , we did not break our connexion with each other . It remained subsequent to the ancient rules , until those rules should be changed by the competent authority . ' To this we may add , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice Ellsworth , while he was on the supreme bench , that the common law of this country remains the same as it was before the Revolution . We may also adduce to this point the opinion of Mr Du Ponceau , that the general system of laws , by which these colonies were governed , has never been repealed , either expressly or by necessary implication , but has always continued to be in vigor , so far as applicable to our varying situation . The first serious question , that was made on this subject , we believe was by Judge Chase , on the trial of Worrall , in 1* ' 98 , when he declared it with great energy as his opinion , that the United States had no common law , although the states had . But the common law of one state was not the common law of another ; nor was the common law of England the law of any of the states , except so far as they had adopted and modified it by their respective statutes and usages , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconciled . This opinion , as Mr Du Ponceau remarks , made considerable noise at that time , and produced a vague but strong impression , as Judge Chase was known to be a man of powerful mind and extensive learning , and more addicted by his temper to extend , than to abridge authority . For the sins of his temperament , certainly , rather than the surrender of his trust , this patriotic and independent jurist was summoned to answer before the highest tribunal of his country , on several charges of impeachment ; and since his universal acquittal from them , upon a judgment of the Senate , sanctioned by the subsequent voice of the nation , he has been gathered , without a spot on his integrity , to the rest of that race of our political fathers , who have gone to their reward through much tribulation . This opinion , although it did not compose one of the ingredients of his accusation , // gave rise to one of those unfortunate measures of legislation , the Sedition Act , which was passed soon after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act resulted as a corollary , was employed by Professor Tucker of William and Mary 's College , in Virginia , to combat that of Chief Justice Ellsworth *n an essay , in which he exhausted all the diversities , anomalies , and antinomies , thatcould be brought into any relation to the subject ; and this product of a political enthusiasm , he intended to embody as a permanent appendix to the commentary of Blackstone . The opinion of Judge Chase seems to have been reverenced and regarded as a sort of perpetual edict . It served as a text for the instruction of the General Assembly of Virginia in 1800 . The Virginia Assembly did not pause at that time , to expose at large what they considered the monstrous pretensions , resulting from the adoption of the principle stated ; to wit , that the common law of England was in force under the government of the United States . But besides the evils attending the exercise of such an unlimited criminal jurisdiction , as it opened , it was declared to arrest , or supersede state jurisdictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of jurisdiction for the federal courts , which defied definition or limitation ; and again , that it had a tendency to involve the existing institutions of federal and state courts in such an inextricable maze of confusion , that it would be impossible to separate their judiciary rights with precision , or avoid the constant and mischievous consequences of a conflict of rival jurisdictions . They , there fore , protested against the passing of any law by Congress , which was founded upon , or recognised this l ) rinciple , except such parts of the common law , as might have a sanction from the constitution , so far as they were necessarily comprehended in the technical phrases , which express the powers delegated to the government ; and also excepting such other parts , as may be adopted by Congress , as necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers expressly delegated . The opinion delivered by Judge Chase industriously confines the operation of the common law , as a civil rule , to cases between citizens in states , where the suits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while // the Virginia resolutions , notwithstanding the broad language of the preamble , more considerately allow it the whole scope of the constitution . That this imagined common law of the Union can be in any manner the same , as the common law of England , Judge Chase positively denies ; and what was the source of the common law acknowledged by the General Assembly of Virginia , is , by their instructions , in no wise indicated . The constitution does not clear up this point by any particular definition . It is a very just remark of Mr Justice Story , that the constitution of the United States presupposes the existence of the common law . It then becomes a very interesting topic of examination , to ascertain what this common law is , which is thus , in his language , presupposed by the constitution . This point of inquiry , namely , wherein consists this anteconstitutional common law of this country is one , which Mr Du Ponceau undertakes professionally to answer . In the first place , he says , I consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . ' And , secondly , I think I can lay it down as a correct principle , that the common law of England , as it was at the time of the Declaration of Independence , still continues to be the national law of this country , so far as it is applicable to our present state , and subject to the modifications it has received here in the course of near half a century . ' That is , subsequently to the Revolution . This proposition of Mr Du Ponceau is not , we acknowledge , without some embarrassment to our minds , in respect to the point of time , at which he fixes the period of this identification of the common law of this country , with the common law of England ; for if we apprehend the statement aright , it is , that the common law of England was the common law of this country , at the epoch of the Revolution . We are not quite sure , however , that we do perfectly apprehend Mr Du Ponceau on this point ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own organ , rather than his . We do not imagine , that he means to arrive at such a result by any empirical process ; and he , therefore , is not to be understood as attributing any inherent virtue and efficacy to the law of England , as being rendered thereby , at that period , the law of the colonies . Conquered and ceded countries , upon me principle so correctly considered by himself , retain their // laws and preserve their original customs ; and much more a country like ours , which had conquered its independence , and achieved its own sovereignty , as a nation . Even the phrase of our emancipation was one , which Chatham could not endure ; for when , ' said he were we ever slaves ? ' The principle of the lex loci is otserved and respected , in regard to all extra-territorial authority ; and the necessity of some medium to connect the existing system , with the antecedent state of jurisprudence , is too obvious to escape so penetrating and philosophical an observer as Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look further into his dissertation , and compare the sentiments , which he expresses on this subject , with the sound principles upon which he undoubtedly determines to erect his system , and rest his opinion . Mr Du Ponceau accordingly observes , that the common law may be viewed under different aspects ; hence the variety of opinions that have been and still are entertained respecting it . Here is an ancient and a modern , an English and an American common law , making in some respects a whole , in some others distinct codes . ' In his preface he expresses an opinion , that the English and American common law have been in some manner improperly confounded . We are aware with him , that the common law of England has its various periods , which may be distributed , like the Roman , intojus antiquum , ju* novum , and jus novzsssmum . That which he selects , as the true meridian of the English law , and on which he lavishes his encomiums as the season of the greatest excellence in its history , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ending at the time of the American Revolution . The true era of the common law is the period , which followed the great Revolution of 1648 , to the time of our own emancipation . It was then that it assumed that bold and majestic shape , those commanding features , which have made it the pride of the nations who possess it , and the envy of those who do not . During that period , the rights of man have been acknowledged and defined , and limits have been set to the sovereign authority . The prerogatives of the crown ( I am speaking here of England ) have been ascertained , and restricted within proper bowids ; the legislative , executive , and judicial authorities , have taken their re // spective stations , and know the extent of their several powers ; judges have been rendered independent , and juries have been freed from ignoble shackles . The writ of habeas corpus has been made effectual , a fair and unexceptionable mode of trial has been provided for cases of high treason . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensers . Religious toleration has been established . The hand of arbitrary power has been paralysed ; and man has been taught to walk erect , and to feel the dignity of his nature ; civil jurisprudence has also been considerably improved , and is in a progressive state of further amendment . ' pp. 111 , 112 . As Mr Du Ponceau is speaking expressly , in this passage , of England , wee do not know in what degree he intends his remarks to apply to the state of the colonies . How the common law , as the common law of England , could have any operation in the colonies during that period , we have no definite idea . The true time , at which the colonies received the common law , was that of their settlement , which was previous to the commencement of the auspicious era , descanted upon with so much animation by Mr Du Ponceau . There is no subsequent point , which we can fix without anachronism , for any general transfusion of its principles* and from that time forth , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of the colonies , and the adoption of those meliorations of it , which took place during this long interval in England . The power of legislation , upon subjects of common law , was deemed to have ceased in Great Britain , concerning the colonies , in so far , that legislative alterations of its principles were only received in their courts at their election . But judicial determinations , in regard to those principles , by the English tribunals , it is certainly true , carried some air of authority until the Revolution ; and the legislatures of some of our states have in reality acted upon no false principle , in suspending the citing of such cases as authorities since the Revolution , although there would be no great harm , perhaps , in permitting them to be read . That there was some affinity , therefore , between the two systems , during this long middle age of the common law , seems quite apparent . Mr Du Ponceau again observes , That the common law was the common jurisprudence of England , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation required . In all cases for which the local law had not provided , or to which it was not applicable , this national law , ( as he terms it , ) was the rule of decision . ' In this general relation to the mother country apd the colonies , he compares it to the civil law , which is called the common law , jus commune of Europe ; which each separate government has modified , as it thought proper , to suit its own local circumstances ; or if it has introduced into its territories new edicts , new laws , and new codes , still the civil law governs in all their common concerns . As the civil law is now in Earope , so the common law in America was not indeed paramount to the local customs and statutes , but it was the fruitful source from which principles were drawn to aid in the solution of all the doubts and difficulties , which arose from them , and the . rule by which unforeseen cases were decided . It was a general system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling up the interstices . It was ready to pour in at every opening it could find . Like the sun under a cloud , it was overshadowed , not extinguished , by the local laws . It lost nothing of its force , its power , or its vigor . It burst in at the moment of the adoption of the constitution of the United States , and filled up every space , which the state laws ceased to occupy . ' If we comprehend Mr Du Ponceau 's idea in this glowing passage , it is , that the common law of which he speaks , is neither the English common law , nor the American common law , exclusively , according to the distinction previously suggested by him , but the common law of England and the colonies together , and so continued until the time of the Revolution ; and that the whole body of it was adopted with the constitution , to supply all these spaces , which were opened or created for its application , by the operations of the new form of government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of the common law of England , as a great reservoir for supplying the jurisprudence of the colonies , we appreherA him to be correct ; and we are not prepared at present to deny , that there might have been a certain portion , or residuum of this power , in his own moderate sense of the term , which , of course , remained suspended during our dependant colonial condition ; and which instantly , // perhaps , became applicable in the due exercise of the judicial faculty of national sovereignty . Indeed we believe , that in practice , the principles ot ' the common law were immediately , and have always been applied to the civil relations , subsisting between the *government , and its officers , and citizens . Some rule was certainly necessary , and we know of none , that could have been so properly adopted . Whether the authority , under which this rule went into operation , was derived entirely from its adoption by the constitution , or whether the principle possessed some previous potential vigor , and elastic force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather to favor the latter alternative . While we have no difficulty in conceiving , how a common law could exist in this country upon some principle before the constitution , we have some , however , in apprehending how there could be a common jurisprudence between England and her colonies , during the last century , except under very considerable limitation . That the common law of the colonies , indeed , could not be the same as the exact common law of England , is quite obvious . There could not be in all respects a common law to both countries . There could be no common rule to such various relations , as were divided by the ocean , any more than the same doctrine of real estate can be applied to wild land and cultivated ; and that portion of the common law , which Mr Dim Ponceau describes , as having been brought into being with the constitution , could assuredly have had no actual existence in this country before the Revolution . It was very justly remarked by Lord Mansfield , that the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended on precedents only . Precedents serve to illustrate principles , and to give them a fixed authority . The law , he observes , does not consist in particular cases , but in general principles , that run through the cases and govern the decisions of them . It is undoubtedly true , that the genius of the common law is essentially analytical . Its courts decide nothing but cases ; all the rest is mere obiter dictum ; and it is evident that Lord Eldon 's mind , with a strong native cast towards equity , received its original schooling in the common law . It is charged upon the common law as a solecism , by // Hoicroft , in his novel of Hugh Trevor , that the rule is always the same , while the cases are different ; but such a remark would never be uttered by a man of philosophical reflection . Dr Cooper speaks with more propriety in saying , that principles may , with due care , be so cjearly expressed , that they will admit of little doubt ; while the innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no effort of human wisdom can reduce to any system a priori ; they will arise from circumstances , with which we are totally unacquainted ; from modes of social intercourse , which will receive their origin , when we are dead . ' We are no apologists , more than Dr Cooper himself , for what may justly be deemed bench legislation ; but we are warm advocates for that species of legislation , which is wrought by the spirit of the age . Time is unquestionably the great legislator ; and we cease to inquire into the annals of past ages , to find the wisdom that is necessary to guide our own . Changes , therefore , are insensibly wrought in the circumstances of a country , to which it is necessary , that not only the laws themselves , but also the spirit of the laws , should he accommodated . This alteration is not produced ; it already exists before it is announced ; and excepting those cases , which are proper for the interposition of the legislature , society has yet to invent some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . As for many of those cases , that pass under the odious name of judicial legislation , we conceive they are frequently little else , than a mere sound discrimination and application of the most apt and enlightened principles . We thought there was hardly any reproach , to which the common law of England was less liable , than one of this sort . The complaint has rather been , that it was not sufficiently ductile . It is a maxim of that law , for example , that statutes altering the common law should be construed strictly , and also that no statute ever becomes abrogated , although really reduced to a dead letter , by disuse . And whether this rigid system of precedents , even accompanied with all the original and inherent redeeming excellencies of the common law , but governed at the same time by the impracticable spirit prevailing upon the English bench , ought to constitute the precise rule of municipal jurisprudence for the United States , to be measured at the exact moment of // their independence , without regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its actual application to the state of society on this side of the ocean , and without making allowance , moreover , for the more mutable and practical aptitude , which its principles had acquired in the character of a system for the colonies , during the long period of their dependence upon the cro*vn of Great Britain , would be that proposition upon which we should linger a long time , before we gave it our absolute assent . But the American common law , we appi'ehend , is in quite another tone and spirit . On this topic we may avail ourselves of the remarks made bx Mr Du Ponceau , upon the essential improvements , which civil jurisprudence has undergone in the United States ; and this is in those respects , in which he considers the common law to be on g inallv inferior to the civil . He considers it to be still in a progressive state of improvement , and to be becoming more and more dignified with American features . ' Our landed estates , foc example , have become allodial ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few forms and phrases , among which , that offee simple still survives . The principles of conveyancing are simplified , and registries established to supersede the ancient form of livery of seizin . Entails , where not abolished , are very easily destroyed . Survivership in joint tenancy is almost extinct . The laws of descent are assimilated to the rules of succession , established by the Roman law ; and the privilege of primogeniture is abolished . If children , then heirs . ' The intricate peculiarities of English practice in general are less observed ; legal proceedings rendered less expensive , and legal rights more easily understood by those , who can not pretend to be subtle lawyers . Now the most of these changes were actually effected , and the principles of them all were in operation , and the whole impulse , in fact , communicated before the Revolution . From all this it is moreover apparent , as if of much greater consequence , that the American common law had acquired a spirit of change ; and that this spirit had moved over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead and stagnant surface , but was excited with all the vigor of a new creation . Whatever inflexibility may be arrogated , or attributed to the English system , the character of our own is not so // harsh and rugged , as many have deemed it ; and if such be the true quality of the common law of England in any degree equivalent to the supposition , we regard it as a still further evidence of the actual departure , which the American common law had acquired from it , anterior to the epoch prescribed by Mr Du Ponceau . That the common law did exist in this country , before the Revolution , is a mere matter of fact , totally independent of any argument concerning its excellence , or any question touching its character as a system . There must be some law in every country , and this was the law of ours ; at least until some more satisfactory conclusion can be established . But why , ' says Mr Du Ponceau , and we take pleasure in borrowing the following beautiful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide argument to prove , what I consider a self evident principle ? We live in the midst of the common law ; we inhale it at every breath , imbibe it at every pore ; we meet it when we wake , and when we lay down to sleep ; it is interwoven with the very idiom that we speak , and we can not learn another system of laws , without learning at the same time another language . We can not think of right or wrong , but through the medium of the ideas , that we have derived from the common law . ' It is the very ens rationis , and , as Mr Du Ponceau observes in another place , is a part of every civil and political institution . In this sense it becomes quite obvious , that the United States must have a general law , not so much arising out of their constitution , as resulting from their condition , suiting itself to their national circumstances , fitting itself to their federal relations , and incorporating itself with their municil ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be conceived to exist without a body of jurisprudence ; and it is no doubt perfectly correct to say , as has been suggested by one of our most valuable , though least obtrusive jurists , that our present social contract must be supposed to have been formed upon the supposition of certain fundamental principles of social order , derived from the common law , or as he terms it , adopted under our English common law , ' whether expressly referred to by it or not . No language can be more correct , in our judgment , than to say , that this was the element of the constitutiom // Nor does this phraseology exclude the use of the civil law as a principle of interpretation , whenever it may be important to the same instrument . The security of the rights and repose of private society against general search warrants , of the conscious independence of personal liberty against arbitrary seizure or extravagant sti'pulation , the indemnity of individual property against acts of involuntary benevolence , or in other words , the resistance of taxation without representation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speaking , writing , and publishing , as well as the liberty of volition and action , within the bounds of law ; these were the topics that were perpetually harped upon out of the common law , and served to fan the flame of freedom on both sides of the Atlantic . On the same platform of our original common law , we are able to keep pace with the progress of the most enlightened principles of national and public law , and avail ourselves of the advances of general jurisprudence in the liiiprovement of our civil code , or the explication of our political system . In that manner , without doubt , the United States ivill eventually come to have a common law , not that of England , nor of Rome , nor of France , but the common law of the United States . ' In that manner , together with that body of natural reason and law , which is requisite for the municipal order of civil society ; and those usages , which we have derived from England , and those customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , that we have already borrowed from other sources , with those that we may hereafter extract from foreign codes , or the future combinations of our concerns and interests , we shall probably acquire a system of common law , suitable to expound and give effect to the constitution , and open a sufficient field for the operation of all the benevolent and equitable principles . We have expressed our assent to the doctrine of Mr Dii Ponceau , respecting the existence of a common law for this country . We acknowledge its necessity to the exposition of the constitution . We admit it was an element floating , if he pleases , in the atmosphere . We regard it still as a vast reservoir of valuable jurisprudence ; but we are not satisfied with the correctness of his expression , in calling it the common law of England , and fixiBg its authority at the epoch of // the Declaration of Independence . It seems to us to be beginning wih the old phrases of the civil law Regiarn Alajestatem . We are far , as we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ponceau the heretical idea of any inherent efficacy , in the law of England at that instant , as binding us proprio vigore ; and yet something of that kind seems necessarily to be implied , without some kind of mordent , or medius terminus , to ground the color , or connect the consequence with some immediate cause . And it is difficult to discover , what basis of authority the common law of England could rest upon in this country , at the period of the Revolution , similar in any manner to the authority which it enjoyed in England ; or equivalent even to the predominance , which the civil law has obtained upon the continent of Europe . We have even yet to learn how the common law of England , in the capacity of common law of England , could prevail in the colonies during the century after their settlement . We will add our concession to the criminal law of England , of all the unrivalled excellence that belongs to it as a rule of jurisdiction , and also as a species of jurisprudence connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agreeing with Mr Du Ponceau , respecting the existence of an American coirimon law , independent of that of England , we are induced to give it an origin somewhat beyond the breaking out of the Revolution ; and after that period , until the adoption of the national constitution , at which time he represents the whole tide of common law pouring in upon us , there was a considerable interval . At that latter period certainly a foreign code , like the law of England , could have owed its obligation only to our adoption ; but a limitation of its authority , like that , would not probably be insisted upon by Mr Du Ponceau . The common law , which constitutes the desideratum in his mind , requires some grounds , for which we must search into the state of things long before our independence ; and we may discover it by analysing those general principles and usages , which are to be found in that generally received and long established law , which forms the present substratum of the laws of every state in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall , and we deem it incapable of any addition or subtrac. * tion for its improvement . // We would not undertake to he perfectly confident , however , on any point , on which we might have the misfortune to appear to differ from Mr Do Ponceau , and least of all would we engage in any mere difference about words . Perhaps he is to be understood by his favorite phrase , common law of England , as making use or that sort of metaphor in describing the common law of this country , before the Revolution , which our forefathers were so fond of employing , in all the models they made of their social and civil institutions . England , before the Revolution , was always called home ; and in this way , the common law of the colonies may be deemed to have acquired , and preserved the name of the common law of England . In the same manner the expression may he understood to have been used by Mr Du Ponceau , who in no part of his book is to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the changes , which the sy stein had undergone in this country . We have no right to understand him in any sense , which a sound view of the subject will not warrant ; nor without all those limitations , which the most careful reflection would suggest . Nor are we aware , that Mr Du Poncean intended anything by the language alluded to , beyond what the most profound analysis of the principles , on which our institutions rest , would authorise . His known precision of language will not allow us to suppose , that he uses any terms without a perfectly appropriate signification ; hut we are after all inclined to query , whether , on the present occasion , he has sufficiently guarded himself against misapprehension .
