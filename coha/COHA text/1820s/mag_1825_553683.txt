By AN ENGLISHMAN . 8vo. pp. 503 . London . 1824 . So much abuse and folly have beet ) published in England , in books purporting to be travels in the United States , and so much ignorance and stt*pidity , as well as unfairness , have been palmed upon the public in the works of this description , that all interest for them seems to have died away , even with the most inquisitive and reading part of the community . It is mainly on this consideration of the subject , that we can account for the fact of the Summary View ' not having been published in this country , although it issued from the press more than a year and a half ago in England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any person could be supposed to have towards a foreign country , and evidetmtly contains the results of close observation , at ) d no small degree of knowledge . To those , who judge only from experience of the 1 ) ast , this will be thought to be saying a great deal in favor of an English traveller in America , but as great an anomaly as it may seem , we nevertheless think , that this meed of approbation is at least due to the Englishman , * who has favored us with the volume under notice . And we will add , moreover , that , in spite of his prejudices , which it sometimes costs him a hard struggle to keep down , he writes with as good a spirit , and with as open a disposition to learn the reality , and report it fairly , as any American could reasonably desire . // The author tells some truths not the most flattering to our self prepossessions , nor grateful to an American ear , but it is our duty to listen to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us no pleasure to hear . His remarks are now and then tinged with a spice of cockneyisrn , and he sometimes has a gossiping way of relating incidents , which detract somewhat from the dignity of his work , but when these are accompanied with a good temper , and a philosophical resolution not to be biassed by appearances , nor to draw hasty conclusions , we can easily endure them . It may be safely believed , that the author had it not in his thoughts to make any false impressions , in regard to America , or to indulge a vein of humor or sarcasm at the expense of the people , whose manners and character he aims to describe . The following topics , among others , constitute the heads of his chapters , namely ; face of the country ; conveniences of travelling ; men ; women ; domestic life ; spirit of conversation ; patriotism hospitality ; politeness ; religion ; slavery ; colouisation society Loglish language ; oratory ; literature ; government ; political parties ; law and jurisprudence ; manufactures ; fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident , that several of these subjects are such , as no foreigner , who had resided but a few months in the country , could be qualified to discuss with any fulness or pertinency . In remarking upon them , therefore , it is not surprising , that our traveller should frequently say little to the purpose , and enter into speculations betraying at the same time his ignorance and his indiscretion . What , for instance , could he be supposed to know of our literature , government , political parties , jurisprudence , and national character ? These things are not to be learnt in a month or a year . The author shows , that he has been industrious in collecting as many facts pertaining to them , as his limited means would allow ; and that he aims to represent these in a fair and proper light , according to the best of his knowledge ; but after all , his important facts are exceedingly scanty , and his notions crude . It could not be otherwise . The chapters on slavery and the slave trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin and history of our political and civil institutions , and the credulity , benevolence , and amiable zeal of the author . His hatred of slavery is just , but misapplied ; his visions are bright , but airy as the dreams of an enthusiast , or the mists of an autumnal morning . He talks of our literature without reason or discrimination , selecting books for his criticism , of which no American ever heard , and sometimes passing judgment with a pertness , which no wise man of any nation would approve . He was much scandalised at the violation of syntax , and otherwise faulty style of the Annual Report of one of the New York Charity Schools , and a publication of the Philadelphia Society for promoting Agriculture . Some writer in // The author tells some truths not the most flattering to our self prepossessions , nor grateful to an American ear , but it is our duty to listen to them with patience , and to profit by such as it gives us no pleasure to hear .

Some writer in // Oct. which is to grow out of the length of the grand Canal , and other advantages pertaining to the great commercial emporiuni of the western world , but we have not till now been informed of their habit of besie* in g foreigners on this account , till they deserved the charge of absurdity . The writer also makes the discovery , that no city in America is under more mob influence than New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savage custom of ' using pigs br scavenger5 , * a practice , he adds , of which many of the inhabitants are ashamed . ' It is a pity , that the New Yorkers should be ashamed of their own customs , and we leave the matter for them to consider and digest , subjoiniug only the further declaration of our traveller , who speaks authoritatively on die subject , that pigs ought not to be allowed to be kept even in a yard within the boundary of a city . ' Such New Yorkers , as would be further informed , must consult the volume itself . In our good city of Boston the author resided but a short time , and pays us only a passing tribute . He ascended the dome of the State House , and says the view from it is the finest in America . Next to this in extent and beauty , he considers the view from the XVashingron monument in Baltimore . For the edi*cation of those , whom it may concern , we give , in his own words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in our city . I was present , ' says he , at a meeting of the Debating Society of Boston , when a question was proposed for discussion on the policy of l ) rohiblting usury . The first speaker was a short , jolly many who seemed mu ( h more likely to please a dinner party by acting as their chairman , than to throw light on an abstract question . He began with diffidence ; a good symptom ; but after bl ' . indering through his speech , bewilderin * . himself and his auditory , he concluded with no more confidence than he manifested at the commencement . The second speaker was quite as obscure , though with rather more assurance . The third , with some appearance of method in the handling of his subject , and with the air of a man , who is to bear down all opposition , floundered in the mmmd of his own spreading . till he had tired himself , and blinded those about him . The chairnmn was about to put the question , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some further light would be thrown on it at another meeting . Some one might have told him , that there had been " no light , but rather darkness visible . " The motion for adjournment was carried , and the meeting dispersed , havin * , as I thought , shown a most exemplary patience. * The author met with occasional troubles and inconveniences of a personal nature , in the course of his travels , as well as moving testimonies of the negligent habits of Americans . which ought not to pass unnoticed . Let me mention , ' he says , that I went into a draper 's shop at Fredericksburgh , in Virginia , to purchase a nightcap , // but no such thing was to be had . I tried a second , and was told that no dealer in the town kept nightcaps , as the people did not use them . At Richmond I obtained one . ' To the credit of Virginia let it be spoken , that it has one town in which nightcaps are both used and sold . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of association we presume , another passage in that part of the author 's work , in which he is treating of national character . He is complaining of the want of exactness in the domestic and other common transactions of lice ; ' and here , we are sorry to say , lie is alluding particularly to the ladies of these United States . This want of exactness , ' he observes , is obvious in the deportment of female servants , whom I have seen , when not actually engaged in waiting on the company , leaning on their elbows near the door or window . Now it is evident , that their mistresses would teach them to adopt a more becoming attitude , if they themselves did not share in the prevalent carelessness . I am inclined to ascx'ibe the custom of female servants not wearing caps to the same disposition . What can be said in excuse for their mistresses , who might sm-ely persuade them to adopt a dress less disgusting , than that of heads of hair loose and dirty like mops ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true sufficiently neat ; but how is it possible to keep their hair in order without caps when en*dged in it ? ' Ah , indeed , how is it possible ? This question we must leave to the American ladies to answer ; desiring them , however , not to indulge any unkiodly feelings towards the traveller for these gentle hints , as in numerous instances he has bestowed upon them a full measure of compliments for their remarkable qualities , and a profusion of thanks and expressions of gratitude for their civil and hospitable attentions to him . In short , we are in sder earnest j ) repared to say , that the American must be hard to please , who can find it in his heart to censure the prevailing tone and spirit of this work . The author undertakes too much , and falls jeatly short of his aims ; had he confined himself to a narrower compass , and talked only of what he knew , he would have been more wise , and doubtless committed fewer mistakes . As it is ' his volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books of travels written by Englishmen , which have been republished in this country . Why this has been suffered to pass by we know not , except from the cause suggested at the beginning of these remarks . It will do Americans no harm to hear their foibles , their national prejudices and follies exposed , by intelligent and candid foreigners ; this will be one way of convincing us , that we are not the most enlightened people on earth , as it is said we boast of being ; especially can we endure these things , when we have the privilege of laughing as much as we please at the ignorance , presumption , and self importance too often displayed // by the writers , who undertake to reveal our faults , and become the censors of our manners . Indignation must sometimes be excited by downright stupidity and impudence , but for the most part the effusions , which have gone out from the English press respecting America , have been worth worthlessness , or contempt . v of little else than neglect for their for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching ; and , indeed , it may be reckoned as an encouraging symptom of the commencement of such an era , that American literature , such as it is , begins to be better understood than formerly in England . Many of our popular works are ow reprinted and circulated in that country . Mr John Miller , pubisher and bookseller in New Bridge Street , London , has recently brought out English editions of the Pilot , ' Red*vood , ' Lionel Lincoln , ' Poinsett 's Mexico , ' John Bull in * Percival 's Poems , ' and that interesting little tale , the Travellers , ' by the author of Redwood . These we understand have all met with such success , as to be satisfactory to the publisher . Mr Miller deserves the commendation of our countrymen , for the strong interest he has taken in making our literature known to the British public . He has established a library , which he calls the American Library , ' and in which he endeavors to collect all the valuable American publications of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be doing a service to the literature of the country , if authors and publishers will keep this institution in mind , and send new works to Mr Miller , to be deposited in his library and open to the inspection of reading persons in London . The merits of many performances will thus become known there vbich may be thought adapted to publication in that country , but which might otherwise never come to the knowledge of a London publisher . We may here add , that the circulation of our own Journal in England has increased much more of late , than at any former period . This is a slight proof , we flatter ourselves , that the edge of prejudice is wearing off . In France our book has the honor of being inserted on the proscribed list ; and it is seized at the customhouse , whenever a straggling copy seeks hospitality in the dominions of his newly crowned majesty , Charles the Tenth . But we have the consolation of seeing its name in good company there , and as we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves of kings , we shall not repine at this mark of disapprobation , with which our labors are branded by those , who fear the contagion of liberty and truth . //
