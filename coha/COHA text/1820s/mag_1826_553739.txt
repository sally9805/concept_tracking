txt ART . llJ. - Practical Observations *pon time Education of tile People . By HENRY BROUGHAM , EsQ . M. P. F. R. S. London . 1825 . Svo. pp. 33 . THE edition of this interesting pamphlet , which is now before us , and which was published last year . is the i euth ; hut w VOf , * XXTII. - NP. m*2. // believe , that beibre the end of the year the editions had been multiplied to nearly three times that number ; and we are given to understand , that the Observations have in the same time been most extensively circulated throughout Great Britain in reviews , journals , and newspapers of every description . Or if any exception is to be made , it is a circumstance that does not diminish , but rather increases the interest and importance of this statement . That there should be men to take alarm at the universal spread of knowledge ; that there should be powerful , nay , respectable journals setting themselves in array against this object , only shows how strong is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This hostility , however , concerns us not , except as a matter of information and of regret . Nor would it much disturb , if it did more nearly concern us . For it may as safely be said of knowledge as of truth , since it is , in fact , but saying the same thing , that it is strong and will prevail . ' The cause of human improvement , of human nature , has gone too far , the hope of it has become too strong , to allow despondency . The single fact , that a publication like the one before us , has , in England , gone through nearly thirty regular editions in a year , and as many more in quotations and extracts , stands , with us , against all other facts . It stands against whatever is stronger than facts , against all obstacles , however deeply laid in the foundations of prescription , and strongly built in the battlements of power . There is a movement in the great mass of society , to which all such obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . But we do not intend to enlarge on this subject of general improvement , about which so many pens are engaged , indeed , that it can scarcely fail of being understood for want of being discussed . We do regard this excited and universal attention to the subject , however , this quickened and earnest spirit of the age , as the pledge of great things . It will fulfil itself . But that it may do so with the greatest success , it is desirable , that every people should bend its first attention to the correction of its own errors , to the revnedy of its own abuses , and to urging forward it own improvement . We are willing to consider ourselves as pledged to perform our part , as reviewers , in this great work . We believe there is much to be done , and , most of all , in what may be considered as the very elements of this business , the editcation of time people . // It will not be doubted , that the subject of education , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of men for the last three hundred years , has come late for its share of attention . The pressure of political tyranny , or of ecclesiastical domination , has compelled men to inquire into their civil and religious rights . Curiosity and the love of research have urged them to penetrate far into the fields of science and intellectual philosophy . The natural growth of taste and imagination has developed itself in the arts and in literature . But the science of education has been one of less obvious utility or attractiveness , or of less urgent claims upon attention . Men could live , could defend their rights and opinions , could amass personal acquisitions and pleasures , without any of this science . And in the nature of things , they would regard a present interest , which was their own , more than a future one , which concerned their children . In conformity with these remarks , we find that the subject of education has elicited fewer books , than any other great subject affecting human welfare ; fewer than law , medicine , politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is really no comparison between the cases . While there are books on these and other subjects , so many , that the world can scarce contain them ; while in foreign countries alcoves , and halls , and mighty structures groan with the weight , some of one hundred , and others of five hundred thousand volumes in a library , you may wander through them all , and find but here and there a thin , neglected , and , very likely , superficial book on education . And this deficiency , moreover , indicates another ; a dbflciency of interest on this subject , in the public mind . For it is in this , as it is in other things , that a demand , a market will procure a supply . If there had been readers , or those who wished to be such , there would have been writers . And even now , when this subject is attracting an increased attention , there are , and there are among reading parents too , but few , comparatively , who read and inquire earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poems , novels , good things in their place , provided they are good in their character , but these accounts of other , and often fictitious beings and scenes , are more attractive to the most of us , than those discussions , which lead us to contemplate in every light , that interest and duty can present , the beings and scenes of our own home . It is an encouraging omen for the coming age , that the num // bev both of writers and readers on education is increasing ; that many powerful minds are directed to this subject , and that the public attention is beginning to awake ; that parents and guardians are making more liberal appropriations of their property , and that men of the highest talents and education are taking up the professed business of teaching youtb , not only in our universities and colleges , but in our lyceums , academies , and schools ; and that their toils , morever , in many cases , are better compensated than any other intellectual labor in the country . These cornhined circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate auspices of our national condition , give rise to indefinite expectations of improvement , both in the principles and in the modes of education among us . In this state of things and of the public mind , we feel a warrant for undertaking to point out some features of that improvement , which the age is demanding ; which , in fact , is already taking place , and which , we are sure , will be more fully developed in our systems of instruction . Our language almost involuntarily takes the form of hope and promise ; hut we give fair warning , that we have to speak of faults and evils , which have prevailed , and still too much prevail , in our systems of education . We have only farther to premise , that we shall confine our remarks chiefly , if not entirely , to the education , not of scholars , but of the body of the p*ople , to popular education ; to studios , that are pursued in the English language , whether in our common , or grammar schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is another department of popular education , however , distinct from these ; and in treating of it , we shall avail ourselves of the valuable information and the judicious remarks , which are thrown together in Mr Brougham 's pamphlet . Let us add , that , as we have proposed the humblest scene of education , we shall content ourselves with some very plain and obvious suggestions , such as all will admit , though but few apply them ; for such , on a subject like this , are likely to be at ont*e the most just and the most useful . The first thing to be required in a system of popular instruction , is , that it should be intelligible ; that children and youth should understand what they learn . Understand what they learn ? it may be asked ; What else can they do ? We answer , that they may commit it to memory , may recite it , may even make a // fair show of knowledge , and yet know nothing . Understandest thou what thou readest , ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can he put to the old inquirer , and to the guarded and cautious controvertist or disputant . But to most children , in regard to much of what they have been taught in the prevailing systems of education , this would be a confounding question . We have not the least hesitation in saying , that two or three years , in the education of almost every individual in this country , have been thrown away upon studying what they did not understand . What , for instance , can a child from seven to ten or twelve years old understand of the science of grammar ? It is one of the most abstruse and profound of sciences , involving an analysis of thought , and the most delicate discrimination of it . Language is the instrument of thought ; and if a man can not comprehend an instrument of merely mechanical power ; if he can not cornprehend the principles of a steam engine , without some acquaintance with philosophy , shall he expect with more ease scientifically to comprehend the great instrument of intellectual power ? It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man may understand the use of language without investigation , as he may understand the use of a steam engine without philosophy . But to this we have a ready answer . Every child learns the use of language , and he obtains his actual use of it , whether correct or incorrect , not from the pages of a grammar , but from actual life , from conver ! ation , from reading . And one of the evils of this system is , that the child imagines , that by the new names he gives to words , as verbs , nouns , &amp;c. by a parade of *iefinitions , and a routine of parsing terms , he is making great acquisitions of knowledge , while in fact be is learning nothing . in these remarks , we intend not to reflect on intelligent teachers of youth . They are obliged , to a certain extent , to go in the beaten path . Popular custom requires this study to be pursued , at a certain age . There is a mystery hanging about it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not the slightest con*eption of any use there can be in it ; but there is a vague and indefinable impression on their minds , that grammar is something very important , and indeed essential . The child is , therefore , sent to learn it ; and perhaps is chastised for his dulness and reluctance ; while , in fact , by this very dulness or reluctance , by this unwillingness to learn what he does not understand , be is often giving the best proof of good sense *nd brightne*s of parts . // The improvement , then , which we confidently expect on this subject , is , that it xviii be postponed to a later period in the course of education ; that it will be accompanied with more reading , writing , and reflection ; and , that it will then be taught not as a mere set of rules , which every child gains from actual conversation , but that it will be ta*iight as the science of language . We might easily add to the number of subjects , either in themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they are communicated ; but , as we shall have occasion , under another head , to animadvert upon several of the branches of common education , 4we shall only refer for the present to the books in which the art of reading is commonly taught . They are made up , in general , of the most splendid passages of our eloquence an ( I literature ; passages , whose force and beauty , the body of adult readers but very vaguely apprehend , and which to children are often perfectly mysterious . We still remember the strange ideas , which , in our early days , we had of these passages , and the ridiculous blunders in reading them , which used to pass on from year to year in that venerable place , the school house . We are sure , that for most of the children in our common schools , yea , and our grammar schools , and academies , the finest and most highly wrought compositions of our language are not the proper readings . The monotonous , we had almost said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our schools , abundantly shows , that they are the worst possible lessons for the youthful learner . They are not understood ; and not being understood , they induce those false habits of reading , that monotony and singsong , from which even our educated men and public speakers but too rarely escape . Now , if there were substituted , in place of these elaborate compositions , familiar narratives of the most common events , and especially such easy and spirited dialogues as many of Miss Edgeworth 's , we believe it would be as impossible for children to avoid the right tone , as it is under the present system found impossible for them to attain it . The same remarks may also be extended to the indiscriminate reading of the Semiptures in our schools . Without entering at all into the question of the moral bearing of this practice , we may observe , that there is a considerable part of the Scriptures , and even of the New Testament , which children can not comprehend ; and therefore , on every account , that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books should be introduced as reading lessons . Shall a child , then , it may be asked , attend to nothing , that it can not understand ? We answer , to very little or nothing . What possible use would it serve ? It may be thought , that for a boy to study the grammar of an unkno*vn language , is studying what he does not understand . But certainly not . He understands , if lie is properly taught , that the grammar , which he is learning , is a description of the unknown tongue , that he is to study . The child , in this case , therefore , no more commits to memory what he does not understand , than an adult , than the most learned professor of languages . But is there not much in the commencement of every study and science , that is necessarily unintelligible ? We say decidedly , that there is not . if we are wrong , we will stand corrected by those that are wiser . We do not believe in the doctrine , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the process of learning , to lay up in the memory words without meaning . The first principles of every science may have bearings and relations , indeed , which the learner does not understand ; but he does , or may understand all that is intended for him as a learner ; all that is necessary for him , in order to proceed intelligently in his study . Take , for example , the axioms of the mathematics . Are they not intelligible ? rhe very science proceeds on the supposition , that they are understood . Take the definitions of any branch of study , and if they can not be understood , we desire to know , what is the use or purport of a definition ? After knowledge may undoubtedly throw further light on these definitions , and axioms , and first principles ; but they are , at the outset , or may be , comprehended to a certain and sufficient extent . We are not required to admit , therefore , what , after all , is a mere solecism , that a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have resulted from this defect in education , are of the worst kind . The loss of time , already alluded to , is the least of them . Nor is even the loss of knowledge the greatest of them . For the very disposition to know , the very desire of acquisition is taken away . Much of the ignorance of the community is to be traced to this kind of learning . How many dull scholars , too , have been made so by unintelligible instruction . The abused mind still gives this testimony to its intrinsic dignity , that it can not be interested in what it does not mnder*tand . Words , that neither teach nor signify anything t&gt; // it , must be dull ; they ought to be dull . It is , and it ought to be , a dull business to commit them to memory , and to repeat them , though with ever so much fluency and eclat . This attending to words , without comprehending their meaning , also fosters a habit of indistinctness , a want of discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something bordering certainly on moral dereliction . There can not be a worse habit for the mind , if not for the heart , than to be content with an equivocal , half way knowledge of what is studied , or read , or heard . It is fatal to thorough scholarship ; it is injurious to practical good sense ; it is a species of injustice to the mind , and almost a. swerving from conscience . We are prone enough from our natural indolence , to rest satisfied with superficial knowledge ; * but add this propensity the influence of a neoii*ent and we to bb superficial education . And yet , perhaps , nothing so puffs up the mind with a notion of its acquisitions , as superficial knowledge . No person is so self complacent as the fluent repeater of unmeaning words . But we must not dwell longer on these evils . Let us hoper that they will soon be remedied , that books of elementary instruction will be simplified , as some of them already have been ; that education will become less scholastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more a business of real* understanding ; that the capacity and aptitude of children will be more consulted in the appropriation of their studies , and that . their minds will no more be stupified and disgusted with laborious and fruitless application to sub*jects beyond their mach and . comprehension . The human mind is fitted to be interested and delighted at every step of real progress in knowledge . And when this progress is made , it will be found , that the simple delight of learning will surpass and supersede all the lower influences of fear , jealousy , and emulation . And this of itself , if there were nothing else , would constitute a new and grand era in education . But we find that we are entering on another subject , that belongs to the course of our remarks . The second thing , then , to be demanded in an improving education , is , that children and youth should be more interested . in what they learn . The dulness of our schools is proverbial . The weary task , the irksome lesson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u*tmost patience . Enter many of our schools and , unless an approaching examination , or a contested medal // has called forth the spirit of zealous rivalship , what languor and listlessness meet you on every side . How many vacant faces , and heavy attitudes , and sluggish movements . How many indications that everything is done because it must be done ; that almost every learner is held to his seat , not by inclination , but by necessity ; that if the restriction were taken off they would fly from the walls of the school room , as they would from the walls of a prison* And now suppose they were released , and thai you should follow them to the play ground . What an instantaneous and total metamorphosis would you witness . What life and spirit. ; what cager faces and bright eyes ; what delightful animation .. And is it true , then , that man is naturally more an animal , than an intellectual being ; that he was made to be more interested by sports and feats of physical strength and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For the honor of human nature , we would not admit the idea ; and , in truth , we do not believe it . There are instances , and there will be more , where the school room calls forth the most active and delightful exercise of the faculties , and is resorted to with as much eagerness as the most fascinating sports of childhood . This step , in the course of an improved education , will natu.rally follow the one already mentioned . Let children understand , and they will be prepared to be intercsted . But this is not all . They must be taught what is naturally fitted to interest them , and they must be tan ht object . * t in a manner suited to gain this And here we shall venture to call in question much that is taught in many , even of the better sort of schools , on the ground of a deficiency in one of these respects , that is , of its being uninteresting in the matter , or of its being made uninteresting by the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many of the English studies , that are pursued in most of . our schools , and especially of our female schools . They are not uninteresting in themselves , but they are made so . Arithmetic , geography , history , as they are commonly taught , are to most learners extremely wearisome and dull ; that is to say , these studies are not interesting for their own sake , and they can be pursued with interest , only by means of stimulants quite foreign to the love of knowledge . it is impossible , that a body of mere abstract facts , without any relation to the grounds or reasons of them ; without any relation to human nature or human life ; without any obvious - VOL . XxJH. - NO. 5*. // relation to practical utility or personal improvement ; it is impossible that such isolated facts , however true or important , should be really interesting , any more than the definitions of a dictionarv. or the events of a table of chronology . It has been remarked by Dugald Stewart , that the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas we have , but upon the number of relations , which we perceive between them . But Ynany people imagine , that there is some absolute and singular good in certain ideas , in certain , though most inconsequential and useless statements , because they are set down in books ; because they are what is called learning ; and perhaps , also , because that most precious of all things , money , is paid for their acquisition . Now what pleasure , we beg leave to ask , what interest can be taken in the hundred rules of arithmetic , if not one in ten of them is ever to come to any use , and still fexver of them are ever understood in their principles ; that is to say , are ever demonstrated by the learner ? What statement of particulars can there be so barren or so trivial , that it is not equally entitled to interest and delight the mind ? There is some intellectual effort elicited , it is true , but it is , after all , but a misdirected and vexatious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction in being acqm4ainted with foreign countries ; there is a charm in the descriptions of noble rivers and mighty cataracts ; of green and cultivated fields , and majestic forests and mountains ; of flourishing kingdoms and splendid cities ; and Malte-Brun has shown us , that a charm may be given to these descriptions even in a book of geography . But *eography , as it is commonly taught , is divested of most of these attractions . It is reduced to a matter of geometrical survey ; of lengths and breadths ; of latitudes and longitudes ; of heights and distances ; dry statements of population and produce . We do not deny , that something of all this should be learnt ; but it should be as little as possible , and always on a system of comparative geography . With regard to thick and crowded compendiums of history , we have really no ) patience with them . They are , and they ought to be , insufferably tedious . History is interesting , not as a collection of naked facts , which may be aptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after , and then , from the excessive and irksome load , which they lay upon the memory , necessarily and gladly forgotten ; but history is interesting , as it spreads before us mighty scene of human conduct , unfolds its sprIngs* // and traces out its consequences , displays the character of the actors , with something of the detail and interest that belongs to biography ; and thus touches and quickens the moral sentiments of our nature . And here again we allow , that something of the nature of compendiums is needful ; but we are confident , that they should go but little beyond chronological and historical charts ; landmarks to show the inquirer his course , his relative position , and his progress . It will be easily seen , that we would not have the branches of study , on which we have ventured to bestow these strictures , neglected . We would have them pursued in their place and measure ; and we will , in a moment , endeavor to state our views on this point . But on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are obliged to doubt entirely . We should say , that rhetoric , considered as a set of rules , would be better learnt from reading ; and that rhetoric , considered as the philosophy of language , is beyond the comprehension of almost all the pupils in our schools . The philosophy of rhetoric , however , is not attempted to be taught in them ; and as to the rules , we believe they would be better learnt , if the time usually devoted to them , were given to reading the authors , who best illustrate them , and to composition . And we would recommend this latter practice , particularly to our female schools , since it would help , more than any other means , to correct what is considered as the most common fault in the female mind , the want of logical discrimination . Upon the whole , then , in fixing the proportion , that should be observed in the different departments of education , we should assign a much lar6 er place than is commonly given , to the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemistry , natural philosophy , and astronomy . The earth , its structure , the substances of which it is composed , together with their mutual relations , and their action on each other ; its minerals , plants , and animals ; and then its connexion with other planets , and with the system of the universe ; these would be inexhaustible sources of interest to the learner . These , in their elementary principles , together with languages , and , along with these severer studies , accomplishments in the arts of reading , writing , music , and the like , might occupy the early years of education . At a later period , accomplishments of a more intellectual kind , as history . rhetoric . and matters of literary taste . might be introduced . // It may be thought by some , that these objects would require a life of study ; and , carried to their fullest extent , they would . But we speak of them only in their elements , especially the subjects of natural philosophy ; and we are persuaded , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some valuable extent , pursue this course of education ; and that , with the exception of languages and the higher accomplishments , the other half might . Let them only begin ribht ; let them learn nothing that they do not comprehend ; let them he interested in what they learn ; let them feel the excitement of curiosity , and have their faculties put on the stretch with the love of knowledge ; and we believe , that a new race of children would rise tip among us . Let a few simple , and they might be cheap , instruments and apparatus he introduced into our school rooms , for developing the beauties and wonders of nature , and let them be judiciously applied to this purpose ; and instead of the barren minuthe of geography being committed to memory , let the great features of it be surveyed with the aid of good maps , and drawiwrs of cities , and of curiosities , and let interesting portions of history be combined with the study of different countries ; and , instead of a multitude of tedious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which exemplify in fact all the rules of good writing ; let all this be done , and much more of the same kind , and the school room would become one of the most interesting spots in the world . But let the business of education be a business of learning names and dates , and barren rules , of studying grammar before it is comprehended , or the abstract principles of rhetoric , which are turned to no account or use , or wearisome compendiums of history , or technical maxims of arithmetic , or the petty localities of geography ; let all this be , and schools must be dull . Children may study , from the love or fear of their parents or teachers , from a desire of respectability , from rivalship , but not from the love of knowledge ; and wanting this motive , their minds will be too apt to rise only to mercenary exertion , or to sink down into a miserable apathy or disgust towards all learning , towards books and everything connected with them . Finding no proper vent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , they may give their spirits chiefly and heartily to play , to rude tricks , and vulgar entertainments . The fault here alleged is not to be laid to the charge of the intelligent teacher of youth . He is often obliged to go in a certain track ; he is often engaged to teach certain branches . // and children are sent to him expressly to learn them . The compensation that is afforded him , also , is in most cases so low , that he is compelled to receive more scholars than he can well teach ; and , from the same cause , he is unable to procure the proper means and apparatus for instructin* youth . The remedy lbr all these evils , therefore , can be applied only by the community . And to the community , we beg leave earnestly to commend this subject . It is a subject nearly touching the duties and the interests of society , and therefore worthy to be urged at all times , and through every medium of communication . The press of an intelligent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . The third tIming to be desired in a system of popular education , is , that it should be more practical . This step will naturally follow the two preceding ; for if education is more intelligible , and more interesting , we may presume it will he more practical ; that is to say , it will be directed to purposes of more obvious and real utility . It will be directed , in the first place , more to the culture of the mind , to the improvement of the character . It will be less an exercise of memory , and more of reasoning . For a child or youth to load his mind with thousands of rules , principles , and facts , will be judged to be of less consequence , than for him to reason on a few of them . The studies of the school and the college , instead of being looked upon as the ultimate point of attainment , will be regarded as the preparation , the furnishing and sharpening of the mind , for further discoveries and acquisitions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid aside , when the school is left , we all very well know ; and this shows , that they never had any strong hold on the understanding , nor any obvious connexion with improvement . The other respect in which education should be more practical , is , that it should more directly fit men for the actual business of life ; or , to say more exactly what we mean , it should give to the business of life a more intellectual character ; mingling thought and reasoning with it ; guiding its labors , not by artificial rules , but by intelligent principles . Thus , a man may pursue the business of a mechanic , and may , without doubt , safely enough guide himself by certain rules , though he does not understand the reasons of them ; or he may be a farmer without understanding anything of the nature and combination of different soils , or the chemical principles that are concerned // 1July* in their improvement ; or a man may traverse the ocean by the help of instruments and calculations , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly , with this blind adherence to rules , a man may be a good mechanic , or farmer , or navibator . But how much would it raise him in the intellectual scale ; how much thought and reflection would it mingle with all his pursuits , if he did enter into this philosophy and reason of thiurs . His daily labors would involve a constant exercise of intellect ; and he would be , on all subjects , a more intelligent man . He would acquire a habit of looking into the reason of things , and this habit would extend to everything . Nor let it be tho*ight , that the acquisition of the necessary knowledge would be a Herculean task . rrhe requisite study of nature , and of the laws of nature , may easily be simplified , so as to be brought within the comprehension of youth , and within the time ordinarily allotted to a common education amoug us . The application of science to the business of life is an object , which has already interested some intelligent and patriotic individuals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country for this specific purpose ; and it can not be doubted , that more of the same kind will soon be established . To some projects of this kind , that have been recently brought before the legislature of Massachusetts , we can not help taking this opportunity to give our most hearty wishes for their success . Labor need not be a mere mechanical or corporeal drudgery . It may be accompanied with a perpetual exercise and improvement of the intellect . It may be accompanied with the study and love of nature , and with increasing discoveries of the wisdom of its laws , and the wonders of its operations ; while , with these , every domestic affection , too , and every religious aim may mingle , to relieve , to exalt , and to hallow the toils of life . Nor would those only , who are engaged in laborious employments , feel the benefit of an improving education , but the men of more leisurely and sedentary pursuits . It has been , we can hardly say to the reproach , but certainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned professions , that they have been too much mere men of business . This is rapidly changing ; and it will yet more change . Not that they will be less men of business , but more men of reading and study . rriade will be more and more understood , not only as an affair of barter , but as a subject of science . Its relations to society , to government , to national improvement ; its connexion with the // interests and institutions of foreign countries , and with the laws and political economy of our own , are subjects , which , if our merchants do not want the inclination , they will not want the leisure to pursue . We expect much more , too , from the liberal professions . Trained in childhood to the love of knowledge , animated in later years with the love of learning , the lawyer , physician , and divine , not indolently content with what they must know , will push their inquiries into the fields of liberal investigation and elegant literature . There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , but in law and in divinity ; too many mechanical drudges even in what are called the learned professions . We confidently expect the time when these professions shall better deserve the name of learned . But it will be thought , that we have forb0tten the pamphlet , whose title we have placed at the head of this article , and have only taken occasion from it to make a pamphlet ourselves ; and we will not deny , that we have been more concerned to follow out the spirit of it , than to quote its details . We remarked , at the commencement of our observations , that there is a department of popular education distinct from the schools ; we referred to the education of adults . It is to this , that Mr Brougham 's observations chiefly relate . There are now springing up in various parts of England , associations of mechanics and apprentices , by whom not only libraries are collected , but lectures are established ; and bodies of intelligent artisans are found in a considerable number of towns and villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conversing on the principles of their respective arts , or nstening to the illustration of them from an able lecturer , and he , too , in many instances , one who has risen up from among themselves . This example is beginning to be followed by some of our own cities ; and we see not why it might not be extended to our villages , and even to very small villages of a considerably dense population , and why our farmers and manufacturers , as well as mechanics , might not tinite to form similar institut*ons . The utility of stich institutions will not be doubted ; we would ask , why their practicability is any more questionabl&amp; ? Let ten or twenty mechanics or farmers in any of our villages unite , and consent to appropriate six cents a xveck from their income . and they will soon have a valuable collection of books ; // others will join them , and their collection xviii swell into a library* With a little increased exertion , they may , during three or four of the most leisure months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expense , in such a country as this , ought not to he any serious objection . If it is made such , with any , let that ohjec. * tion be put to shame by the example of their English brethren . Nay , let it be put to still greater shame , by a survey of the actual and superfluous expenditures of the community . We will name but a single item . We ask but for what the show man carries off from our villages yearly , to establish libraries and lectureships . We can not leave this general subject of popular education , without saying something , in fine , of its bearings on the spirit of the age , and the situation and prospects of our country . There is at this day an unprecedented developement of mind , and most of all unprecedented in its extension to all classes of the people . We can not say , that we look without apprehension upon this excited mass of public sentiment , that is rising from the lethargy of centuries , like the sea from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedes its most violent convulsions . From the free and inquisitive spirit , of the age , we believe , that there is much to hope . We believe , that politics , religion , and the wisdom aud welfare of life have much to hope ; hut we seriously apprehend , too , that they have something to fear ; and the only chance of that glorious issue of the present state of things , to which the quickened and enthusiastic spirit of the age is looking , depends on the sound culture , and wise direction of the public mind . The question , ' says Mr Brougham , no longer is , whether or not the people shall he instructed ; ' whether or not , we might add , in this country , they shall think and inquire with freedom and boldness ; for that has been determined long ago , and the decision is irreversible ; but whether they shall be well or ill taught ; half informed , or as thoroughly as their circumstances permit , and their wants require . Let no one be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their superiors . Well educated , and even well versed in the most elevated sciences they assuredly may become ; and the worst consequence , that can follow to their superiors , will be , that , to deserve being called their betters , they too must devote themselves more to the pursuit of solid and refined learned . ' p. 3S*. // ment to us in this country , than to any other people . Education , and the education of the people , too , is the hope , not of our improvement only , but of our existence . It stands , with us , in the place of everything that makes other governments strong . It stands in the place of the Establishment , of the army , and the sacred throne ; it is the order , and ( lefence , and power of the nation . We look upon this nation as making a momentous and penN ous experiment on free and popular institutions ; nor is it to he thou bht , that the experiment has yet gone beyond the point of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too often repeated , that such institutions as ours can have no permanent standing , but on the basis of knowledge and virtue . The charter of our privi* leges is our national character . It was this , that bought them when our strength was not in sinews , but in brave hearts ; in the spirit of men , that were resolved to do , or die . ' If other nations can not attain to the same privileges ; if Spain , and Portugal , and italy can not be free , it will be because the spirit of intelligent , virtuous , and cour*eous freedom is not in them . Let our people swerve from this , and it matters little whether , in name and in form , they are freemen or slaves . Let our national character fail in the great trial , which it is passing through ; let luxury and excess grow in our cities ; let vice stalk abroad fearlessly in our villages ; let our hardy yeomanry become indolent , inefficient , bankrupt in property , and more bankrupt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtuous education , and vie with each other in extravagance and revelling ; and farewell to the dignity and the joy of freedom . Though the semblance remain awhile , the spirit will have fled forever . Now , that our national character is improving , we wish it were easier to maintain than it is . No sober citizen certainly can look without concern , on the increase of luxury , and the fearful inroads of intemperance among us ; nor ask , without solicitude , what is to stay their desolating progress ? To say , that we want more virtue , is only saying , that we have too much vice ; and is therefore only to descant upon the evil , which we wish to correct . Of the means of correction for our grand national vice , but two things occur to us as at all likely to have any success . One is , to lay a tax on spirituous liquors , such as must exclude them from that common use , which now brings temptation to every man 's loor every day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th' community // is not yet virtuous and highminded enough to consent ; and hence the government xviii not venture upon a measure as impracticable , perhaps , as it is unpopular . Or , to state the case more truly , since , among us , the feelings of the people are represented in the government , the government has no inclination to do it . The other means of prevention , and the only one , it appears , which is now open to us , is to educate , to enlighten , to exalt the public mind . Knowledge , reading , must supply those resources to the mind , which shall render it independent of meaner excitements . For why does a man resort to the intoxicating draught ? Commonly , because he is unhappy without it ; he wants something to excite or to entertain him . He sits down at home for an evening , and it is dull to him ; he goes abroad for relief , and too often finds a relief , which is his ruin . Now let this man have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which too much prevails , but educated to the love of knowledge ; let something of the science and mystery of nature to b e been prohave been opened him ; let interesting books hay vided for him ; let him have been associated with others in the same pursuits ; and he would not have found leisure a burden ; lie would not have found company a snare ; he would not have found his home irksome . Life , with him , would have received a new impulse , new resources ; and he would be proportionably raised above sense and matter , to intellect and virtue . The hope of seeing communities thus educated , intelligent , virtuous , and happy , is one which we delight to cherish . We gladly go along , however cautiously , with this spirit and promise of the age . Visions of improvement , not of perfectibility , arc before us ; and though past experience seems to mock them , we xviii not believe they are dreams . The auspices of freedom , the tendencies of knowledge , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of man , all forbid despair . Let our favored communities do their duty , and there shall be no l ) lace eveim for scepticism . Tell us not of difficulties , of obstacles , of expenses , in the way of rearing a wise , and enlightene ( l , and righteous generation . Give us the refuse of the superfluous expenditure of the country , the fragments from the tables of luxury , the leavings of expensive entertainments and amusements , the east off garments of sumptuous wardrobes ; or store for us what excess consumes , and intemperance swallows in this land ; and with these means , we could pledge ourselves *o raise up a community , far more enlightened than the world // has yet seen . Let every man , moreover , give his own faithful personal endeavors , and we deem it not too solemn to add , his earnest prayers to Heaven , and here upon these shores of promise , shall be reared up a community as pure and happy , as it shall be intelligent and enlightened .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
