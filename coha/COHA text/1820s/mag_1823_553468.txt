ART . VII. -. i1 few Notes on certain passages respecting the Law of Nations , contained in an article in the July number of the North american Review , upon the work entitled Europe , by a citizen of the United States . ' By the author of that work . Boston . 1823 . THE object of this pamphlet , written by the author of Europe with his usual ability , is to maintain the correctness of certain statements and opinions advanced by him in that work , and questioned in our review of it . Our respect for his talents and learning , and the consciousness that , as our opinions carry with them no authority , it is so much the more incumbent on us to support them by reason , induce us to swerve so far from the usual practice of reviewers , as to reply to his arguments , and to state particularly the grounds of our dissent from them . If we may ever be allowed to do this , we owe it to the writer and to the subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the North American Review and its readers are more indebted than to the author of Europe , and few topics more interesting in our diplomatic history than those on which we differ from him . The first is the construction of Jay 's Treaty . That we may not do injustice to his remarks by misunderstanding them , we shall quote in coilnexion all that he says upon the subject . 1 . Of these , the one which appears to have becn regarded as the most exceptionable , is contained in some remarks in the ninth chapter of the work , page 400 , in which , after representing as an unwarrantable innovation on the law of nations , the claim made by Great Britain , in the year 1793 , to treat provisions as an article contraband of war , I have added an expression of regret , that this claim should have been sanctioned in a formal treaty by the government of the United States . The reviewer , after quoting the passage , here alluded to , in the treaty with Great Britain negotiated by M* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage in question forms a part of the sixteenth article of the treaty , and is as follows : " And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the precise cases , in which alone provisions and other articles , not generally contr*sband , may be regarded as such , enders it expedient to provide against the inconvenIences and misunderstandings , which might thence arise ; it is further agreed , that whenever any such articles , so becoming contraband according to the existing law of nations , shall for that reason be seized , the sa inc shall Rot be confiscated ; but the owners thereof shall be speedily and completely // " We supposed that there was now but one opinion among enlightened men with regard to the merits of this treaty ; and that , at the present day , it was admitted , as a whole , to have been equally honorable and beneficial to our country . it is obvious that the clause above cited does not warrant the reproach cast on it , thai it did not recognise any new rule of public law , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or relinquish any national right of the United States . Literally construed and fairly applied , it is unexceptionable ; tending rather to mitigate , than increase the severity of the law of nations ; and the only rational objection to its policy is , that in practice it admitted and indeed almost invited abuse , by enabling England more easily and with less danger of clamorous and immediate resistance , to interrupt even our lawful commerce with her enemy , upon her paying what her own courts should deem an adequate compensation for the injury . " The meaning of the most important phrase in this passage , which is j ) rinted in italics , is rather ambiguous . The treaty plainly admits the existence of cases , in which provisions may become contraband by the established law of nations . In saying that it does not recognise any new rule of public law , the reviewer therefore conveys of necessity to his readers the idea that he does not consider the rule , which makes provisions contraband , as a new one . As all treaties must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded , the cases provided for in the article must n*tturally be regarded as those , about which a difference bad existed between the parties ; and putting this construction as the treaty , the remark of the reviewer would amount to a recognition of the legality of the British claim , to its full extent . Afterwards , however , he uses the phrase , " lawful * in apparent application to the trade in provisions , which was interrupted by the claim in question . I confess that I should regret very much to believe that so learned and patriotic a writer intended to vindicate publicly this most extraordinary pretension ; and as his language will admit a different , although perhaps a less natural construction , I shall consider him , when he states that the clause in question does not recognise any new rule of public law , as meaning to be understood , that there are cases , in which , by the acknowledged law of nations , provisions become contraband ; that the treaty merely provides for such cases , without admitting that the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was of the indemnified ; and the captors , or in their default , the government under whose authority they act , shall pay to the masters or owners of such vessels the full value of all such articles , with a reasonable mercantile profit thereon , togeth. *r with the frcight , * and also the demurrage incident to such detention . " // number ; and that it mitigates instead of increasing the severity of the existing law , by determining that provisions seized in these cases shall be paid for . This is the most plausible sense that can be drawn from the reviewer 's language , and is probably the one which he intended to convey . But the passage , thus understood , is liable to two weighty objections . 1 . That there are any cases , in which provisions can be fairly treated as contraband , according to the existing law of nations , Is , in my opinion , a wholly untenable position , and was uniformly denied by the American government up to the time of Mr Jay 's treaty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because all intercourse with such a place is prohibited , upon a different principle from that which interdicts the trade in contraband articles . It has probably , however , arisen from a confusion of the two cases , that a few writers have given some countenance to the idea , that provisions might become contraband in certain junctures . The attempt of Great Britain to 5uJ ) - port , on such authorities , a pretension to interrupt the whole trade of the world in provisions with one of the greatest nations in Europe , can hardly be looked upon in any other light than as a piece of solemn mockery . It seems to be regarded in this way by Kliiber , a late approved German writer on national law . ? * If , " says he " the pretensions of belligerent powers respecting contraband articles were binding on neutrals , every thing would become contraband that was worth taking . Thus Great Britain , by her order of June * , 1793 , directed the seizure of all ships bound to France with provisions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quoted at the time by lord Grenville , as giving countenance to the British claim , because he stated , that in some treaties provisions were made contraband in certain cases , afterwards expunged the passage relied upon by his lordship , which is not to be found in the third edition of the work , published at Gdttingen last year , a short time before the author 's death.t The principle that provisions may be treated as contraband , was positively denied by the American government . Mr Jefferson , then secretary of state , remarks in a letter to Mr Pinckney , our minister at London , written immediately after he had received the first intelligence of the order , that the principle supposed is so rn*an*festly contrary to the law of nations , that nothing more would seem necessary , than to observe that it is so. $ And in * See Kiuber , Droit des gens moderne de lEurope , 288 , in Not . Since the death of Martens , KiOber is perhaps the most distinguished living writer on public law . I Compare Martens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 318. f See Wait 's State Papers , vol. i. pp. 218 and 324 ; also 327 , 408 , and the following pages . // his answer to the letter of the British minister , Hamm6nd , giving official notice of the order , he declares that the principle is entirely new . Mr Randolph , who about this time succeeded Mr Jefferson as secretary of state , took the same ground in his correspondence with Mr Hammond , and Mr Pinckney , in his intercourse with the British government . " General Washington , 7* says Marshall , " was resolved on no account to acquiesce in the idea , that provisions , though not generally contraband , might in certain cases become so . " " * The motives which induced him to break this resolution by ratifying the eighteenth article of Mr Jay 's treaty , will be noticed hereafter . I conclude , therefore , that , on the * own construction of the article , it sanctioned a new and wholly inadmissible rule of public law , and one which up to that time had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . But a second and still more weighty objection to the reviewer 's observation is , that the construction of the treaty , which he has adopted , or rather which I have attributed to him , as implied by the most candid interpretation which could be put upon his language , is not the true one . The article does not merely recognise the existence of certain undefined cases , in which provisions may become contraband , without admitting that the then present case was of the number , but must be understood upon all the fair and ordinary principles of interpretation , as *zcknowledging the legality of the precise claim , which had just before been made by Great Britain , of a right to interdict the whole neutral trade with France in provisions ; a claim which had previously been pronounced by the American government , as it has been ever since by all good authorities , a monstrous offence against the rights of neutrals as well as common humanity , and which is now treated , as I have shown , by approved civilians , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , is unfortunately but too certain . The reviewer will pardon me for observing , that a literal construction of state papers and public documents is rarely just , and never , perhaps , when it differs from a fair and liberal one . Such instruments , and , in particular , treaties , must be interpreted , on the contrary , as I have remarked above , by reference to the ircumstances under which they were concluded , without a knowledge of which they are seldom even intelligible . In this case , as in others of the same description , the negotiators met together , not to compile a general code of national law , nor to provide for undefined cases , that might never occur , but to seP * See Marshall 's Life of Washington , vol. v. p. 619 . . N*cw Series , . Mo . 15. 19 // tie certain important points in dispute between the two countries . One of these was the legality of the British order in council of June 8 , 1793 , directing the seizure of provisions bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and denied by ours . Had the treaty contained no stipulations on the subject , we should have concluded that the point remained unsettled , and that neither party would consent to abandon its ground-as waS the case in regard to several important questions at the negotiation of Ghent . Had *t contained an article declaring that the trade in provisions could not be interdicted as contraband , we should of course have concluded that Great Britain had conceded the point , although the precise case of the recent claim had not been mentioned . When , on the contrary , we find an article declaring that provisions may , in certain cases , be treated as contraband-the full extent of the British claim when stated in general terms  --  and providing for these cases in the same way , and nearly in the same words , in which they are provided for by the order of June it is just as obvious , that the intentions and effect of the article are to recognise the legality of this order , as if it had been quoted by its date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propriety or rather necessity of such a construction by supposing a parallel case . Let it be imagined , for an example , that the treaty of Ghent had contained an article conceived in the following terms : Whereas the difficulty of agreeing upon the precise extent , to which5 when one of the contracting parties is at war , and the other at peace , the naval officers of the belligerent party may exercise the right of entering the ships of the neretral , and carrying away wholly or in part the persons whom they find on board , renders it expedient to provide against the misunderstandings and inconveniences , which might thence arise ; it is agreed that all such persons , so carried a ay , shall immediately be put on shore by such naval officer at the nearest port within the dominions eJ the belligerent party , and shall there be examined without delay by commissioners to be appointed for this purpose , and , if they are found to be the native citizens or subjects of the neutral power , shall be forthwith released and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable compensation for detention and other damages . Such an article would have stood in about the same relation to an undoubted principle of public law , in which the eighteenth article of Mr Jay 's treaty stands to a very questionable one ; and on the principle of literal interpretation , recommended by the review*r , might have been defended as an improvement and mitigation of the existing system.u Had it been found in the treaty of * It might have been said , for example , that it is an acknowledged prinei. pie of public law , that the belligerent party may enter the ships of the neutral // *hent , it would have been interpreted , as every article in every treaty must be , by reference to the circumstances under which it was agreed to , and would have been rejected with indignation by the government and people of the United States , as a sanction of the abuse of impressment . The terticle , therefore , tchich I have been considering , undoubtedly admitted the legality of the British order . Any article upon the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same extent to which it did not directly exclude it ; and aS this contains no provision in favor of neutrals , not to be found in the order , it amounts to a complete concession . The order had been revoked on the fourteenth of August , previously to the signature of the treaty . But it is rather a curious fact , and one which strongly confirms the propriety of the construction , which I have put upon the article , that after the signature of the treaty , and before its ratification , this obnoxious pretension was revived . It is evident enough from this , that both the negotiators considered the legality of the order , as admitted by the article , since the British government would hardly have thought it worth while to sign a treaty , which they intended to violate before it was ratified . 1 think myself therefore justified in repeating , that the treaty , upon the * own construction of it , sanctioned *a new and inadmissible rule of public law ; and that , upon the only fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British order of June 8 , 1793 . Such an admission I thought and still think a legitimate subject of regret , with every friend of justice and humanity , and every citizen of the United States . In regretting the admission of this article into the treaty , I have not , however , cast any censure upon the administration , which negotiated it , nor have I expressed any disapprobation of the treaty , as a whole ; although both the reviewer , and the author of the pamphlet ( judging of the latter from the title ) seem to charge me with so doing . A treaty may be excellent as a whole , and yet contain one or more unfortunate articles . In and carry nxvay all persons in the actual military or naval service of the enemy to be found there , that the article here supposed , as it only recogriises acknowledged principles must be understood , literally construed and , fairly applied , as simply confirming this right , and as not touching the doubtful question , whether the belligerent party has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsequent provisions are consequently a mitigation of the existing law . This is the mode of reasoning adopted by the reviewer in regard to the eighteenth article of Mr Jay 's treaty , and the argument is stronger in the case supposed , than in his , for the reason stated in the text . No candid man , however , can doubt that an article , like that supposed in the text , would have sanctioned the claim of impressment ; and it is equally esidenit that the eighteenth article sanctioned the legality of the order of June . // fact , the gentlemen , who make this charge against me , appear to have overlooked or forgotten the facts-. -. - which , however , rest upon no more distant authority , than that of Marshall-that the particular article of Mr Jay 's treaty , to which I have objected , was also at the time considered objectionable by the government ; that the president was doubtful whether he should ratify it , and bad apparently at one time made up his mind not to do so ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary expunged from the treaty , had not the ratification of the whole instrument , as it stood , been precipitated by accidental causes ; and finally that the ratification was accompanied by a memorial *n regard to this article , disavowing the principles recognised by it , and amounting in substance to a refusal to ratify it . These facts are either directly asserted by the chief justice , or follow in necessary conclusion from the tenor of his narrative , which is briefly thus : * " The president , " he informs us , " after some hesitation and deliberation upon the subject of the treaty , had concluded to ratify the whole instrument as it stood , if it should be approved by the senate . i*3ut while it was under consideration in this body , intelligence was received of the renewal of the provision order , ( mentioned above . ) The president apprehended that this renewal might be construed and intended as a practical construction of that article in the treaty , which seems to favor the idea that provisions , though not generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction in which he had determined not to acquiesce  --  and thought it wise in consequence to reconsider his decision . " Now , as the article in question does not seem to favor the idea , but actually affirms , in so many words , that provisions , though not generally contraband , may in certain cases become so4 and must be understood on fair principles of construction , as admitting the legality of the British order , it is clear that the president , if , as we are informed by Marshall , he had determined not to acquiesce in this admission , must also have determined not to ratify this article of the treaty . At all events , he wholly rejected the principle , which the reviewer declares not to be a new rule of public law . The chief justice pursues his narrative as follows : " Of the result of this reconsideration there is no conclusive * See Marshall , as quoted above ; and the following pages . t The phrase , which appears in the body of this article in a conditional form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as follows : Provisions and other articles not generally contraband , may in certain cases become so acsording to the existing law of nations . It is not too much , I think , to say of this phrase , as Hamlet does of himself , that it knows not seems . // testimony . A strong memorial against this objectionable order was directed : and the propositions to withhold the ratifications of the treaty until the order should be repealed ; to make the exchange of ratifications dependent upon that event ; and to adhere to his original purpose of pursuing the advice of the senate , connecting with that measure the memorial which had been mentioned , as an act explanatory of the sense in which his ratification was made , were severally reviewed by him . In conformnity with his practice of withholding his opinion on controverted points , until it should become necessary to decide them , he suspended his determination on these propositions until the memorial should be prepared and laid before him . In the mean time his private affairs required that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable length into an account of the opposition to the treaty that displayed itself throughout the country ; after which , he describes the circumstances under which the resolution to ratify was finally taken in the following manner : " In the afternoon of the 11th of August , the president arrived in Philadelphia ; and on the next day the question respecting the immediate ratification of the treaty was brought before the cabinet . The secretary of state maintained singly the opinion that during the existence of the provision order , and during the war between Britain and France , this step ought not to be taken . " This opinion did not prevail . The resolution was adopted to ratify the treaty immediately , and to accompany the ratification with a strong memorial against the provision order , which should carry in explicit terms the sense of the American government on that subject . By this course the views of the executive were happily accomplished . The order was revoked and the ratifications of the treaty were exchanged . The president was most probably determined to adopt this course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rapid progress which this violence was apparently making . It was obvious , that unless this temper could be checked , it would soon become so extensive , and would arrive at such a point of fury , as to threaten dangerous consequences . It was obviously necessary either to attempt a diminution of it&amp;action by rendering its exertions hopeless , and by giving to the treaty the weight of his character and influence , or to determine ultimately to yield to it . A species of necessity , therefore , seems to have been created for abandoning the idea , if it ever was taken up , of making the ratification of the treaty dependent on the ratification of the provision order . " It does not appear that this memorial has ever been published , and we are of course unacquainted with its precise tenor . // The chief justice represents it as a remonstrance against the renewal of the order-describes the eighteenth article of the treaty as only seeming to favor a principle , which it really asserts in terms  --  and does not state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article . As we can not , however , suppose that president Washington and his cabinet could be mistaken in the meaning of an English phrase , so short and simple as the one alluded to , it is more probable that they intended originally not to ratify the article ; but that the ratification of the treaty as it stood , having become desirable on account of the circumstances related by the chief justice , they substituted for a refusal to ratify the article a memorial against its practical enforcement . However this may be , the order , as I have previously shown , was really authorized by a fair and natural construction of the eighteenth article , and a memorial against it was consequently in substance a disavowal of the article Itself . In expressing my regret at the admission of this article into the treaty , I have therefore cast no censure whatever on the government , which certainly viewed it in the same light that I do . The reviewer , on the contrary , censures the government by implication , when he undertakes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they refused in substance to ratify it , although from accidental causes it still retains its place in the treaty . ' It must here be observed , that the question between us is not whether this clause of the treaty be in any manner objectionable ; for its liability to abuse is stated in the review , as one specific objection to it , and after reading this pamphlet , we readily admit as another , its liability to misconstruction . But did it sanction the first article of the British order in council of June , 179*3 , which authorized the capture of neutral vessels carrying corn , meal , or flour to any port in France ? The affirmative is the position which is assumed in the work entitled Europe , and repeatedly and confidently reiterated in the pamphlet before us ; and which we then ventured and still venture to deny . The inference , that because the treaty admits the existence of cases , in which provisions may become contraband , therefore the reviewer , in saying that it does not recognise any new rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he does not consider the rule , which makes provisions contraband , as a new one , seems to us neither natural nor just . A rule , which in general terms should make provisions contraband , would indeed be a new one , and even more extravagant than // the British order in council ; for thus unqualified , it must sig .. nify that they are commonly so . The difference between such a rule , and the admission that there are cases , in which provisions and other articles not generally contraband , may . be regarded as such , is in our opinion sufficiently obvious to be perceived and acknowledged without any remarkable astuteness or candor . This last position is that assumed in the treaty , and it is still believed to be no new rule of public law , but as ancient as the law itself . That there are any cases , in which provisions can fairly be considered as contraband , is deemed by this writer a wholly untenable position ; and one which he thinks to have been uniformly denied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treaty . He considers the instance of a besieged town not in point because all intercourse with such a place is prohibited upon a different principle from that which interdicts the trade in contraband articles . ' Without stopping to inquire what this different principle can possibly be , it is enough to remark , that it is altogether immaterial to the present question , upon what principle neutrals are prohibited by the law of nations from carrying provisions and other articles to a blockaded port . If they are in fact so prohibited , such articles are in that case contraband . One cause of the difference of opinion between us and the learned author may be , our employing the same word with a slight difference of signification . The term contraband is sometimes used without qualification , and in its strictest sense , to denote the mere implements of war , which a neutral is entirely prohibited from carrying to any part of a belligerent country ; and the assertion that provisions are not and can not be contraband in this sense , is incontrovertible . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr Pinckney oF Sept. 7,1793 ; where he defines contraband to mean mere implements of war , and in this sense it is obviously used by chief justice Marshall , when he says that Jay 's treaty seemed to favor the idea , that provisions may in certain cases become contraband ; and that the president was determined not to acquiesce in this construction of it . In its more general sense , however , the term ineltides every article which a neutral is under any circumstances forbidden by the law of nations from carrying to a belligerent port . This we take to be its true meaning in that clause of the treaty now // under consideration , and in this sense provisions and other articles not generally contraband , may in certain cases be regarded as such ; especially when destined to ports actually blockaded . This position is abundantly supported by the following authorities . Bynkershoek says Omnes res obsessis subvecta* habenda* sunt pro contrabandis. ' * Vattel , after defining contraband goods , adds Telles sont les armes , les munitions de guerre , les bois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * l'armement des vaisseaux de guerre , les chevaux , et les vivres m*mes en certaines occasions . ' t Valin , having remarked that Loccenius and the Danish law lay down the rule that provisions are prohibited as contraband , goes on to say ; mais par nos loix et de droit commun elle n'a lieu en cette partie que par rapport aux places , assi*g*es ou bloqu*es ; ' and cites the Spanish commentator D'Abreu and L'Observateur Hollandois , as according with him in this Opiniou.t Pothier observes , a l ' *gard des munitions de bouche que des sujets des puissances neutres envoient ? * nos ennemis , elles ne sont point cens*es de contrabande ni par consequent sujet. tes * confiscation , sauf dans un seul cas , qui est lorsqu ' elles sont euvoy*es a une place assi*g*e ou bloqu6e.

' Chief Justice Parsons , in the guarded and elaborate opinion of the court pronounced by him in the case of Richardson against the Maine Insurance Company , thus defines contra .. band goods . Goods contraband of war are of two descriptions : - munitions of war , the property of a neutral , bound from a neutral port to the territory of either of the belligerents , after the existence of the war is known :  --  and every species of neutral goods bound from a neutral port to a port belonging to either * Quest . jur. pub . b. 3. e. 11. t Droit des gens. 1 . 3. c. 7 .

If destined for the ordinary use of life in the enemy 's country , they are not in general contraband ; but it is otherwise if destined for military use . Hence if destined for the army or navy of the enemy , or for his ports of naval or military equipment , they are deemed contraband . ' t Mr Jefferson , secretary of state , in his letter of Sept. 22 , 1793 , to Mr Hammond , the British minister , relating to this order in council of June preceding , says , That all provisions are to be considered as contraband , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the means intended to be employed ; or in any case but that of a place actually blockaded , is a position entirely new . ' $ Mr Randolph , his successor , on the 1 May , 1794 , addressed a long letter to the same minister on the same subject , containing the following passage . If by a circuit of construction , food can be universally ranked among military engines ,  - -  what article , to which human comfort of any kind can be traced , is not to be registered as contraband ? In some peculiar circumstances , it must be confessed , corn , meal , and flour are so ; as in a blockade , siege , or investment . ' We can not find , in Mr Jefferson 's letters to Mr Pinckney and Mr Hammond , the remarks which this pamphlet professes to cite from them .

' The passage alluded to in his letter to Mr Hammond , as declaring that the principle is entirely new , ' is that which we have cited above . Our readers will now judge whether either of these expressions gives any countenance to the position , in support of which they are adduced ; that provisions can not in any case be fairly treated as contraband . The sentence printed a few lines below in italics , as from Marshall , is more correctly cited afterwards in connexion with its context . It can not be deemed unwarrantable to assert , in conformity with these authorities , that provisions , and other articles not generally contraband , become so when destined to ports blockaded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , in which they become so ; and by many writers are said to he the only ones . But there is very high authority for maintaining that there are others also ; that naval stores may be treated as contraband if bound to a port of naval equipment ; and provisions whenever they are destined to supply the fleet or army of one belligerent engaged in a hostile expedition against the other . The first ordinance of the American congress on this subject in the revolutionary war contains the following provision . All vessels to whomsoever belonging that shall be employed in carrying provisions or other necessaries to the British army or armies or navy , that now are , or shall hereafter be , within any of the united colonies , or any goods , wares , or merchandise for the use of such fleet or army , shall be liable to seizure , and with their cargoes shall be confiscated. ** In our last war , the supreme court of the United States decided that *a neutral was not entitled to freight for goods destined to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the ground that this was prohibited by the law of nations . It should be stated however that there was a difference of opinion in the court as to carrying the rule to this extent . The authorities above cited do not in any manner countenance the monstrous pretension set up by the British order in council of June , 1793 , to interdict the trade in provisions with France ; but they do show that it is not recognising any new rule of public law to admit that there are cases in which provisions and other articles , not generally contraband , may be * 5 Wheat . Rep. Appendix 103. // deemed so ; and further , that the cases of blockade , siege , or investment are such . But is this the true construction of the treaty ? Does it apply , as its terms plainly import , to cases in which provisions and other articles , not generally contraband , may be regarded as such , according to the existing law of nations ? or must it be understood , as the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of international law , the order of June , 1793 ? it is readily admitted , that a literal interpretation of public documents ought never to be preferred to a fair and liberal one . In construing a treaty we ought undoubtedly to affix to every expression the signification , which the parties intended to give it , at the time of making the compact ; and the circumstances under which it was made may properly be considered , in order to ascertain that intention . But after all , the best evidence of their meaning is their language , which must receive its obvious and usual interpretation , unless it be manifest that the parties intended to give it a different sense . The writer himself informs us , that the order in council was repealed more than three months before the conclusion of the treaty ; and of course it was not at that time a point in dispute between the two countries . And how , under any circumstances , could the mere fact , that the treaty contains a stipulation relating to the subject , warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amount either to an abandonment or a recognition of the whole British claim ? It may have been the object of the parties to determine in what manner provisions and other articles , not generally contraband , should be dealt with in cases , when they should become so , without defining what those cases were ; but leaving that question to be settled by the existing law of nations . This is the plain import of their language , and we can not avoid the conviction , that it was at lea*st the clear intent of the American negotiator , and known to be so hy the British at the time ; and in this case it was not competent for Great Britain to set up a different construction afterWards . The renewal of the order , indeed , after the signature and before the ratification of the treaty , looks like an attempt on her part to give it the construction contended for by this writer , sanctioning that order . But if it was so , it was a mere arti-. fice , and an unsuccessful one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free Ships Free Goods , July , of the American government against this renewal was a protest against that construction , and the consequent repeal of the order , by the British , an abandonment of it ; which , in our opinion , destroys all pretext for reasserting it now . If , by calling the admission that provisions may in certain cases be treated as contraband the full extent of the British claim when stated in general terms , it is meant to assert that this general proposition does warrant the claim , set up by the order of 1793 , to interdict the trade in provisions with France , this is the very questioci in controversy , and can not be assumed . Admitting that there are such cases , is not of itself , surely , an admission that the situation , in which France then stood , was one of them . The letters of Mr Jefferson and Mr Randolph above cited , in which they allow provisions to be contraband in cases of actual blockade , siege , or investment , at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to us chargeable with any inconsistency in so doing . The idea of illustrating this article of the treaty of 1794 , by a parallel case , is ingeniously conceived , but not , we think , aptly executed . The stipulation imagined , does not expressly limit the belligerent 's right of seizing persons on board the ships of the neutral to cases , in which this may be done according to the e xi*ting law of nations , but , on the contrary , supposes the seizure even of the citizens and subjects of the neutral power , by providing , that when seized they shall , on examination , be liberated , and directly authorizes , not only the seizure but the detention of all other persons , including of course the subjects of the belligerent and even of other neutral powers ; all which is incompatible with the principles of pulilic law ; where as the treaty of 1794 does not in terms authorize the seizure of provisions and other articles not generally contraband , excepting in cases , when by the existing law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is so happy a thought , that we can not refrain from pursuing it , and producing , in our turn , an article on the subject of impressment , resembling the provision of the treaty of 1794 , so far as the present question is concerned , more nearly than that feigned by our learned friend ; inasmuch as it does not omit , like that , the clause of express reference to the existing law of nations , the precise point on which the whole controversy turns . // No seaman , seafaring or other person , shall , upon the high seas and without the jurisdiction of either party , be demanded or taken out of any ship or vessel , belonging to the citizens or subjects of one of the parties , by the public or private armed ships belonging to or in the service of the other party ; and strict and effectual orders shall be given for the due observance of this engagement ; but it is to be understood that this article shall not exempt any person on board the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the other party , in cases where they may be liable to be so taken , accord .. ing to the laws of nations ; which liability , however , shall not be construed to extend in any case to seamen or seafaring persons , being actually part of the crew of the vessel , in which they may be , nor to persons of any description , passing from . one port to another port of either of the parties. ** What says the learned author to this article ? That it would in any manner sanction the abuse of impressment ? We know his answer . He is too well versed in our diplomatic history to be ignorant , that in the year 1804 , when Great Britain not only claimed the right of impressment from American vessels , but was constantly enforcing the claim , when this was a subject , and the chief subject of controversy between the two countries , the American minister in London , Mr Monroe , was authorized to propose this very arti ( le to the British government ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclosing it , says , You will observe , that this guards in all cases the crews of our vessels from being meddled with , and , in referring for an exception to the immunity on board our vessels to the law of nations , yields no principle maintained by the United States , inasmuch as the refrrence will be satisfied by the acknowledged exception of enemies in military service . ' t According to the reasoning of our author , was not this a mere subterfuge ? Might it not have been said , if this article had been adopted , that it must be interpreted to sanction the whole pretension of the British ? Should we not be told , that the negotiators met together , not to provide for undefined cases , but to settle important points in dispute between the two countries : - that one of these was the right of Great Britain to impress her subjects on board American vessels , which * Wait 's State pap . 360 t * Wait 's State pap . 368. // was maintained by the British government and denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitting that persons may in certain cases be taken by the British from American ships , the full extent of the British claim when stated in general terms ; the effect of this article is to recognise the legality of impressment , as much as if it had been formally confirmed ; - that any article upon the subject would have amounted to a recognition of this pretension to the same extent to which it did not directly exclude it ; and as this excludes it only in two specified cases , it completely sanctions it in every other ? ' So did not reason Mr Jefferson and his cabinet ; for assuredly they would never have proposed this article , had they dreamed that it would give the shadow of a sanction to the abuse of impressment . The renewal of the order of 1793 , after the signature and before* the ratification of the treaty , does not make it evident to our apprehension that both the negotiators considered the legality of the order as admitted by the article . It may show that the British government wished to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that it was adopted by the American . On the contrary , when it appears that our government , on learning the renewal of this order , protested against it , and that the British then again repealed it , this is a plain assertion , on the one part , and admission on the other , that it was not sanctioned by the treaty . The whole history of the events attending the ratification of the treaty , as cited from Marshall , confirms , instead of shaking our opinion . The interpretation , which would render the treaty a formal sanction , by the American government , of the or ( ler of 1793 , seems to have no countenance in this narrative , but what it derives from a single expression misunderstood . We are informed that the president had concluded to ratify the whole instrument as it stood , but that , on receiving intelligence of the renewal of the provision order , he apprehended that this renewal might be construed and intended as a practical construction of that article in the treaty which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraband , may in certain cases become so , a construction , in which he had determined not to acquiesce , and thought it wise , in consequence , to reconsider his decision . Is it not a mistake to suppose that the term contraband is // used in this sentence with the same broad signification as in the treaty ? Is it not here used in its strictest sense , as embracing only munitions of war ? And was not the idea that provisions might , in some cases , be regarded as munitions of war , and so their exportation to every part of a belligerent country be interdicted , that which the president deemed so inadmissible ? We think these questions must be answered in the affirmative , because taking the term in its more general acceptation , as used in the passages cited above , it never could have been considered inadmissible , but had in fact been admitted both by Mr Jefferson , secretary of state , and by his successor , in their official correspondence on the subject ; and because the only practical construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to put upon the treaty , was one , by which that order should be sanctioned ; and this must have been a different one from that , which Washington himself had put upon it , when he determined to ratify it as it stood . We must suppose that Marshall understood the term not to bear in the treaty the same sense in which he used it , or else we must admit , as is alleged in this pamphlet , that he describes this article as only seeming to favor a principle , which it really asserts in terms ; and also , that if the president had determined not to acquiesce in this construction , he could not have determined to ratify the treaty as it stood ; the two propositions being inconsistent . Yet does the historian positively and explicitly assert them both , in immediate connexion with each other . When it was perceived by this ingenious writer , that the necessary consequence of his construction of the treaty was , to make it appear that Chief Justice Mar*hall had so far mistaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare that it only seemed to favor the idea of a proposition , which it actually affirmed in so many words , and had involved himself in a direct contradiction , all in the short compass of two sentences , did it not suggest itself to his imagination , that perhaps that construction might be erroneous ? Nor is this the worst . Adopting this construction of the treaty , supposing that it formally sanctioned the order of 1793 , we should be compelled to think Washington and his cabinet no less inconsistent than the historian . It was the renewal of that order , whicLm induced him to reconsider his decision , and which // changed the opinion of the secretary of state ; for Marshall states that before the account of this renewal the secretary was in favor of ratifying the treaty , though afterwards opposed to it . Now why consider the renewal of the provision order any objection to the treaty ; why apprehend that it might be intended to put a practical construction , deemed inadmissible , on the eighteenth article ; if this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that recognising the legality of the order ? Why entertain the proposition to make the repeal of the order the preliminary or the condition of ratifying a treaty , by which that order was to be formally sanctioned ? Why prepare a memorial as an act explanatory of the sense , in which the ratification of the treaty was made , if the only sense , which could fairly and naturally be put on it , wa* a confirmation of the whole pretension of the British ? If the American government , being willing on the whole to ratify the treaty as it stood , but fearing that an erroneous construction might be put upon it , and one in which they were determined not to acquiesce , accompanied their ratification of it with a memorial , setting forth what they considered to be its true meaning , in order to prevent any subsequent misunderstanding , this was a candid and dignified precaution . But any attempt to avoid the effect of ratifying the treaty by a secret memorial disavowing its only fair and natural construction would , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation ; at once unmanly and unavailing . We can not therefore admit the assertion to be correct , that the memorial against the provision order was in substance a disavowal of the eighteenth article of the treaty , and a refusal to rat *fy it , although from accidental causes it retains its place in the treaty . ' But it ' it be so , and that article was not in fact ratified , then there is the less reason for the friend of justice and humanity to regret that the provision order was sanctioned by the American government in this treaty ; since it assuredly contains no other article , which can possibly be interpreted into such a sanction . The next subject , on which we have the misfortune to differ from this accomplished writer , is thus commented on in these Notes . II . The next passage in the review , which I propose to notice , is the following : - ** The position , taken in this work , that it // was an unwarrantable pretension of England to hold , that enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not be . maintained . This is the settled law of nations , and is uniformly enforced by the United States . " It may be sufficient to observe , in answer to this passage , that no such position , as the one alluded to , is taken in the work . I stated , on the contrary , expressly , that " according to the maritime code of public law , the right of plundering the private property of enemies may be exercised upon such property in the hands of third persons , " p* 399 ; in other words , that enemy 's property on board of neutral ships is good prize . Without attempting to balance authorities on the subject , I have stated this to be the principle now in force , on the simple ground that it is the British construction , and that the construction of national law adopted by the dominant powers by sea and land must always be regarded for the time being as the only valid one . I have represented this principle as unreasonable and inhuman , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reviewer may easily satisfy himself , if he will take the trouble of reading over the chapter . But although I have considered the British doctrine as a part of the existing system of public law on the ground that this law is a thing rather of fact than right , and determined for the time being , by th' practice of the dominant powers by sea and land , I can not quite agree with the learned critic in regarding it as the settled law of nations , or in thinking that it is uniformly enforced by the United States . There is in fact no que* tion in public law upon which authorities of all kinds are more at variance . The Consolato del Mare , an anonymous work on maritime law , compiled at the epoch of the crusades , but still occasionally quoted in the prize courts , recognises this principle . It was also confirmed by most of the treaties concluded previously to the middle of the seventeenth century . At that time it may perhaps have been fairly considered as settled . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish the contrary doctrine . During the American war , the latter was formally agreed to by the United States , and by all the powers of Europe excepting Great Britain ; and , soon after the close of that war , Great Britaih herself recognised it in her commercial treaty with France . If then we admit , with the reviewer , that nations'may alter the established law by cor*sent and treaty , I do not see how it can be easily denied that the doctrine of free ships , free goods , had become , in its turn , a settled principle previously to the war of the French revolution . Unless too we admit that a single nation can make and unmake the law at pleasure , I see not how the subsequent refusal of Great // Britain to acknowledge the modern principle , in which she has not been followed by the other powers , can be regarded as re* establishing the old law . On grounds of right , therefore , I conceive that the weight of authority is in favor of the modern principle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of public law as existing in fact rather than of right , that I have been led to represent the antiquated principle as the one now in force . That this principle has been uniformly enforced by the United States , is also , in my opinion , a very hazardous assertion . That it has ever been enforced by them is a fact of which I was before ignorant ; but I willingly take for granted , that the reviewer has some authority for this statement . It vras certainly however not enforced in the revolutionary war . Mr Finckney observes in his note to lord Grenville of July 22 , 1793 , " In the last war , the Americans adopted and carried into effect the principle of free ships , free goods , to the advantage of British subjects , having actually liberated several British cargoes captured on board of neutral vessels . " * Nor has the ancient doctrine been uniformly maintained in theory by our government . On the contrary , the modern principle was confirmed by all their treaties previous to Mr Jay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this treaty that it sanctioned the attempt of Great Britain to restore , from motives of mere rapacity , the principle which she herself and every other christian power had just before agreed to alter . I know of no other treaty ever concluded by the United States , in which the antiquated doctrine is revived . A few dicta that fa*. vor it may be found in the correspondence of some of the persons employed in the government , about the time when Mr Jay 's treaty was concluded , particularly in that of Mr Pickering . Taking the state papers through , a far greater number will be found on the other side . The conclusion from the whole is , that the American government , instead of having uniformly enforced the ancient doctrine , have , on the contrary , uniformly enforced and maintained the modern one , excepting ix a single case when a different policy was enjoined upon them by strong reasons of state . ' * See the State papers , as quoted above . t The treaties with France , Holland , Prussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make free goods . Mr Jay 's treaty with England , which is the next in order , admits the contrary one . The former , however , appears again in the treaty with Spain concluded the next year , in the new treaty of 1800 with France , and in the late treaty with Sweden . In the new treaty with Prussia , negotiated by the present secretary of state , the article was not revived , but the whole subject was referred to a future negotiation , with an evident inclination however to the modern principle , and these are all the treaties , I believe , in which this matter is mentioned ; and if we consider the second treaty with Prussia as doubtful , there are seven authorities for the modern construction , and one only for the ancient . // We are mistaken , it seems , in supposing this writer to main tam that it was an unwarrantable pretension of England , to hold that enemy 's property on board of neutral ships is good prize . As an apology for this mistake , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretension of Great Britain , conveyed to us the impression that he thought it only a pretension , and not her clear right . The account given by him , in these very Notes , of the course of his reasoning in his work on Europe is as follows : After expressing my unqualified disapprobation of the rule of 1756 , and stating that the government entertained the same opinion of it , I observe that from motives of moderation and policy they had declined asserting , by violent measures , the full extent of their rights as a neutral power , but had acquiesced in such belligerent pretensions , as did not violate too directly the national honor and independence , giving as examples of this sort the rule of 1756 , and the claim to seize enemy 's property on board of neutral ships . ' This appears , even now , to be a pretty plain intimation that he considers the claim as violating in some sort , if not too directly , the national honor and independence , and as worthy to be ranked in this respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no violation of our national honor or independence at all , but a settled principle of the law of nations , and one which the United States uniformly enforce as such . The language of these Notes is so perfectly explicit , that we can not again be mistaken in supposing the writer to say that he was ignorant of the fact that this principle had ever been enforced by the United States  --  and that it was certainly not enforced in the revolutionary war-and , to conclude , that on the contrary , the United States have uniformly enforced and maintained a different doctrine , excepting in a single case . Our assertion , that this principle of the law of nations is uniformly enforced by the United States , was not and did not profess to be founded on the treaty of 1794 ; nor is the circumstance that several of our treaties contain a different provision any evidence against it . For though treaties often contain articles merely declaratory , this is not their only nor even their principal object , and therefore the insertion of any provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting parties deem it a part of the existing law of nations . it may // be merely the rule , by which they agree to regulate their intercourse with each other . This is still more apparent in the l ) resent case , from the consideration that the United States have , by different treaties , made different stipulations in relation to this subject . The treaty with Great Britain of 1794 declares the goods of enemies on hoard of neutral ships to be lawful prize . Our treaties with France , Sweden , and Holland stipulate that free ships shall make free goods , and that hostile ships shall make hostile goods ; in effect that the character of the ship shall in all cases determine that of the cargo . The treaty with Prussia of 1785 , and that with Spain of 1795 , provide simply that free ships shall make free goods , without establishing the converse , thus leavin0 neutral property on board an enemy 's ship exempt from capture . The treaty with Prussia of 1799 contains the following article Art . 12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of the treaty of 1785 , according to which free ships make free goods , has not been sufficiently respected during the two last wars , and espec*lly in that which still continues , the two contracting parties propose , after the return of a general peace , to agree either separately between themselves , or jointly with other powers alike interested , to concert with the great maritime powers of Europe such arrangements and such permanent principles , as may serve to consolidate the liberty and the safety of the neutral navigation and commerce in future wars . And if in the interval either of the contracting parties should be engaged in a war , to which the other should remain neutral , the ships of war and privateers of the belligerent power shall conduct themselves towards the merchant vessels of the neutral power , as favourably as the course of the war then existing may permit , observing the principles and rules of the laW of nations as generally acknowledged . ' Admitting this article to show an evident inclination to establish the rule that free ships make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think , an evident opinion that it was not already established , either by common practice , or by general acknowledgment . In the treaty with Spain of 1819 , it is agreed , that if either of the two contracting parties shall he at war with a third party and the other neutral , the flag of the neutral shall cover the property of enemies whose government // acknowledge this principle , and not of others :  --  a limitation sufficiently indicating that our government do not consider this principle to be a part of the law of nations , and as such uni* versally binding . In order then to determine what is the principle of public law enforced by the United States , we must inquire , not what stipulations are contained in their treaties , for these are various , but what is the rule applied by them to those nations , with whom they have made*no stipulation on the subject , and towards whom therefore they are bound to conduct themselves accordin * to the established law of nations . They uniformly condemn the goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their present practice , not of their past history . But the same rule was enforced during the greater part of the revolutionary war , and Mr Pinckney , in his note to Lord Grenville , did not mean to say the contrary . The well known fact , to which he alludes , is the publication of instructions to captains of armed vessels by Congress on the 7th of April , 1781 , prohibiting them from capturing enemies ' goods on board neiitral ships . These instructions were prepared in consequence of a secret vote of Congress adopting the principles of the armed neutrality , and remained in force till the close of the war . But the ordinance previously existing , and which they in effect repealed , authorized the capture of all vessels , goods , wares , and merchandises , belonging to the crown of Great Britain or its subjects , and such property found on board of neutral ships had always been condemned . The short interval between the publication of those instructions and the termination of hostilities , is the only period in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever adopted as law by the United States . Since that time , in all cases not otherwise provided for by express compact , the rule , that the goods of enemies found on board neutral ships are good prize , has been , and it still is , uniformly enforced by them . The passages in the state papers , showing that the United States maintain this rule to be a principle of the law of nations , are too much disparaged , when they are spoken of as a few dicta favoring it in the correspondence of some of the persons employed in the government . ' In July , 1793 , the French minister , M. Genet , addressed an official communication to Mr Jefferson , secretary of state , informing him that the property // of French citizens had been captured by the British on board merchant vessels of the United States , in violation of the principle that friendly vessels make friendly goods , and demanding that the government should assert its neutrality and require the property to be restored . The government refused to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24th of July , the whole object of which is to justify this refusal . I believe , ' says he , it can not be doubted but that , by the general law of nations , the goods of a friend found in the vessel of an enemy are free , and the goods of an enemy found in the vessel of a friend are lawful prize . Upon this principle , I presume , the British armed vessels have taken the property of French citizens found in our vessels , and I confess I should be at a loss on what principle to reclaim it . It is true , that sundry nations desirous of avoiding the inconveniences of having their vessels stopped at sea , ransacked , carried into port , and detained , under pretence of having enemies ' goods on board , have in many instances introduced , by their special treaties , another principle between them , that enemy bottoms shall make enemy goods , and friendly bottoms friendly goods ; a principle much less embarrassing to commerce , and equal to all parties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of particular treaty , controlling in special cases the general principle of the law of nations , and therefore taking effect between such nations only as have agreed so to control it. ** The letter of the same secretary to the American minister at Paris , on the 16th August following , is written with the greatest care , being intended as an official vindication of the conduct of the government towards M. Genet , and has been considered a model in diplomacy . It contains a formal argument in favor of the same position . 5 . Another source of complaint with M. Genet has been , that the English take French goods out of American vessels , which , he says , is against the law of nations , and ought to be prevented by us . On the contrary we suppose it to have been long an established principle of the law of nations , that the goods of a friend are free in an enemy 's vessel , and an enemy 's goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend . ' And speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * 1 Wait 's State pap . 110. // and enemy ships enemy goods , he adds , As far as it has been introduced it depends on the treaties stipulating it , and forms exceptions , in special cases , to the general operation of the law of nations. ** We suspect the assertion , that , taking the state papers through , a far greater number of passages will be found on the other side , to have been made inadvertently ; at least it has not been our fortune to find them . Mr Madison , in his instructions to our ministers in London , dated May 17 , 1806 , says , that the United States have not asserted the principle , that a neutral flag covers the property of an enemy , as the established law of nations , but they have ever been anxious to see it made a part of that law . ' t In the celebrated case of the Nereid , decided in 1815 , the opinion of the supreme court of the U. S. , delivered by Chief Justice Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods of an enemy found in the vessel of a friend , are prize of war , and that the goods of a friend , found in the vessel of an enemy , are to be restored , is believed to be a part of the original law of nations , as generally , perhaps universally acknowledged . Certainly it has been fully and unequivocally recognised by the United States . This rule is founded on the simple and intelligible principle , that war gives a full right to capture the goods of an enemy , but gives no right to capture the goods of a friend . ' - ' The character of the property , taken separately and distinctly from all other considerations , depends in no degree upon the character of the vehicle in which it is found . ' - ' The celebrated compact , called the armed neutrality , attempted to effect by force a great revolution in the law of nations . This attempt failed , but it made a deep and lasting impression on public sentiment . ' - ' From that epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been formed , some contain no article on the subject , and consequently leave the ancient rule in full force . Some stipulate that the character of the cargo shall depend upon the flag , some that the neutral flag shall protect the goods of an enemy , some that the goods of a neutral in the vessel of an enemy shall be prize of war ; and some that the goods of an enemy in a neutral bottom shall be safe , and that friendly goods in the bottom of an enemy shall also be safe . ' - ' The United* * I Wait 's State pap . 123. t * Wait 's State pap . 435. // States have in some treaties stipulated for both principles , in some for one of them only , in some that neutral bottoms shall make neutral goods , and that friendly goods shall be safe in the bottom of an enemy. ** The practice of the United States accords with their theory . In their late war with Great Britain , they invariably captured and condemned British property found on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty . If this is not enforcing the principle , we would fain learn what would be . If we thought with this author , that the doctrine of free ships free goods had become a settled principle of public law previously to the war of the French revolution , and that Great Britain had subsequently refused to acknowledge it , and not been followed in this refusal by the other powers , we should readily accede to the conclusion that , of right , this is still the law and we should venture to add , in fact also . But a brief reference to the history of this celebrated maxim will probably satisfy our readers that the premises of the argument are erroneous . The writer frankly admits , that the opposite rule was the settled law of nations in the middle of the seventeenth century . We were not aware that it was contained in most of the treaties concluded before that time ; but supposed it to have been deduced from the general principles regulating the rights of belligerents , and established by custom rather than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then the settled law , it must be deemed so now , unless it be proved that it has since been changed by the common consent or general practice of nations . The first systematic effort to introduce the rule , that free ships make free goods , into the treaties of Europe , was made in the middle of the seventeenth century by the Dutch , who connected with it the rule that hostile ships make hostile goods ; their doctrine being , in effect , that the character of the vessel should in all cases determine that of the cargo , and their apparent motive , to secure to themselves the carrying trade of the world ; for they were then at the height of their prosperity , and their policy was essentially neutral . This wa* the doctrine so often inserted afterwards in commercial trea .. ties until the year 1780 . The two maxims were connected *9 Crauch Rep. 418 to 421. // in substance though not always in form , and were represented , we say not how justly , as equivalents for each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1780 the empress of Russia published a declaration setting forth what she claimed to be the rights of neutrality , the most conspicuous of which was the rule of free ships free goods , and inviting the belligerents to recognise , and the neutral powers to join with her in forcibly maintaining them during the existing war . In the same year , Sweden and Denmark , although the ancient treaties between both those nations and Great Britain , then in force , contained the opposite rule , accepted her invitation , and formed with her the celebrated coalition , called the armed neutrality ; to which , in the following years and before the peace of 1783 , Holland , Prussia , Austria , Portugal , and the Sicilies acceded . The treaties , establishing this coalition , separated the maxims previously united , and declared that free ships make free goods , without admitting the converse , that hostile ships make hostile goods . Of the belligerents , France answered , that her existing ordinance established the rule of free ships free goods , and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctness of the principle , and would enforce it if England would ; and England , refusing to accede to it , declared she would maintain the existing law ofnations . The congress of the United States passed a vote , complimenting the empress , and adopting her principles , and appointed a minister to Russia with instructions to offer to establish them by treaty , either with the coalition generally , or with Russia or any other member of it , sagaciously considering that the acceptance of their offer would be a recognition of their independence . But the empress did not receive this minister . Many of the commercial treaties concluded between the end of the war in 1783 , to which time the armed neutrality was expressly limited , and the war of the French revolution , stipuJated for the observance either of the single rule maintained by that coalition , or the more ancient double maxim of free ships free goods , and hostile ships hostile goods . It was the latter which was contained in the treaty between England and France of 1786 . Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some of her treaties the one maxim , and in some the other . But it must not be imagined that any European // nation made either of these stipulations with all others , nor that every one made any stipulation on the subject . Hardly did the war of 1793 afford an opportunity for putting in practice these maxims in favor of neutrals , which had become so popular in theory , when they seem to have been generally abandoned . Russia , ' says Martens , made common cause with Great Britain and with Prussia , to induce Denmark and Sweden to renounce all intercourse with France , and especially to prohibit their carrying goods to that country . The incompatibility of this pretension with the principles established by Russia in 1780 , was veiled by the pretext that in a war like that against revolutionary France , the rights of neutrality did not come in question. ** France on her part ordered the capture and condemnation of the goods of her enemies found on board neutral vessels , without ex*cepting the vessels of those states , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denmark and Sweden declared themselves neutral , and entered into a convention to maintain their rights as such , according to existing treaties , and the established law of nations ; without intimating in it what they deemed that law to be in relation to this important subject . But the Danish proclamation of 1793 declares , that the principles of neutrality do not permit any neutral vessel to have on board articles , which belong to the states at war or their subjects.t The United States , as we have seen , en the application of France , formally refused to assert the right of sheltering her property under their flag from capture by the British . The article cited above from our treaty with Prussia , in 1799 , sufficiently shows how little the principle of free ships free goods was regarded up to that time , either in the existing or in the two preceding wars . In the year 1801 , Russia attempted to reestablish this doctrine , and for that purpose entered into a coalition with Denmark , Sweden , and Prussia , in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But England , considering this an act of hostility , attacked Copenhagen , and compelled Denmark to suspend a compliance with her engagements , and was proceeding to act against the other powers , when the emperor Paul was assassinated , and Alexander , immediately on ascending the throne , declared his willingness *2 Sup . au Rcc. 34*. t 5 Wheaton 's Rep. App. 75. // to enter into negotiation with Great Britain . The result of this negotiation was the celebrated treaty between the two powers of June , 1801 , expressly asserting the principle that the goods of enemies on board of neutral ships are lawful prize ; to which treaty Denmark and Sweden soon afterwards formally acceded . We are not aware that the advocates of the doctrine of free ships free goods , imagine that any event subsequent to this period has rendered it part of the law of nations . The several treaties , by which the coalition of 1780 and both the coalitions of 1801 were established , professed to be merely declaratory of the existing law . But even such treaties bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down a rule for the conduct of the parties towards each other , do not bind either of them to apply that rule to other nations . That most of the European treaties , which have provided that free ships should make free goods , whether accompanied by the converse or not , were intended in this respect to regulate the mutual intercouse of the parties , and not to be declaratory of the public law , is obvious from the circumstance , that the parties themselves at the same time enforced the opposite rule against those natiofls , with whom they had made no such treaty , and to whom they were therefore bound to apply what they understood to be the existing rules of international law . The numerous ordinances of France before 1778 , all declare the property of enemies found in neutral ships to be good prize . Great Britain at all times , and the United States , excepting during the two last years of the revolutionary war , have maintained the same rule . It is contained in the Swedish ordinance of 1715 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1780 . The ordinance of Denmark in 1659 , and her proclamation in 1793 declare it also . The Spanish ordinance of 1779 directs that British property in neutral vessels- should be captured and detained , to be dealt with , as the British should deal with Spanish property taken in similar circumstances , which was in fact to condemn it . On the other hand , it is provided by the French ordinance of 1778 , repealed in 1793 , and recstabiished in 1801 , that free ships shall make free goods , and by the Danish prize instruc-. lions of 1807 and 1810 , that free ship makes free goods // and hostile ship hostile goods . ' But , notwithstanding these or any other ordinances of the same import , of which however we have seen none , the fact that the several powers above named , during the existence of treaties , in which they had stipulated to observe the principle of free ships free goods , applied by their public ordinances a different one to cases not provided for by treaty , proves that they understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established rule , and not the rule itself , contracts binding between the parties and not mere declarations of the existing law . And after all , what is the principle contended for as being of right part of the law of nations ? Is it the single proposition of the armed neutrality , or the ancient double maxim of the Dutch ? Supposing that the doctrine of free ships free goods was an established rule before 1780 , how can it be denied that the converse maxim , which was till then its constant companion , and rested on the san:ie authority , was so likewise ? Is this now the law , or how and when was it abrogated ? On the other hand , supposing the doctrine of free ships free goods not to have been the law in 1780 , in what manner has it become so ? The treaties since concluded contain various stipulations , and surely it has not been sanctioned by general practice . Was it established by the armed neutrality ? But if this coalition had the right to establish , why had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeal it ? In our opinion neither of them had any such authority . We have no respect for the pretensions of these holy alliances of a few great nations to the right of making a law for others , as independent if not as powerful as themselves ; and when they mean to impose one by force and without right , they should be a little more nnited , consistent , and persevering in their efforts , than they have been in relation to this subject On / the whole , we see no sufficient evidence that the rule , which was the settled law in the middle of the seventeenth century , has since been abrogated or even unsettled by any competent authority . The only remaining passage in the article , ' proceeds the writer in his Notes , which I think myself called upon to notice , is the following : " A pamphlet has been recently published here to refute the assertion of this writer , that the United States acquiesced in the // rule of 1756 . We know of no acquiescence by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , they always protested against it , and compensation was demanded and received from the British government for the Amer*can vessels , which had been cap . tured and condemned by virtue of the rule . " The learned and ingenious reviewer seems to be rather delb cate in his notions as to what may be considered an acquiescence by the United States in a principle of public law . lie admits that they acquiesced in the rule that enemy 's property on board of neutral ships is good prize , although this doctrine is stipulated in only one treaty , and the contrary one in seven : and again , he denies that they sanctioned the rule which makes provisions contraband in certain cases , although it appears in terms in the very treaty , which in the other case he seems to consider so weighty as to overbalance the authority of all the rest . It may therefore be difficult to satisfy him that the government ever acquiesced in another rule , which certainly has not been admitted so freely or to the same extent as the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares himself not to be aware of any acquiescence in the rule of 1756 , is probably aware of the real state of the c-ise ; and the only question is , whether the word acquiescence is a correct description of the proceedings of the American government in regard to this rule . This is a point which I shall not insist upon very strenuously , if the reviewer is disposed to contest it . I shall content myself with stating the idea which I intended to convey by the term , and which I think is indicated by it with sufficient exactness in a composition , which , from its nature , can not be supposed to aim at the verbal exactness of special pleading . It is unquestionably true that the American government pro* tested against the rule of 1756 , when it was enforced by Great Britain in 1793 , and obtained compensation for the captures made under it . It is also true , that upon its revival , at the opening of the second war of the French revolution , they again protested against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is however , I apprehend , equally well known to all who are acquainted with the subject , that the government never made this point in their negotiations a sine qud non of peace , as they did some others ; for example , those of impressment and the orders in council of 1807 ; and that they did not regard the concession of it by England to the full extent of our claims as essential to the national honor and independence ; but were rather disposed to make it a matter of compromise and mutual agreement . Not to enter into a long detail of facts and authorities in reply to a summary assertion unsupported by any , I shall quote , in proof of this remark , a single passage // from a letter , written on the 17th of May , 1806 , by Mr Madison , then secretary of state , to Mr Monroe , then our minister at London , and employed in the negotiation of a treaty upon all the points in dispute between the countries. * " Particular care is to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of 1756 be expressly or virtually abandoned , as being no part of the law of nations . On the contrary , it is much to be desired that the general principle in its full extent be laid down in the stipulation . But as this may not be attainable , and as too much ought not to be sacrificed by an inflexible pursuit of abstract right , especially against the example and sentiments of great powers having concerns and interests with the United States , you are left at liberty , if found necessary , te abridge the right in practice , as is done in the supplement of October , 1801 , to the treaty of June of that year , between Russia and Great Britain . " I repeat , however , that I am not tenacious of the propriety of the word acquiescence as here used , and will cheerfully admit , if the reviewer and the author of the pamphlet desire it , that in the hasty and merely incidental allusion to this point , which I have made in a single line , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion the idea of a more full and direct admission of the rule than ever actually occurred . But I confess myself quite at a loss to conjecture how my reniark upon this subject , supposing it even to be erroneous , can be construed into a censure on the government of the United States . It is perfectly obvious , on the contrary , upon the slightest inspection of the passage , that I make the remark , honoris causd : and represent the conduct of the government as highly commendable and politic . After expressing my unqualified disapprobation of the rule of 1756 , and stating that the government entertained the same opinion of it , I observe that from motives of moderation and policy they had declined asserting , by violent measures , the full extent of their rights as a neutral power , but had acquiesced in such belligerent pretensions , as did not violate too directly the national honor and independence , giving as examples of this sort the rule of 1756 , and the claim to seize enemy 's property on board of neutral ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially correct , both as regards the facts in the case and the motives of the government . But whether correct or not , nobody can dispute that my language expresses approbation of the proceedings of the government , and not censure . ' // Those who recollect the repeated denials of the rule of 1756 , contained in our state papers , and the almost indignant language in which the government repel the insinuation that they had acquiesced in this among other belligerent pretensions , could not have expected from the author of Europe the assertion , however incidental , that they had done so. * He now states that , although the government protested against the rule , they did not obtain compensation for captures made under it after 1802 , nor make this point a sine qud non of peace , nor regard the concession of it to the full extent of our claims as essential to our national honor and independence ; but were disposed to make it a matter of compromise and mutual agreement , and that this is the conduct which he means to designate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contend with him about words , nor the slightest objection to his employing the term in this sense , but he must not he surprised that we mistook his meaning , until he informed us that he intended to affix to so common a word so unusual a signification . Even now , unless we misunderstand him again , we can not accord with him entirely in sentiment . The concession that his language might convey the idea of a more full and direct admission of the rule than ever actually occurred , implies , that in his opinion there was some sort of admission of it . Now we believe the government never admitted , but constantly denied the validity of the rule . Not to accumulate authorities , we refer to the very passage , which the writer has selected from the state papers to support his opinion . It enjoins the negotiator not to abandon our principle expressly or virtually , and expresses a strong desire that it be stipulated in its full extent , permitting him , however , if this can not be done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our principle in regard to this rule ? Mr Madison himself tells us in the same sentence . It is that neutrals may lawfully trade , with the exceptions of blockades and contraband , to and between all ports of an enemy , and in all articles , although the trade shall not have been open to them in time of peace ; ' a direct and absolute denial of the whole rule of 1756 , which is , that neutrals can not lawfully engage during * See Mr Madison 's letter to Mr Erskine of March 25 , 1806. 6 Wait 's State pap . 303 to 305 ; and the report of a *ommittee of congress of JNov. 22 , 1808. 6 Wait 's State pap . 41Q. // war in any trade not open to them in peace . Hence so far as any treaty should admit this rule , so far it would abandon our principle . If then the conclusion of the paragraph cited is taken to be an admission of the rule , it would seem to be a little at variance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of inconsistency . The passage , how .. ever , will appear perfectly clear and consistent , if we advert to the great and obvious distinction between admitting a rule , which declares that we have no right to carry on a trade in war not open in peace , and consenting by treaty to abridge our right in practice . In the one case we abandon the right , in the other we assert it , but agree to refrain from its full exer* cise . An admission of the validity of the rule concedes that belligerents have , by the law of nations , authority to prevent our engaging in such trade , an authority , which is of course perpetual , and can not be controlled or restrained without their consent ; while such authority , granted to a limited extent by express treaty , lasts no longer than the treaty , on which it is founded , and can not be prolonged or extended without ours . This distinction was repeatedly urged on our ministers . 1*It* Madison , in his instructions of January 13 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that we will refrain from trading directly between a belligerent nation and its colonies , provided the trade between those colonies and our ports shall not be interrupted , adds , but the president expects and enjojns , that you will be particularly careful to use such forms of expression , as will furnish no pretext for considering an exception of the direct trade between a belligerent nation and its colonies as declaratory of the neutral right , and not a positive stipulation founded on considerations of expediency . ' Our government in the same manner offered to agree , that we would refrain from exercising our right to employ British seamen in American ships , provided that no irnpressments should be made from them ; yet surely this was no acquiescence in the claim of impressment . We can not relinquish to the authority of this writer , highly as we respect it , our opinion that the right of the British house of lords to put a negative on all legislative acts , is a great and efficient power ; and that the division of our own legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , is a measure of much practical convenience and // utility ; but shall wait for the arguments , which he intimates an intention of publishing on these subjects , with the confident expectation of being instructed and delighted by them , and with no unwillingness to be convinced . The author thinks very naturally , that we ought to have given our hearty and unequivocal approbation to the improve*. meats suggested by him , and to have refrained from making any remark about extravagant and hopeless schemes , which could be supposed , from its connexion , to allude to his opinions . This seems to require that we should state more particularly the application of the single remark to which he alludes . In his work on Europe he says : If , at a future period , a serious attempt should be made , by a coalition , or in any other way , to remedy this evil , it would be highly expedient to strike at the root of it , and not to stop at the very unsatisfactory point , at which the coalition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently recommends the adoption of such a provision as was contained in our first treaty with Prussia , as conformable to the humane notions of the present age . We know not whether he means that this should be the first step , or only the ultimate object of those who wish to mitigate the existing laws of war ; but his language , we think , has a tendency to encourage the idea that it would be expedient to begin any serious attempt to remove the evil of which he complains , by striking at the root of it , and proposing a stipulation to abolish at once the practice of capturing the private property of enemies at sea . It seemed to us not irrel .. evant to oppose this idea , which his language obviously favors , without determining whether he intended to inculcate it or not , which we are even now unable to decide ; for , in our opinion , there is no reasonable ground to expect , that such a stipulation would be generally adopted in the present age , still less that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , which could at first be e*tablished and enforced , is one which stops short even of that of the armed neutrality , the rule inserted in our last treaty with Spain , that a neutral flag shall cover the property of those belligerents who allow it to cover the property of their enemies , and not of others , and that to begin by introducing this would be more likely to pro* * Europe , 407. 23 // duce a practical effect , than any attempt to set up a more indulgent principle . The willingness expressed by the United States to establish the perfect freedom of commerce , in time of war , is highly honorable to them , as evincing a liberal and benevolent policy , and the more so because it is entirely disinterested ; since it is very doubtful , to say the least , whether it would promote the immediate interests of this country to give security to the commerce of belligerents . But though the stipulation , contained in our first treaty with Prussia , is , on this account , highly creditable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience has shown , that there is little probability of its being soon established as part of the law of nations , and its omission in the second treaty is , in our opinion , no subject of regret . From the author 's repeatedly associating the claim of belligerents to seize the property of their enemies on board neutral vessels , as a pretension of England , with the rule of 1756 , and from his remarking that for these pretensions authorities more or less satisfactory were adduced from the laws and usages of the worst periods of European history , but whether the case of England was made out , even on grounds like these , is a question , which has not been settled and is hardly worth examining ; ' as well as from some other passages in his work on Europe , we certainly supposed that he questioned the validity of this claim ;  --  and that he questioned it on the ground of its unreasonableness , for he makes no other objection to it , and argues this at considerable length . The object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Notes from our review , was to prove the fallacy of this argument , by showing that it would lead to the extravagant conclusion , that war itself was contrary to the law of nations , since the author asserts , what we are not disposed to deny , that it is both unreasonable and cruel . So far then is the passage from ascribing to him , or to any one else , the strange heresy , that war is in fact contrary to the law of nations , that it supposes the proposition to be so absurd , that if it could be shown to follow from the argument which we understood him to adopt , this of itself would prove that argument erroneous . These Notes inform us that we were mistaken in supposing this right to he in any manner questioned ; but we trust the passages above referred to will be deemed a sufficient excuse for our mistake . We shall cite but one more passage from this pamphlet : // I can not , it is true , quite go the length which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for one nation or one individual to deny that an existing custom is reasonable ; nor do I believe that he is supported in this by good authorities . Vattel holds , on the contrary , that " if an established custom be wise and useful , or even indifferent , it ought to be considered obligatory : but that if it contains any thing unjust or illegal , it is of no force , and every nation is under an obligation to abandon it , as nothing can oblige or permit a nation to violate a natural law . " 3 , 7,112 . Here the obligation is placed on the other side , and a single nation , instead of having , as the reviewer states , no right to denounce an existing custom as unreasonable , is bound on the contrary to do so whenever it can be done with truth . This doctrine appears to be much more plausible than the other . And to bring the matter to a practical test , I take the liberty of asking the ingenious critic , whether the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade as inhuman and unreasonable , did what it is not for a single nation to do . Indeed , the reviewer himself does not seem to be very firm in the faith he professes upon this point , since he states immediately after , that any nation , desirous of changing an existing custom , may take the first steps toward this end by waving the right that accrues from such usage to itself , and thus setting an exam pleto others that may finally be followed by all . Now if he allows a single nation to do this , he would not probably refuse it the privilege of publishing its motives for so doing , which would necessarily amount to a denial , that the custom in question was reasonable . ' The author would not have ascribed to us the whimsical idea , which he so ingeniously refutes , that one nation or individual may not deny an existing custom to be reasonable , if he had not overlooked a few words , which were not intended to be unmeaning . Our remark , referring to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom is sufficient evidence that according to the common sentiment of mankind , it is reasonable ; and it is not for one individual or one nation to control all others by denying it . ' This expression and the whole context show that our object was merely to state , that no nation or individual could avoid its obligations to others or extend its rights over them ns established by the existing law , on the ground that the law was unreasonable ; and not to call in question the right of nations or individuals to govern their language and their conduct , not // affecting others , according to their own notions of rectitude , or to express freely whatever opinions they may be pleased to entertain . To answer the author 's ingenious question ; the nation , which first abandoned the slave trade and published it motives for so doing , did only what was its right and its duty . And the same may be said of the individual who first did so . But had that nation undertaken to control all others by its opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pirates , this would have been altogether incompatible with the principles of public law . It is very natural and excusable that this author should be peculiarly sensitive in regard to every expression , which he could imagine to charge him with speaking disrespectfully of the American government . We had no intention to cast any such imputation on him , nor do we think that our language imports any . Indeed we should be slow to forgive ourselves had we uttered a doubt of his respect for the government of his country , or of the ability and fidelity with which he has served it . NOTE . We forgot to refer above to the letter of Messrs Pinckney , Marshall , and Gerry , to the French minister of foreign affairs , dated January 27 , 1798 , in xxhich they argue at le%th in favor of the same construction of the 18th article of Jay 's treaty , hich we have adopted . The following extracts will give some idea of the course and the result of their reasoning. - ' The objections to this article shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation .
