txt ART . XVIII. -. - . Circulars addressed to the american members and patrons of the simerican . /Jcaderny of Language and Belles Lettres . By the Corresponding Secretary . THE second and third of three circulars of this kind are before us , and are more particularly within our view , in the few remarks we design to make . The newspapers of the day have informed the public of a project for an American Academy of language and belles lettres ; and the circulars , which have been published , contain an account of what has been done towards its organization , but consist principally of the correspondence between the corresponding secretary anj // various gentlemen of the highest respectability in our country , upon the general subject of the institution . We should fail in our duty to the public , did we omit to express our opinion of an institution coming forward with a name , and on a plan *o imposing ; and if our remarks should not command the ap* probation of the gentlemen who have been most active in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not he thought to exceed the limits of fair dissent . The American Academy , ' as appears from the second circular , was organized in June , 1821 , by the choice of a President ( the Secretary of State of the U. S. ) three Vice Presidents , a corresponding and a recording secretary , a treas-. urer and eleven counsellors , one only of whom is an inhabi*-tant of the state of New York . In addition to the names of the foregoing officei s , a list of twenty eight members resident at New York is given , a second list of corresponding members from the several states of the union , and a third list of foreign .. ers proposed as corresponding members . By whom proposed , or on what principle of selection , we have found ourselves , so far as concerns the last , much at a loss to conjecture. * * We can not but regard the following as an extraordinary explanation . ? The list of officers and members is furnished , as far as under present circumstances it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered only as an sspproximation to one strictly accurate . Our extensive territory , and the imperfect knowledge of the character of our scholars , as such , make it a work of time and much difficulty to obtain correct information , and to introduce the literary men of the United States to an acquaintance with each other . The proposal of such an institution was new , and many with the best wishes doubted its practicability Some , from motives of prudence , waited to see the completion of its arrangements and the list of its members , previous to committing themselves . The number of members who have in form been admitted and given their decided assent is between ninety and one hundred. * We call this extraordinary , on comparing it with the following version of the same passage in a second edition of the same circular . The list of officers and members is furnished , as far as under present cir* cumstances it can be made out : but that of the members is to be considered only as an approximation to one strictly accurate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of our scholars , as such , make it a work of time and much difficulty to obtain correct information , and to introduce the literary men of the United States to an acquaintance with each other . The proposal of such an institution was new , and many with the best wishes doubted its practicability . Sonic , from motives of prudence , waited to see the completion of its arrangements and the list of its members , previous to committing themselves . To some whose names are used it has not been convenient to communicate the requisite information . .11 few names are insertea* of candidates , who , from what is at present known , will be admitted . It is dsffi. cult to draw a perfect separating line under present circumstances . The number of members who have in form been admitted and given their decided assent , is between ninety and one hundred . ' // The doings of the Academy , as far as we are able to judge from the circulars , have been confined to the proposal of a premium of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written history of the United States , to serve as a class-book for academies and schools ; of a premium of $200 and a gold medal for a small volume of original reading lessons for common schools ; of a gold medal to be presented on behalf of the society to Mr Charles Botta , of Italy , in acknowledgment of his history of the American Revolution ; and of a premium of $400 and a gold medal for a popular treatise on natural philosophy or useful science . ' it should be added , that i ' * the last circular , it is stated that the more elaborate dissertations are reserved for the first regular volume of transactions , for which a few interesting papers are yet expected in time . ' It is also stated in the second circular , that the Rev. J. M. Mason , D. D. late provost of Columbia College , is chairman of a committee to collect throughout the United States a list of alleged Americanisms . With these premises , an extensive correspondence has been carried on , as it appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various members , selections from which are given in the third circular . The first remark which occurs to us on the subject of this academy , is , that , it is eminently entitled to the name bestowed by Louis XViII on one of his chambers of deputies , of the undiscoverable . We have bestowed some attention on the subject , with the design of rendering the institution whatever aid we could , if in no other way , at least , by making the public acquainted with the Academy 's proceedings , through the medium of our pages . We have been unable , however , to obtain any idea of what the Academy is designed to be . By a literary and scientific academy , we understand an association of learned men , in some great city , who at their meetings communicate to each other the fruits of their studies , in the form of memoirs , which are afterwards generally published ; and who associate with their body , under the name of corresponding or honorary members , distinguished intellectual characters in other places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new American academy , for , with the exception of a small list of resident members , the very great majority of officers and members are non-residents . This circumstance does not , it is true , create a total obstacle to assembling ; a member may travel from // Baltimore , Philadelphia , or Boston to New York ; though not very advantageously from New Orleans , Lexington , and Brunswick , at which several places , high functionaries of the Academy reside . Nor does it appear that any system of deputation is projected , by which n*onresident members shall meet at stated periods in some ca*1tal . It seems then to us , th*tt the first great requisite to a society , viz , associating , fails . The*m*mhers are not to meet each other : and in consequence can render each other no service , in capacity of being fellow members , or in otherwords , the academy will do no good . If it be replied to this , that the active portion of the academy is intended to consist of the resident members at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the usual complimentary way , we rejoin first , that this does not appear to he the fact . The president , two of the three vice presidents , and all the eleven counsellors are nonresidents . If these offices mean any thing , the active portion of th' society is not at New York ; if they do not mean any thing , why have them ? But on examining the contents of the circulars , we find a still further proof , that the academy is not intended ' to be a local academy , with nonresident associates . The ' *ohject of oirering a premium for a text-book of natural philosophy and useful science having been stated , page 10th of the second circular , it is added , this preamble and resolulion are proposed for consideration , ' and the opinions of mernbevs ttr* requested concerning their modification or adoption . ' Yet we perceive no possible way , in which opinions are to be collected throughout the union , hut by a correspondence ; and how any thing like literary stimulus and excitement can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cann*t imagine . Again , on the same page of the second circular , we read , At the last meeting of the Society , the following was proposed for consideration Res*d red , That a gold medal be presented , in behalf of this Society . to Signior CHARLES BOTTA , of Italy , author of the History of the American Revolution ; and that the lion . William Tilghrnan , Chief Justice of Pennsylvania , Langdon Cheve* , Esq . President of the Bank of the United States , and Robert Walsh , jun . Esq . be requested to procure and transmit the same . The reason offered for this procedure is , that it is just , creditable and politic to take an honorable notice of the man , who in // a foreign country and a foreign language , has , by a work of much merit , contributed to make our character more known and respected . ' Here we have an important procedure proposed as just , creditable , and politic , and to he conducted by three most respectable gentlemen . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We presume to the academy at large , who are to express their opinions , through the medium of correspondence . But we find in another copy of the same circular , a sort of second edition , though containing nearly the same matter , that the committee above named have approved the resolution and accepted the appointment . ' Here we are somewhat embarrassed . In both copies of the circular , it is said the medal for Mr Botta is proposed for consideration , hut in one of the copies , it is immediately added , that the committee have approved the resolution and accepted the appointment . The diflictdty is a little increased , by the consideration that the committee are all nonresidents . Now we ask merely for information , on the comparison of these premises , who is eom* petent to propose measures for consideration ? Who to consider and adopt them ? By whom was this medal considered and adopted , between the publication of the first and second editions of the second circular , and what is to be understood by a resolution which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the committee only nwirinated in the resolution , and when thus approved , the committee then accepting the appointment to a trust created by the resolution , of which their own previous approbation is the only sanction we can find . We beg not to be understood to express an objection to the measure in question : it is a matter of entire i*difference . We wish merely to authorize our remark , that the academy has no organization , or that it is impossible to discover what it is . To a literary society , on a reasonable and practical plan , we should certainly be very friendly . Did the men of science and letters of New-York see fit to associate themselves into an institution of this kind , ( though we think that it would be far better to employ their efforts* under the auspices of the respectable institutions , which already exist in that city , ) did they give the world , in the form of published memoirs , or in the proposal of premiums , or any other mode of academical operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite // sure that they would carry with them the good wishes of all friends of American literature , and of none more sincerely than ourselves . How much could be effected would depend altogether on the qualification and zeal of the members , and on what was effected would depend the estimation , in which the compliment of honorary membership would be held in other parts of this country and in Europe . But we feel little doubt that this is all that can reasonably be attempted , and we regard the entire failure of the American acadenhy , after three years ' experiment , even to propose an organized modus operandi , as satisfactory demonstration of the impossibility of the thing . It will be said , perhaps , that the mos$ respectable gentlemen in the country have given it their sanction , and we shall be pointed to the extracts and selections from their letters in the circular of the corresponding secretary . But t&amp;what have they given their sanction ? We say there is nothing to sanc*. tion . There is no academy ; there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operation , which body so operating these gentleman have sanctioned . It is a matter of course , that if a gentleman receives a polit* letter , telling him that he is chosen a member of the American Academy of Language and Belles Lettres , of which the secretary of state is president , and the judges of the supreme court are vice-presidents , ' that he will write as polite an answer , saying he accepts the honor . We can not but observe , however , the discretion with which some of these acceptances are expressed . Mr Mason of Portsmouth judiciously observes , that it is obvious that the usefulness of such an association must depend wholly on the talents , literary acquirements , and consequent public influence of the individuals who compose it . Without knowing who the individuals are , that are expected or intended to contribute to the association , I can form no definite opinion of the probability of its final success and usefulness . ' We would add , that it is not merely the talents and literary acquirements of the nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the degree , to which the organization of the academy will call their talents and acquirements into activity . The printed list of members comprises no small proportion of the respectability of our country . Great value would be attached to the opinion of almost any individual upon it , upon any subject , on which it should be expressed . And yet who knows of any influence of the American // Academy of Language and Belles Lettres over public opinion . We venture to say not half our readers ever heard of it . The letter of Mr Jay is also characterized by a discretion almost of that species , which in lighter matters is called sliness . I perceive that the prudence of pro*eeding circumspectly has not escaped their attention , and care will doubtless be taken , that the publications , made by their directi* and desire , be such as shall comport with the style and design of the academy . ' The letters , from which the foregoing extracts are made , and all the others , express abundant good wishes for the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in vain to pretend that their respectable writers bestoxv any specific sanction on any existing organization ; for , as we have repeated , no such organization exists . It might seem invidious to engage in the criticism of the materials which make up the circulars . The letters of most of the gentlemen , we presume not to have been intended for pub*-lication ; those of the corresponding secretary , which make up the greater portion of the pamphlets , appear to have been designed for that purpose . They are a series of essays on the community of language with England , on popular education , on national sentiment , and various other topics ; and they appear to be written by the motu proprio of the secretary , without any specific injunction of the society . Some of them are quite long , and appear to have been composed in an uncominonly zealous construction of the duties of a corresponding secretary . They contain many just remarks , but we must confess we do not regard them as very well written , nor calculated to impress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very high idea of the institution . They are by no means free from grammatical errors , and are vague and wordy . When the world , moreover , shall hear this institution ask , If the little territory of achaics , with scarcely any other advantage than merely being free , could so exalt the Athenian name , what ought the world to demand from this wide-spread country , with all its resources * it will be apt to conclude , that although an academy of language and belles lettres , it is not one of history or geography . We hope that no invidious construction will he put on any of our remarks or their general design . To every rational ef fort to promote the literary improvement of our country , none would contribute more heartily than we . Were the operations // of this society what they are repeatedly stated to be in the circulars , practical , prudent , unostentatious , we should not have a word to say . But a colossal organization of officers is displayed , a fund is collected , and vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high terms , without a single practical hint , that xve can fix on , or so much as the project of the plan , by which these objects are to be attained . There is in fact nothing wanting to this academical institution , hut the single fact of being an academy , and until something is done to make it one , we shall rest in the unpleasant conclusion that Mrs Glass , author of that renowned precept , first catch a turbot , ' has lived and written in vain . In the circulars hitherto issued , there is no suggestion or hint toward any thing like a meeting of the academy , nothing like a call on the president , vice-presidents and counsellors to assume their function , nothing like an indication to the corresponding members of the nature of the tribunal , which is to receive , act upon , reject or print their communications . In lieu of all this , we are told that the academy wishes to collect opinions , proceed slowly , and modify its progress by experience . But is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall meet or not meet ; whether its officers shall act or not act ; whether its members shall contribute or not contribute to the volumes of its transactions ? If all these things are to be ascertained by experience , then there is one other point also to be ascertained by experience , viz , whether the academy exists or does not exist ; and we can not but think the experience of the three years last past strongly in favor of the latter . In fact , the academy thus far resolves itself into a fund raised by contribution , from different parts of the United States , for printing a desultory , complimentary , formal correspondence . It is unnecessary to say , that the names of many of the gentlemen , whose letters are published , secure the public interest for whatever they are subscribed to ; but their letters form a small portion only of the pamphlets , and what the American Academy of Language and Belles Lettres has to do with the replies , which the corresponding secretary has been pleased , at great length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to know . Some of these letters are elaborate essays of eight finely printed octavo pages , which it requires much leisure or a strong sense of duty to write or read ; and by what warrant they are written , does not appear . Our little experience in learned societies has not // prepared us for this mode of performing the duty of a corresponding secretary . We understand that officer to be , charged WTith writing official letters on behalf and by order of their academy ; and the goodness of an official letter is commonly in inverse ratio to its length . We would not dwell unkindly on this , but that we are threatened *Ivith the continuance of the system . The third circular begins thus : - The following pamphlet , though a very imperfect work , will be in some degree a guide to the general views of the Academy of Language and Belles Lettres . It is not calculated for publication ; but to serve as a temporary basis , for farther expected communications , preparatory to a more full and formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters between members of an academy and the secretary , should be a ver* , i irnperftct work , we do not comprehend . We can think of no- ' thing human SQ easily made perfect , in its kind . But we suppose this qualification was dictated by the corresponding sacretary 's modesty , who felt that it was in name only an official correspondence , and in reality a series of essays of his own production . Were it not this , he could have no warrant so far to let diffidence of his own merit prevail over respect for his distinguished correspondents , as to call the pamphlet , consisting of their joint productions , a very imperfect work . ' It is then a production , and we take upon us to add , an unofficial production of the secretary . How then can it serve as a guide to the general views of the academy ? ' Does the secretary mean to say , with Louis XIV , l'academie , c'est moi ? If so , the corresponding members and the public may wish to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secretary was authorized , by the academy , to run into these weary dissertations . But all this is only a temporary basis for further expected communications . ' This circular is to be sent round , other letters invited , or selected from those received , more long answers , we presume , to be written , and the paniphlet now terminating at page 40 , in the middle of the letter of a gentleman , who is doubtless highly gratified with this new method of abridgment , will be continued to page 80 . And when these farther expected communications ' are received , what purpose is the whole to serve ? It is to be preparatory to a more full and formal production . ' By whom , and for whom , and about what , is this more full and formal production to be written ? Sonic eighty pages like ours have already been printed . This // is declared to be a temporary basis to farther expected corninunications , which , according to the usual proportions of a su* perstructure to its base , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparatory to a more full and formal production ; - on what subject and for what end is not hinted . If ( what we have no particular reason to suspe* , but as is commonly the case ) there is no secret history to these doings , which we , at a distance being uninitiated , can not get at , we are constrained to pronounce the whole enterprize one of the most signal displays of unprofitable fuss-making , we have ever witnessed . The circular immediately goes on to say ,  --  ' To some it may perhaps appcar that a more public and imposing display is unnecessarily delayed ( ! )  --  but from every consideration of lasting usefulness , it appeared more important that no wrong step should be taken , than that any specific amount of measureable labor should be performed in a given time . Those , towhom it has fallen to perform the humble task of pioneers , could not be less anxious than others , to witness the favorable result of their exertions ; but they would betray a great want of jud6ment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature and vain parade . ' Now what but parade , we are free to ask , has the society brought forth ? it is not a defence to say , that the objects , about which the corresponding secretary has written , are substantial ; that a national dictionary , a standard of language , a system of intercourse to transmit books from New-Orleans to Brunswick , London , and St Petersburg , that mental philosophy , * that national instruction , and we know not what else ; that these are solid , substantial objects . Wha will , what can the academy do , what has it begun to do , what has it undertaken to do , for any of them ? Nothing . It has only said , they would be fine things , if well done . This we apprehend was known before , and to nominate a vast faculty of officers , and publish an array of correspondence all over the union , for the purpose of asserting the importance of these objects , is empty parade . When the academy shall , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial objects , its own character will be substantial ; till then , the objects will remain substantial , the academy mere talk , Par levibus ventis volucrique simillinsa somno. * The attention of the society will be particularly called to the subject of mental philosophy .
