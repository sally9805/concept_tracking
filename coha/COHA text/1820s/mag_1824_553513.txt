txt ART . IX. - sl Year in Europe , comprising a Journal of Ob .. servations in England , Scotland , Ireland , France , Switzerland , the North of Italy , and Holland in 1818 and 1819 . By JOHN GuIscoM . Professor of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy in the New York Institution ; Member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of New York , &amp;c . New York , 1823. 2 vols. 8vo . PROFESSOR GRIscoM , who , as we learn from his book , belongs to the very respectable Society of Friends , seems to have visited Europe for the purpose of collecting informalion , that would be useful after his return home , and espe // daily such as relates to institutions in the old world destined to promote moral and intellectual culture . In this we think he has succeeded . We hardly know a work of equal size , that contains so many practical details and statements respecting those European establishments , which may now be rendered useful in our own practical country . And it is on this ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the information it brings to us . He landed at Liverpool on the 1st of May 1818 , and reembarked from the same port , on the 1st of May 1819 , to return home , having in the interval travelled through no small part of Great Britain and France , and some portions of Switzerland , Italy , and Holland , making his observations with great diligence , and generally with much skill and judgment . The first circumstance , that seems to have produced a very lively impression on him , was , his approach to London . Nor is this remarkable . No city in Christendom announces itself from so far ; or sends to such a distance the decided intimations of its extent and power . Twenty miles before its pin .. nacles and spires are visible , the black cloud of smoke and vapor that hangs over it , as a perpetual canopy , is seen to swell up in the horizon like the dark forms at sea , which sometimes announce the approach to a vast continent . Al .. most as far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stage coaches , of all sizes and forms , crowded with passengers on their tops , that make them seem instinct with life , hurry by in rapid succession , and the post chaises and equipages multiply to such numbers , that one not accustomed to calculate the wide influences of so great a city , can hardly persuade himself , that he is not already approaching its very suburbs . Some miles , however , before he is even so near as this , the numbers of everything moving begin to look like crowds , and soon afterwards the crowds fall into an almost incessant and uninterrupted stream . In the mean time , the roads and streets are growing wider and the shops more frequent , rich , and showy . The villages disappear , or rather become considerable towns ; and the towns are gradually changed into a continued succession of suburbs , through the midst of which , the astonished stranger hastens forward , until , driven perpetually onward by the unbroken torrent , he finds // himself borne , at last , into the endless multitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griscom employed himself , as he did almost everywhere , chiefly in inquiries touching public institutions . His remarks on most of them are valuable ; and , concerning some , particularly those devoted to benevolent purposes , he has given statements and details , that add much to the importance of his opinions . We were particularly struck with his notice of Mrs Fry , of whom we have heard so much , in relation to Prison Discipline ; but with whom we never felt so much acquainted , and the secret power of whose character was never so much opened to us , as in the following accounts of a visit to herself , at her house in the country , and a visit , under her direction , to Newgate . I had several times seen her prior to this visit , but only with a partial opportunity of estimating her character and worth . Her manners partake in a slight degree of the formality of one who perceives that she is treading in a new , and in some degree , an untried path . But impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of benevolence which she has undertaken to establish , and relying with entire confidence on the correctness of those principles , and on the spirit and motives which animate her in the discharge of those high and solemn duties , she moves on with a blended dignity and sweetncss ,  --  a loftiness of purpose , and a christian meekness combined , which I have rarely , if ever , seen equalled in man or woman . The success and the fame of her efforts , have attracted around her a numerous circle of the highest orders of society , in rank and influence , who are desirous of her acquaintance , and of an introduction by her to those apartments in the prison in which the effects of her labors are so conspicuous . They universal plaudits of her numerous and titled visitors and acquaintance , have no effect upon the simple and plain habits of the " Friend ; " and divert her not from pursuing , with patience and mildness , the enlightened path , which her conscience approves . She appears to understand too well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her affections , and to draw her mind and heart from that humility and dedication , which are the real basis of her success and usefulness . She is a preacher in the society of which she is a member . I have several times heard her , and always to my satisfaction . She has nine children , and performs towards them the duties of a most affectionate and enlightened parent . The secret of her government at home , as // well as in her sphere of benefactress to the wretched outcasts of society , is christian love . Their situation in the country is pleasant-They have a good house , finely cultivated grounds , a grove with winding gravelled walks , a fruit garden , &amp;c. but her services in the city require her residence in town , during much of the year . 11cr person is tall and dignified . her physiognomy , open and intelligent ; and , though it would not be accounted handsome , it is by no means the reverse . There is an expression of grace and kindness in it , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' vol , i. pp. 28 , 29 . I had the pleasure , this morning , of visiting Newgate prison , at the invitation of Elizabeth Fry . A number of strangers , among whom were several foreigners , were also present . The prisoners , upon ocr being admitted by the turnkey , were as quiet and orderly as are the laborers in a common manufactory . Habituated to the entrance of strangers , almost daily , since the late reform , they are no longer disturbed by it , but attend to their labors without much interruption . In one small apartment , a school was kept by one of the prisoners , in which a number of children , whose mothers were within tbe walls for various crimes , were taught to spell and read . There was a modest diffidence in the air of their young mistress , which could hardly fail to excite the sympathy of every visitor . The prisoners are provided with work , according to their capacity , consisting , principally , of knitting and sewing . Various articles of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very neatly made by them , are kept for sale , and find a ready market in the company , whom humanity and curiosity attract to the prison . At an appointed hour the women were collected in one room , and after being quietly seated , , and remaining for a few minutes in stillness , their excellent benefactress opened the Bible , and read to them one or two chapters , judiciously selected for the occasion . The tone of her voice , her enunciation and emphasis , particularly when she reads the Scriptures , are so peculiarly impressive , as to command the attention of all her auditors . Many persons of taste and learning , who have witnessed her exercises on these occasions , have acknowledged , I have been told , that they had never heard the Bible so well read before . She frequently comments upon the passages she has read , with a feeling which gains the whole attention of the wretched class which she addresses . her exhortations , though pointed and close , are clothed in such a spirit of love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of whom , in all probability , had never heard the language of christian kindness addressed to them before . Their demeanor , while thus collected , had nothing of that almost ferocious boldness , and contempt // for everything serious , which marked their conduct when this humane enterprise was first undertaken . There was a mixture of shame , sorrow , and reserve , in their countenances , which proved that better feelings had taken possession of their minds . The keepers of the prison speak of the reformation with astonishment ; and every visitor retires with admiration , at the proof which this eminent example affords , of the benign and resistless efficacy of the Gospel spirit , over the most corrupt passions and habits of human nature . ' vol. i. pp. 132 , 133 . Mrs Fry is certainly one of the distinguished persons of our time ; and her success , in the extraordinary form of benevolence , to which she has devoted herself , is now sufficient to show , that its beneficial results will be permanent . She began her labors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for the improvenient of the women confined in Newgate . Perhaps , nothing of the kind was ever undertaken with so little prospect of success . Perhaps , there never was a more deplorable and disgusting scene of squalid misery , of quarrelling , of blasphemy , and of shameless indecency , than the one to which she was led . The wise , the good , and the efficient had been there before her ; and had brought nothing to pass . They , therefore , did well , when they told her , she would certainly fail ; for everything within their own experience , fully justified them in the melancholy foreboding . But she could not be deterred . She felt within her that , of which we have a glimpse in the description , we have just cited , of her person and manners , as well as of her conversation and spirit ; and she knew , that , even in a final failure , she could not be entirely defeated . The event has proved she was right . She has gone on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only brought order , neatness , and industry among the wretched female convicts at Newgate , but by her influence , and , ge-. erally , under her personal direction , her system has been extended to several , and , we believe , most of the prisons in England and Scotland , where it was most needed . The result has been everywhere the same , and the last accounts that have reached us , dated only a few months since , and given by one well fitted to judge with impartiality and skill , have more than confirmed the hopes excited by those that had preceded them . // Yet nothing can be more simple than the means Mrs Fry has employed to effect this great good ; for , excepting the moral persuasion of her own character , sacrifices and example , which we are disposed to rate very high , she has done almost nothing but furnish the prisoners with regular and constant occupation , and give them the humble instructions suited to their debased ignorance . She has , in short , banished idleness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what renders guilt odious and contaminating . She has done a great deal to prevent the English prisons from being any longer well organized schools of vice and misery , sending forth , every year , multitudes to spread the contagion of guilt through a community , whose very remedies for it had , until lately , but exasperated the disease . In this subject , however , we have , from many causes , a strong interest on our side of the Atlantic . The Philadelphia Penitentiary is the oldest prison , that attempted , by practicable and easy means , or with any considerable degree of success , to reform its convicts by giving them occupation , and interesting them in their own amendment . The Duke de la Rochefaucault , who is now at the head of the national arrangements for prison reform in France , said , nearly thirty years ago , in relation to this establishment , May the new continent , accustomed to receive from Europe that illumination , which her youth and inexperience require , serve in her turn to establish a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes have been partly fulfilled . The Philadelphia system begun , like Mrs Fry 's , almost entirely by the Friends , has had its influence in Europe , and will have yet more hereafter . In the mean time , however , it becomes us to see what have been its effects at home . Crime , it is true , is neither so gross nor so obtrusive here , as it is in most parts of Europe ; but our neglect may in time make it so . We have now nega* tive , as well as positive example before us , and we shall incur a heavy responsibility , and meet a melancholy retribution from posterity , if , neglecting to profit by it , we suffer the old system of imprisonment to go on accumulating guilt and misery , which , though little felt by us , will prove , at last , one of the most deplorable curses we could have entailed upon our children . There is another subject very interesting in the present sate of our country , on which valuable information is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we mean , of Free Schools , taught on what is often called the Lancastrian system ; but , what ought to be called the system of Mutual or Monitorial Instruction . There has been much angry discussion about the author of this improvement ; but the important facts admit of no question . It was first practised at Egmore , near Madras , by Dr Bell , an English clergyman connected with the East India Establishment , who , between 1789 and 1797 , gave it a pretty fair experiment on about two hundred boys . His peculiar arrangements were , in part , suggested by modes of instruction which he found in use among the natives , to whom he was , in particular , indebted for the very important hint to teach children , at once both to read and write , by teaching them to begin with copying the alphabet in sand . The main merit , however , of combining the whole into an effective system is due to his own practical good sense and diligent benevolence , and he would probably have carried it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in 1797 . In consequence of this , he returned to England , and , in the same year , published a small volume , giving a detailed statement of what he had effected ; but did nothing more towards introducing his system into his native country . From this time , however , Joseph Lancaster , an active Friend , who was for some years zealously supported by his own Society , and therefore had great facilities for success , began to practise mutual instruction . He adopted the whole of Dr Bell 's method ; added to it a considerable number of details , which , by making it more mechanical , enabled one instructer to manage a greater number of pupils ; made his first publication on the subject in 1803 ; and very soon obtained a great reputation both for the system and himself , making it so famous and useful throughout England and Ireland , that , since the peace of 1812 , it has been diffused over many parts of the continent , and is now in active operation in Russia , France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it employs the more advanced pupils to teach those least advanced ; that it sustains the attention of all more uniformly and vigorously by keeping all constantly under the examination and supervision of these numerous young teachers ; that it excite* // a more useful and efficient emulation , by giving instant rewards and punishments for success and misconduct ; and that , by all its arrangements , it much diminishes the expense of education , and therefore renders this great principle of moral life in a community accessible to greater numbers , on easier terms , and in a higher degree , than it ever was before . How far the system of mutual instruction can be carried , we do not yet know . It is still very young . Twenty years have hardly elapsed since it was first heard of in Europe , and there is no reason to believe , it is yet developed in nearly all its powers and proportions . Thus far it has been chiefly applied to instructing the lower classes of society in the humblest elements of knowledge , because here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most easily and effectually administered . It has , however , in some instances , gone much farther . Monitors are already known under different names in not a few large schools in New England ; and in the National Institution at West Point , under the management of Colonel Thayer , which would do honor to any country , a. considerable and very important portion of the instruction is given by the more distinguished pupils . But , perhaps , the most striking instance of its application to the higher branches of knowledge , which has thus far been made , is in the High School at Edinburgh , where it was introduced by the late Rector , Dr Pillans , now Professor in the University of Edinburgh ; and where a successful experiment of thirteen years in teaching Latin , Greek , Geography , several branches of Mathematics , some of the physical sciences , and , in short , whatever is suitable to be taught to boys under sixteen , can leave no doubt that the system of mutual instruction may be usefully applied to the higher as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griscom 's account of this school , which is well known , as one of the most valuable in Europe , is not so minute as would have been interesting ; but it is very satisfactory , as to the general results obtained . C This grammar school is of ancient standing , and like the university , it is under the direction of the magistrates of the city . It dates an existence of nearly three hundred years , but the present building was erected in 1777 . It is one hundred and twenty feet long . The number of scholars is at present between eight and // nine hundred . Four teachers are employed in addition to the rector . This gentleman , by the effort of a particular genius , and indefatigable activity , has completely succeeded in introducing into this large school , the system of monitorial instruction , and applying it to classical learning . He has under his exclusive charge , twenty three classes , each containing nine boys . Every class has its monitor , who hears the rest recite . They occupy three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rector superintends the whole , and decides all questions of dispute , when appeals are made to him against the decision of the monitors . In each room is a custos morum , who watches the behavior of the scholars and notes every instance of remissness . Almost the only punishment resorted to , is the imposing of additional tasks on offenders , and obliging them to attend the school , during the hours and half days of ordinary vacation . The twenty three classes all recite the same lesson at the same time . The noise they make is unavoidably great , . but it is the sound of useful activity . We were highly grati .. fied with the evidences of intelligence and attainment , which the boys displayed when collected into one room , and examined before us by the rector . The superiority of their instruction appeared not only in the facility of their translations , but in the readiness with which they recited parallel passages , and referred to the illustrations of different classical , authors , and in their acquaintance with the geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given them as extemporaneous exercises . Great merit is obviously due to the rector , for bringing this method of teaching so perfectly to bear upon the higher parts of education , and showing ifs adaptation to subjects which have generally been thought beyond its reach . The I-ugh School contains a good library for the benefit of the teachers and boys of the upper class . The whole cost of tuition in this excellent school , is but three pounds per annum , including the use of the library . There are few boys in the school above sixteen years of age , a period which leaves them sufficient time for apprenticeship to almost any kind of business . With such advantages of intellectual and moral instruction , is it surprising that Scotland should have taken such an elevated stand among the nations , for the intelligence , industry and sobriety of her people ? The very flourishing condition of the High School of Edinburgh , in which about nine hundred boys are taught by four masters and a rector , afforded , to my mind , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excellence of the monitorial system , when applied to any or all of the exercises of a superior grammar school . The public , in all the large cities of England , Scotland , and the United States , have long since been convinced , that this system is of inestimable importance in the education of the lower classes ; and because it has been adopted chiefly in the Frec // Schools , many persons seem to have drawn the illogical conclusion , that it is not adapted to higher seminaries , or to the instruction of boys in the more elevated parts of learning . The example of the High School has clearly shown the error of this opinion . By the partial employment of this easy and pleasant mode of instruction , the rector of the High School , ( since chosen professor of humanity in the university , ) was able , as he informed me , to manage his two hundred and seven boys with more facility , than he could have taught one hundred upon the old plan , and with greater efficiency . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be communicated through the monitors . Such parts only of the recitations are confided to them , as it is ascertained , that they are fully competent to attend to ; much of the time , ( probably one half , ) is spent by the rector in explanations and examinations before the whole school . By this judicious course of proceeding , a high degree of emulation is excited , habits of great industry and activity are maintained , and an education of the best kind is afforded at about one third of the cost of the ordinary grammar schools of our cites . So well convinced are the citizens of Edinburgh of the advantages of this plan of instruction , they have under considerat-ion the establishment of a High School in the new town , in which provision is to be made for the more complete introduction of the monitorial system . ' vol. ii . 334-336 . It is well worth consideration , how far a system so thorough and effectual can be introduced into our own large cities , where , in some cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviest , though our proudest burden . From a comparison of the preceding statement with well known facts it appears , that the city of Boston , which makes , we doubt not , in proportion to its means , a more honorable exertion for the instruction of its own community , and is rewarded by a more excellent success , than any other city of equal size in the world , pays at least twice as much for the instruction of a boy at its admirable Latin School , as is paid . for the instruction of a boy at the High School , in the more expensive city of Edinburgh , where the Head-master receives , if we mistake not , a salary very much larger than that afforded to any teacher in the United States . But this view of the case , which applies with more or less force to very large portions of our country , is not the strongest . The future must be looked to as well as the present . The demand for instruction increases every year , as we trust it long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses are built , and // new teachers put in requisition to meet it . But we fear there is a point , where the expense of the common system will be found too heavy , even for the wisest and most generous communities , and that it will , at last , be necessary either to give up that constant advancement in the higher branches , which has of late so honorably raised the standard of education among us , or else to make some change in the system and mode of instruction , which will ensure the permanency and improvement of what we all regard as the very first benefit of our political institutions . It is , therefore , a matter of serious concern to those , who have the management of public instruction in our large cities and towns , to inquire , how far it can be improved , and not only improved but raised , by adopting , according to the particular circumstances of each case , some portions of the system of Mutual Instruction , which may enable them to effect more than has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed , or of the burdens now imposed . Professor Griscom , whom few useful inventions seem to have escaped , speaks also of Lithography , a cheap and beautiful substitute for engraving , which has been known about twenty years in Europe , where it is already of Vast and growing importance in the arts , and which quite recently has been a little practised in the United States . It was discovered , under rather singular circumstances , by Aloys Senne-. felder , who was born at Prague in 1772 , and educated at Munich , where his father was long an actor of some reputation on the public theatre . He was first sent to the viniversity of Ingolstadt , where he studied law , and afterwards , while yet very young , wrote several pieces for the stage , which were well received . But he was suddenly stopped in his literary career at the age of twenty , by the death of his father , who left a family consisting of a widow and nine children , all in great want . Aloys was the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them from immediate suffering . lie asked for a very humble place in the custom house , and was refused . He offered himself for the military service and was rejected , because he was not a native Bavarian . At last , he resorted to cheinical experiments in dyeing , and here , too , failed , as lie se ? med destined to fail in everything . // 1S24 . Lithography . One day , however , as he was walking alone near Munich , in the melancholy mood , which his desperate affairs might well inspire , he chanced to take up a piece of limestone , one of the compact carbonates , and cutting into it from mere idleness with his penknife , it occurred to him , that , for musical printing and similar work , it might be employed instead of wood and type metal-an improvement , which he thought would be important , because the portions to be taken off in order to procure the necessary relief could be so easily removed by an acid . He pursued this thought soon afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stone , but in the block method . While , however , he was engaged in this experiment , he observed one day , that the parts of the stone which had been touched with acid refused to receive ink , even in the slightest degree ; and this led him at once very naturally to the conclusion , that these portions did not need to be removed ; but that it would be sufficient for his purpose to touch them with a weak solution of acid , after the portions from which it was intended to obtain the impression , should be covered with some oily matter . This was in the year 1796 , and this is the substance of the invention of Lithography , which consists in taking a compact carbonate of lime , making it perfectly smooth , covering with some oily matter , usually made by the addition of wax into the form of a crayon , the design to be struck off , wetting it freely with a weak solution of acid , which will not at all effect the drawing , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copy by pressure . Patents were obtained for this invention in Munich in the year 1800 , and in both London and Vienna in 1802 . But still little or nothing was attempted , except to print music , copy books for children , and other similar and inconsiderable works . In 1804 , we believe , the first efforts were made in landscape designs . This was the decisive step , and from this time it has gone on in a rapid course of improvement and extension , Within ten or twelve years , it has been much known out of Germany . Count Lasteyrie , the son in law of La Fayette , and the same person who introduced merino sheep into France , and who has done so much for popular education , went to Munich in 1814 and in 1816 , for the express purpose of transporting this beautiful invention to // Jan . Paris , and succeeded . Engelmann , a German , who is among those that have improved the art , resorted also to Paris in 1816 . Since that time another German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same capital . W. Westall has lately adopted it in England , and published some beautiful sketches for the first volume of Southey 's Peninsular War ; and in Russia , it has been so long established , that several of the Lithographers of St Petersburg are already well known to collectors throughout Europe . The following short account from Professor Griscom , of Count Lasteyrie 's method , will show how far the art was advan .. ced in 1818 ; but it has made considerable progress since . We also called on Count Lasteyrie , who is likewise distinguished for his philanthropic efforts in the cause of education , and for his ingenious and persevering endeavors to introduce the art of printing on stone . He politely conducted us to his Lithographic rooms , where we saw the operation of smoothing the stone , putting on the colors , sponging , inking , and printing . The stone is a compact carbonate of lime , of a close texture . After it has received the requisite polish , the figure or character is laid on with a pencil dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus effected of the object to be represented . The stone being then placed in the frame of the press , a sponge , dipped in water , is several times passed over it , and the ink is put on , by pressing upon the stone a soft substance , charged with it , much in the same manner as that practised with common types . But the ink adheres to no part of the surface which is thoroughly wet , and of course it is only that part which has been previously covered with the paint that takes the ink , and produces the impression , when covered with paper , and subjected to the press . ' vol. i. 2*8 . How far this very simple and beautiful invention may be extended , we have not yet experience enough to determine with any considerable degree of probability . But its past history and success are so remarkable , that we can not help anticipating much from its future progress . It has already been applied with more or less advantage , wherever the methods on copper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the misty indistinctness of a remote background can even now be represented by it to more striking effect than in any other way ; and quite recently we have seen a large series of portraits of distinguished Frenchmen , executed with a degree of success , that seems to remove // the limits , which have usually been assigned to the art . Every year , indeed , of the last seven or eight , has brought with it some striking improvement in the management of lithography ; and we are therefore rejoiced to find an effort now making to give it currency in our own country , where it can so easily be made useful and important . We do not indeed believe that it will , either here or anywhere else , supersede a method , which has produced such masters as have engraved on copper from Marco Antonio to Morghen ; yet , as it is probably nine hundred per cent cheaper , the temptation to exertion is almost indefinite ; and , as its progress during the few years of its existence has been so rapid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period yet to come we shall witness a corresponding increase in its delicacy , depth and spirit . Another very interesting subject , and one of those that occur most frequently in Professor Griscom 's book , is that of Hospitals , and many valuable facts concerning their management will be found scattered through it , as he from time to time visited them . Perhaps , the most remarkable account he has given of this kind is that of the Saltpetri*re near Paris , ( Vol . II . 58-63 , ) which contains within itself a population nearly equal to that of the whole town of Newburyport ; and has , of course arrangements for their nourishment , clothing and care , on the most gigantic scale . But we can not follow this excellent philanthropist through these and many more of his details , which have gratified and instructed us . Yet , we can not leave him without saying , that perhaps no parts of his work will be read with more pleasure , than his accounts of Fellenberg 's school , ( Vol . I. 382-401 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 415-421 , ) and of the singular establishment of Owen of Lanark , ( Vol . II . 375-393 , ) three institutions , which are intended to raise the character of popular and general education and manners , and which are conducted with great spirit , enthusiasm and success , on principles so different as to be almost opposite and inconsistent . Professor Griscom seems to have gone to Europe in order to be able more effectually to do good , after his return home . His book , therefore , is simply a useful book , rendered very interesting by its relation to the present state of our own country . its literary execution is not remarkably good* // Its notices of society and manners are necessarily superficial and imperfect ; and the accounts of individuals are sometimes more free , perhaps , than they themselves would think judicious . But , there is nothing in it to gratify scandal or spleen ; no exhibition or excitement of party feelings and passions in religion or politics , or anything else . It is chiefly filled with accounts of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hospitals , public schools , and other similar establishments , which he visited ; and consists , therefore , in a great measure , of what may be called the statistics of the benevolent and useful institutions , by which misery and guilt are diminished* and knowledge and power diffused in Europe . It is a book , which , in all respects , does credit to its author , as a member of the Society of Friends , and can , therefore , hardly fail of being interesting and useful to the public .
