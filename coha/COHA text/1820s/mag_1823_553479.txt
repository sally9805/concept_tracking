txt ART . XVI. - iEssays on Fevers , and other Medical Subjects , by Thomas Miner , M. D. and William Tully , JJ'L B. Middietown , Connecticut , 1823 . Life is short , the art is long , occasion sudden , experiment dangerous , judgment difficult , ' was the aphorism of the father of physic , which the experience of more than two thousand years has abundantly confirmed . The science of medicine , though among the most interesting to mankind , attracting , in all ages , the attention of all , and cultivated with nearly equal zeal hy civilized and savage man , by the peasant and the philosopher , has advanced with a progress apparently little creditable to their united efforts , disappointing the benevolence of the philanthropist , and mortifying the pride of human nature . The pages of its history are too frequently the records of folly , su* perstition , and crime . There is scarcely a substance so virulent , disgusting , or insignificant , as never to have found a place in the materia medica , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an advocate among the countless multitude , who have been infected with the cacoethes medendi . The decrees of the empire and the thunders of Rome have been enlisted in defence of bleeding from a favorite vein ; and the followers of Galen , in the enthusiasm of their wrath against innovation , did not hesitate to declare that they had rather be wrong with their master , than right with Paracelsus. // With so much of evil , however , some good is intermixed ; and he who loves his brethren with all their vices and follies , and prefers to fix his eye on the bright side of human nature , is gratified to perceive , that the proportion of the good is much more considerable , than is at first apparent . If the profession of medicine has been disgraced by hot-headed zealots , compelling , by loud nonsense and arrogant dogmatism , that regard which is often refused to real merit , it has also given to the world a multitude of benefactors , whose services attract litth* attention , because they are met with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical skill and learning were united in the character of Paracelsus with every vice , in those of Boerhaave , Cullen , Heberden , and Rush , they were accompanied with an unusual share of the virtues of humanity . If the doctrines have been often extravagant , their evil tendency has as often been counteracted by the plain sense and caution of actual practitioners . If too many of the articles of the materia medica are useless , they are also harmless . While the most violent and dangerous produce , in prudent hands , the most beneficial results , if they sometimes do harm in those haz-* ardous cases , in which they are most likely to be employed , surely the restoration of health or preservation of life is well worth some of that risk , which we are every day wilfully in. curring , for much less important considerations . When we compare the actual state of medicine at different and distant periods , it is encouraging to perceive that its advancement however slow , is yet certain . Some of the harsh and dangerous medicaments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst others are altogether superseded by articles , which possess all their good , without their evil quali .. ties . Modern dexterity and knowledge of anatomy frequently accomplish , with little pain and trouble , what the ancients could only effect by torturing force . The frequent and periodical plagues of London are now only matters of history , and few in this country have ever seen more of the small-pox , than the indelible marks , which its ravages imprinted on the countenances of their parents . This science has had its share in the good effects of that zeal for improvement and diffusion of knowledge , which has been so generally prevailing in Europe and America for the last half century . Its advancement , to be sure , is not to be // compared with that of its sister sciences . Its progress is still slow , and from the nature of the case , it always must be ; but it has been so much accelerated by these circumstances , that it may be asserted without much hyperbole that it has been greater , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes . It must be admitted that physicians are not , yet , able in all cases , to supply an organ or a member which nature has denied , or accident destroyed-they can not restore to the stomach , with a single miraculous pill , the tone which years of intemperance have impaired ; they have no bark which can give to female delicacy of muscle , the vigour of the peasant 's arm , ' nor any preparation which can expand the chest , or extract the tubercles from the lungs , of hereditary consumption . In short they are unable , as yet , to satisfy many very reasonable expectations of their patients . But let them not despair or any thing , in an age which has seen the successful revival of the scheme of Taliacotius , and supplemental noses , ' which are no longer fabulous . These remarks have been suggested by the perusal of the work which is the subject of the present article , and of which we feel ourselves called upon , as the friends of truth and justice , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this we are unconscious of being actuated by any prejudice or partiality . We have no medical system to support or overthrow . We are wedded neither to the lancet and hot water on the one hand , nor to opium and brandy toddy on the other . We believe in all , or either , in their proper times and places , and are ready to admit that there is a proper time and place for each . Moreover , we have no private grudge or malic6 against the authors of these essays . Of Dr Miner , we declare , even at the risk of arguing ourselves unknown , that we know nothing except his book , nor ever saw his name but on its pages . Of Dr Tully we have heard elsewhere , and always as a physician of skill and reputation . Neither shall we pretend to give any nice analysis of the particular mode of practice which they recommend , considering that as the province of works devoted more particularly to the subject of medicine . Our business is rather with the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it which relate to matters of which many of the community at large are competent judges-though we may now and then be tempted to // hazard an observation upon such more strictly professional passages , as seem to us remarkable . We conceive , that the tendency of these Essays is in a high degree injurious , both to the members of the profession and to the community ; to the profession , by depriving them of that public confidence which is essential to their success , their reputation , their very livelihood ; to the community by giving them false ideas of the practice of physic , teaching them to regard with suspicion the best concerted means for their recovery or preservation from disease , and adding new and un .. necessary terrors to some of the unavoidable calamities of life . Not that we fear , that such effects will really be produced , or at least extensively . The authors deal too much in assertion to be very convincing to that class of readers who are most likely to peruse their work . But the attempt is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed* It is time , however , that Dr Miner should be permitted to speak for himself . The following extract is from the preface . It is of immense importance , that the present confusion of the practice of physic , in the treatment of acute febrile diseases should be known . The quantity of extraneous matter , with which it has been encumbered , during the last fifteen years , is immense . Some author is needed of so much independence of mind , that he is not afraid to hazard his popularity , by publishing a true statement of the most important facts . Should it be thought , that he has vindicated the cause of TRUTH and HUMANITY* with a degree of zeal and ardour , bordering on asperity , he has only to observe , that he can make no apology . When he finds it asserted , on the a**thority of the highest names , that the Bark is rarely serviceable in our fevers ; - that blisters to the head are of no use in typhoid affections of the brain ; that opium , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausti&amp;i is inadmissible ; that the mercurial action , when moderately excited during the preparatory stage , is of no other service , than as a test of the natural mildness of the disease ; or that continued fevers are never cured by resolution , his charity is exhausted . He can attribute these assertions to no other sources , than ignorance , obstinacy , and , what is still worse , wilful misrepresentation. ' p. vi . Now we are the last persons to be sticklers for authority in medicine , or any other science . If a man is satisfied that he is right , whilst all the rest of the world are wrong , and // that in a concern of vital importance , we can not blame his endeavors to enlighten his benighted contemporaries , provided they are made with modesty and decorum . Neither can Dr Miner reasonably blame us , if for want of that strong internal evidence of things , which seems sufficient for his own conviction , our charity for the rest of the profession should not be utterly exhausted . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such indignation in the mind of our author , we offer no opinion . We leave these matters , as observed before , to medical men . But when we find the highest names , the names , as we afterwards learn , of Rush , Hamilton , Armstrong , Johnson , and others equally celebrated , accused of ignorance , obstinacy , and wilful misrepresentation , we are naturally led to inquire into the opportunities , which the accuser has enjoyed , of acquiring such superior information . And what are these ? -A practice of a certain number of years , ( he does not tell us how many , but probably not more than fifty , ) in the city of Middletown ; a city comprising a population of more than twenty-six hundred inhabitants , ' in which Dr Tully can not find , that , between the revolutionary war and the year 1820 , there have been half a dozen adults sick , at one time of the same acute disease , ' and the health of which , in general , has been greater than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' This immense practice has been shared too with , at least one , if not more , competitors . But then there was , in 1816 , an epidemic of a dozem cases of spotted-fever , and another , in 1820 , of ' fifteen decided cases of yellow-fever , besides three , or four , which there was good reason to suppose were broken up in the forming Stage . ' With these exceptions , ( the cases , to wit. , of those patients , whose constitutions have been undermined , or much impaired by previous sickness , age , or intemperance , and a few malignant ones in severe epidemics , ) the writer is free to acknowledge , that he never saw a regular case of fever , either run its courses or prove fatal , that might not be fairly attributed to obvious neglect or mismanagement on the part of the patient , or nurses , or physicians . ' p. viii . These extracts from the preface , will , in some measure , prepare our readers for an account of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr Tully , on // matters relating to fevers . Our limits will not permit us to attempt a separate analysis of ' each , nor is it necessary , since to use the words of our authors ; It is presumed that on close examination it will be uniformly perceived that the subject ' ( in all the essays ) is only placed in a different point of light . ' We shall content ourselves with noticing a few of the most prominent opinions . A leading one is that slow and moderate purging with calomel in the first stages , and the regular administration of opium , alcohol , and bark in the last , is the only proper methodus medendi in typhoid fevers , ' and that the plan of thus subduing them in their early stage by calomel is entirely original with Dr Miner . That the above method is a very good one in many cases of typhoid fevers , we allow ; but , that it is the only one admissible in any , we doubt , because we find very eminent physicians sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accounted for , without supposing ignorance or wilful misrepresentation on either side , if the general term , typhoid fever , includes diseases which , agreeing in some general characteristics , are yet sufficiently different to require considerable variation in the mode of treatment , which we have sometimes suspected to be the real state of the case . Neither is the originality of the plan so obvious to those of us , who are not so well skilled , in the minute shades of difference between the practice of different authors . It seems to us that Dr Hamilton recommends purging , and that sufficiently slow and moderate , and also that he uses sometimes calomel and sometimes other medicines for the purpose . Armstrong and Johnson give calomel combined with opium , as well as our author . Chisholm and Warren long ago taught to use calomel and opium till the mouth was affected . In fact , there is hardly a modern author , of our acquaintance , who does not recommend these articles , in some form or other , as a part of the treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , who does not use them . But it is clear , that they do not use them , in the same manner , as Dr Miner , or else they have different forms of disease to deal with ; for , in what other way , can the Doctor 's extraordinary success-in all cases but bad ones-be accounted for . A peculiar excellence of our author 's plan is , that , in proper kands , for that is very material , and with a little variation , // it will cure typhus mitior , as well as gravior , putrid sorethroat and lung-fever , measles , dysentery , rheumatism , every low acute febrile disease , marasmus , croup , yellow-fever and dropsy in the head , and we doubt not , that if there is any other disease , which the Doctor forgot to mention , it will cure that also . Another notion much insisted on , in these essays , is that all the diseases in Connecticut , and probably in the United States , for the last fifteen years , have the asthenic diathesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidences of sthenia , or asthenia , in any particular case . Perhaps all cases that require Dr Miner 's plan of cure are asthenic ; on this supposition , this doctrine of the change of diathesis may be an example of the manner of placing the subject in a different point of light . ' The indignation of Doctor Miner , like that of Luke Lundin , is particularly excited by those cursed old women , who take currently and impudently upon themselves to act as advisers and curers of the sick , and interfere with , disturb , and let , the regular progress of a learned and artificial cure . ' He states that , in the whole course of his practice in typhus , of all who have applied within the first forty-eight hours , after the obvious access of the disease ,  --  he is pretty confident that not one has proved fatal , in which the patient had not previously been tampering with emetics and cathartics. ' p. 31 . For this grievance we can offer the Doctor nothing but compassion , fearing that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will admit that it would be a great deal better-for the faculty-if mankind would never take any measure , respecting their health , without applying to the regular sources for advice . It must also be granted by all , but those abominable infidels whom we put out of the question , that many would thus escape severe diseases and premature death . But we are a self-willed and short-sighted race , and nothing but adversity will whip us into wisdom . Some of us are delayed by an habitual tendency to procrastination . Others by the absurd proverb , which inculcates the danger of dealing with the Doctor . ' Others again are deterred by a narrow-minded consideration of the honorarium , which the vulgar call a bill . In short , from one cause or another , we often neglect the opportunities , which are always open to us , of avoiding a large proportion of the ills that flesh // is heir to . As it sometimes happens , and , we should imagine , not unfrequently in a city so salubrious as Middletown , that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispositions , they acquire such hardihood by impunity , that , nothing , short of yellow-fever , will recall many of them to a proper sense of the duty they owe to themselves and their friends , of consulting the faculty , on all possible occasions . Nothing but this will place before their eyes , in its true colors , the impropriety of allowing their wives , mothers , and nurses to flatter them with herb teas , or practice upon them out of Buchan , or Townsend , or the still greater enormity of recommending to others , what they honestly , but ignorantly , believe to have been beneficial to themselves . The world will be much altered , when its inhabitants neither give nor take advice without due consideration . Nor can either Dr Miner , or we , ever hope to see the time , when men will not sometimes act as their own tailors , their own cooks , and their Own physicians , at the risk of bad clothes , bad dinners , or bad health . We could even , if necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , and that without implying any disparagement to the brethren of the thimble , the ladle , or the lancet , or their several arts , all of which we respect and honor . But we reserve the result of our researches into this matter for some future opportunity , and proceed to the consideration of the doctrine , in Dr Miner 's second essay , that medical authors are rarely practical men ; that they represent diseases , as much milder than they really are ; ( and if they do , heaven keep us from the reality , when the descriptions of diseases , in any medical book , are enough to make a common man 's hair stand on end ; ) that their practice is frequently ( that is , we suppose , when , by any accident , they happen to be practical men ) very different from their instructions ; and that their personal experience can teach them little of the real difficulties of medicine , because that experience is confined to hospitals . As if there was any difference between the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that , in the former , the most formidable cases are always admitted in preference to milder ones ; that the patients , the nurses , and the medicines , being all more completely under the control of the physician , it is proportionally easier for him to carry into effect his remedial processes , and of course to form // a more certain judgment of their real merit ; that a man can often see , in the fever-wards of a large hospital , more cases of that disease , to speak within bounds , in one year , than the mere family practitioner can see in twenty ; that he can , in such a situation , spend a life , in studying the phenomena of a single species of disease , instead of being distracted by an endless variety of maladies ; and lastly , that , as every step of his progress is liable to be watched and criticised by a crowd of students and medical men , he is deprived of those facilities of concealing his real processes , or skreening his mistakes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , our author , in this essay , accuses such writers as Sydenham , Cullen , Rush , Hey , Armstrong , Hamilton , Clutterbuck , and Johnson , either directly , or by very obvious implica-* tion , of gross deception ; and roundly asserts , that they were deterred from attacking the popular opinions of their day , by a mercenary regard to the general circulation of their works . We trust that such charges need no other attempt at confutation , than the simple statement of them . After perusing this essay , however , we feel ourselves bound to acquit the writer himself of any suspicion of this supposed besetting sin of mcdical authors , an undue regard for public opinion , when we find him deciding ex cathedra , that Fordyce , after a practice of twenty years , in a hospital containing an average of nearly four thousand patients , was yet unable to distinguish the paroxysms of a dangerous fever , from hysteric fits ; that Dr William Hunter , with all his learning , must in acute diseases , have been but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific work , his belief in the truth of the shocking jest , that a medical diploma is sufficient to suspend , through a whole kingdom , the penalties annexed to a violation of the sixth commandment . ' In the eighth essay , entitled EXPERIENCE , we are told that a prominent cause of the deterioration of medicine , in the United States , is the combination of the two professions , physic and surgery . ' The principal argument in support of this position is , that a greater number of the symptoms of surgical diseases being objects of sense , these diseases admit of greater certainty of judgment and practice , than those which are more strictly medical . The surgeon , therefore , will acquire a habit of deciding hastily in obscure disorders , and // without taking into view all the facts relating to the case . Now it seems to us , that if a surgeon brings to a medical case nothing but his knowledge of surgery , he can not but perceive it to be unlike those with which he is accustomed to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor , by studying the symptorns , reading , consulting his friends in the profession , in short , by every means in his power , to ascertain its nature and the proper method of treatment . The more medical diseases he meets with , the better he will be convinced of the difficulty of understanding and properly managing them ; that is , he will consider medicine , in the same light , in which it has been regarded by all itsjudicious professors , from the time of Hippocrates , who , en passant , was both physician and surgeon , to the present day , as a science of great difficulty , and not to be practised without care and deliberation . Another argument is , that the profession of surgery has , time immemorial , been second in rank to that of medicine . ' The implied inference from this , is that they can not be placed on a level , except at the expense of the latter . This , however , is the fable of the Lion and Man , especially when we recollect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , in relation to this subject . Other arguments are drawn from the difference , betweon the alleged dashing and desultory manner of surgical , and the slow and steady plan of medical practice , which it would be out of our prescribed limits to discuss . It seems to us , that all this reasoning is of little weight at the present day ; that it can apply only to the surgeons of another age ; the barber bleeders , itinerant lithotomists and cancer cutters ; the chirurgeons , or workers with the hand ; in short , to those mere mechanical operators , of which the race is almost extinct , as far as we know , in civilized Europe and America . Surgery is now a noble science , which , for the last half century , has given employment to some of the most philosophical minds ; the full sister , if we may so speak , of medicine . The distinction between them , is , in fact , an artificial one , a species of division of labor , which can only be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The innumerable necessities of the millions of London , can only be satisfied by dividing the duty amongst a host . Physician and surgeon are but the names of grand divisions , the classes and orders of the healing tribe . The ear , // the eye , the teeth , the stomach , every organ of the human frame , finds there an appropriate guardian . The occasional deformities even of the inorganic tipping of its extremities afford a name and a support to the humble art of the chiropodist . One man presides over the birth of the mewling infant , another conducts it safe through the perils of the cradle , and a third watches its advancing childhood ; the accidents of youth employ a fourth , a fifth encounters the graver maladies of manhood , a sixth ministers to the peevishness of the lean and slippered pantaloon , whilst the seventh goes through the decent ceremonies of the last scene of all , and pays his cold and formal duties to unconscious imbecility . Multitudes are thus enabled to devote their lives to the observation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eager competition and immense experience , the wisdom derived alike from their failures and success , is transmitted to us in ' bales and hogsheads . ' But , even in Europe , the mere medical man is comparatively rare . The physician and accoucheur of the village is also its surgeon . The diseases incident to the fleets , the armes , and the colonial establishments of Britain , are managed by surgeons . One of the greatest improvers of physiological science , ( upon which alone any rational medical theories can be founded , ) whom the world has known , was John Hunter , a surgeon . Finally , whatever may be the efficiency of the cause in certain circumstances , we are unprepared to admit the reality of the effect , alleged by our author ,  --  a deterioration of the practice of medicine in the United States . We can not leave this essay , without noticing the very logical inference , that , since our author has never failed in more than one instance , to cure consumption , when a fair opportunity has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some of our large cities , must be owing to the mal-practice of physicians . When we consider this remarkable success , and reflect that the remedies recominend*d by him have been so powerless in other hands , we can not but suspect that there is something more in all this , than meets the eye . We should be sorry to suspect so frank a person as Dr Miner , of any underhand proceedings ; but unless he has obtained the secret of the Balm of Gilead , or something of that sort , we can not tell what to think of it . The ninth essay , on the varieties of the pulse , would have // done honor to the acuteness of Solano , or Nihell . Among the different kinds of arterial vibration enumerated by our author , we were particularly struck with the designations of three , the gaseous , the suffocated , and the shattered . Those physicians , whose sensibility of finger is not sufficiently erudite to perceive some of these nicer modifications  --  and who must , therefore , fall under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but indifferent practitioners in acute diseases , ' will perhaps find consolation from the following opinion of the amiable and experienced Heberden , all who begin the study of physic , must find in the doctrine of the pulse , as collected from medical , writers , a great deal which they do not understand ; and all , I imagine , who have advanced a little in the practice of physic , can have very little doubt of its not being understood by the authors themselves . ' We looked into the twelfth essay , in which the author hopes that nearly all the rubbish , under which the subject of crisis has been so long buried , has been removed , ' with some curiosity . We find it there asserted , that fevers certainly have critical days . But as a host of authors , with Asclepiades and Celsus at their head , have asserted the direct contrary , and , moreover , presumed to ridicule the notion , as without any other foundation , than the Pythagorean doctrine of the power of numbers , and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we imagine that the fevers of Middletown are more strongly marked , in that particular , than many others . In the second , or Dr Tully 's part of the work , our limits will only permit us to analyze the account of the cases of yellow-fever , which occurred in Chatham in 1796 , and those before alluded to , which occurred in Middletown , in 1820 . Every fact relating to the question of the supposed contagious natare of yellow-fever , is at once so interesting and important to the community , that we trust our readers will excuse the length of the extract which we shall make , in relation to this subject . The history of the yellow-fever in Chatham , after premising that the town is remarkable for its salubrity , and exemption from endemic and epidemic diseases , ' is as follows . In the month of August , 1796 , during the prevalence of the usual general health in the village and adjacent country , when neither simple fevers , dysenteries , nor choleras , had any existence in that quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless perhaps it might have been considered as rather warmer and dryer than usual , the brig Polly , Russel Doan master , owned by Bulkley and Doan , arrived from Cape St Nicholas Mole . Her outward cargo consisted of oats and other grain , which was sold for cash ; so that she returned merely in ballast , and in as cleanly a state , as such vessels usually are , after a voyage . On her homeward passage , Mayhew Tupper , one of her crew , died on board with yellow-fever . The clothes , which he wore while sick , were thrown overboard , though a sail , upon which he lay when he died , was retained . The vessel afterwards underwent a sailor 's washing , which , in this instance , consisted in scrubbing with cold sea-water , and the subsequent application of vinegar . On the arrival of the brig at this landing , Newell Ilurd , a young man of about eighteen years of age , and John Ranney , were employed to assist in clearing her out . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time Sarah Exton , wife of one of the crew , and Elizabeth Cook , who lived in the same house , were employed in washing some of the sailors ' clothes . A few days afterwards , these four persons were attacked with yellow-fever . In about five days , viz , on the 29th of August , Hurd died , and within twelve hours , Ranney and Sarah Exton . The alarm in the village was already so great , that Sarah Exton was left alone in the night , and was found dead in the morning , with her infant child at the breast . Elizabeth Cook was soon added to the number of victims ; and in quick succession , the infant child of Sarah Exton , together with Lucinda Norton , a tailoress , and member of the same family , who had been employed in mending some of the sailors ' clothes , and Elizabeth and Rebecca Carey , daughters of Elizabeth Cook , who were immediately taken sick , and survived but a few days . The whole of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometime during their existence , Gersliom Lord , who acted in the capacity of clerk to one of the owners of the vessel , who had been on board of her , but had had no intercourse with the sick on shore , was taken with the same disease , and after a short but a severe illness , recovered . Beside this there were two or three other imaginary , or at most light cases , among those who had intercourse with the vessel , which soon recovered . Sometime while the brig was lying at this landing , but whether during the existence of any of the other cases , or subsequently , I have not ascertained , two young men , passing along the river in a boat , in the night , hauled along side the brig , and slept till morning in her cabin . Soon after they reached their father 's house , both sickened with yellow-fever , and one died , but the other recovered . ' pp. 359-*6 1 . // Accounts of this kind are always to be regarded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the oral testimony of persons who may be subjected to cross examination ; since the deponents , however honest and impartial , may often omit circumstances , which , in their view of the subject , are of little consequence , while in another , they are highly essential . We do not mean to dispute about names , or deny , that the informants of Dr Tully , for we have this account at second-hand , were competent judges of the real nature of these cases , or that they were truly instances of yellow-fever . We are also willing to admit that they all originated from the vessel in question . But we deny the certainty of their having been imported , in the technical sense , which the word seems to have acquired in relation to this disease . Our opinion is that putrefying vegetable matters will frequently cause yellow-fever in hot and dry weather , whether they be in the hold of a ship , or the cellar of a house , in a dock , a kennel , or a marsh . We suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no opportunity of asking the question , that a vessel , which had carried a cargo of grain , whether in bulk , or not , to a climate within the tropics , in the month of July or August , did contain and did bring home a very considerable quantity of such noxious matter among , or beneath her ballast , and was yet in as cleanly a state , as such vessels usually are after a voyage ; and we have no doubt , that the informants of our author would have found this to be the case , if their attention had not been so much attracted by the sail , on which Tupper died . ' Of the eleven cases , five are stated to have exposed themselves to the deleterious effects of this miasma , by going on board the Polly , whilst it is nowhere mentioned that the other six did not . On the contrary the following reasons afford a strong probability , that they did . First , that a vessel newly arrived from sea , is always , in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants , especially the lower classes , and those who reside about the landing-place . Secondly , we are toM , in the next essay , that the people of Middletown were more or less in the custom of visiting vessels from the West-Indies , for the purpose of obtaining fruit , &amp;c. &amp;c . ' And we presume the people of Chathain had the same custom , since nothing could be more natural . Lastly , these six persons were among the most likely of all to follow this practice , // being the relations or intimates of the crew , or those employed about the vessel , apparently tenants of one house , and the most probable party in the world to take a walk on board the brig after tea in a warm summer evening , and enjoy the air of the river . There is nothing strange in all this , nor in their dying soon after of yellow-fever . The thing is unhappily too common in many of our seaports . No violent suppositions are necessary to reconcile this account with our opinion of the non-contagiousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to us too obvious to be mistaken , viz. that no more persons from the shore , than are absolutely necessary should be permitted to go on board vessels in such circumstances , till they have been thoroughly cleaned and ventilated , and that every person already there , who can be spared from this hazardous duty , should be not only permitted , but exhorted , and , if necessary , compelled to seek safety by flight to a less noxious vicinity . We would direct the attention of the reader to one other circumstance only in this account and the succeeding part of the essay , we mean the inhuman desertion of the sick , which will always take place , to a greater or less degree , wherever the doctrine of contagion is the popular belief . Of the fifteen cases detailed in the account of the fever in Middletown in 1820 , the two first appear to have arisen from circumstances , not common to the remaining ones . We shall abridge the account of them thus . Fargo , a common sailor , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow-fever prevailed there . He arrived at New-York , the 25th of May , and in the evening of the 27th was first taken ill , in consequence , as he supposed , of some over-exertion in unloading his vessel . ' He was well enough on the 30th to sail , in the schooner Antelope , for Middletown , where he arrived , the 3d of June . He was found at that time to be affected with yellow .. fever , and died on the eleventh , eight days after . Capt . Vail , of the schooner Antelope , in the latter part of May went to New York , where he remained with his vessel , in all about a fortnight . chiefly at Burling-slip , though she was hauled one day to Coenties ' - slip . On being asked whether any vessels from foreign ports lay in his vicinity , he at first , thought there was none ; but on farther consideration , he recollected one from the West-Indies , with considerable fruit on board , where he // thought Fargo had been . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated above . While on his passage he began to be ill , and was seen , immediately after bis arrival , by Dr Tully , who considered his disease to be yellow-fever . The case is stated to have been mild ; he began to recover after fourteen days . The Antelope appears to have been a perfectly clean vessel . Several other persons came from New-York in her at the same time , who were not affected with the fever . We conceive that these cases may he explained , without supposing Fargo to have brought the disease from Savannah and communicated it to Capt . Vail . Indeed we are not sure that this is the opinion of Dr Tully . He leaves it unsettled whether it was originated in this way , or by the vessel from the West-Indies . We believe that the fatigue of loading , unloading , and hauling vessels in hot weather from one wharf to another of a city where we have good reason to think domestic causes of yellow-fever frequently exist , ( and there are few large ports in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will occasionally produce that disease . Of the remaining thirteen , three were ascertained to have been on board the brig Sea-Island , from St Jago de Cuba , which is described as being in an extremely foul and offensive state , from a quantity of putrid corn and other decomposing matters behind her ceiling . ' It is not certain that the others had been , but very probable , for reasons similar to those alleged above in considering the cases at Chatham . All the persons were , from their acquaintance with the crew , local situation , and other circumstances , very likely to do so ; and it is observed , that while the Sea-Island lay at Middletown , there was the freest communication between her and the shore . It is further stated , that after the fever became alarming , there was an opposition , on the part of many of the inhabitants , to any investigation of the fact of individual communication , so violent as to account for the difficulty of proving with respect to most of the cases , what was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of the particular cases . Doubts might be suggested , whether all these were really yellow-fever . But we abstain from criticism of that sort , since the opinion of a reputable physician , on the spot and acquainted with the appearance of that disease , is evidence which it would be arrogance to distrust , on the sole ground that his ac // count of it may not happen to agree entirely with our notions . We are well aware that fevers intrinsically of the same character and of course to be included under the same general denomination and requiring similar modes of treatment , may yet vary very considerably in the course , the degree , and the nature of some of their symptoms . A matter of fact , which we would recommend to the consideration of committees of health , especially those , if such there be , who think themselves warranted to vote down the existence of a disease , because it was not originated according to rule . We have treated parts of this work , with something like levity , but we desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Miner , in the language of grave expostulation . We particularize Dr Miner , since our greatest objection to Dr Tully , is , that he has authorized by his association in this work , what , we believe , he would never have written . We desire them to reconsider such passages , as the following : It has been calculated , that within a hundred years from Sydenham , the indiscriminate use of the lancet , and the antiplogistic regimen , so highly recommended by him , was the cause of more premature deaths , than all the wars that ravaged Europe , during that period . ' p. 13 . Who ever did , who ever could make such a calculation ? The very attempt would be alike impious and preposterous . Yet this monstrous hyperbole is set down without any qualification , among the axiomatic sentences , which commence the work , and is followed , in the very next sentence , by a similar charge against the practice now followed by the greater proportion of practitioners . ' We ask these authors , what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , with equally justifiable virulence , the charges of ignorance , obstinacy , skepticism , felony , and murder , with which they are repeatedly assailed in these essays ? What will be their own remorse , if increasing years and experience should change their opinions ? And has the history of medicine , and the biography of eminent physicians , persuaded them that such change is impossible ? No men seem better aware of the uncertainty of medical science and the proverbial variance of its theories . Can they draw from this knowledge no lesson of modesty or charity ? One would suppose , from some of the language of these essays , that the physicians of the present day , except // those few , who , as our author expresses it , have not bowed the knee to Baal , ' were a combination of ignorant blunderers and unprincipled hypocrites , whose god was mammon , whose very cures are escapes , ' and by whom hecatombs are annually sacrificed ; ' and that the practice of physic is the last profession , that an honest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world believe this of those , whose privileged feet must enter the sacred penetralia of domestic life ; who must continually become the confidants of their follies and their faults , and on whose skill and integrity they must so often rest the preservation of their health , their honor , or their lives . And can no honest man wish to engage in a profession , which is forever holding up to view , the policy of benevolence and sympathy , of tenderness for the health and happiness of his fellow-creatures , and charity for their weaknesses ,  --  which connects his daily avocations in the strongest manner with the exercise of the social feelings , and enforces the duties of morality by the powerful sanction of immediate interest ? Will men , we repeat , believe these accusations ? And if they will not , need we intimate to the accusers , what will be believed of them . Our authors inform us , that they found it expedient to omit several essays in this volume , which they hope soon to publish in another . But , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we entreat them for the credit of the profession , of their country , and of human nature , to refrain from their publication .
