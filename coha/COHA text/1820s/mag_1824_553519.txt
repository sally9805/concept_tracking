txt ART . XIII. - Histoire compar&amp; des Systeimes de Philosophie , consid&amp;is relativement aux Principes des Connaissances hurnaines . Par M. DE GERANDO , Membre de 1 ' Institut de France . Deuxii*me Edition , revue , corrig*e , et augment*e. 4 vols . Svo . Paris , 1822 . THE History of Philosophy is an entire blank in English literature , excepting always the elegant dissertations by Mr Stewart in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia . These , however , treat exclusively of the three last centuries , and of that period in a very summary way . They are rather fitted to make us feel the want of a more complete work on the same subject , than to supply it . The abridgment of Brucker by Enfield , though valuable to the mere English reader for the information contained in it , does not possess the character of an original treatise ; and one or two imperfect essays of an earlier date are now forgotten . We are told by Mr Stewart , in his life of Adam Smith , that this eminent philosopher had conceived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral sciences , which he had cultivated with so much success , and that he had in part prepared the materials . It can never be sufficiently regretted , that he did not carry his intention into effect , or that the knowledge of it had not // moved his biographer , in the vigor of life , to undertake the same task upon the same scale . The literature of France was , in this particular , nearly as ill furnished as our own , until the appearance , in 1804 , of the great work of the Baron de Gerando , the second edition of which is now going through the press . This work consists of three divisions . The first treats of the period anterior to the revival of learning ; and the second of the three last centuries . In the third , the author reviews the whole subject , and states the conclusions to which he is led by this survey . The first of these divisions is the work , which we now propose to notice ; the republication of the second and third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take some future occasion to invite the attention of our readers to the other parts of this valuable treatise . The reputation of Monsieur de Gerando stands high with the public , in consequence of the commendations , which Mr Stewart has repeatedly bestowed upon him , in almost all his works . In France he is regarded , by general consent , as the first metaphysician of the day ; and even in Germany , where the intellectual and moral sciences have been more diligently cultivated of late , than in any other part of Europe , and where the learned in this department are apt to undervalue , in some degree , the productions of foreigners , the merit , of M. de Gerando has been felt and acknowledged . His book has been translated into the language of that country , and accompanied with a careful commentary by Professor Tenneman , himself the author of one of the best works on the same subject . If , however , our author has gained the approbation of his neighbors beyond the Rhine , it has not been by adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressing their thoughts . His style is uncommonly perspicuous and elegant ; and his opinions are in general nearly the same with those of the Edinburgh school . He has imitated the Germans only in the unwearied industry , with which he recurs to the original writers , however difficult and barren of attraction , instead of resting satisfied with the compilations and extracts of modern commentators . His position , in the neighborhood of the King 's library at Paris , has given him the greatest possible advantages for this purpose ; and he seems to have improved them to the utmost . He not only follows the great masters of antiquity to the // *236 April , charming retreats of the Porch and the Academy , a labor that rewards itself by the pleasure which accompanies it ; not only penetrates , with fearless and scrupulous fidelity , the palpable obscure ' of Kant and Aristotle , but makes it a matter of conscience to investigate the ecstatic mysteries of the new Platonists , and to dwell in the monasteries of the middle ages , with Albert the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care in consulting the originals , as a merit of a very high order ; and it gives to the researches of M. de Gerando a solid and lasting value , independent of the correctness of his own private opinions . This gentleman has devoted himself , from his youth upward , to the cause of philosophy ; and , besides the work be-. fore us , has published several others of great value on different branches of intellectual science . He is still living in the full vigor of his faculties , and actively occupied with his favorite studies , and with the discharge of various official functions of the most respectable character . It may be remarked , as an additional recommendation of his writings , that their moral tendency is entirely different from that of the productions of the French philosophers of the preceding generation . Without giving at all into the extravagance and mysticism , which , by a natural reaction , are too apt to grow up after the temporary prevalence of sensual doctrines , and of which we see many symptoms in all parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless adopted a generous and elevated notion of the nature and destiny of man . His writings are warmed with a genial glow of good feeling , and exhibit a firm though temperate attachment to the cause of rational liberty . They breathe the mild spirit of toleration and charity ; and we rise from perusing them with a conviction , that their author is not only a just and powerful thinker , but , what is still better , a most amiable and virtuous man . It is with us a matter not only of regret , but of some surprise , that books of so much real value , and at the same time of so popular a character , considering their subjects , should not yet have found a translator , either with us , or in England , while the presses of both countries are constantly teeming with republications , and translations of French productions , of a wholly worthless and ephemeral class . The invention of printing , by giving popularity to learning , will accelerate its decline , as much as it has done its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their profession to direct the pub . ' lic taste to proper objects , neglect their noble office , and basely pander to the vilest passions and most frivolous ca-* prices of the multitude . The work before us , although it has done much to supply the deficiency in Frenc*h literature of a good history of phi. * losophy , does not , however , profess to give a complete ac* count of the origin and progress of intellectual and moral science . The author has been led , by taste and habit , to direct his attention principally to that branch of the general inquiry , which considers the sources and certainty of know ' ledge . He has treated this subject in a separate work , and Mr Stewart has also examined it in one of his essays . This question is obviously the first in order ; since , before we take the trouble of exploring our intellectual domain , it is obviously necessary that we should review the titles by which we hold it , and ascertain whether it is really our own . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of philosophy , that there is one preliminary question upon which the whole discussion seems to turn ; to wit , the origin of knorvledge . To determine the real nature of the relation between the mind and the objects of which it takes cognizance , and to ascertain upon what principles it draws conclusions respecting them , and how far those conclusions may be depended on , must be the first objects of attention with every philosopher . This inquiry constitutes , in my opinion , the true first philosophy of Descartes and Bacon ; and contains within itself the essence and the elements of every other . It is obvious that before we can decide the questions respecting the three great objects of all philosophy , God , Man , and the Universe , we must first examine by virtue of what title , we decide upon any thing . ' This question is not only the first in the natural order of the inquiry ; but the decision of it regulates , in a great measure , the character of our conclusions upon the vast subjects mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources and certainty of knowledge , determine us in the choice of the methods by which we examine other subjects . The methods we choose fix the course of our ideas , and conduct us inevitably to one or another of certain opinions . Materialism on the one hand , and Idealism on the other , are the two extreme points towards which we tend , as we . Neu* Series , . JVo. 18. 31 // 238 April ; attach a greater or less degree of importance to sensible , or abstract notions ; and hence our views on the comparative importance of these classes of notions , or , in other words , on the sources and certainty of knowledge , will probably determine the point at which we fix ourselves between the opposite systems. * The author 's general plan is , therefore , to recapitulate the opinions of the most eminent philosophers of ancient and modern times on the sources and *certainty of knowledge ; and to notice their views on other kindred subjects , as far as they appear to have been determined by the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the author himself observes , a history of philosophy , that is , of intellectual and moral science in general , but an introduction  --  to such a history , or an account of that particular branch of the science , which stands at the threshold , and ought to be examined before we attempt to enter on the study of tho rest . It serves , however , to a certain degree , as a substitute for a more complete treatise , since the progress of all the other branches of philosophy is , to a greater or less degree , brought under rexiew in connexion with the principal inquiry . It . may perhaps be doubted , whether this question , although the first in order , and even in importance , considering it as a necessary introduction to all the others , is precisely the most suitable to be made the rallying point in a work of this kind . Whether we are sure of the existence of any-thing , ourselves included , may be , as D'Alembert calls it , a terrible question , * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly preliminary in order to any other . But this question , which involves the whole inquiry respecting the sources and certainty of knowledge , does not admit , when rationally treated , of much discussion ; and the history of the various strange and wild speculations , into which philosophers have been led by it , is a mere record of human folly in one of its various forms . Hence , if this be made the leading topic in a general history of philosophy , the attention of the reader is principally directed to one of the least valuable and interesting portions of the subject . The writer , if he is true to his plan , will be obliged to dwell at greater length , and with more care , // precisely on those periods when the general science was at the lowest point , and on those 9haracters , who have done least for the advancement of knowledge . Socrates , for example , the most remarkable person in the whole history of philosophy , has , strictly speaking , no place whatever in a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever to solve the terrible question ; while the visionaries of the Alexandrian school , who built up a vast castle in the air , ' of the wildest imaginations , on the basis of a false theory on the origin of knowledge , must receive an attention exactly proportioned to their want of real merit . If it were proper to select one branch of philosophy , as the leading topic in a summary review of the whole science , it strikes us , that the moral relation existing between man and the universe would be more suitable for this purpose , than the intellectual one , as being of itself of far more practical importance , and as naturally fixing the attention on the most instructive and agreeable parts of the inquiry . It may be remarked , however , that the correct taste and sound judgment of M. de Gerando have led him to avoid , in a great measure , any inconvenience of the kind alluded to by deviating , as occasion required , from a too strict adherence to his plan ; and it would perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compass of a work of this extent a greater mass of valuable matter relating to the general subject , than we find in the one before us . For the purpose of introducing the necessary order in the arrangement of his materials , our author has distinguished five successive periods in the progress of intellectual and moral science , and has divided his entire work into the same number of corresponding sections . The first period comprises the time anterior to Socrates * the second terminates at the age of Cicero ; the third describes the decline and fall of philosophy , and ends with the close of the seventh century ; the fourth brings us to the epoch of Descartes and Bacon ; and the fifth to our own times . The four first occupy the work before us ; the fifth is reserved for the subsequent division of the ' entire treatise , of which the second edition is not yet published . The new matter , contained in the present edition , consists principally of copious annotations appended to each of the chapters . We shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article , to follow M. de Gerando through the whole course of his interesting researches ; but shall endeavor to give the reader an idea of his manner , and of the contents of his work , by a notice of some of the most interesting passages , accompanied with occasional extracts . The materials for a history of the first of the periods above distinguished are extremely scanty . Very little information has come down to us respecting the doctrine of the two schools , then principally in vogue , commonly called the Ionic and Italian , or their respective founders , Thales and Pythagoras ; and the little we have can hardly be received with implicit credit . Aristotle tells us , that even in his time nothing was known of Thales except by tradition ; and there is great reason to suppose , that the common accounts of the opinions of these extraordinary men were transmitted by persons , who did not understand them , and who substituted their own crude imaginations for the juster views of their masters . Thus the leading principle attributed to Thales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything , and he has accordingly been regarded by many as an atheist . It is known , however , that his attention was chiefly directed to physical science , and his celebrated axiom doubtless meant nothing more , than that the changes we find to have taken place in the structure of the globe were produced by the action of water . This was an ancient tradition current among the oriental sages , to whom the first Greek philosophers were probably indebted for most of these notions ; and we even can see the traces of it in the account of the creation in Genesis , where the chaotic mass which existed before the introduction of order , is represented as consisting of water . The earth was without form and void , and the spirit of God moved upon the waters . ' Thales was therefore not an atheist , but a Neptunian . Pythagoras , on the other hand , is represented as placing the first cause and essence of everything in numbers . One is the active principle , or the Divinity ; two the passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These assertions , literally taken , convey no idea whatever , and are wholly unintelligible . They are , therefore , probably conclusions drawn by an inferior disciple of the great Samian from some leading doctrine of an entirely different cha** racter* // M. de Gerando inclines to the opinion , that Pythagoras had personified the abstract notions of the numbers , and converted them in his imagination into independent and substantial beings . Such a system would resemble pretty nearly the heresy of certain philosophers , refuted by Seneca , who considered the four cardinal virtues as so many living animals ; and we can hardly bring ourselves to believe , that a person linesdeleted // water , is the universal principle . Perhaps the continual contemplation of his favorite element made his eyes look red , and gave rise to the popular opinion , that he was addicted to the melting mood . He was , also , surnamed the Obscure ; but Aristotle tells us , that the difficulty of understanding his works was owing entirely to the want of any proper punctuation . Hippocrates , the physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is justly ranked among the most distinguished philosophers of this period . Empedocles of Agrigentum is another of the great names belonging to it , but we know little , with certainty , of his life or opinions . He is represented by several writers , as having lived in a state of perpetual enthusiasm , and as having wrought miracles ; but if he had really possessed this gift , it is hardly probable that he would have leapt fondly into Aitna 's flames , ' in order to be thought a god . Anaxagoras , surnamed A " ous , or Intelligence , the friend of Pericles , probably the master of Socrates-Anaxagoras seems , upon the whole , to have been the greatest character of this epoch ; or , at least , is the one whose greatness is best attested by authentic evidence . The enthusiastic approbation with which he is mentioned by M. de Gerando is equally honorable to both . We now arrive , ' says our author , at the epoch of the illustrious Anaxagoras , whose memory was held in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the long course of intervening ages that separate us , we salute him with feelings of gratitude and joy . Considering the importance and grandeur of the notion of an intelligent first cause , which he was the first to publish , his name would well deserve to mark a period in the history of philosophy . The Ionic school , in which he was instructed , had conceived the idea of a first cause , or principle of order , which they called the soul of the world , but they supposed it to be in some way confounded and identified with the matter of the universe . Anaxagoras was the first , who established with distinctness and precision the separation between them . He taught , that the universe is an effect entirely distinct from the cause that produced it . This cause has nothing in common with any other being . It is one and eternal . It acts upon the world as the artist upon his materials . Power had before been considered as the principal attribute of the first cause ; Anaxagoras added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , before his time , // demonstrated with fulness and precision . The mass of mankind had always entertained some notions of it , by the mere effect of the natural religious instinct . Those , who thought more deeply , had perceived that the chain of effects must terminate in a first cause ; that this cause must produce these effects by action , and that action supposes a being endowed with thought and will ; but they had not stated the argument in a methodical way , nor had they drawn their conclusions directly from a view of the general harmony of the universe . This merit was reserved for Anaxagoras . He was the first , who clearly perceived and distinctly taught , that the appearances of the universe are all connected together and form one system ; that order is the chain which unites , and the supreme law which governs them ; that this universal system , thus connected , supposes a single directing principle , or in other words , an omniscient and almighty mind . ' Such were the sublime notions of Anaxagoras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purity and elevation of his principles . He possessed , * says our author , a considerable fortune , but disdained sensual pleasures , and gave himself up exclusively to the search after truth . He was accustomed to say , that the noblest occupation of man was the contemplation of heavenly things , and the study of nature . When he was reproached with indifference to the welfare of his country , he replied , lifting his hands towards heaven , " Oh no ! my country is very dear to me . " He supported the persecutions , to which he was subjected , with courage , and without discontinuing his labors in the cause of truth . This philosopher was a great admirer of Homer , and called him the teacher of justice and virtue . From this poet , he probably derived the majestic eloquence , that adorned his conversations and his writings . He resided at Athens in habits of intimate association with Pericles and Euripides . There too he met with Phidias , and lived much in his society . These two immortal geniuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubtless derived great assistance in their various pursuits from their mutual intercourse . They were the first persons , who took a correct view of the real dignity of art and science , and who discovered the secret of the true sublime and beautiful in moral and in sensible objects . They found it to consist in the union of the divine and human , the ideal and the real . In the writings of Anaxagoras , the notion of a higher intelligence diffused a religious light over the whole face of nature ; - while the same great conception beamed in beautiful forms from under the chisel of Phidias ; and inspired him in the execution of those master pieces of art , which have been the admiration and delight of all succeeding ages . ' // Anaxagoras , as is well known , was sentenced to banish- ' ment by an Athenian tribunal , on a charge of atheism , a worthy prelude to the judicial assassination of Socrates for the same offence . At the close of his account of the first period , our author devotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their appearance about this time in Greece , under the name of the Sophists . It would seem , that this was an appellation which they assumed themselves , and which they rendered so infamous by their corrupt principles and actions , and by their vicious modes of reasoning , that it has been regarded ever since as a term of reproach . It is rather difficult , however , to ascertain exactly in what way these persons were classed as a sect . Aristotle states , that sophistry is the art of appearing wise without being so , and that a sophist is a person , who teaches this art for money . Cicero tells us , that they attributed the order of the universe to chance , and had no belief in an overruling Providence . And it appears from Thucydides , that they considered force as the only principle of moral obligation . To judge from these hints , we should consider them as a sect of materialists . Other authorities , however , seem to intimate , that the opinions of the Sophists were not uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of philosophy , and some to another . Individuals , designated by this epithet , are even mentioned with approbation by the same authors , who show the least favor to the class . Thus Prodicus is described by Plato as a Sophist , while Xenophon calls him the divine , , and attributes to him the beautiful and highly moral apologue of the choice of Hercules . We have not room to go at length into an examination of the real character and opinions of these persons . It is not improbable , that the name meant originally , and while it was used in a good sense , nothing more than a professional instructer in philosophy and rhetoric ; as we find the feature of teaching for hire a prominent one in every description of the Sophists . However this may be , it appears that one of their favorite modes of instruction was putting questions to their pupils ; and it was from them that Socrates borrowed the interrogative method , which he afterwards turned against them with so much effect . The second period in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , and closes with Cicero , // is by far the most interesting and important of all . The first is , for the most part , an age of injudicious attempts , conducted on false principles , and terminating in very unsatisfactory results . It represents the infancy or preparatory state of philosophy , and it is in the second , that the science may be fairly said to have been created . During the second period , the great problems were first stated with precision , and the principal different solutions , that may be given of them , were distinctly perceived . Hence nothing remained for succeeding inquirers , who were content to keep within the bounds of a rational method , hut to build on the foundations of their predecessors . This has , accordingly , been done from that day to the present . Later writers have completed , explained , and corrected the results obtained by the ancients , but have still followed in the leading tracks , which they had marked out . The intellectual philosophers of the experimental school , including Locke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wrought upon the basis furnished by Aristotle ; and the modern idealists , in like manner , with Leibnitz and-Kant at their head , have presented under new modifications the leading notions of Plato . Political science , the third great division of morals , is perhaps the one which was least satisfactorily treated by the ancients , and in which the greatest improvements have been made , or still remain to be made . The great men , that adorned this period , and conferred such vast benefits on the world , have justly been the objects ever since of a veneration bordering on idolatry . The enlightened and the unenli*htened have been equally ready to admit their merits . After their writings had ceased to be understood or studied , their names still held an undisputed sway over the cloistered ignorance of the middle ages ; and upon the revival of learning , they exchanged this barbaric empire ' for the more congenial homage of intelligent and inquiring minds , who found that the study of nature on rational principles brought them back at once into the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted exclusively to morals , has , in reality , no place in the work before us , M. de Gerando has , nevertheless , judiciously departed from a too strict adherence to his plan , and has made him the subject of a long and very interesting chapter . Afte // paying this tribute to the great founder of ethical science , our author passes rapidly over the schools , that were fdrmed under the influence of his lessons , until he comes to those of Plato and Aristotle , the two first names in the intellectual science of that , and all succeeding ages . M. de Gerando seems to be thoroughly versed in the writings of both these philosophers , as well as of their principal commentators , and dwells at great length , and with evident satisfaction , on this part of his subject . The following parallel , though somewhat too elaborate and artificial , is , upon the whole , pow&amp;rfully drawn , and exhibits the general conception formed by our author of the characters of the two writers , and of the relation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato and Aristotle , in some degree , the same sort of relation , which exists between the inventors of models in the arts , and the writers , or critics , who follow them , and deduce from the study of their models a system of general rules . The field of speculation occupied by Plato is vast , because his point of view is elevated , but it is not always defined with sufficient distinctness . The observations of Aristotle are the result of personal inquiry or reflection . He visits every place , notices every object , and determines with exactness its shape and dimensions . Hence , though his researches are less extensive , his views are much more precise , than those of his rival . Plato contemplates , reflects , and imagines . Aristotle observes and arranges . Plato seems to draw entirely upon his own mind for everything , even to the subjects of which he treats . Aristotle is equally original , but collects his materials from abroad , and employs himself in giving them proper forms . Plato brings down the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes it out from the objects we see around us . Imagination is the province of the former , and reality of the latter . One is the king of speculation , and the other the master of arts . The former disdains , as doubtful and deceptive , all the information furnished by the senses ; while the latter treats as chimerical everything not founded in actual experience . Plato has no wish to impose his own opinions on us as laws ; but on the contrary , scarcely ventures to state them in a positive form . He guides us into the track , which leads to his conclusions , and then leaves us to follow it out , so that we seem to be thinking for ourselves even while we are adopting his ideas . Aristotle is not contented with stating his own views distinctly , but asserts them with a sort of authority , chains us down to them , as it were , by the closeness of his reasoning , and draws a circle round us , from which we attempt in vain to escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial one . His writings are all in a dramatic form . He brings his characters on the stage , and keeps himself behind the scenes . Aristotle reasons in a great variety of forms , but always in his own person . His works are a complete code of laws , promulgated in his own name , in which he foresees and directs everything down to the most minute details . In reading Plato we seem to enjoy the society of a noble minded friend . We feel inspired and encouraged . We think better of ourselves , and are even willing to be in the wrong in so good company . With Aristotle we find ourselves under the rod of an instructer , capable , indeed , of educati ngthe whole human race , but still a hard master , who regulates our actions , dictates our opinions , and even prescribes the language in which we must express them . In return for our obedience , we feel the repose and security , which attend the acquiescence in any established system . Plato 's views are uniformly directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all truth , by studying the general laws of the universe , and he means to deduce from this common fountain the principles of each particular science . Aristotle studies the laws of every science in the science itself and directs his attention to the discovery and classification of individual facts . The manner of Plato is warm and enthusiastic . He thinks with all his soul , and inspires us with emotion even in his coolest moments . The other is always didactic . There is no heat in the light which he throws on the subject . The severest reason presides in all his lessons ; he addresses himself to the understanding , and puts us on our guard against any kind of excitement . Plato , in short , is the high priest of philosophy , and the father of his pupils , while Aristotle has the character of a judge and a schoolmaster . ' It is pretty evident , from the manner of this parallel , that Plato is the favorite with M. de Gerando . If we consider the two persons , merely as philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to prove , that our author 's preference is unjust , even on his own showing . But where both the parties have so much merit , it is almost invidious to institute comparisons . In the following passage , our author draws the character of Plato in a more direct form . Nature had united in Plato her richest and most various gifts , as if she had been creating for some particular purpose the finest genius in philosophy , that the world has ever seen . He possessed , in the highest degree , the qualities which lead to excellence in the fine arts , the inspiration that seeks for models in the ideal world , the power of imitation which revives at pleasure the objects that have once been observed , the imagination that gives brilliancy and life to these recollections , and the exquisite sense of proportion , // propriety , and harmony , which arranges details in the most agree* able forms . With these faculties , he had also the power of abstraction , that belongs to thinking minds , and enables them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them under a common point of view . He embraces with a glance the vast variety of appearances that fill the universe . His plans are all conceived on a great scale , and executed with an overflowing richness and splendor of materials . In a principle he sees the most remote consequences ; in an effect the most distant causes . Never before had similar subjects been treated in forms at once so comprehensive and so well connected . And yet his observations are so nice , and his distinctions so delicate , that he often appears subtle , and is able to contend successfully with the most artful reasoners . He sees things at the same time in the largest masses and in the minutest elements . In respect of manner , his expressions glow with a certain internal warmth and enthusiasm , which are however always kept within suitable limits , or rather seem to conform of themselves , and without an effort , to the laws of good taste . Having once formed a correct conception of the character of this extraordinary genius , it is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must necessarily have assumed in his hands . A poetical spirit had predominated in the attempts at philosophical investigation made by most of his predecessors . In him , philosophy and poetry are strictly combined , and united , as it were , in marriage . He carried to perfection the art of poetry , as applied to scientific subjects , if we may use such language , and became the Homer of philosophy . This is the reason that his fame has come down unimpaired , through such a lapse of ages , and that he am pears to us as the intellectual and moral representative of all antiquity . For poetry never grows old ; and the works of Plato , two thousand years after they were written , are as full of life and freshness as ever , and hold the first rank among the few classical models , which men of taste are never weary of studying . It is necessary to a full understanding of his merits , that we should recollect the manner in which his intellect was trained . No individual was ever placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , and we may add , that it requires such a concurrence of circumstances to account for the existence of so extraordinary a genius . The reading of the poets was his first favorite employment , and his first ambition was to imitate them . He attempted successively the epic , dramatic , and lyric forms ; and also cultivated painting and music ; but he soon abandoned these pursuits for more serious ones . He then studied geometry , and this science served with him as an introduction to other abstract speculations . It was , therefore , in conformity with his own practice , that he required a similar preparation of his fob // lowers . At the age of twenty he became a pupil of Socrates , and after his master 's death , retired with several of his disciples to Megara . The travels of Plato are celebrated . They were so many voyages of discovery in search of moral truth . In Italy he met with the sages , who inherited the wisdom of Pythagoras . From the Egyptian priests he learnt their astronomy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse with them produced a lasting effect on his manner , and doubtless contributed to give him the remarkable dignity , the sort of pomp and pride , which he delights to assume , and which invest him , when he teaches , with a sacerdotal character . He visited every part of Greece , dwelt thrice in Sicily , and observed in person the forms of government , the institutions , laws and manners of different nations . In the popular states he witnessed the effects of liberty ; and studied in courts the characters of princes . He never took a part himself in public affairs , and was even jealously attached to his independence , thinking that it was empire enough for him to found and govern his own academy. * The following portrait of the mighty Stagyrite ' is drawn with a less partial hand , but probably gives a pretty correct view of the leading traits of his character . C Aristotle enjoyed several advantages , which his predecessor , ( Plato , ) wanted , besides that of succeeding him in the order of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed his attention very early to the phenomena of nature . Books were then very scarce , and so exorbitantly dear , that no private individual could think of founding a library at his own expense . Aristotle was permitted to draw at discretion on a royal treasury for this purpose , and he brought together the largest collection of manuscripts that had then been seen . The , expedition of Alexander into Asia opened new sources of information in history , geography , and all the positive sciences , and Aristotle had the freest access to them from the nature of his personal situation . He received , as presents from this great conqueror , who had been his pupil , immense col* lections in the various departments of science ; and the care of arranging these specimens was equivalent , of itself , to a course of experimental philosophy . Aristotle was certainly the most learned of the ancient philosophers ; but his genius , instead of being crushed under the mass of his erudition , derived from it additional vigor and originality . After making himself acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking any account of authorities , he compares opinions , doubts , examines , and finally decides for himself . He treats the other philosophers with an apparent feeling of // 250 April , superiority ; and they seem to follow in his train , like captives in the triumphant procession of a conqueror . While his great pupil was traversing and subduing Asia , Aristotle founded a more just and lasting empire in the realms of science , and added new provinces to the territory of the human mind . Several other circumstances , which had not been much remarked , had their effect on the genius of Aristotle . He was deficient in some of the qualities necessary to a brilliant orator and writer ; and therefore sought to obtain a reputation of a different kind , by presenting knowledge in precise and accurate forms . He had passed a great part of his life at the courts of princes , in countries where , by the arbitrary will of one individual , even law and order were founded on passive obedience . Athens itself , at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national existence . The golden days of liberty had vanished like a dream , and the fine glow of patriotic feeling had departed with them . Aristotle had been employed eight years as the tutor of Alexander ; and the habits of teaching required for public and for private instruction are essentially different . A private tutor must exercise authority , must stimulate or restrain his pupil , and expose his own opinions in the form of precepts rather than of scientific principles . Hence , in all the writings of Aristotle we recognise the schoolmaster . There was nothing , in fact , either within or without him to inspire him with enthusiasm . His great experience of life led him to value the positive , and to aim chiefly at practical utility . Hence , it was his leading object to collect facts , and devise methods of applying them ; and he became , as it were , the Archimedes of philosophy . ' All this has but little to do with the terrible question , which M. de Gerando professes to make the leading topic of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has given himself a good deal of latitude in his mode of treating it . In examining the works of Plato and Aristotle , he comes however to the point , and very naturally , as the writings of these philosophers had been the fountains of materialism and idealism of all succeeding times . Although this question does not probably interest a large class of our readers , a few of them may , perhaps , be pleased to see the manner in which it was stated two thousand years ago . Plato holds , that our general notions or ideas are not abstractions from particular perceptions , but forms on models existing originally in the divine mind , and innate in that of man . Ideas , ' he observes , are not deductions from experience , like the general notions of which we were speaking // just now , and which are obtained by the comparison of par .. ticular perceptions . They have a different origin . It would be impossible to explain the production of them , if they were not independent of experience and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God himself , to serve as the elements of knowledge . Before they were communicated to us , they dwelt in the divine mind , as so many forms or models according to which the Deity arranged the universe . ' Hence , then , ideas are supposed to have a much more complete reality and certainty than any merely sensible notions . Plato puts this doctrine in the mouth of Socrates ; but in doing this he seems merely to have made use , whether justifiably or not , of his ordinary dramatic form of writing , without regard to fact ; since Aristotle tells us expressly , that Socrates did not distinguish in this way between universal and particular notions . After him , he adds , the distinction was taken , and the name of ideas was attributed to the former class . Such is the leading principle of Plato on this subject ; and his great disciple attempts to refute it in the following way . If ideas are * says Aristotle , how happens it that we are not always conscious of them , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they ought to impart to us ? How can we have an idea of a thing , which we have never perceived ? To call our ideas models , on which existing objects were formed , is merely a poetical figure . Who is there , that acts with his eyes fixed on these supposed models ? We know that objects may exist , may be made without reference to them . Besides , there would be , on this supposition , several models for the same thing , since everything may be ranked under several classes . It is impossible to separate in fact the notion of the kind from that of the individual ; and ideas have no substantial existence independent of their objects . There are many things , which nobody pretends have been formed agreeably to these ideas , as houses , rings , and so forth ; and why should not this be the case with others ? The reasoning , which is employed to support this theory , has no solid foundation ; and admitting the truth of it , it serves no useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore clearly in an error . His ideas are evidently a product of the understanding , formed by a generalization of the particular qualities of individual objects . * . * ** ** It belongs to experience to furnish the principles of every science . Thus , astronomy rests on the observation of the heavenly bodies , by means of which we dis // cover the laws , that regulate their motions ; and so of other branches . But if the light of perception fails us , all science fails with it . We derive our conclusions either from induction or demonstration . By induction we ascend from particular perceptions to general principles , and by these , in time , we are able to demonstrate ; so that all our knowledge rests ultimately on the same basis . ' These leading notions on both sides are developed at considerable length by our author , and supported by a number of passages from the two writers . It is curious to see how little the speculations of subsequent inquirers , up to the present day , have proceeded beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the Baconian theory of induction , as clearly stated as it could have been by the illustrious Chancellor himself , and we can hardly justify him in calling this method a new one-novum organum-in oppo-. sition to the organon , or method of Aristotle , which was the name given by the Stagyrite to his work on logic . In the same extract we find the doctrine of Locke on the origin of knowledge , and his refutation of the theory of innate ideas . In the empirical ( experimental ) notions . This dispute , like most others , might probably be brought within a very narrow compass , if not entirely removed , by the definition of a few terms . The two theories are rather different , than opposite modes of considering the same facts . If we admit , as Plato and Aristotle both did , the existence of an intelligent first cause , the laws of nature , which correspond with our general notions , must be looked u as revelations of his will . They may be said to exist in the divine mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are the models upon which all individual objects are formed . On the other band , the same laws or general notions , as realised in the appearances of nature , can only be known to us , as far as they are deduced from our own perceptions . Plato has , therefore , looked upon general notions , or ideas , under a religious , and Aristotle under a philosophical point of view . If there is any error in the system of Plato , it lies in stat .. ing , that these ideas are innate and have an existence in our minds , independently of perception , a proposition , which , in its obvious and literal sense , is quite absurd , but which was probably understood by him in some other way . This , // This , as our readers are aware , is the precise point on which the dispute turns ; but we doubt very much whether any two persons , who should agree on a definition of the word innate , would afterwards differ on the question of innate ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new form , does not go the length of saying , that any of our ideas are absolutely independent of perception ; but merely holds , that while some of them are directly furnished by the senses , others are only suggested by the act of perception , and spring up naturally in the mind on that occasion . In like manner , the disputes on the certainty of knowledge might probably be settled by a few good definitions . Two persons , who should first explain to their mutual satisfaction the terms doubt and certainty , would hardly find themselves at variance on the point , whether we ought to doubt the evi-. dence of the senses , or even on the terrible question , whether we are certain of the existence of anything , ourselves included . It is not our object , however , in the present article , to go at much length into the examination of particular opinions , and we now return to our immediate subject . The second period in the history of philosophy closes , in a manner worthy of its commencement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , as far as we possess them entire , give us the wisdom of the ancients in a still more complete and perfect form , than those of Plato ; although his merit as an original thinker , and even as a fine writer , may not be so great . We are not sure , however , that in either of these respects there is any other than a merely accidental inferiority . The master is doubtless as suck above the disciple ; and Cicero throughout his works acknowledges , in the most honorable manner , his obligations to his illustrious model , and is never weary of speaking of him with enthusiastic admiration . But Plato himself was nearly as much indebted to Pythagoras , Socrates , and his other predecessors , as Cicero was to him , and the philosophers that followed him in Greece ; and the merit of Plato is far from being particularly conspicuous , when he thinks entirely for himself , as in his theory of Ideas , and that of government , where he is notoriously extravagant , unnatural , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have thought with more correctness // and precision ; and if the style of Plato is more poetical and lively , that of Cicero , without being deficient in these attrac* tive qualities , is more perspicuous , more dignified , and on the whole better adapted to their common subjects . There is no single work of Plato , or any other ancient writer , that can come in competition with the treatise on Duties . Cicero has also the merit of stating his opinions in a more manly and unaffected form , than the great philosophers of Greece . Most of them , especially Pythagoras , Plato , and Aristotle* adopted the plan of a double doctrine , and pretended to make a distinction among the truths they were able to communi* cate , some of which might be told to every body , while others were too sublime for common ears , and could only be revealed with safety in secret conclave to a privileged few . This reserve , it would seem , was but little better than mere pretence , because they published their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore have kept back nothing of much consequence , unless it was their contempt for the common superstitions of the day . But it was a part of the genius of the oriental schools , in which these sages were instructed , to delight in mysteries , and to wrap up wisdom in a garb of ceremonial mummery . The world had hi some measure outgrown this childish taste before the time of Cicero ; and he himself had been weaned from it by the wholesome training of practical life . He gives his opinions on the most delicate subjects with freedom , and at the same time with prudence . Without shocking the prejudices of his countrymen , he shows us plainly enough how much he was above them . M. de Gerando has hardly allowed to Cicero so conspicuous a place as he deserves in the history of philosophy , partly perhaps because he did little or nothing for the particular branch , to which our author principally attaches himself in the present work . He has also thrown him injudiciously into the commencement of the third period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of his writings , and may be ranked indifferently in the order of time with one or the other . His works are the finest fruit that remains to us of the ripe and manly age of ancient science ; and it seems very singular , that he should be assigned to the barbarous period that followed , merely because the progress of corruption had commenced in a different part // of the world , before the time in which he lived . In his account of the second period , our author dwells with suitable attention on the several sects of the Stoics , the Epicureans , and the Skeptics ; but on these subjects we must refer the reader to the work itself . The third period exhibits the decline and fall of philosophy from the brilliant state , in which we have been considering it , down to the lowest depth of degradation and wretchedness . In the long course of seven centuries , which this period includes , M. de Gerando distinguishes two principal groups or classes of writers , namely , the Alexandrian , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work is executed in a very masterly way , and is one of the most instructive and agreeable of all . The author has succeeded uncommonly well in compressing , within a moderate compass , a large mass of materials , on subjects not very familiar to the public . Our limits will not permit us to follow him in detail through his several divisions , and we must confine ourselves to a very few brief notices and extracts upon each . The doctrine of the Alexandrian Platonists reigned , without opposition , through the whole western world , from the beginning of our era till the revival of learning . It was adopted by the Christian Fathers , who concerned themselves with philosophy , and by the Arabians ; and was also professed and refined upon by the schoolmen . The founders of this system had succeeded to their own satisfaction , in reconciling the differences between Plato and Aristotle ; and the Stagyrite of the middle ages was an Alexandrian Platonist . It is rath&amp;r difficult to seize , and still more so to recapitulate within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary system . It has been done , however , by M. de Gerando , with much precision and correctness , in the following short passage . If it were necessary to reduce to a few principal tenets the entire doctrine of the New Platonists , we should state them as follows . . 1 . Pantheism . They identified the effect with its cause , and admitted the existence of only one substance . 2 . Spiritualism . This substance is mind ; matter is a mere negation . 3 . Idealism . Perceptions , and things perceived , are identical * and there can be no perception without such identity* // 4 . Mysticism . The only source of real knowledge is a union , or identification , of the human mind with the Divinity in a state of ecstacy. 5 . Magic . Spirits , or Genii , of an intermediate class between the human mind and the Divinity , may be made to appear and to affect the order of nature . ' Such were the five leading points of the philosophy , which prevailed without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creed of thinking men for eleven centuries . The new Platonists were in the first instance Pagans . Porphyry and Proclus , two of their most distinguished writers , were among the violent adversaries of Christianity . But after the controversy between the two religions ceased , the Christian Fathers gradually became reconciled to the Alexandrian philosophy . Plutarch , the biographer , was among the *tdherents of this monstrous creed ; and his daughter Asclepi. genia initiated Proclus into the magical mysteries , which she had been taught by her father . The emperor Julian was an ardent disciple of the same opinions ; and the sincere zeal with which he espoused them seems to have been the real principle of his opposition to Christianity , at that time particularly odious to the Alexandrians . It startles one at first to see men of unquestionable talent , of cultivated minds , and of the highest rank in society , embracing the belief , or rather employing the jargon , for it is really nothing else , of these wild enthusiasts . Our author exhibits in every part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and introduces his account of the Fathers with the following elegant enco*niums on the spirit of Christianity . The establishment of Christianity is the most sublime and charming spectacle presented by the annals of the human race . The notion of the Deity cleared of the gross fables , that had so long disguised it , was exhibited to the world in all its grandeur and purity , uniting the attributes of infinite power , wisdom and goodness , the characters of a first creating cause , and of an overruling Providence , that watches constantly over his creatures with paternal affection . The Gospel explained to us the deep mystery of our nature and destiny , and revealed to us the transitory character of the present life , and the sublimity of our origin and future prospects . It gave to us a perfect code of morals , which sanctifies all the social ties , purifies the natural affections , copsoles and supports // us in adversity , rewards us for every sacrifice , and inspires the most complete and generous forgetfulness of self . The Gospel represents the Divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commands us to worship him in spirit and in truth . It strengthens and sanctifies the notion of moral duty , by connecting it with religious feeling , and with the hopes and fears of future retribution . It breathes into the heart of each individual , and into the common frame of society , the new and living principle of love to God and man . Distracted with agonizing doubts , and crushed to the earth with a load of sorrows , the human race received with transport the revelation of this divine doctrine , which satisfied all their wishes , removed all uncertainties , and opened to the virtuous and the wretched the most encouraging prospects . How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those that bring good tidings . Such a system carried as it were in its effects internal evidence of its heavenly origin . There was also this distinct and peculiar blessing in the Christian dispensation , that it was not an exclusive gift , confined in its distribution to a select few , but addressed itself freely and equally to all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as large and general as the air . It even looked with a sort of partiality upon the poor and the humble , took by the hand such persons as the world had abandoned , visited the most obscure dwellings , and caressed little children with peculiar fondness . The mythological allegories of the pagans were probably intended as vehicles of sublime truth ; but they were only communicated to a few , and as a profound mystery . Their philosophers had arrived by meditation at the knowledge of many sound doctrines in theology and morals ; but these were still the subjects of grave dispute among the deepest thinkers , and could not be understood by the mass of mankind . This forgotten and neglected mass , nevertheless , covers the face of the world , performs all the labor , and endures all the sufferings ; and it was the precise object of Christianity to raise the character , and improve the condition of this portion of society . It debased the proud and exalted the humble ; and it viewed all men , of whatever condition or country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its primitive beauty , was the theory of our religion , and we see it realised in the early practice of the church . The first Christians were few in number , and under the influence of a firm faith , which with them had overcome the prejudices of education , and all interested motives . They were penetrated with the true spirit of their religion , and rose above the terrors of persecution , danger , and death itself . How admirable is their conduct , as described in the Acts of the Apostles , and the writings of the Fathers . They held everything in common , had but one heart and soul , were full of zeal in doing good , and patient in suffering evil , // 258 April , perfect patterns of kindness , generosity , and courage , real sages without knowing it , and they outdid in their humble walks of life the sublime virtues , which we admire in the conduct of the greatest and best men . ' The chapter on the philosophy of the Arabians is full of interesting matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The history , literary and political , of this nation is extremely curious . It is sketched in a masterly way by Gibbon , in one of the volumes of his Decline and Fall , but requires a separate work to do it justice ; and would well reward the labor and talent , that might be laid out upon it In intellectual and moral science the Arabians discovered little ; but they exhibited a good deal of keenness and industry in refining upon the Greeks . It is mentioned as a singular fact by our author , that Algarel , in his Destruction of Philosophers , anticipated the famous paradox of Hume in regard to the relation of cause and effect ; but employed it for a purpose precisely opposite . His object is to establish the credibility of miracles , by shewing that successive events have no other connexion excepting that of the order oftime ; and that a miracle may of course be wrought without contradicting any other existing law of *nature . It is well known , that Hume 's application of the theory was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another , entitled the Destruction of Philosophers destroyed . One of the most curious productions of the Arabian writers is the Self taught Philosopher , by Thophail of Seville . It seems to be a sort of metaphysical Robinson Crusoe ; and is mentioned by M. de Gerando in the following manner . About this time flourished at Seville , Thophail , a physician and author of the Self taught Philosopher . This singular and celebrated work has passed through several editions . It was translated into Latin in England , Holland , and Germany ; and met with great success , not only among the Arabians and the Jews , but even in later times , and especially in England . The Quakers relish it very much . Even the great Leibnitz declares , that he read it with extreme pleasure . *** ** This work , which is a sort of philosophical novel , proceeds upon a very ingenious supposition , which has since been repeatedly employed , and amongst others by Buffon . The author represents an individual , as thrown by accident in his infancy upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education whatever ; but arriving by the natural progress o* // his understanding and by meditation , at the knowledge of God and of his own intellectual and moral nature . This idea , though improbable perhaps in itself , is developed with great elegance . The philosophical theory is in substance that of the Alexandrian Platofists . The Arabian Crusoe , called by the author Hai Eba Jockdan , is supposed to discover in the course of his solitary walks and - reflections , that the only source of real knowledge is an immediate and mystical union with the divine mind in a state of ecstacy . In *one of these ecstacies he sees the heavenly sphere , the essence of which is immaterial , and the splendor beyond all expression . He here perceives a spiritual being , who is neither the first of beings , nor the sphere itself , nor yet entirely different from either ; as the image of the sun in a mirror is neither the sun nor the mirror , but something akin to both . He also sees in the inferior sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun in the first mirror reflected in a second . By this illustration he attempts to reconcile the variety of thinking substances with the Pantheism of the school to which he belonged . ' The account of the Arabians forms an episode in the history of the fourth epoch , which commences about the seventh century , when learning was at the lowest point throughout the Christian world , and finishes with its revival in modern Europe . It is thus wholly occupied with the philosophy of the dark ages . The intellectual night , which then prevailed , appears to us doubly gloomy , by its intervention in the order of time and place between the two brightest days in the civilization of the world . The first three or four centuries of this period are almost wholly barren , not only of interesting results , but of celebrated names . Isidore of Seville , Herbert , Pope Sylvester II. who is supposed to have introduced the Arabic numerals , and John the Scotchman , are almost the only persons whose reputations have come down to us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little was taught , but reading , singing , and arithmetic . The first impulse , that led to a better state of things , was given by the Arabians ; and , indeed , our forefathers seem to have been indebted to this miscreant race for almost everything valuable in their institutions , and habits , during the middle ages ; for their sciences , metaphysical and physical ; for their beautiful Gothic architecture , as they called it , the only . art that flourished among them ; and finally for the high sense of honor , which did so much to correct the existing vices in the frame // 260 April , of society , and to form the modern European character . Even the enmity of the Saracens was not without its positive advantages ; and the crusades , that were undertaken to drive them out of Palestine , had the effect of enlarging the general sphere of observation , and giving a new spring to intellect . In the eleventh century we begin to perceive the dawn of improvement in philosophy . A metaphysical controversy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monasteries , and which is not wholly foreign to the learning of the present day . This was the famous dis . ' pute between the Realists and the Nominalists , on the true nature of general notions or ideas . The Alexandrian phi .. losophy , which had hitherto prevailed in the schools , considered general ideas as the only things entitled to the name of realities . Matter , individual objects , were mere negations , unworthy the attention of thinking men , who could only satisfy their thirst for knowledge by an ecstatic and mystical union with the universal mind . This system appears to have been first called in question by one John , who suggested the new , and , at that time , monstrous and alarming heresy , that individuals are the real substances , and universals mere names or creatures of the intellect . Little , however , is known of this philosopher or his opinions . He was in all probability a very unpopular man , like most others who are , or pretend to be , wiser than their neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supposed , with any of the usual surnames of the irrefragable , the solemn , the subtle , the solid , the fundamental , the admirable , and the angelic , which they were in the habit of bestowing on ' each other ; and he is only recorded as plain John . Roselinus is said to have been his disciple , and is the first Nominalist of wbom we have any certain account ; but the theory was received at this time with general disapprobation , and did not begin to obtain favor till the revival of the controversy two or three centuries later . St Anselm , one of the lights of this age , treats with undisguised contempt those heretical logicians , who can not conceive the existence of color without a body , or intelligence without a mind . ' Such persons , he observes , ought not to be allowed to argue . The Saint 's opinion , in this latter point , seems to have been adopted . The doctrine of the Nominalists was formally condemned as heretical at the Council of // Soissons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and England . The nature of Anseim 's opinions on this head gives us a high idea of his general acuteness and sagacity , which are not less clearly shewn in his dialogue entitled , The Grammarian . In this work he discusses very seriously the questions , whether a grammarian be or be not a substance , and whether it be possible , that there should be a grammarian , who is not at the same time a man . Having settled these difficult points , he next proves to his own satisfaction , that man is not grammar , and that he who knows grammar is a grammarian . This learned and ingenious logician was archbishop of Canterbury . Abelard , and his disciple John of Salisbury , the two greatest scholars of the next age , took a part in this dispute ; but so little is known of the details of the affair , that it is not even certain on which side they enlisted . It would seem , however , that they professed a mitigated Realism , perhaps to avoid persecution , and save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undertakes to refute the theory of Roscelinus ; but his fame with the present generation rests principally on his correspondence with his celebrated female pupil Eloisa . In the following passage our author alludes to some of the principal circumstances in his life and history . The writings of Abelard , most of which are still unpublished , give us a very imperfect notion of his philosophical opinions ; but his history throws much light on that of the times . His life , though devoted wholly to study , to instruction , and to pious exercises , was still a stormy one , and was troitbled by constant persecutions . We learn from it several important particulars respecting the manners and notions of his contemporaries . We see , for example , that the masters , who were authorized to teach in public , received a salary from their pupils . We see the extraordinary zeal of the French youth of that day in the cause of leariiing ; the passionate interest , which was excited by the talents of the masters ; and the eager spirit of rivalship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thousands of pupils surrounded their professor , followed him to his retreat , and even encamped in the forest of Paraclete , in order to enjoy his instruction . Other doctors , jealous of his success , denounced him to the Pope 's legatees , and obtained a sentence of condemnation against him as a heretic at several Councils . The monks were so enraged at his reproofs , and perhaps at the reforms , which he was meditating , that they threatened him with steel and // poison . On the other hand , convents and abbeys contended with each other for the advantage of possessing him . The whole population of Paris took interest in his sufferings . Princes cultivated his friendship , and the Pope demanded an account of his opinions . Eloisa , the object of his love , and the first cause of his misfortunes , while she excelled him in sensibility , delicacy , and virtue , seems to have nearly equalled him in talents and learning . After they were separated , she became abbess of the Paraclete convent , and instructed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Abelard and Eloisa are read , even at the present day , with all the interest of a romance ; and present , at the same time , to the historian a valuable picture of the state of information and opinions at the time they were written . Abelard himself the principal figure in the group , is every way superior to the age with which he had been compelled to struggle , and combined the affectionate piety of Fenelon with a manliness and independence of feeling , that for the period were truly remarkable . *** He draws with precision the dividing line between the territories of faith and reason ; and holds that the former is subject to authority , the latter independent of it . He refutes the objections made by the monks to the study of the ancient philosophers , and recommends it to his pupils , observing , however , that he has never read any of them himself , and knows them only through the medium of St Austin . ' Albert the Great , and St Thomas Aquinas , commonly called the angelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . The latter is invested , in the poem of Dante , with the honorable office of introducing to him the philosophers of the schools , who are all stationed in Paradise , while the pagans , with Aristotle at their head , are condemned without ceremony to the oppositeregion . The account given by our author of these two worthies is somewhat particular , and very amusing ; but we have not room to extract it . Albert was especially famous as an alchymist and magician . In the following passage of one of his works , quoted in the original Latin by our author , he states that he had himself discovered the great secret of transmuting metals , not merely , it would seem , into gold and silver , but into the sun and moon . I began , ' says he , to labor diligently in decoctions and sublimations , in solutions and distillations , in curations and calcinations , in coagulations of aichymy , and in many other operations , until at last I discovered , that it was possible to transmute metals into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , I mean to write for the use of my friends and // 263 History of Philosophy . associates an easy and infallible method of doing this , but in such a style , that seeing they shall not see , and hearing shall not understand . ' His friends and associates must doubtless have been greatly obliged to him for his communicative disposition . Respecting his skill in magic , he makes the following remark . The reality of apparitions is proved by the evidence of Trismegistus and of Socrates . To reranve all doubt on the subject , I may add the testimony of my own experience , having raised them myself . ' Such were the speculations by which in those days a man achieved greatness . Albert and Thomas were both determined Realists , the opposite opinion having indeed for the time entirely disappeared . After these heroes of scholastic learning , rose up Duns the Scotchman , denominated the subtle doctor , better known to the public by the couplet , which Butler has dedicated to his memory , than by all his own works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been In school divinity as able , As he that hight irrefragable , - A second Thomas , or at once To name them all-another Duns The Doctor , hight irrefragable , was Alexander of Hales . Duns like all his contemporaries was a Realist , and exhibited much of his peculiar subtlety in attempting to solve a problem , which then greatly exercised the learned , respecting what was called the principle of individuality . If Peter and John both possess alike the generic character of humanity , which , on the system of the schoolmen , was the only thing about them that had any real existence ; in what consists their individuality ? Or , in plainer language , since Peter and John are both men , in what do they differ from each other , and what is it that makes one Peter and the other John * The question , thus stated , and addressed to a plain man , would not appear a very difficult one . On the principles of the schoolmen it was absolutely insoluble , or rather could never be started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only things really existing ; individuals were nothing , and of course could have no principle , either of existence , or of distinction from each other . The very proposition of this problem . was therefore , a proof that the system of Realism had begun to // degenerate from its pristine purity . But the schooliner* having once started it , and not perceiving that it was insoluble on their principles , went on pecking at it from generation to generation , and furnished twenty different answers to it , most of which were equally at variance with each other , with common sense , and with the principles of those who gave them . St Thomas , however , whose favorite field of researcir was among the angels , whence his title of the angelic doebr , and who did not perhaps think a problem relating to merely human matters , a proper occasion for the exercise of all his supernatural sagacity , answers the question very much as any plain person probably would at the present day . The individuality of Socrates , ' he observes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we presume , a particular conformation of flesh and bones makes a man Socrates , and another makes him Plato . This solution is plausible enough , and properly explained might be considered satisfactory . It is obviously , however , quite inconsistent with the received notions of the schoolmen , St Thomas himself included , who did not admit the reality of flesh and bones ; and it must have been generally regarded , at that time , as involving a most gross and material error . Duns solves the problem in a much more elegant way . The individuality of Peter , ' he remarks , lies in his Petreity or Peterness ; and the precise reason why he is Peter , and not John is , that in him humanity is combined with Petreity , while in John the additional ingredient is Johnnity . ' This , we apprehend , will be regarded as the ne plus ultra of refinement . The force of dulness could no farther go . It only remained for Raymond Lully to invent the grand art of solving all possible problems by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill 's arithmetic for writing poetry by the multiplication table . This paltry piece of mechanism was considered as something more than human ; and the inventor of it looked upon himself , and was generally regarded by others , as a man divinely inspired . Roger Bacon , who flourished about the same time , and whose real merit is but little inferior to that of his more celebrated namesake , Lord Verulan-i , and of a similar kind , was comparatively unknown to his contemporaries , though styled by them with justice the wonderful doctor . He was prohibited by the monks of his // order from publishing any of his works ; while bully , by grinding out philosophy as a barrel organist makes music , excited the enthusiastic admiration of the scientific world for two or three centuries . The vogue that attended this charlatan is looked upon with justice by M. de Gerando , as one of the curious forms of human weakness ; and seems to have attracted a good deal of his attention . He mentions , in the present work , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoirs , which are published in the transr actions of the Institute , but which we have not had the opportunity to examine . The dispute on the principle of individuality , just alluded to , resolved itself as we have seen into the old argument between the Nominalists and the Realists on the nature of general ideas . The revival of this controversy , in the beginning of the fourteenth century , and the final triumph of the Nominalists or rational party over their adversaries , mimarks , in the judgment of our author , the commencement 3f the refor- , mation of philosophy , and closes the fourth period of its history . William Ockham , an Englishman residing on the continent , was the leader of the Nominalists . His opinions , though they ultimately prevailed , gained ground rather slowly . F*is logic ; was condemned by the Parliament of Paris in 1339 , and his ; followers persecuted and banished by Louis XI ; but common sense finally carried the day . The reign of dulness and ignorance had indeed for some time been tending towardsj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the study of : the classical writers , was making rapid progress .
