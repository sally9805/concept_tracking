ART . XVI. -i . .1 Review of the plan of Education in South Carolina . Columbia , S. C. 1821. 2. address to the Graduates of the South Carolina College ; December 1821 . By Thomas Cooper , Al . D. President of the College . IT is remarked by Dr. Ramsay , that the settlement of Carolina ' was nearly coeval with the institution of the royal society of London , and began at a time when Addison , Boerhave , Barrow , Fenelon , Hall , Locke , Milton , Newton , Rollin , Sydney , Sydenham , Sloane , Tillotson , Watts , and many other sons of intellect , were living and enlightening the world with the beams of knowledge . Though few , if any , of the early settlers of the province were learned men , yet they brought with them general ideas of European literature . ' The doctor appears to intimate , in this array of great names , that some light may have been reflected from them on the infant settlement of Carolina . It is however only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , that all these luminaries can be made contemporaries . Of the labors of one of them , from whom , as the formal legislator of that colony , something might have been expected , the author of the seasonable pamphlet before us , expresses himself in the following decided manner . One will not be surprised , when he has read the number of stumpid and illiberal things contained in Locke 's Constitution for South Carolina , ( for instance , such as prohibiting the existence of lawyers , and of commentaries and reports on legal subjects*compel .. ling a man to worship some god publiclq , or be driven from society and the protection of the law-giving absolute power to the master over his negro slaves , &amp;c. which show a great want of philosophy as well as Christianity , ) that he should have made no provision whatever , in his government , for education . I rejoice that our ancestors expelled it with contempt and indignation , as the unworthy offspring of a writer on the mind and republics . He apologised for one clause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Indeed , Carolina was not indebted for the first efficient efforts made in that province , for the promotion of literature , to any of the shining luminaries mentioned in Dr Ramsay 's catalogue ; but to a man , whose name most of our readers will probably hear now for the first time  --  a Dr BRAY - by whose liberality chiefly it was , that libraries were early // established in Charleston , and the other parishes into which the province was then divided . In 1700 , the legislature took these libraries into its own care , and appointed commissioners to loan out the books . Following up this salutary beginning , in 1710 and 1712 , the legislature Jounded a free school in Charleston , on a pretty large scale , and schools in the other parishes , on a less extensive plan . The preceptor of the free school was to receive ? 100 , and the country masters ? 10 , per annum , ' to be paid out of the public treasury . ' Donations were also made by private individuals to found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus mentions one of them The academy at Childbury with its little cupola , situated near Strawberry-ferry on Cooper river , is now in ruins , and is the habitation of owls and bats . Just by , is a romantic little church , with its grave-yard and solemn grove of live oaks , from whose large and spreading branches masses of grey moss hang , with almost architectural arrangement , picturing to the fancy of the classical enthusiast gothic arches , festoons , and all the variety of tapestry and ornaments ; and where the writer has often seen the prowling fox , loitering in the dusk of evening , with his mewing whine , awaiting nightfall , when he may prey upon the poulti'y of the neighbouring tavern , where the reader , should he ever travel for the gratification of romantic night-thoughts , church-yard walks , and good lodging , may be gratified in them all . ' - p. 10 . Nothwithstanding this liberality , both of the legislature and of private lovers of literature , the colony still lacked the means of affording such an education as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the European colleges ; and none of the British provinces , ' says Ramsay , in proportion to their numbers , sent so many of their sons to Europe for education as South Carolina . ' This disadvantage continued to be more and more felt , until , in the year 1769 , a bill was introduced into the legislature , to found a provincial college . Such , however , was the prevalence of aristocratical prejudice ,  --  such the fear , that , by facilitating the acquisition of a liberal education , the conditions of men would he equalized ,  --  that the project entirely failed . The revolution purified the atmosphere of this kind of influence ; and , as soon as peace was fairly established , in 1785 , the legislature , it should seem , were determined to make up for the discomfiture of 1769 , and instituted three colleges on the same day ,  --  one in Charleston , one in // LApril , Winnsborougb , near the centre of the state , and the third in Cambridge , near its western extremity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite extreme . These colleges , in due time , sunk into mere grammar-schools , and still continue in the same state . In* 1795 , the citizens of Beau .. fort obtained another charter for a college ; but that soon shared the fate of the three others ; and it was not until the year 1801 , that the legislature hit upon the proper plan . In that year a law was passed , with unexampled unanimity , ' as Dr Ramsay informs us , to found a college , to he called the South Carolina college , at Columbia , the seat of government . The chief executive and judicial officers of the state , with thirteen associates elected by the legislature for a term of four years , constitute the trustees , who possess the sole power of inflicting the punishment of expulsion , and a negative on all suspensions . With these exceptions , the government of the college is in the hands of the faculty . ' The trustees having been empowered to make choice of certain public squares in Columbia , for a site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south-east of the city , commanding a view of the country for many miles around not indeed like the view from the state-house in Boston embracing villages , steeples , and country houses , with the bay and its numerous islands , but affording to the north and west a prospect of the capital of South Carolina , one of the finest villages perhaps in America , with a population of three or four thousand inhabitants , and as refined a society as our country affords , and overlooking to the south an immense forest , of twenty or thirty miles in extent , and now and then interrupt-. ed in the uniformity of its appearance by some great cotton field , that stretches itself along the immense plains , through which the Congaree winds its way between its willoxv banks . ' The number and construction of the college edifices , as set forth by our author , appear adequate to the purposes of the institution , though with a brick building designed as an observatory , and the astronomical apparatus kept in it , he makes himself somewhat merry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was selected by general Pinkney , judge De Saussure , and judge Johnson . The smallness of the library is a just subject of complaint ; and we must be permitted to remark it as somewhat inconsistent with that claim to liberality , of which Carolinians so justly boast , that , after making such // ample provisions for planting a college , they should furnish so scanty a stock of the very pabulum , upon which it must subsist . If the three first essentials of oratory be action , the three first requisites of a college are books ; and we think it was a fine conceit in the ten clergyu*en , who founded Yale college , that the only act necessary for the purpose was , each to bring three or four large books , and lay them on a table , saying , I give these books for the founding of a college . ' Five thousand volumes would scarcely be considered as a decent library for a private gentleman in Europe . Our author mentions several persons in this country , who have twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he adds , a late writer in the clerk 's office in Charleston had 2 or 3000 ; and will an independent sovereignty confine the whole body of her youth to 5000 ? * The faculty of the college consists of the president , a professor of the languages , a professor of mathematics , mechanical philosophy and astronomy , a professor of logic and moral philosophy , and a professor of chemistry and mineralogy . There are also two tutors , who superintend the freshman class . The salary of the president is 3500 dollars ; that of the professors , 2000 ; that of the tutors , 1000 . There is but one vacation in the year , which includes the months of July , August , and September , and the annual commencement is holden in December . The course of studies prescribed resembles in general that which is followed at similar institutions in our country . It does not appear designed to introduce the students to a familiar acquaintance with ancient literature , and of course leaves them without that discrimination in the use of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , which can only be derived from the study of the ancient authors . An additional objection to the limited range prescribed to the study of the Latin and Greek is , that if more be not learned , the beginning made is worthless* and the student is condemned to waste years in the irksome and unprofitable task of conquering the elements of a language , of which he does not pursue the study far enough , to read its authors with ease or pleasure . We are happy to perceive , however , that an improvement has been made in this respect . By the former system of study , all attention to the learned * There are five or six well selected private libraries of four or five thou . *and volumes in our immediate vicinity . // languages ceased at the expiration of the freshman year . They are now studied throughout the college life , although the selection of authors to be read is quife limited . The legislature of South Carolina has manifested a praiseworthy liberality in its appropriations for the support of the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pains of constructing a table to show the yearly and total expenses of South Carolina college ; and from his results it appears , that the appropriations increased during the period between 1811 and 1820 , from 10,000 to upwards of 15,000 ( dollars a year ; the whole sum , for that time , being 138,659 dollars . Up to the year 1811 , where our author 's table commences , the annual and special appropriations had amounted to 148,000 dollars ; so that the total sum of appropriations is 286,659 dollars . Among the articles , which make up this sum , we observe one of 3 or 400 dollars a year for the education of orphans . ' In 1811 the legislature passed an act , empoxvei*ing the commissioners of the orphan house in Charleston annually to select one of the boys educated and maintained by the bounty of that institution , for the purpose of completing his education at colic e . The expenses of such youth , except for clothing , are to be defrayed from the general appropriations to the college ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of 140 dollars to each individual . Our remarks thus far regard the college of South Carolina . We must now devote a little space to those minor institutions , in which are taught the primary elements of learning ,  --  reading , writing , and arithmetic . ' This is the language of an act passed in 1811 , to establish , in every district of the state , as many fi'ee schools as each district respectively sent n*embers to the house of representatives . By free is meant that the tuition only is free to every citizen of the commonwealth : but , where the citizens are too numerous , the children of the necessitous and poor orphans are to be preferred . These schools are placed under the care of commissioners ; who have full power of appointing teachers , determining the situation of schools , increasing or diminishing their number , arranging the system of instruction , of drawing on the comptroller for sums appropriated , ' &amp;c . Three hundred dollars per annum were voted to each school , until sufficient funds should be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriation of 37,000 dollars a year , // which has been ever since regularly continued . Of the sums annually drawn out of the treasury by the commissioners , from 1812 to 1820 , our author has constructed a table ; from which it appears , that , for those . eight years , 302,490 dollas bad been expended by the state , upon this sy*stem of elementary education . But expended by the state ' does not mean expended by the commissioners . ' That these latter did not expend the money , as they ought , our author does not take it upon him to say ; but he proves , by a laborious investigation , that they have not , as they ought , accounted for the expenditure of upwards of 100,000 dollars . And it appears , indeed , from the results presented in the pamphlet before us , that this bountiful system of charity , like most bountiful systems of the same kind , must have been egregiously mismanaged , and has come to little good . In 1813 , for instance , nearly 40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account given of it whatever . Nearly the same sum was taken out in 1817 ; in which year there were no returns from thirty-one districts , and , with this large sum , there was no evidence , that the education of more than 2,237 children was paid for ! These are only specimens ; and truly they furnish our author a fair opportunity of referring to some of those instances of gross abuse in charters , which Mr Brougham 's investigations in England have recently brought to light , and which , from a case mentioned in p. 39 , appear to grow up as well in this country as in England . I shall , ' says our author , fatigue the reader no longer with instances of abuses in foreign nations , but will barely mention that I have been informed , that one of our sister states , north of us , is at present a striking example of the difficulty of succeeding in this kind of charity schools . It is said , that in that state , many of the commissioners have actually hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools , have their names registered , and after a short attendance , to decamp . The commissioner and master understand each other ; the account for teaching the year or quarter so many scholars is made out , and paid , and thus the money is accounted for , and the plan to the legislature seems to be succeeding most prosperously ; - at least the money is welt spent . ' p. 39 . What has been the particular mode of management in South Carolina our author has not stated ; but he appeals to results. , as furnishing evidence of the imperfection of the system , either // Apri* , in design or execution . Of its actual operation in some places , he has given us a glimpse , which , to our readers in this part of the country , will appear almost too ludicrous to be credible I believe , in many instances , the teachers that have been employed , were as much in want of ins*uctioii as their pupils . I II ave heard that in some of the lower districts , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academies ; where , instead of studying philosophy in the woods and groves , as the Druids did of old , they take delight in the more athletic exercise of deer and rabbit huntino* and that it is a fine sight to see the long , lean , serpentine " master , " with his dial thce and greasy rifle , looking like a very surveyor , at his stand , whilst the younger peripatetics are scouring the woods , and hallooing up the garne. * p. 44 . Contrasted with these results of the free school system , our author displays the benefits , which the college has conferred upon South Carolinian society ; and thence derives a strong argument , to convince the legislature how much wiser it would be to endow new professorships in the college , increase its li .. brary , and improve it in other respects , with a part of their 37,000 dollars , than to appropriate it all in a manner in which , at best , its utility is inferior , and in which it is so likely to be mismanaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the college , our author makes the following remark , though it admits , perhaps , of question , whether all the effect should be ascribed to the college at Columbia alone , since it is well known that large numbers of the young men of Carolina are annually sent to Princeton , New-Haven , Providence , and Cambridge. * Some years ago , the middle and back country scarcely had a man who was weff educated ; and to many of the good old folks , when the wonders of the college came upon them , it appeared that all these curious inventions of chemistry , Greek , Latin , &amp;c. had just been discovered since the revolutionary war  --  the event frotu which every thing that is excellent is dated . Now there is not a neioh bourhood that has not intelli gesit , well educated young men . Th* young men , who have received liberal educations in this state , have a spirit and vivacity in conversation , that is not very common to any other nation , save the French . This gives them considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be We observe even in the late catalogue of the flourishing university at Lcxin*ton , Kentucky , the names of south Carolinians. // ascertained by comparing the present situation of South Carolina with its condition before the establishment of this college ,  --  when all the refinement , all the influence and talents of the state were concentrated in Charleston ; when the people in Charleston thought the upper country inhabited with savages , ( some remnant of the same opinion remains still , ) and thos&amp;of the upper country thought the inhabitants of Charleston a womanish , enfeebled race of cits . ' Before closing this article , we beg leave to say a word of the judicious address of president Cooper , which we have named at the head of the article . It contains , in plain and perspicuous language , a series of very valuable remarks , ad-. dressed to the young gentlemen about to become graduates at the last commencement . We sincerely rejoice that the state of society is such , we will not say in South Carolina alone , but in any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professional study , as this address prescribes , can any where even be recommended . We do not suppose that the mass of candidates who crowd into any of the professions , will allow themselves to be delayed by the noviciate which president Cooper marks out . But it augurs well to the cause of education , that a thorough course of reading in civil and continental law is enjoined on the student of law ; and an acquaintance with the original language of the Old Testament and with the writings of the fathers of the four first centuries declared essential to the theologian ; and classical literature to all engaged in these or any other professional pursuits . if we were to take any exceptions to the opinions of this judicious address , it would be to those which are expressed in dispar .. agement of the art of oratory . While we unite with president Cooper in reprobating all abuses of that art , and every application to wrong ends of the power which it confers , we can not allow that the whole history of ancient oratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating the understandings of a gaping populace , by amusing their imaginations and exciting their passions ; and that all modern oratory is to be held in the same estimation . ' This seems to us at once an incorrect and a superficial view. - By public speaking in legislative , judicial , political , and religious assemblies , the highest temporal and eternal interests of men are most powerfully affected . Laws are made and abrogated , governments administered , preserved or overturned , justice dispensed , wrongs inflicted or redressed , the opinions men cherish on the highest points of moral and // 318 April , religious concernment decided , and the whole complex social system in all its relations affected , by public speaking . Why then the art of doing this , the art of speaking well , should be a cheat in ancient or modern times , we see not . Does the president mean that to possess one 's faculties before a formidable assembly , to speak the right word in the right place , to feel the intellectual and moral pulse of a mingled crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and address them seasonably , judiciously , and effectually ; to accompany what you speak with proper corresponding movements of the wonderful bodily organization which nature has made to act in sympathy with the soul ,  --  does the president mean that this is that studied premeditated oratory which savors either of vanity or fraud ? ' Is it not the hardest thing which ifian can attempt , to do all this in perfection , without affectation , without extravagance ? He who studies to be eloquent , will never study to be wise ; a dealer in tropes , metaphors , allegories and similes , is seldom a dealer in facts . ' Did not Pericles and Demosthenes study to be wise ; did not Cicero , did not Chatham and Burke study to be wise ? Eloquence is not one thing and wisdom another . Eloquence is wisdom speaking or wisdom writing ; and as for tropes and metaphors , to which the president testifies such aversion , there are not many sentences in his own well written address , that do not contain a tropical or metaphorical expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four lines , in which their use is condemned . Most language is tropical ; and if the meaning of the president 's precept is , that impertinent , unseasonable use of figurative language should be avoided , it is one part of the art of oratory , to teach the speaker to avoid it . The president approves that eloquence of the heart , which arises naturally , spontaneously from warmth of feeling in the course of debate . ' We approve it too , but what is to give this eloquence of the heart , the power of modulating the voice , perhaps a feeble voice , so that it shall be heard through a vast hall by a crowd ; what shall give it a happy ease and command of language , what shall furnish it with illustrations , instances , arguments , replies , ready distinctions against plausible objections , and furnish these too , in the hurry and press of a passionate debate ? Put down an eloquent savage in congress , Logan or Red Jacket himself ; would he be able to keep the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments , previous ques // tions , and personalities ? Put him down again in a court of justice ; would he be able to lay a complicated train of facts intelligibly before the minds of a common jury , or direct the bench through a maze of almost equally balanced analogies , in a question of law ? The heart is very honest , and must furnish , we grant , the orator 's inspiration ; and must itself be warmed by nature . But words , speech , action , debate , these are things , which nothing but the most laborious study , and the longest practice can enable the heart to command to best advantage . It is some consolation that this is no new theory , though a theory more reasonable we can not imagine ; for the greatest orators of ancient and modern times have united genius and study in equal degrees .
