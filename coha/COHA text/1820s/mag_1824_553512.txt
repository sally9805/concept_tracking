By C. J. INGERsOLL . Philadelphia . A. Small . 8vo. pp. 67 . SEVEN or eight years ago the plan of the American Philosophical Society was enlarged , by instituting a committee of history , moral science , and literature . Its objects before that period were confined chiefly to the natural sciences , to mathematics , astronomy , physical philosophy , medicine , natural history , chemistry , trade and commerce , mechanics , architecture , and husbandry . This new arrangement has given a much wider scope to the exertions of the Society , and enabled it to enlist a greater amount of active talent in promoting its liberal purposes . Our stock of historical knowledge has already been enriched by the curious and valuable papers , which the committee has published , concerning the manners , characteristics , and languages of the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zeal and vigilance of this branch of the Society , several manuscripts of early date have been brought to light , some of which are now preparing to meet the public eye . On a former occasion we presented to our readers a notice of the eloquent and interesting anniversary discourse , delivered by the corresponding secretary of the historical and literary committee. * The one now before us by Mr Ingersoll * See a review of Mr Dupouccan 's Discourse in our Number for *pri1 , 1822 , Art . XMII. // was the next in succession . The subject , which the author has chosen , is deeply interesting and of broad extent , claiming the attention not more of the lovers of knowledge , than of the friends of American improvement . In tracing the influence of America on the mind , the author is led into a review of the progress and tendency of our political establishments , and the springs of our civil and social , mental , literary , and scientific advancement , from all which he is conducted to results most encouraging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the enduring fexture and renovating spirit of our free institutions . He pursues his argument by way of a comparison between this country and the countries of Europe , pointing out as he proceeds the advantages we enjoy by having thrown off the shackles of an entailed despotism , which , in some of its forms , still oppresses and afflicts nearly all the inhabitants of the old continents . Mr Ingersoll approaches this subject with a mind evidently accustomed to enlarged thought and close reflection ; and , by the diligence of his research , the amplitude of his knowledge , and his philosophical views of men , principles , and events , he has proved himself adequate to his difficult undertaking . He speaks of things as they are , and rests his positions on the immovable basis of reason and truth ; nor can we deem it a trifling achievement , that , in discussing a topic of so general a nature , the fruitful soil of theory and speculation , he has perseveringly avoided the path into which most persons would have been tempted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor sees prophetic visions ; but , standing on the solid ground of fact , he collects his materials from the storehouses of reality , and combines them into things , which have a shape and a being . This trait of his discourse invests it with a practical value , rarely to be met with in compositions of a similar kind , and inspires a confi-. dence in his facts and general statements , which every one feels to be well placed . But we can not better convey our impressions of the merits of this performance , than by drawing out some of its leading parts . The author begins with what he justly considers the first spring of human improvement , as well as the sustaining pillar of American liberty and happiness , namely , the education of // the young , and public provisions for the support of schools He tells us , that public funds for the education of the whole community are endowments exclusively American , which have been in operation here for several ages , whilst the most improved governments of Europe are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them dread , and others dare not risk . ' Well would it be for the world , if this latter clause were not too true , and the time were come , when the kings and great ones of the earth should see no frightful omens in the progress of intelligence , and feel no thrills of alarm at the natural struggles of men to become free . In this country , almost from the first arrival of the pilgrim band at Plymouth , public attention has been drawn to schools . Nearly two hundred years ago funds were appropriated for this purpose , and the paternal solicitude of our ruling powers , in the cause of education , has become a deep woven trait in our fundamental institutions . By the constitution of the United States , ' says Mr Ingersoll , it is the duty of government to promote the progress of science and the useful arts . Not one of the eleven new states has been admitted into the Union without provision in its constitution for schools , academies , colleges , and universities . In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to education , and they claim a share in the great landed investments , which are mortgaged to it in the new states . Reckoning all those contributions federal and local , it may be asserted , that nearly as much as the whole national expenditure of the United States is set apart by laws to enlighten the people . The public patronage of learning in this country , adverting to what the value of these donations will be before the close of the present century , equals at least the ostentatious bounties con* ferred on it in Europe . In one state alone , with but 275 000 inhabitants , more than forty thousand pupils are instructed at the public schools . I believe we may compute the number of such pupils throughout the United States at more than half a million . In the city of Philadelphia , without counting the private or the charity schools , there are about five thousand pupils in the Commonwealth 's seminaries , taught reading , writing , and arithmetic , at an expense to the public of little more than three dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States are receiving school education . Besides the multitudes at school , there are considerably more than three thousand under graduates always matriculated at the various colleges and universities , authorized to grant academical degrees ; not less than twelve hundred at the // medical schools ; several hundred at the theological seminaries ; and at least a thousand students of law . ' We apprehend that our sentiments do not fully harmonize with those of the author , concerning the value of the ancient languages , as a branch of study for American youth . Forcible reasons can no doubt be urged , why the study of these languages will for a long time be more limited in this country , than in Europe , but we would fain believe it a deceptive vision , which bodes the day , when they will perish under the mass of knowledge destined to occupy entirely the limited jpowers of the human understanding . ' The varieties of moral and physical nature are exhaustless ; they can never be explored ; and as the world grows older , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiplying discoveries and inventions , disclosing fuew facts in science , contriving new devices in art , and thus extending indefinitely the fields of knowledge , the period must arrive , when a long and industrious life will he too short to compass all necessary attainments . But even then , we should hope a remnant may be spared to visit the groves and cull the flowers of antiquity , to go up to the fountain and drink the pure waters , to draw something from the sources , whose treasures have enriched the empire of thought and sentiment , fancy and taste , for many hundred years . To say nothing of the excellent discipline , which the young mind receives in studying a language so admirable in its artificial forms , as the Latin or Greek , to say nothing of its effects to sharpen his faculties by leading him to discriminate the nicer shades in the meaning of words , and to detect the bearing and force of one part of speech on another , which , in those highly polished languages , is always an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits , worthy in themselves of the highest consideration , there are other reasons why the study of the ancient languages ought to be fostered in our schools . The men , who wrote in these languages , were ornaments of their species ; the works they have left are the choicest models of human composition ; refined in taste , elegant in diction , rich in imagery ; distinguished by a deep insight into the nature of man , the springs of passion , the impulses of feeling , and motives of action . These models are the transcripts of nature ; the mind formed on them willi // gain the refinement bestowed by culture , without losing the native strength too apt to be diminished by a redundance of artificial applications . But they possess a still rarer virtue . Time was when the Greeks were free ; they thought , and spoke , and wrote as freemen ; the poets and orators , the philosophers and historians , equally caught the spirit and assumed the tone of liberty and self government . These are the seeds , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . However fantastically they may have shot up on some occasions , however abortively they may have put forth in the German universities and secret societies of Europe , however licentiously they may have run riot in the French revolution , no such difficulties or dangers can be apprehended here . Our institutions are firm and well balanced ; the impulse of Greek and Roman liberty will tend to preserve the equal action of their several parts ; we have nothing to fear from excess , because we have been too long in possession of the sober reality to be made giddy with the day dreams of romance . Greater is the danger , that we shall forget our distinguished privileges , than that we shall value them too highly , or talk of them too much . In connexion with a series of judicious remarks on the progress of literature in the United States , the author justly observes , that , notwithstanding the preeminence held over us by European countries in attainments , which time only can mature , yet in the literature of fact , of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' they have by no means left us so far behind . Our domestic literature is adequate to our immediate wants , and the demand has never risen above the supply . The learned professions are full ; schools of law , medicine , and divinity are numerous , and competent to educate as many students as are required in these departments of life . We do not abound in the luxuries of literature , and for a very good reason , we want other things more ; and it is natural that we should look to our wants , before we begin to pamper our taste . Another rea son is , that we have this kind of manufacture already fabricated to our hands ; the market is so well supplied from abroad , that our men of genius find their wits much more profitably employed in other pursuits . In whatever tends to dilThse useful intelligence , to elicit thought , invigorate the A'en ' Series , . JVo. 17. 21 // mind , and btiild up the structure of society on the basis of just principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities , will find its way to the best market . The field of political science is so broad under our forms of government , and the reward of political distinction so speedy and liberal , that we can not be surprised at seeing many in this road to eminence , who , in other countries , would be induced to court the muses , and loiter in the haunts of ornamental literature . Utility is the watchword of American genius ; it loves to contrive and operate for the good of man ; it is better pleased to improve the arts and increase the solid comforts of life , than to embellish its less substantial forms . In this respect it accords with the spirit of our government , and with our condition as a young and rising people . When we grow older , and have more leisure , more wants , and more wealth , we can afford to indulge in luxuries , our appetites will be sharpened , we can spare a portion of the effective talent of the community to provide delicacies , and the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fancy and taste , than it now is in the fruits of a practical invention , and wise maxims of political science . The publication of books , ' observes Mr Ingersoll again , is so much cheaper in this country than in Great Britain , that nearly all we use are American editions . According to reports from the Custom Houses , made under a resolution of the Senate in 1822 , it appears that the importation of books bears an extremely small proportion to the American editions . The imported books are the mere seed . It is estimated that between two and three millions of dollars worth of books are annually published in the United States . It is to be regretted , that literary property here is held by an imperfect tenure , there being no other protection for it than the provisions of an inefficient act of Congress , the impotent offspring of an obsolete English statute . The inducement to take copy rights is therefore inadequate , and a large proportion of the most valuable American books are published without any legal title . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased from January 1822 to April 1823 . There have been eight editions , comprising 7500 copies of Stewart 's Philosophy published here since its appearance in Europe thirty years ago . Five hundred thousand dollars was the capital invested in one edition of Rees ' Cyclopoedia . Of a lighter kind of reading , nearly 200,000 copies of the Waverly novels , comprising 500,000 volumes , have issued from the American press in the last nine years . Four thousand // copies of a late American novel were disposed of immediately on its publication . Five hundred dollars were paid by an enterprising bookseller for a single copy of one of these novels , without any copy right , merely by prompt republication to gratify the eagerness to read it . ' These interesting particulars bring to mind a subject , which has for sometime past excited the attention of many of our most enlightened men ; we mean the duty on books . it is justly deemed a matter of serious regret , that a statute should still be retained in our revenue laws , which operates as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time yields so meagre a pittance to the national treasury . The duty is fifteen per cent on the invoice price of books , which , by other incidental charges at the custom house , is increased to nearly eighteen ; that is , for all books purchased from abroad , we pay the amount of one sixth of their cost to the government . This feature in our laws will appear the more remarkable , when contrasted with tire policy of other nations , whose institutions and liberal spirit we have not been taught to consider superior to our own . Every one knows the rapid advancement , which learning has made in Germany during the last half century , and one of the chief causes is allowed to have been the direct encouragement afforded to it by the Protestant Governments ; So far from imposing duties on foreign hooks , they have granted every possible facility to tempt booksellers to bring them into the country . Even the transportation of books in the public post waggons is charged at a lower rate than other articles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on less enlightened principles , than the governments of Germany , they have nevertheless been guided by a policy much more liberal than ours . As for England , she has kept on her duties , and perhaps such a course was expedient ; but it has proved unfavorable to knowledge . Great Britain has been tardy in adopting the improvements in science , and imbibing the spirit of enlarged literature , which have gained ground on the continent . She has made her own books , and read them , and in some branches of knowledge has been content* ed to loiter far behind her neighbors . The republic of Colombia imposes no duties on books . // The only arguments for a duty on books we suppose to be , its benefits to the treasury , and its encouragement to the home manufacture . In regard to the first , the revenue de .. rived from books is so extremely small , as hardly to make a perceptible item in the custom house returns . For several years it has not been more than five thousand dollars annually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has fallen short of that amount . The weakness of this argument , therefore , will at once be seen , and especially when it is recollected , that the slender acquisition thus produced to the revenue , is so much taken from the efficient means of intelligence in the country . A slight examination will prove the other argument not less groundless . Mr Ingersoll states , that books to the value of between two and three millions of dollars are annually published in the United States . According to this statement , the amount of books published at home , is to the amount of those imported , in a ratio of about ninety to one . It can hardly be thought , that a protecting duty is wanted to encourage a manufacture , which enjoys so complete a monopoly , not from the aid of the laws , but from local circumstances . In truth , it is not wanted . Nearly all books , for which there is demand enough to warrant an edition , can be supplied by our publishers for less than half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active booksellers , whose interest the duty is intended to protect , do not desire it to be continued . They would be less subject to losses front miscalculation , in regard to the success of a new edition , if a larger number *f copies were imported , and the probable demand ascertained by a more general expression of public sentiment . It may , indeed , be doubted , whether a single work is republished in this country , under the present system , which would not find its way through the press with equal speed , if all duties were removed . None but the most popular works are now reprinted , and while these can be done so much cheaper than in England , imported copies can never interfere with the sale . Books in the ancient and foreign languages we lay out of the account , because these will not for many years be printed at all , except in a cheap and jrnperfect form to supply schools . // The mischievous tendency of this branch of our revenue laws is seen in a more glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it excludes from the country , and the description of persons on whom the burden falls . Books most needed for the benefit of the country , books of science containing accounts of the latest discoveries and inventions , books in the learned professions , which qualify our jurists , physicians , and divines for filling with intelligence and usefulness the stations they hold , these are the works on which the restricting law acts with the greatest severity . The demand for much the largest , and most valuable portion of these works , is too limited to call out editions in this country . Who does not see that the community is the chief sufferer ? Professional men have an influence on the public in proportion to the sphere in which they move , and it is of high importance , that they should be men of knowledge , light , and prudence ; they need the aids to be derived from the wisdom and experience of others , who have gone before them in the same pursuits ; new facts are every day coming to light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mysteries of nature are perpetually yielding to discoveries in science , which the ingenuity of our countrymen might turn to public advantage , if they could have access to them as they occur . To this list we may add the accurate and elegant editions of the ancient authors , which alone can be valuable to a scholar . Now the kind of books to which we have here adverted are of solid value , and essential to the progress of useful knowledge among us ; but they are always costly , because the sale is small . Their original price rises above the means of most of our purchasers , and when the duty is added it amounts to an absolute prohibition . Far better would it be to grant a bounty on the importation of such books , than to exclude them by an onerous duty , which produces nothing to the government , and lends no aids to publishers . J1'urthermore , the persons from whom the duty is exacted are those least able to pay such a charge . They are commonly young men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an education , or men in the professions , whose income does not allow them to go beyond the limits of necessity , in purchasing books . Can any thing // be more impolitic , or more hostile to the best interests of a republican state , than to throw impediments in the way of such men , or to diminish a single advantage by which they may attain to higher usefulness ? If we look for safety in our political establishments , and happiness in the circles of society , as no doubt every one does , from the power of enlightened intellect and the right use of knowledge , we ought to be instructed by the counsels of wisdom to afford as many aids as possible to those classes , small in numbers and usually far from affluent in circumstances , whose business it is either to teach the young , or to go out into spheres of life , where they contribute more than any other class to influence the minds and morals , form the character , and direct the destinies of the people at large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unequally , and impolitic to set up such a barrier to the progress of improving talent and efficient skill . Universities and public libraries are exempt ; this was a wise provision , but it contributes little to remove the difficulty , since the- books treasured up in these repositories are accessible only to persons in their vicinity , or to students , who are in the elements of learning , and not yet advanced to the studies required in the pursuits of life . To make knowledge available to the extent of its power , let it be of easy access to all , who are disposed to obtain and use it . From these considerations we are convinced , not only that the progress of learning would receive a salutary impulse , but that the welfare of the country would be indirectly promoted , by removing altogether the duty on books . Some persons , perhaps , who might feel the force of our reasoning , would think it a question , whether it were better to abolish , than modify the present system . Two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admit books of all descriptions free of duty . Mr Jefferson drew up a memorial on the subject , remarkable for its comprehensiveness , and the forcible manner in which he represented the justice and wisdom of such a measure . The petitions and memorial were referred to a committee of Congress , engaged in constructing a bill for a general revision of the tariff . In this bill it was proposed , that all books in foreign languages should be free , and that English books should be subject to a duty according to their weight , instead // of an ad valorem duty . To this modification there is little to object , for although the evil still exists , yet the weight of the expensive books most wanted bears so small a proportion to their value , that the duty will be comparatively insignificant . But it should be remembered , that the two great arguments for any duty at all , the increase of the revenue , and the protection of publishers , are weakened in the same proportion . The bill did not pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content themselves with hoping for a speedy revival of the subject under better auspices . Among other productions of the press in this country , Mr Ingersoll estimates the newspapers to be not less than a thousand . We presume he rather falls short , than overruns the actual number , for in many of the states there is one newspaper , and frequently two published in each of the principal counties . He makes some judicious observations on the political and moral influence of our papers , compared with those - of England , but we think he carries the parallel quite as far as it will bear , and farther , perhaps , than the occasion re quired . From * he goes on to say , the transition is natural to the arts , which minister to usefulness , comfort and prosperity , individual and national . Under their authority to provide for the encouragement of the arts and sciences , the United States , in thirty years , have issued about four thousand four hundred patent rights for new and useful inventions , discoveries , and improvements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American patentees must be American inventors or improvers , and are excluded from all things before known or used in any other part or period of the world . The English law allows English patentees to monopolize the inventions , discoveries , and improvements of all the rest of the world when naturalized in Great Britain . Notwithstanding this remarkable disadvantage , I believe the American list of discoveries is quite equal to the English . The specimens and models open to public inspection in the national repository at Washington , are equal , I understand , to any similar collections in England or France , and superior to those of any other country . It will hardly be expected that I should undertake to mention even the most remarkable articles of this immense museum , containing every element of practical science , of mechanism , of refinement , and of skill . I may be allowed , however , to say that the cotton gin has been of more profit to the United States , than ten times all they ever received by internal taxation ; that our grain mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is very superior to that of Europe ; that there are in the patent offices models of more than twenty different power looms , of American invention , operated on , and weaving solely by extraneous power , steam , water , wind , animals , and otherwise ; and that the English machines for spinning have been so improved here , that low-priced cottons can be manufactured cheap enough to undersell the English in England , after defraying the charges of transportation . ' Having spoken of education , literature , science , and the arts , the author proceeds to sketch the principles of legislation and jurisprudence in this country . He considers representation the grand improvement in the modern science of government , and this , together with a harmonious confederation , forms the chief feature of American politics . The constitution is a safeguard , a rallying point , a line of circumvallation , but its main excellence consists in securing to us a representative system of legislation . By the rule of frequent elections the interests of legislators are linked to the interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse power is to run the hazard of losing it ; for a legislator to propose or abet a bad law , is to open wider the watchful eyes of his constituents , and pave the way for a successor at the next election . Three thousand chosen members represents these United States , in five and twenty Legislatures . There are , moreover , innumerable voluntary associations under legislative regulations in their proceedings . I am within bounds in asserting , that several hundred thousand persons assemble in this country every year , in various spontaneous convocations , to discuss and determine measures according to parliamentary routine . From bible societies to the lowest handicraft there is no impediment , but every facility , by law , to their organization ; and we find not only harmless but beneficial , those various self-created associations , which in other countries give so much trouble and alarm . It is not my purpose to consider the political influences of these assemblies , nor even their political character . But their philosophical effect on the individuals composing them , is to sharpen their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While this almost universal practice of political or voluntary legislation , could hardly fail to familiarize a great number of persons with its proprieties . The mode of transacting business is nearly the same in them all , from the humblest debating club to Congress in the capitol . Legislation in the United States is better ordered , more deliberative , decorous , // and dignified , much less tumultuous or arbitrary and more eloquent than in Europe . Continual changes of the political representatives , afford not less than ten thousand individuals spread throughout the United States , practically familiar with the forms and principles of legislation , who , through the vivid medium of a free press , constitute , as it were , an auditory greatly superior to that of any other nation . A large proportion of this great number of practical legislators , are qualified by the habits of discussion incident to such employment , and perfect freedom , to deliver their sentiments in public speaking ; which , being in greater request , of greater efficacy , and at greater liberty in America than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than there . It is a striking view of the ideas of legislation in Europe , that within the last thirty years , France and Spain have waged destructive wars for legislatures , consisting of single assemblies ; a constitution , which , in America , would not be thought worth so much bloodshed . The much abused French revolution has given to that country a Legislature of two houses , and a press of considerable freedom . But the peers are lost in the secresy of their sessions ; and the deputies can hardly be called a deliberative assembly . Few speak , inasmuch as most of the orations are read from a pulpit ; and still fewer listen , amidst the tumults that agitate the whole body . To crown these frustrations of eloqu*nt debate , when it becomes intense and critical , as it must be , to do its offices , the proceedings are sometimes closed by an armed force , marched in to seize and expel an obnoxious orator . This is certainly not the philosophy of legis*. lation . In Great Britain , an excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few attempt to speak , and few can be brought to listen ; and where both speakers and hearers are disturbed by tumultuous shouts and unseemly noises , not , according to our ideas , consonant with either eloquent or deliberative legislation . In theory , the House of Commons contains nearly 700 members ; in practice the most important laws are debated and enacted by sixty or fifty . Owing to the want of personal accommodation , when the house is crowded , its divisions to be counted are attended with great confusion . Most of the bills are drafted , not by members , but by clerks hired for that purpose ; to which is owing much of the inordinate tautology and technicality of modern acts of Parliament . In theory and principle there is no audience , and is fact , bystanders are not permitted but occasionally , under inconvenient restrictions . Jieports and publications of the debates are unauthorized , and of course imperfect , notwithstanding the exploits of stenography . Although Parliament is omnipotent , yet a member may not publish abroad what he says in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which punishment wa*i // actually inflicted not long ago on a peer , proceeded against by in** formation , for that offence . in France , the press is , in this respect4 freer than in England . The publication of speeches in the Legislature is considered an inviolable right , which , among all the revocations of the present government , has never been molested or called in question . By a perversion of the hours , unknown , I believe , in any other country or age , most of the business of Parliament is done in the dead of night , to which , probably , many of the irregularities now mentioned are ascribable . The great popular principles which have preserved the British Parliament , while every other similar attempt in Europe has failed , or nearly so , and it brilliant political performances , have recommended it to admiration , notwithstanding these disadvantages ; and indeed sanctioned them as part of the system . But unprejudiced judgment must allow , that all these are imperfections which have no place in Congress . Hence it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at any one Pine , more than two or three members of Parliament actu. * ated by the great impulses of oratory ; and that the talent of extemporaneous and useful eloquence always has been much more common in Congress. * Some of these views are accurate and philosophical , but whether the author 's admiration of the excellent political system of his own country , does not tinge the colors of his pencil a little too deeply in portraying the defects of European legislation , our readers can judge . The number of lawyers in the United States is supposed to be more than six thousand ; the author thinks that these , as well as the judges , have a greater reverence for decisions under the laws of the mother country , . than is consistent with the different principles on which the two governments are founded , or with our character as an independent and self controlling people . In reference to the English law books of the day , he deplores the colonial acquiescence with which they are adopted too often without probation or fitness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not acquire the level to which it is entitled by the education , learning , and purity of those , by whose administration it is formed , ' till we shall cease to prefer British adjudications to our own . In some of the states , possibly all the new states , which have been carved out of the old , a great question is in agitation whether the English common law is their inheritance . Being a scheme . of traditional precepts and judicial precedents , that law requires continual adjudications , with their reasons at large to // explain , replenish , and enforce it . Of these reports , as they are termed , no less than sixty four , consisting of more than two hundred volumes , and a million of pages , have already been uttered in the United States ; most of them in the present century , and in a ratio of ' great increase . The camel 's load of cases , which is said to have been necessary to gain a point of law in the decline of the Roman Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Speaking of the improvements in the jurisprudence of the United States , the author says , Jury trial , the great safeguard of personal security , is nearly universal , and ought to be quite so , for its invaluable political influences . It not only does justice between the litigant parties , but elevates the understanding and enlightens the rectitude of all the community . Sanguinary and corporal punishments are yielding to the interesting experiment of penitential confinement . Judicial official tenure is mostly independent of legislative interposition , and completely of executive influence . The jurisdiction of the courts is far more extensive and elevated than that of the mother country . They exercise , among other high political functions , the original and remarkable power of invalidating statutes , by declaring them unconstitutional ; an ascendancy over politics never before or elsewhere asserted by jurisprudence , which authorizes the weakest branch of a popular government to annul the measures of the strongest . If popular indignation sometimes assails this authority , it has seldom if ever been able to crush those who have honestly exercised it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim might be immolated , his very martyrdom would corroborate the system for which he suffered . Justice is openly , fairly , and purely administered , freed from the absurd costumes and ceremonies which disfigure it in England . Judicial appointment is less influenced by politics ; and judicial proceedings more independent of political considerations. * We would gladly follow Mr Ingersoll through his review of medical science in this country , and the comparative state of the different religious denominations , but our limits forbid . A few of the facts , which his industry has brought together , must suffice . There are about ten thousand physicians in the United States , and medical colleges for their education in Massachusetts , RhodeIsland , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Ohio . There are also two medical universities in the state of New York , one in Pennsylvania , one in Maryland , one in Massachusetts , and one in Kentucky ; containing altogether about twelve hundred students . ' // The doctrine of non-cont g n in pestilential distempers , should it be established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most distressing prejudices concerning contagion , are not yet extirpated in Europe . I am not authorized to consider a disbelief in this shocking aggravation of any malady , as a point in which the medical profession of America is quite unanimous with respect to yellow fever ; but a foreign physician , who lately collected their opinions , ascertained the ratio of non-contagionists to be 567 to 28 contagionists . A late French ambassador in this country , who was bred a physician , has publicly claimed the merit of the discovery of non-contagion for another French physician , who was in practice in this city in 1793 , and is now in the service of the king of France . But in a treatise on the yellow fever by Dr Hillary , published sixty years ago , its contagion is explicitly denied by the unqualified declaration , that " it has nothing of a pestilential or contagious nature in it . " That this is not the sentiment prevalent in France , would seem to be inferrible from recent events . A French army was stationed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to prevent the passage of contagion over those lofty , and frost crowncd mountains . Whatever may be the theories or reveries of a few , therefore , it is a remarkable proof of the actual state of the public intelligence on this subject , not only in France , but throughout Europe , that all inquiries concerning the cause of this apparently warlike demonstration were silenced , by assurances that its design was to repel contagious disease ; under which assertion the wisdom of Eui*ope rested , till the plans thus masked were ripe for execution . ' Mr Ingersoll enlarges on the condition and prospects of what he calls the American church , in a manner which manifests equally his tolerant spirit , and practical estimate of the influence of laws on religion . Segregation from political connexion , and toleration , are the cardinal principles of the American church . On the continent of Europe , toleration means , where it is said to exist , catholic supremacy suffering subordinate protestantism . In the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , it mefins a protestant hierarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subjecting them to double ecclesiastical impositions . France , Italy , Ireland , and Spain , have been desolated by contests between church and state . Toleration has won at least part of these bloody fields . But a segregated church does not appear to have made any advance in Europe . In the United States , both of these principles are not only fundamental political laws , but ancient , deep seated doctrines , whose bases were laid long before political sovereignty was thought of , when Williams , Penn , and Baltimore , by a remarkable // coincidence , implanted them in every quarter , and in every creed . American toleration means the absolute independence and equality of all religious denominations . American segregation means , that no human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience . Adequate trial of these great problems , not less momentous than that of political selfgovernment , has proved their benign solution . Bigotry , intolerance , blood thirsty polemics waste themselves in harmless , if not useful controversy , when government takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only unknown , but inconceivable in Europe . We are continually receiving accessions of their intolerance , which is as constantly disarmed by being let alone . Our schools , families , legislatures , society find no embarrassment from varieties of creed , which in Europe would kindle the deadliest discord . ' There are upwards of seven hundred congregational churches in the New England states alone , and nearly that number of clergymen of that denomination , including pastors , unsettled ministers , and licensed preachers. * The Presbyterian church in the United States , in addition to the congregational , contains about nine hundred ministers , one hundred and thirty five licentiates , one hundred and forty seven candidates , more than fourteen hundred churches , and last year administered the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper to a hundred thousand com* municants . It has theological seminaries in the states of New Jersey , New York , and Tennessee . ' The Methodist church of America contains three diocesses* eleven hundred itinerant clergy , exclusively clerical , and about three thousand stationary ministers , who attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences , and more than twenty five hundred places of worship . By the report to the Baptist convention , which sat in June last , at Washington , the places of worship of that persuasion are stated at more than two thousand three hundred ; and they reckon a very large number of ministers . There are three theological seminaries of the Baptist church , one in New England , one in the interior of the state of New York , and one at the city of Washington . ' The Universalists have one hundred and twenty preachers , two hundred separate societies , and eight periodical publications . The Lutheran , the Dutch Reformed , and Associate Reformed , the Moravians , the Friends , in short , almost an innumerable roll of creeds , have their several seminaries of education , their many places of worship , numerous clergy or preachers , and every other attribute of secular , as well as spiritual , religion in prosperity. * The Church of England in the United States has expanded to ten bishoprics , with three hundred and fifty clergymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminary , and every other assurance of substantial prosperity . ' Upon the whole , I do not think we can reckon less than eight thousand places of worship , and five thousand ecclesiastics in the United States , besides twelve theological seminaries , and many religious houses , containing , the former about five hundred , and the latter three hundred * We would remark in passing , that the estimate of the congregational churches in New England is too small . The number in Massachusetts alone is nearly four hundred , and in all the New England states it is probably not less than eleven hundred , with about as many preachers . Mr Ingersoll has succeeded in collecting much information concerning the Catholic church in the United States , which we think will be novel to most of our readers ; and it proves , what the author aimed to prove , the beneficent principles of our government in fostering the interests of substantial religion , in whatever forms christians may think it their duty to clothe their ceremonies , or render their devotions . From a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States has spread into an extended and imposing hierarchy ; consisting of a metropolitan see , and ten bishopric* , containing between eighty and a hundred churches , some of them the most costly and splendid ecclesiastical edifices in the country , superintended by about one hundred and sixty clergymen . The remotest quarters of the United States are occupied by these flourishing establishments ; from the chapels at Damascotti , in Maine , and at Boston , to those of St Augustine in Florida , and St Louis in Missouri . There are Catholic seminaries at Bardstown and Frankfort in Kentucky , a Catholic clerical seminary in Missouri , Catholic colleges at St Louis and New Orleans , where there is likewise a Catholic Lancastrian school , two Catholic charity schools at Ba ! - timore , two in the District of Columbia , a Catholic seminary and colle6e at Baltimore , a Catholic college in the District of Columbia , a Catholic seminary at Emmitsburg in Maryland , a Catholic free school and Orph* n 's asylum in Philadelphia . These large contributions to education are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are , the most remarkable characteristics of the American Roman Catholic church . It is a circumstance pregnant with reflections and results , that the Jesuits , since their suppression in Europe , have been established in this country . In 1801 , by a brief of Pope Pius the Seventh , this Society , with the concurrence of the emperor Paul , was established in Russia under a general authorized to resume and follow the rule of // . fimerican Church . St Ignatius of Loyola ; which power was extended in 1806 to the United States of America , with permission to preach , educate youth , administer the sacraments , &amp;c. with the consent and approbation of the ordinary . In 1807 a noviciate was opened at Georgetown college in the District of Columbia , which continued to improve till 1814 , when , being deemed sufficiently established , the congregation was formally organized by a papal bull . This Society now consists of twenty six fathers , ten scholastics in theology , seventeen scholarships in philosophy , rhetoric , and belles lettres , fourteen scholastics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four lay brothers in , the noviciate ; some of whom are dispersed throughout the United States , occupied in missionary duties , and the cure of souls . This statement is enough to prove the marvelbus radication of the strongest fibres of the Roman Catholic church in our soil . But the argument does not stop here . The oldest Catholic literary establishment in this country , is the Catholic college just mentioned , which was founded immediately after the revolution , by the incorporated Catholic clergy of Maryland , now capable of containing two hundred resident students , furnished with an extensive and choice library , a philosophical and chemical apparatus of the latest improvement , and professorships in the Greek , Latin , Fren cli , and English languages , mathematics , moral and natural philosophy , rhetoric , and belles lettres. r* his institution , I have mentioned , was put in 1805 under the direction of the Society of Jesuits ; and that nothing might be wanted to the strong relief in which the subject appears , the college thus governed was , by act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rank of a university , and empowered to confer degrees in any of the faculties . Thus , since the suppression of the order of Jesuits , about the time of the origin of the American rev*lutio* , has that celebrated brotherhood of propagandists been restored in the United States , and it principal and most operative institution organized and elevated by an act of our national Legislature . In like manner , the Sulpitian monks have been incorporated by an act of the legislature of the state of Maryland , in the administration of the flourishing Catholic seminary at Baltimore . In the oldest religious house in America , that of the female Carmelites near Port Tobacco , in Maryland , the established number of inmates is always complete . The convent of t Mary 's , at Georgetown , in the District of Columbia , contains fifty nuns , having under their care a day school , at which upwards of a hundred poor girls are educated . The convent of the Sisters of Charity of St Joseph , incorporated by the Legislature of Maryland , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including novices , with fifty two young mdi . s under their tuition , and upwards of forty poor children . A convent of UrsulL es , at Boston , is yet in its infancy , consisting // I of a prioress , six sisters , and two novices , who undertake to instruct those committed to their charge in every polite accomplishment , in addition to the useful branches of female education . The Emmitsburg Sisters of Charity have a branch of their convent for the benefit of female orphan children , established in the city of New York , where the Roman Catholics are said to have increased in the last twenty years . from 300 to 20000 . The church of St Augus .. tine , in Philadelphia , belongs to the Augustine monks , by whom it was built . There is also a branch of the Emmitsburg Sisters of Charity in this city , consisting of several pious and well informed ladies , who superintend the education of orphan children . The Daughters of Charity have another branch in Kentucky , where there are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lately established by the Pope at Rome , a cloister of Loretto , and another convent . In the state of Missouri there is a convent of religious ladies at the village of St Ferdinand , where a noviciate is seated , of five novices and several postulants , with a thriving seminary , largely resorted to by the young ladies of that remote region , and also a day school for the poor . In New Orleans there is a convent of Ursuline nuns , of ancient and affluent endowment , containing fifteen or sixteen professed nuns , and a number of novices and pQstulants . The ladies of the Heart of Jesus , are about founding a second establishment for education at Opelousas . I will terminate these curious , I hope not irksome , particulars , by merely adding , that in Maine and Kentucky there are tribes of Indians attached to the Roman Catholic worship , whose indefatigable ministers have . always been successful in reclaiming those aborigines of this continent . Vincennes , the chief town of Indiana , where there is now a Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this purpose. * These are curious facts , and are to be accounted for in part , especially the increased number of Catholics in NewYork , from the circumstance of a large portion of the emigrants to this country professing the Catholic faith . It is indeed remarkable , that the persevering disciples of Loyola , balf a century after they had endured the satire of Paschal and the ridicule of Voltaire , had been enslaved in France , cruelly proscribed and persecuted in Spain , expelled from almost every civilized government , and suppressed by the frowning terrors of a papal edict , should find an asylum in the United States , and receive corporate powers from the American Congress itself . But the wonder consists not so much in the nature of the fact , as in the singularity of the events* which brought it about . It is not surprising , that any religious // body should be sanc*tioned under a constitution , which meddles not with religious opinion . The experiment of the United States affords a decisive argument in favor of the selfsustaining principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of external government , which will support the frame of society , or preserve human intercourse . A thousand instances might he mentioned in which religion has been cramped , and smothered , and destroyed by officious legislation , to one where it has been spiritualized and cherished by political aids . We have been so much instructed by Mr Ingersoll 's dis .. course , we have found so much to approve and so much to praise , that we should hardly venture to refer* to its faults , had they been contained in a work from a less elevated source , or of a less dignified character . We believe our pages will bear testimony , that we are as much in love with the genuine American spirit , and have as good an opinion of our prowess as a nation , of our piiviliges and prosperity , an*l cling as closely to our rights and liberty , and repel as eagerly the presumption of foreign ignorance or insolence , as most of our fellow citizens , who are allowed to have their country 's good at heart ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Ingersoll . On some occasions he runs his parallels farther than we can follow him . It adds nothing to the excellence of our own institutions , to show that they are superior to others ; it may make us better satisfied with ourselves , but such an achievement will bring with it neither wisdom nor profit ; and , besides , if other nations are to be credited , we already possess a thrifty stock of this same virtue of self satisfaction . Mr Ingersoll 's plan is a good one , since comparisons to a certain extent are necessary to exhibit the improvements which our system has effected , and of which it is susceptible ; we only mean to say , that we do not always agree with him , and that we fear the lengths to which he has pushed his comparisons , whether right or wrong , will have in the eyes of some readers an invidious hearing . We hope to embrace some future opportunity to sketch an outline of the history and doings of the American Philosophical Society , under whose patronage we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Ingersoll , and to whose labors the public has heretofore been indebted // for valuable articles in science and philosophy . A Society , of which Franklin was the founder , and an ardent patron , deserves for this cause , if for no other , the respect and good wishes of his countrymen . When we see on the list of its early members the names of persons , who acted a distinguished part in achieving our independence , as well as of eminent foreigners friendly to American advancement , and when we reflect on the scientific incitements and spirit of philosophical inquiry , which Rittenhouse received from this association , we are presented with other reasons for its peculiar claim to public regard . We can not but think , that much good might result to the republic of letters , and to the cause of knowledge generally , if other societies were to adopt the plan of annual discourses . It has been practised with encouraging success by the New York Historical Society . In this manner individuals may he induced thoroughly to examine subjects , carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended in vain ; and thus the public will , from year to year , he put in possession of a. series of valuable facts , selected with industry , arranged with judgment , and combined within a manageable compass . Societies themselves will be stimulated by these annual testimonies of their existence , and be protected from the languishment and lethargy , with which they are now so apt to be seized , by the consoling reflection , that they are doing something .
