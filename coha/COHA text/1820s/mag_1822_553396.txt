A'Jississippi river ; performed as a member of the expedition under Governor Cass in the year 1820 , By Henry B. Schoolcraft. 8vo . Albany 1821. 2. si Memoir on the geological position of a Fossil Tree , discovered in the secondary rocks of the river Des Plainer . By Henry R. Schoolcraft . Albany 1822 . THE journal of Mr Schooloraft 's travels contains the first general view of the chain of lakes and the country about the sources of the Mississippi , founded on actual observation , which was ever published . This gentleman was induced to accompany the expedition sent out under Governor Cass to explore these regions solely for the purpose of acquainting himself with the natural history of this unknown but interesting part of our country . It is the tendency of this science to excite enthusiasm ; the objects of nature are universally attractive even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely bewitching when their secret charms are brought out by examination and study . When this passion is once excited , the votary follows wherever nature leads , and there are no proofs of stronger influence which any affection ever exercised , nor any instances of more perfect devotedness which any admirer ever exhibited , than those of which she has to boast . How many wearisome travels and long voyages and hazardous enterprizes have been undertaken for the advancement of natural history ; how often has it called those engaged in the cultivation of it to give up the usual comforts and enjoyments of life , to renounce the society of man for the // solitariness of the desert , to forego the charms of domestic life , and range wild with the savage , and to have neither part nor lot in the common business of the world . It is only among her works , and in her own grand theatre , that nature can be studied ; the naturalist must see her there , or he sees her only imperfectly . But this theatre is too vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portioned out among those , who are desirous of surveying it , and the knowledge of it must be attained by bringing together what each has Seen . How much is to be done to become acquainted with her works in our own country ; what numerous mountain tops have we , which no geologist ever ascended , and forests which never furnished bird or beast for the cabinet of the naturalist , and valleys in which the flowers have bloomed unseen since the beginning of time ! Let it not be said , therefore , that it is a waste of life to spend it in wandering among wilds in pursuit of flowers and butterflies , for if these fading , fleeting , fluttering objects were the only ones of which the naturalist is in chase , the employment would still be infinitely more noble and more intellectual than a far greater part of human occupations . Are they not the works of God , and has he made any thing so insignificant as to be beneath the attention of man ? Moreover , these are not the only nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . The earth itself is one of its productions , and surely it must be an interesting inquiry to know something of the globe , which we inhabit ; of the materials out of which it is formed , of the various substances which are produced beneath its surface , of the convulsions which it has suffered , and the changes to which it is exposed . It is particularly to this portion of natural history , that the volume before us brings its valuable contributions , and we scarcely know a spot on the surface of the earth , which either needed or deserved examination more than the re ion which it describes . In the introductory remarks , which are chiefly historical , a 5ketch is given by the author of the information furnished by the earlier travellers in these parts , but . he goes no farther back , than the discovery of the lississippi by father Marquette in 1673 . The most important facts of their history , prior to this date , are these . The two gre'it rivers , St Lawrence and Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former by Cartier in 1535 , the latter by Ferdinand de S*to in 1540. // Cartier sailed up the St Lawrence as high as Montreal , but ilid not explore the interior ; and no attempt to do it , or to derive any advantage from the discovery , was made for a long while after . Ferdinand de Soto , who set out upon his Florida expedition in 1539 , spent three years in traversing the coasts about the gulf of Mexico , and to the north of it as far as Carolina , where he followed the Santee river nearly to its source , and thence in various directions to the Mississippi , up and down its banks on both sides , and died on the Red river , near its junction , in 1542 . His successor , Lewis de Moscoso , according to Herrera , sailed down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico the year after . It is remarkable , that the neXt notice , which we get of this mighty river is from Marquette , one hundred and thirty years afterward. - The St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monts and Champlain both began their settlements on its banks in 1603 , the last of whom remained in the country the greater part of the next twenty-seven years , founded Quebec in 1608 , and prosecuted discoveries as far up as lake Ontario , in the country of the Iroquois , and among the Hurons , on the other side . In the account of his travels , published in Paris in 1617 , is the earliest mention of the great lakes , one of which he had seen , and of the others he had received some vague information from the bordering tribes of Indians . Champlain published a quarto volume in 1632 , which contains an account of all his transactions in Canada from 1603 to 1629 , which is in fact a history of the country for the same period . The Jesuits began their Journal of Missions in 1633 , and continued them to 1672 . They relate chiefly to ecclesiastical matters , but they are the only sources of authentic information upon the general affairs of Canada for that time . Soon after Marquette opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Lawrence and the lakes , numerous adventurers came out from France to visit the country ; and it is a curious fact , that all the early enterprises upon the first named river should have been carried on through this channel of communication . All the efforts of La Sale to discover the true mouth of the Mississippi were inef .. fectual , and it is very satisfactorily proved , that it was never entered from the gulf of Mexico , until 1701 by Le Moine . It would be pleasant to ourselves , if not to our readers , to start with our author from New York , and follow him along the banks of the Hudson to Albany , and thence up the Mohawk // to Utica , and onward to the shores of lake Erie , stopping to admire with him the activity , and bustle , and enterprise , which mark out the course of the great canal , the beauty and neatness of the villages on the route , the richness of the lands , the improved state of agriculture , the general appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that most extraordinary union , which this fine region every where exhibits , of the freshness of youth with the comforts and accommodations that characterize older countries . But it was our author 's particular design to describe the hitherto undescribed regions ; it must be ours , therefore to meet him on that ground . We can not , however , pass by Niagara  --  the wonder of the western world-without some notice . How early and by whom were these falls first described are two questions started by Mr Schoolcraft , hut left unsettled by him . Champlain was doubtless the earliest European traveller in their vicinity , but lie neither mentions them in the account of his travels , nor marks them on his map . It is hardly possible , however , to suppose that he knew nothing of them , as lie must have been very near to them , and was in constant intercourse with the indians who lived beyond them . Nor do we find any account of them in the Journal of the Missions , before spoken of , although the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and west of lake Erie , which must consequently have been past in going from and returning to Montreal and Quebec . Sanson s map of Canada , published at Paris in 1657 , is the earliest on which they appear , but they are not so much as named in the description , which accompanies the map . The name on the map , Ongiara , through whatever medium it may have come to him , must have been obtained originally from the indians , as it expresses the sound , as they pronounce it , which Mr Schoolcraft writes O-ni4a-gkrkh . La Sale is the first traveller , who speaks of having visited it , and lie mentions it only in cidentally , in describing the course , which lie took in crossing to the Mississippi in 1678 . Upper lake or Frontenac , ' Ontario says he , has a communication with the lake Herie or Conti by a canal of above twenty leagues long , interrupted by a fall six hundred feet high , known under the name of the Fall of Niagara . ' Neither admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Hennepin , known in Canada , ' says K*lm , as the great liar* , ' who was attached to Le Sale 's // expedition for exploring the Mississippi , estimates the height of the falls also at six hundred feet . The monk Guedeville , whose nom de guerre is baron Ia Hontan , adds about a third to these estimates . As for the waterfall of Niagara , says he , t is seven or eight hundred foot high , and half a league broad . Towards the middle of it we descry an island , that leans towards the precipice , as if it were ready to fall . All the beasts , that cross the water within a quarter of a league above this unfortunate island , are sucked in by force of the stream* Between the surface of the water , that shelves off prodigiously , and the foot of the precipice , three men may cross in a breast without any other damage , than a sprinkling of a few drops of water . ' Unless things have changed very much since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liennepin together would come very near to two great liars . An account of the falls was published in the Philosophical Transactions for April 1722 , written by Paul Dudley Esq . of Roxhury , who received his information in regard to it from Mr Borossoro , a French Canajian . This account is correct in every particular , and it is the first one published , which is so . The height is given at one hundred and fifty six feet , which was determined , says Mr Dudley , by a party of officers sent for the express purpose by the governor of Canada . Charlevoix , who visited the falls the same year , says that he saw it measured and made to be but one hundred and twenty feet in height , but gives his own estimate at one hundred and forty to one hundred and fifty feet . The manner of measurina* in both these cases was by letting down a rope with a weight attached to it . The two accounts coincide in all other respects , particularly in refuting the absurd fables of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance which it shoots over . Whether these accounts were not believed , or that people prefer falsehood to truth , we are not able to say ; but certain it is , that the old fictions of ilennepin and La Hontan continued to find a place in the geographies of Bowen and Middleton and others very nearly to the end of the last century . The opinions about the point of view from which this stupendous cataract is to be seen are various . Most prefer that of the table rock ; our author decides in favor of the chasm below . We agree with him in thinking it the best for judging of the height of the fall , of the volume of water , of the irresistible force with which it rushes over the precipice , and the best // also for watching the beautiful play of the prismatic colors as they form with the clouds of rising spray and vanish as these burst , and for observing those snow white billows as they are rolled out by the meeting of the waters , and for listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep abyss , and for feeling that trembling , quivering motion , which is imparted to the solid rocks . But here is not the highest sublimity of the scene ; to enjoy that , the waters from above must be brought into the view . The dark black aspect of the threatening cloud is more terrific than the thunder 's peal and the lightning 's flash . Let the beholder , who would feel the full grandeur of this beautiful and sublime spectacle , place himself on the table rock , and direct his eyes far above the fall to the point where the first ripple marks the rapidity of the river , and thence follow it downward as its impetuosity increases and as its waves roll out their crested curls , and then again when they no longer roll , but rush in a loud roar of broken , wild confusion , and next unite in a sheet of pure , transparent emerald green to plunge into the gulf below , and there waste their strength in fretting and foaming , and rise at last in infinitely divided spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently as gossamer . But we would not be understood to imply that the view from this spot alone should satisfy any visitor ; we mean only that all which belongs to this magnificent scene is here best grouped in the picture , and here it should be seen by every light and at every hour , and afterwards from the thousand other points along the banks of the river , which present some peculiarity , and novelty , and beautiful variety . Mr Schoolcraft has sketched his picture of this enchanting , this glorious spectacle with great correctness and liveliness , but it is too long for an extract , there is , however , one circumstance which he describes so beautifully , that we must give it in his own language . What has been said by Goldsmith and repeated by others , respecting the destructive influence of the rapids above to ducks and other water fowl , is only an effect of the imagination . So far from being the case , the wild duck is often seen to swim down the rapids to the brink of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeming to take delight in the exercise . Neither are small land birds affected on flying over the falls , in the manner that has been stated . 1 observed the blue bird and the wren* which had already made their annual visit to the banks of the Nia6ara* , frequently fly within one or two feet of the brink , appa* // rently delighted with the gift of their wings , which enabled them to sport over such frightful precipices without danger . ' What a beautiful picture this brings to view , and who ever saw the scene from which it is taken , without wishing to share in the sports of these water fowl . There is a refreshing coolness in the very tliought ,  --  to becarried with the rapidity of lightning down this crystal stream to the verge of the precipice , and there wet one 's limbs in that bright green water , and then rise and skim along its surface , now dipping in the tip of one wing and now that of another. - .. But we are straying front our proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picturesque , but of facts and phenomena in natural history . The depth of the chasm through which Niagara river passes , affords a fine opportunity for examining the different strata of its banks . These according to Mr Schoolcraft are limestone , fragile slate , and sand stone . The uppermost and lowest of these strata , limestone and sandstone , compose the great secondary formation of the United States , occupying the whole basin of the Mississippi and extending from it between the lakes and the Alleghany ridge , as far eastward as the Mohawk , between which the slate is often interposed , as here at Niagara , and throughout the western part of New York generally . This formation is almost without a parallel for uniformity , throughout such an extent , preserving every where its hon zontal direction , or varying only with the slight undulations Ia the surface of the earth . The stratum of slate which is interposed between the limestone and sandstone of this formation at Niagara is nearly forty feet in thickness and exceedingly fragile , nearly as much so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the superincumbent limestone , an opinion has arisen that the same operation has been going on for ages , and occasioned a retrocession of the falls from some point far below , which is generally considered to be Lewistown . We do not look upon this supposition as unquestionable , not that it is in any way incredible , but that we do not see sufficient proofs to place it beyond a doubt . It is true the three rocks are precisely those which would most readily admit of such *n effect , the slate crumbling , the limestone then falling by its weight , and the sandstone disintegrating and washing away . But is it not more probable that such a volrime of water should have at once borne away its opposing // obstacles when it was first hemmed in , or when it first broke loose , in which ever way the canal between Erie and Ontario may have been formed , than that it should have gone on in the nibbling manner which the supposition takes for granted ? That the precipice is not as it wasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly can not be questioned by any one who examines the banks above and below it , but we believe also that the outlet of lake Erie was originally somewhere else , and not through Ontario and St Lawrence , and that the deep chasm between the falls and Lewistown was mostly formed when the junction of the two lakes was effected . As to actual testimony of a gradual retrocession since it was known to Europeans , we see none that is satisfactory . Kaim , who is acknowledged by every one to he both honest and exact , visited the falls in 1750 , the island was then between eleven and twelve hundred feet long , and we believe it will be found to be still the same . Its lower edge also was then just even with the fall , and so it is now . But it is not necessary or even probable , that the island should keep pace in running backward with the ledge over which the water is precipitated . Supposing this retrocession to be gradual and uniform , and not to have commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be contended , the regular annual retiring must be about five feet and a half , which would give three hundred and ninety-six feet for the seventy-two years since Kalm was there . Do the observations of its neighboring inhabitants support this supposition ? Mr M'Causlin , who lived there nine ' years , in a paper upon the falls , published in the third volume of the transactions of the American philosophical society , bears witness to the contrary , although he is a believer in the general opinion of their having receded . We are foreclosed from citing Hennepin as an authority , or we might get something in the support of the non-retrocession from him . But although we can not use him as an evidence , we may quote his suggestions , one of which is so striking as to deserve notice . I could not conceive , ' says he , how it came to pass , that four great lakes , the least of which is four hundred leagues in compass , should empty themselves into one another , and then all centre and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drown a good part of America . ' Mr Schoolcraft returns to Buffalo May *3d , and finds lake Erie still obstructed with ice , which was then rapidly breaking // up . On the 6th he embarks on board a steam boat for Detroit , where he arrives after a passage of sixty-two hours . This is one of the productions of civilized ingenuity which is said to have triumphed over the wonted savage pride . They have not been able to suppress their astonishment on seeing vessels impelled rapidly through the water without the aid of any moving force , apparent to them . indeed it could not well be otherwise , for it is hardly possible to conceive of an object more incomprehensible to a person unacquainted with the principles upon which it is constructed , than this strange vehicle , called a steam boat , and Indians are not the only peo .. pIe who have viewed its approach with fear and wonder . The first one which went up the Elbe drove the inhabitants from the banks , as if it had been a sea monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appeared on the Rhine . And surely when such was the effect upon those to whom its appearance had been foretold and who knew something of its moving power , the simple indians need not blush at having been dismayed . Admirable as this ingenious contrivance is upon all waters , there are none to which it is so peculiarly fitted , as to our inland seas and the two great channels , by which they communicate with the Atlantic ,  --  . the St Lawrence and the Mississippi . It has already contributed greatly to the late rapid increase of population in the parts of the country bordering on these waters , and will doubtless contribute still more to the same effect hereafter . It matters not what the distance between two points on the earth 's surface is , if there be an easy and certain mode of communication from one to the other , and such a communication is now afforded by steam boats , wherever there is water for them to move in ; the lover 's prayer is half realized , and ' space annihilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formerly a half year 's journey from our own metropolis , is now a mere pleasant excursion . This place , when it was visited by Mr Schoolcraft in May 1820 , contained two hundred and fifty houses , and fourteeen hundred and fifteen inhabitants . Its growth has been much less rapid , than would be expected from the great advantages of its situation and the mildness of its climate . But the several checks it has experienced from having been so often the seat of war with the Indians , and latterly of that with the English , have probably counterbalanced the causes , which would otherwise have given it a great increase . It was known in 1620 , // the woodman and hunter having thus early selected it , as a stopping place in their journeys to the north . It was then the site of an indian village , and afterwards of a French garrison , and continued such until 1759 , when it fell into the hands of the English , and soon afterwards became famous by the long and obstinate siege it sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wyandots , Pottawatamies , Missinagas , Shawnees , Ottagamies , and Winnebagoes , under the command of Pontiac , the greatest perhaps of Indian warriors . The account of this siege and of the English sortie and defeat at the bloody battle of Bloody Bridge is given at length in Carver 's travels , and extracted into the work now before us . There are few places in our country , whose history is so rich in incident as Detroit ; and were it not for one damned spot , ' there would be none in any country , which could boast of a history with fairer and brighter pages . The party for exploring the upper lakes and the sources of the Mississippi , consisLed of Gov . Cass , Dr Wolcott , Mr Schoolcraft , and six other gentlemen , attended by ten Canadians , seven U. S. soldiers , ten Indians , an interpreter and guide , in all thirty eight , who embarked in three canoes at Detroit , May 24th . The entrance of the lake of St Clair , affords the first indication observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pebbles of granite , hornblende rock , and silicious sand are seen on the edge of the water , washed out from below the alluvion of the banks . This is probably very near the limits where the materials of the primitive formation show themselves from beneath the secondary ; nothing of them being seen on the American side of lake Erie ; but around St Clair masses of granite , mica slate , and quartz are found in abundance . This little lake is described as being very beautiful , particularly at the point of entrance into the strait which communicates with them . Des. * cending the rapids near Black river , Mr Schoolcraft observed a stratum of blue clay fifteen feet in depth , covered by a layer of sand forty feet deep , and raises thereon some queries about the relative ages of the tree , which we think he might have answered for himself ; for we know not how one could see the banks of such a water course , and not be convinced that the alluvion of its banks is continually undergoing changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Michilimackinac , which shows the difference in despatch // between steamboat and canoe navigation , the distance being the same as from Buffalo to Detroit . The Erie steamboat now goes occasionally to Mackinaw and Green Bay , and never exceeds three days on the passage , which the canoes were fourteen in making . Huron afforded very few objects of interest to the travellers ; its shores are uniformly level , and consequently dull and monotonous . No new plants were discovered to gratify the researches of the botanist , nor any geological phenomena observed , to extend the knowledge of the structure of the earth . Secondary limestone , filled with the usual reliqui* , constitutes the great mass of the rock along the coast . Detached blocks of granite and of other primitive rocks are scattered here and there , in one of which crystals of staurotide , and in another place pieces of calcedony were found , and these were the only simple minerals which they discovered from one extent of the lake to the other . Mr Schooleraft is somewhat perplexed with a granitic block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hornblende , and queries if it be a primitive breccia , or a granitic porphyry . We see no reason why either of these names is necessary , as horublende is very often a proper constituent of granite . But if a distinctive name must be given , doubtless it should be porphyritic granite . Around Saganaw bay , the primitive formation appears to approach nearer the surface , the secondary limestone then giving place to sandstone , which disintegrates and forms sand banks arid beaches , as on the sea shore . We know not that the Canadian shores of these northern lakes have been examined ; when they are , they will probably be found to belong to the primitive formation , judging from the detached masses which are found on the American side . Mr Schooleraft remarks , that the common accounts of the highly electrified state of the atmosphere about Saganaw bay are entirely erroneous , and that there is no reason whatever to believe , that the air in its vicinity contains a surcharge of electric fluid . Farther north an animal was killed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note as a variety of the American Hare , the Lepus Americanus of Gmelin . In the description one or two of the distinctive marks are omitted , such as the white spots below the eyes and behind the cheeks , but it appears to correspond to the characters which belong to this species in all other respects , except that it is somewhat longer and has its ears // tipped with black , which is a characteristic of the Lepus Timidus , or common hare of Europe . We have noted this circumstance , as the distinctions between the animals of the genus Lepus in this country and in other parts of the world have never heen well defined Approaching within four leagues of Michilimackinac , ' says our author , we perceived ourselves opposite the foot of the island of Bois Blanc , which takes its names from the Liriodendron tulipifera , what right have the botanists thus to hid defiance to the rules of grammar , by which it is in a great part covered , ' and which is a strong indication of the superior mildness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lat. 45*O* Passing round this island , ' proceeds Mr Schooleraft , Michilimackinac first burst upon the view . Nothing can present a more picturesque or refreshing spectacle to the traveller , wearied with the lifeless monotony of a canoe voyage through lake Huron , than the first sight of this island , which rises from the watery horizon in lofty blufii , imprinting a rugged outline along the sky , and capped with two fortresses , on which the American standard is seen conspicuously displayed . A compact town stretches along the narrow plain below the hills , and a beautiful harbor chequered with American vessels at anchor , and Indian canoes rapidly shooting across the water in every direction . There is no previous elevation of coast to prepare us for encountering the view of an island elevated more than three hundred feet above the water and towering into broken peaks , which would even present attractions to the eye of the solitary traveller , among the romantic and sublime scenes of the wilderness of Arkansaw . ' We should exceed our limits were we to make a longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schooleraft 's whole account of it to the attention of our readers . Like Detroit , it , that is , old Mackinaw , which is three leagues distant from the present , has been the theatre of many interesting events in the early history of the wilderness . It was there that in 1671 Marquette began the first European settlement northwest of fort Frontenac on lake Ontario , and ever since it has been the seat of the most considerable fur trade in those parts . It is memorable also for the bloody massacre of the garrison by the Indians in 1763 , and for the gallant assault which was made upon it by Col. Croghan during the late war . Mr Schooleraft considers the island upon which the modern Mackinaw is built , as peculiar in its // geological structure , being composed of limestone of different ages , and of portions which mark the passage from one to the other , with crystals of caleareous spar in the cavities , and some other minerals of the same nature imbedded in the mass ; but we see not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harz and numerous other strata of the same rock . An anomaly , however , of another kind , is pointed out by him in his statistical account of it ; which is , that with a population of nearly five hundred , it has neither preacher , schoolmaster , attorney , nor physician which we wish might be at least half true of all the towns in our country of the same size . The etymology given of this name is , Missi great , and Mackinaw turtle , the island being supposed to resemble a great turtle lying on the water . The sault of St Marie interposes a barrier to the free navigation from lakes Huron and Michigan into lake Superior ; barges and canoes partly loaded can ascend it , but the water never rises sufficiently to allow large vessels to pass . It was the site of another of the early garrisons of the French ; and it may well be remarked , as it is by 1*1r Schoolcraft , that they discovered a most extraordinary good judgment , as well as a most t*iorough knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made of places as points of defence ; there is scarce an instance , where it has been found expedient to change them While the party was there , the Indians attempted to frighten them out of insisting upon the claim , which they were instructed to make to a tract of land sufficient for a garrison , in virtue of a former cession to the French , but in consequence of the very firm and decisive manner in which the attempt was received , they soon gave up , and ceded the land demanded . We are next introduced into lake Superior , and it would be injustice to our author to describe this , the grandest event of the whole expedition , in any language but his own . The morning ( June 18 ) was clear and pleasant , with a gentle . breeze bh.wing up the river , which while it filled our sails and relieved the men at the oars , produced an exhilirating effect upon our spirits , by its refreshiub coolness , and we approached the lake with a feeling of impatient delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we fully realized the jugtice of the remark wade by Carver , " that the entrance into lake Superior affords one of the most pleasing prospects in the world . " // This entrance was now in full view , presenting a scene of beauty and magnificence which is rarely surpassed , even amid the rugged scenery of the north . The lake spread like a sea before us : toward the north we could discern across the bay the distant highlands , which border the Canadian shore of the lake , while on the south the mountain chain extending from the head of the river St Mary , westward , towered majestically into the air and presented a fine contrast to the boundless expanse of water at its base . ' But the traveller searches in vain along the borders of this stupendous lake for the picturesque scenery , which its fine entrance leads him to expect ; long and lofty ridges of sand , or piles of shapeless rock , interchange with low sandy beaches from Iroquois point to Fond du lac . The few objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geological view . A remarkable heap or bank of sand about three hundred feet high extends nine miles along the lake , which is divided into three distinct strata . The lowest , one hundred and fifty feet thick , is unmixed light yellow silicious sand ; the middle , about eighty feet , is composed of the same substance , mixed with numerous pebbles of granite , horublende , limestone , and quartz ; and the upper like the lower with trunks of trees imbedded . It is the extent and height of this sand bank alone which make it remarkable . The arrangement of the stra* ta and the manner of their accumulation is doubtless this : the lower unmixed part is the original sandstone which forms the bank of this part of the lake in a state of disintegration , the second layer has washed out from the bottom of the lake at the time of some great overflow , and the upper has blown on from time to time and enveloped the trees which it found growing there . Following the shore along westward , we soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is a range of sandstone of about the same height as the ridge just des .. cribed , broken into various fantastic forms by the action of the elements . To judge both from the sketch and the description which Mr Schoolcraft has given of these rocks , tbey must bear a most marked resemblance to the sandstone formation on the Elbe above Dresden , which is called Saxon Switzerland . By contrasting pictures of the two , the resemblance will appear ; and first of the pictured rocks of lake Superior. - ' Surprising groups of overhar-ging precipices , towering walls , caverns , waterfalls , and prostrate ruins , which are here mingled in the most wonderful disorder , and burst // upon the view in ever varying and pleasing succession ' - are the objects selected by our author for his description of these rocks . Reichard 's of Saxon Switzerland places before us ,  - -  Chasms and loose rocks in the form of figures the most grotesque , summits and points elevated almost beyond the reach of sight , abysses of prodigious depth , rivulets , torrents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rush forward on their course , grottos and caverns of all sizes . ' And this in fact is the common appearance of sandstone rocks , when laid bare to the pelting of the storms . A little farther onward the granite shows itself above the sandstone in an abrupt rock rising out of the lake to the height of two hundred feet , which is united with the shore by strata of red and grey sandstone , under which it dips and rises on the contiguous coast in high , rough , and broken peaks . From this point westward , granite is frequently seen rising from beneath the sandstone . From the Saultde St Marie , to the Ontanagon or Coppermine river is 330 miles , which it took our party ten days to travel in their canoes . Here they were directed to stop and ascertain the truth of the accounts which Henry and others had given about the copper mines on the banks of this river , and particularly to examine the mass which was estimated by him to weigh six tons . The result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the copper which is in a pure and malleable state , lies in connexion with a body of serpentine rock , the face of which it almost completely overlays and is also disseminated in masses and grains , through out the substance of the rock . The surface of the metal , unlike most oxydable metals , which have suffered a long exposure to the atmosphere , presents a metallic brilliancy-.the shape of the rock is very irregular-its greatest length three feet eight inches-its greatest breadth three feet four inches , making about eleven cubic feet , and containing of metallic matter not exceeding twenty two hundred pounds , but the quantity may be much diminished from what it was originally , as there are marks of chissels and axes upon it , and Henry speaks of having cut off an hundred pounds . ' Mr Schooleraft does not determine whence it came , but thinks it must have been removed from its original bed . The obstacles to mining in this region which Henry had to encounter no longer exist , and it is difficult to conceive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judiciously conducted , from being productive . Not a doubt can be // entertained that the metal abounds there , and would probably be found to be accompanied by tin . From the mouth of the Ontonagon to the Fond du lac are one hundred and seventy miles , making the whole length on the American shore five hundred miles . The Canadian is estimated at twelve hundred , and the whole circumference at seventeen hundred miles , and its medium depth , according to Darby , nine hundred feet . It has several large and well wooded islands . The most interesting of these is the island of Yellow sands , about which the Indians have many fine fanciful tales , that its shores are covered with a heavy shining yellow sand , which is gold , but the guardian spirit of the island will not permit any of it to be carried away . To enforce his commands he has drawn together upon it , myriads of eagles , hawks , and other birds of prey , who by their cries warn him of any intrusions upon the domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy . He has also called from the depths of the lake , large serpents of the most hideous forms , who lie thickly coiled upon the golden sands and hiss ( lefiance to the steps of the invader ,  --  that an attempt was once made by some of their nation to carry off a quantity of the glittering sand , when a gigantic spirit strode on the water , and in a voice of thunder commanded them to bring it back . ' As this lake is still so rarely visited , and so little is known about it , which is entitled to credit , we give an extract from Mr Schoolcraft 's general remarks upon it . The southern coast receives thirty tributary rivers , some of which exceed an hundred and fifty miles in length . Of these the Ontonagan , Montreal , Mauvaise , Bois Brule , and St Louis are the largest , and communicate with the waters of the Mississippi . The coast is sandy from Point iroquois to the pictured rocks ; then rocky to the foot of the Fond du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without hills to the head of the lake . The forest trees are white and yellow pine , hemlock , spruce , birch , poplar and oak , with a mixture of elm , maple , and ash , upon the banks of the rivers . The coast is very elevated , in some places mountainous , generally sterile and dangerous to navigate , it s subject to storms and sudden transitions of temperature and to fogs and mists , which are often so dense as to obscure objects at a short distance . it has a warm atmosphere during the summer , the mean heat for June being 660 , and for July 640 . The me n temperature of the water 6i* . The winter is long and frightful . ' in regard to the geological formation , we learn from him , that a secondary sandstone forms the whole southern coasE , . through which the granite on which it rests occasionally ap // pears , and that prase chalcedony , cornelian , jasper , opal , agate , sardonyx , zeolith , and serpentine , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and copper , are the oaly simple minerals imbedded in it . This we do not consider as indicative of a very attractive field for geological investigations and mineral discovery , ' as our author does ; indeed it would be difficult to find a spot which promises less . Beyond lake Superior the narrative becomes totally barren of interest , but its dulness is no fault of the author , it is wholly chargeable to the country where he travels , which was very aptly called by La Hontan , the fag end of the world . ' After proceeding a short distance up the St Louis river , the company divided , a part still continuing to follow its course , and a part striking straight across to Sandy lake . Mr Schoolcraft accompanied the latter , which was composed of Lieut . Mackay , Mr Dotey , Mr Trowbridge , Mr Chase , eight soldiers , two . Indian guides , and an interpreter . Four miles of ponds and . marshes , in which the mud was half leg deep , succeeded by as many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thick forest of hemlock and spruce , and a regular alternation again of swamps , mud , bog , windfalls , and stagnant water , in the whole course of which , not a dry spot to rest upon could be found , were among the agr*mens of the journey , which became peculiarly interesting , when they found that the guides were ignorant of the way and were leading them they knew not whither . This circumstance gave rise to an incident , * which must have more than compensated for the anxiety occasioned by losing their way , and as it serves to explain the manner in which the indians communicate intelligence to their friends , during their marches through the trackless forests , and as also to show an uniformity of customs among the different nations , we extract the account of it . To leave a memorial of our journey for the information of such of their tribe , as should happen to fall upon their track , our Indian guides traced out with their knives upon birch bark , the following hieroglyphics-Lieut Mackay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dotey , with a book , they having understood that he was an attorney ; myself with a hammer , I being called by them Paw-gwa-be-caw-a-ga , the destroyer of rocksto these were added a tortoise and a prairie hen , to denote that these have been killed-three smokes , that our encampment consisted of three fires-eight muskets , that this was the number armed-three hacks upon a pole leaning NW , , that we were go-* // ing three days NW. *-. the figure of a white man with a tongue near his mouth ( like the Azteck hierolyphics ) that he was an interpreter , &amp;c . This told the whole story of how many , who , when and what . At Sandy lake they were joined by Gov . Cass and the rest of the party . Dr Wolcott who had been with them was requested by Mr Schoolcraft to take note of the geological character of the country through which he passed , which he did , and his observations upon it are given , but they are still more meagre and vague , than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn from them is , that the vertical strata of slate which had been observed soon after leaving lake Superior continued but a short distance , and were succeeded by hornblende rocks , which extended as far as Sandy lake ; but these horablende rocks , he says , were not in situ , and he does not inform us what the formation is through which the St Louis and the Savannah rivers flow , facts very important to be known , as these rivers rise in the ridge , which separates the Waters of the Mississippi from those of lake Superior . Sandy lake communicates with the Mississippi by a short outlet , and is therefore to be considered as one of its sources . North of it there are various other lakes , which send their tributary waters to form this mighty river , but it is difficult to say from which of them those drops proceed , which flow the farthest before they reach the ocean . Pike , on arriving at Sangsue lake , says , 1 will not attempt to describe my feel .. ings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the main source of the Mississippi . ' This may be ; but it is not the most distant point , from which it springs , La Beesh and Turtle lakes being a degree north of it , neither of which was visited by Pike or by our travellers . And how it is possible that men , who were possessed of a spirit of enterprise sufficient to carry them through all the toils and dangers of such expeditions , should turn back with their chief object unaccomplished , we are totally unable to conceive . Persons sent to explore the sources of a river should follow it till they reach the point , where they could hold all its water in the hollow of the hand . Objects of curiosity are not wanting in this quarter to occupy attention for days . A thorough search there would probably find out a spot as remarkable as the one on the Grison Alps , where a person may drink , without changing place , of water which flows into the Mediterranean , the Rhine1 and // the German ocean ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of approximation of the waters of the St Lawrence , the Misssissippi , the Red river of Hudson 's bay , and the River of the West , which are received into the ocean at the extreme east , and west , and north , and south parts of the North Amen .. can continent . In other respects , also , there is a great want of exactness in the accounts of both expeditions sent out to explore the sources of the Mississippi , as well as a great want of accord between them . The latitude of Red Cedar , or the Cassina lake of our author , as determined by Pike , is 470 42 40 " ; but on Mr Schooleraft 's map it is found nearly or quite a de*. gree to the north . In the same way he has removed all the known points north of lake Superior to a like higher latitude , than has before been given them , and as it is done upon the authority of a single observer , with a single instrument , the alterations can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in regard to the climate of these dreary regions , are found in the narratives of the two expeditions . When Pike was there in Jan. 1806 , whiskey congealed to the consistence of honey , and our travellers found the bottoms of their canoes encrusted with a scale of ice of the thickness of a knife blade on the night of July 19 , and the thermometer down to 36* at sunrise ; but the extremes of heat and cold of the two seasons are not noted . It must be presumed that the Fur Companies offer the highest pecuniary compensations to induce their agents to spend a whole life , as they often do , in these miserable solitudes ; but to what a state of moral degradation must civilized man be reduced , before any reward could tempt him to wear out life in a condition , which places him so far below the wandering savage . An idea of the misery , which it sometimes produces , may be formed from the following picture . Mons. D -- - had , according to the custom of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that inclement region . During the last , he was , however , caught in a severe snow storm , and froze both his feet in such a manner , that they dropped off shortly after his return to his wigwam . In this helpless situation , he was supported some time by his wife , who caught fish in the lake ; but she at last deserted him ; and on our arrival he had subsisted several months upon the pig weed , which grew around hi* cabin . As he was unable to walk , this had been thrown in by his countrymen , or by the Indians , and appeared to have been the extent of their benevolence . We found him seated in a smallbark // cabin , on a rush mat , with the stumps of his legs tied up with deer-skins , and wholly destitute of covering . He was poor and emaciated to the last degree , his beard was long , cheeks fallen in , eyes weak , but darting a look of despair , and every bone in his body visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which God be praised , but was continually uttering curses in his mother tongue upon his own existence , and apparently upon all that surrounded him . ' It would not require a heart as sentimental as Yorick 's to bleed at such a sight . Mr Schoolcraft has attempted to estimate the height of the sources of the Mississippi above the level of the sea , which he makes to be thirteen hundred and thirty feet . The basis of his calculation is the altitude of lake Erie , as determined by the canal commissioners , which is five hundred and sixty feet above the tide waters of the Hudson , to which his estimate adds ten feet for the rise to St Clair , nineteen to Huron , fiftythree to Superior , making the last six hundred and forty two above the same level ; from this to Sandy lake the rise is five hundred and twenty seven feet , and from that to Cassina one hundred and sixty two feet . If this estimate be correct , or nearly so , and the length of the Mississippi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , its average descent per mile is about three feet . It is deserving of remark , ' says our author , that its sources lie in a region of almost continual winter , while it enters the ocean under the latitude of perpetual verdure ; ' and adds , to have visited both the sources and the mouth of this celebrated stream falls to the lot of few ; and I believe there is no person living , beside myself , of whom the remark can now he made . ' And had he but have gone to La J3eesh lake , we would join him in the exultation . The observations of Mr Schoolcraft determine that this river flows through a primitive region from its rise to the falls of St Anthony , but this is covered in many places along the banks by recent alki .. non . From St Anthony to the gulf of Mexico , it is secondary limestone and alluvion . Various tribes of Indians are found on its borders , some of which , particularly the Chippeways , are distinguished for not making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we would observe , that it is not safe to trust altogether to the explanations given by the Indians of the names they apply to sensible objects ; Mr Schooleraft was told that Missisawgaiegon , their name fo* // lake Superior , signified a great lake , and we find it afterward applied to an inconsiderable tributary to the Mississippi , which enters it a little above the falls of St Anthony . From Sandy lake the party followed the course of the Mississippi to the point where it receives the Ouisconsing . A greater part of this route is comparatively well k*nown , we shall therefore detain our readers no longer with this part of the . narrative , than to give them the following extract . In passing through lake Pepin , our interpreter pointed out to u sahigh precipice , on the east shore of the lake , fioin which an Indian *id , of the Sioux nation , had , many years ago , precipitated herself in a fit of disappointed love . She had given her heart , it appears , to a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to her , but the alliance was opposed by her parents , who wished her to marry an old chief renowned for his wisdom arid his influence in the nation . As the union was insisted upon and no other way appearing to avoid it , she determined to sacrifice her life in preference to a violation of her former vow , and while the preparations for the marriage feast were going forward , left her lather 's cabin without exciting suspicion , and before she could be overtaken , threw herself from an awful precipice and was instantly dashed to a thousand pieces . The name of this noble minded Indian girl was Oola Ita . ' A few leagues below the confluence of the Guisconsing with the Mississippi on the other side is the district of country called Dubuque 's mines , which abound with the suiphuret of lead . The right of working these mines was ceded by the Fox Indians some years ago to Mr Dubuque , who carried on the process of mining to great profit , the ore being very near the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life only , and when he died , the mines reverted to the Indians , who have since worked them and sold the ore to the traders in the vicinity . The abundance of this metal in the alluvion of the great basin of the Mississippi forms its most remarkable geological character . It is without a parallel in the extent to which it spreads and for the manner in which its veins or rather beds lay themselves bare on the surface of the rock , in which it is found . A particular account of the several districts on the Missouri , in which this metal has been observed , and of the manner in which it is mined and smelted , is contained in a former work of our author , entitled a View of the lead mines of Missouri , &amp;c. // We must now leave the Mississippi , and accompany our travellers on their return to Detroit by the way of the Guis .. consing and the Fox rivers , and the lakes lVlichigan and Huron . It was precisely by this route inverted that Marquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is a most remarkable accord in the narratives of the two travellers . The only points of difference are in their estimates of the length of the portage from Fox river to the Guisconsing and of the distance from where they strike this river to its junction with the Mississippi , and these may he satisfactorily accounted for ny considering that one descended and the other ascended it , and that the portage is not now just where it was then . Marquette places the mouth of the Guisconsing in 42* SO ' N. latitude , and that is within 12 miles of the true parallel , which is very accurate , considering the means he had for determining it . At certain seasons a perfect water communication between the Mississippi and lake Michigan is formed through this river , canoes being able to pass easily from it into the Fox river of Green Bay , but the navigation is interrupted in several places by falls . The whole distance across following the courses of the rivers is four hundred and forty miles . The Fox river is described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it looked rather like a corn field , than a river , ' and by our author as so prolific in the various species of water plants , that often , where it is a mile in width , there is scarce open space enough in its centre to allow the passage of a canoe. * Another circumstance mentioned by both these writers is the flux and reflux of the water in Green Bay , which is observed also on the other lakes , particularly Ontario , and is caused without doubt by the winds . Being now arrived on the borders of civilization , the soldiers of the escort were sent to their stations and the Indians who had been taken to hunt , were dismissed . The party formed itself into two divisions , one going around the west and north side of the lake to Mackinaw , and the other around the south and east to the same place . The shores of this lake are described as much more beautiful than those of Huron and Superior , and are also more diversified in their geological character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive rocks are scattered along the shore , which was observed to be secondary limestone , whereve* the stratw appeared through the superincumbent alluvial. // We should have been pleased to have had a more particular account of these boulders , which Mr Schoolcraft speaks of having seen upon the borders of the northern lakes , and which from all accounts , are scattered very widely over those regions . If the facts in regard to them were collected , they might throw some light upon the history of these inland seas , and possibly afford some grounds for determining the period of the great catastrophe , by which they were formed . Were they closely examined , they might probably be traced to their original places , as those upon the Jura and the banks of the Aar have been ; perhaps they would confirm Mr Hayden 's theory of a great northeast current . The appearances around Green Bay , particularly near the rivers which it recieves from the chain of mountains in which the Ontanagon rises , indicate very decidedly that copper abounds in the angle between lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten or twelve pounds in weight , was brought to Mr Schoolcraft by an Indian , who related that passing in his canoe during the afternoon of a beautiful summer 's day , across Winnebago lake , when the sun was just visible above the tops of the trees , and a delightful calm prevailed over the face of the waters , he espied at a distance in the lake before him a beautiful form standing in the water . her eyes shone with a brilliancy that could not be eiidured , and she held in her hand a lump of glittering gold . He immediately paddled towards the attractive object , but as he came near he could per .. cieve that it was gradually altering as to its shape and complexion ; her eyes no longer shone with brilliancy -- her face lost the hectic glow of life ,  --  her arms imperceptibly disappeared ; and when he came to the spot where she stood , it was a monument of stone , having a human face , with the fins and tail of a fish . He sat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-human obsect or to go away and leave it ; at length , having made an offering of the incense of tobacco , and addressed it as the guardian angel of his country , he ventured to lay his hand upon the statue , and finally lifted it into his canoe . Then sitting in the other end of the canoe with his back towards the miraculous statue , he paddled gently towards the shore , but was astonished , on turning round to find nothing in his canoe , but a large lump of copper , which I now present to you . ' How can it be said , that the aborigines of our continent are a stupid race , when they have a thousand such fictions showing the liveliest imagination ? // The principal geological and mineralogical facts , which we learn from Mr Schoolcraft 's Journal , are these-that the second*. ary region extends along the whole chain of lakes , which is mostly limestone and sandstone , and the latter chiefly around lake Superior-that beyond the portage of St Louis river , the few rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th' same formation extends from thence downward along the Mississippi to the falls of St Anthony-that copper and iron are abundant near lakes Superior and Michigan , and lead throughout the whole limestone basin of the Mississippi . But a few earthy minerals are spoken of , and those mostly silicious . It VVould now be interesting and important to determine where the primitive range commences , which runs north of the lakes , and to what depth the secondary strata extend . On the hundred and twenty third day from the time of his departure from Detroit , Mr Schooleraft returns to it again , having made a complete tour of the northern lakes , and north of them to the sources of the Mississippi and down that river to the Guisconsing , and thence across to Michigan , and again down the Huron to the St Clair . The whole distance travelled could not be far from three thousand six hundred miles . The narrative of this journey contains much valuable information upon the natural history and the geographical features of those unknown parts of our country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who inhabit them . All who are interested in these subjects are much indebted to the author for the knowledge he acquired at the expense of so much toil and hardship , and for the fidelity with which he has communicated it . But it has been the defect of all the expeditions of this kind which we have sent out , not to be provided with the instruments necessary to make the requisite observations upon the country , which they went to explore , and it appears to have been the case here . We learn from it nothing to be relied on about the height of mountains , the currents in the lakes , the fall of the rivers , the temperature of the waters , and the latitude and longitude of remarkable places . If it were reasonable to complain of one who has done so much as Mr Schooleraft , because he has not done every thing , we would say that his descriptions are too loose and indefinite ; we are not sure that he has seen one new animal , or plant , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supposes to be new , by any characters wihich decide them t0 // be so . As to language his work is highly defective , and every page he writes , is marked by a sin against the King 's English . We complain not of such words as snags , ' and bluffs , ' and prairies , * and pauses , ' and many others like ' them , which we consider legitimate , because they are technical ; but we d* complain of ' progress , ' and progressing , ' as they are used by him , of handsome opportunity , ' of ' sundown , ' of ' the ba*anceof the time , ' of illy , ' testing , ' schute , ' and eventuate , ' none of which belong to our language . We are independent An-iericans it is true , and have a right if we choose to vote out the English language altogether , but we lav* no right to corrupt it . We trust moreover that it is still a boast of every man of English descent throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his motber tongue . Subjection to it is not among the grievances complained of in the bill of rights , nor is freedom from its laws any where to be found in the declaration of independence ; and while this magna charta does not forbid allegiance to it , we hope no scholar can be found who will not keep his loyalty , his zeal , his love . ' Mr Schoolcraft 's Memoir on a fossil tree , the second work named at the head of this article , contains an account of a phenomenon , which is certainly of rare occurrence . It is thus described . This extrordinary species of phytolites occurs imbedded in a horizontal position in a stratum of newer fioetz sandstone , of a grey colour , and close grain . There are now fifty-one feet six inches of the trunk visible . It is eighteen inches in diameter at the smallest end , which appears to have been violently broken off or to the era of its mineralization . The root-end is still overlayed by the rock and earth in the western bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter at the point of disappearance ; but circumstances will justify the conclusion that its diameter at the concealed end , can not be less than three feet . The trunk is strait*ht , simple , scabrous , without branches , and has the gradual longit*idinal taper observed in the living specimen . It lies nearly at iright angles to the course of the river , pointing towards the south-east , and extends about half the width of the stream . Notwithstanding the continual abrasion to which it is exposed by the vdume of passing water , it has suffered little apparent diminution , and is still firmly imbedded in the rock , with the exception of t wo or three places where portions of it have been disengaged and carried away ; but no portion of what remains is elevated n mre than a few inches above the surface of // the rock . It is owi*ng , however , to those partial disturbances , that we are enabled to perceive the columnar form of the trunk ,  --  . its cortical layers  --  the bark by which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render the evidence of its ligneous origin , so striking and complete . From these characters and appearances , little doubt can remain that it is referable to the species juglans nigra , a tree very common to the forests of the Illinois , as well as to most other parts of the immense region drained by the waters of the Mississippi . The woody structure is most obvious in the outer rind of the trunk , extending to a depth of two or three inches , and these appearances become less evident as we approximate the heart . Indeed , the traces of organic structure in its interior , particularly when viewed in the hand specimen , are almost totally obliterated and exchanged , the vegetable matter being replaced by a mixed substance analogous , in its external character , to same of the silicated and impure calcareous carbonats of the region . Like those carbonats , it is of a brownish grey colour , and compact texture , effervesces slightly in the nitric and muriatic acids , yields a white streak under the knife , and presents solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All parts of the tree are penetrated by pyrites of a brass yellow colour , disseminated through the most solid and stony parts of the interior ,  --  filling interstices in the outer rind , or investing its capillary pores . There are also the appearances of rents or seams between the fibres of the wood , caused by its own shrinkage , which are now filled with a carbonat of lime , of a white colour , and crystallized . ' This description is very correct , so far as we can judge from a small specimen sent to the mineralogical cabinet at Cambridge by Governor Cass , which we have been permitted to examine . In this specimen the calcareous spar in the centre , the seams of pyrites and white carbonate of lime in the outer rind are distinctly seen . But there are distinctive characters in it , which Mr Schooleraft has only slightly hinted at , in another part of the memoir , where he speaks of the exterior rind and bark having acquired a blackish hue , from an effect analogous to carbonization . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the thing itself . Throughout the mass , wherever its fibrous structure remains , it appears to be perfect anthracite , becoming ignited by the action of the blowpipe , yielding neither flame , nor smoke , nor bituminous odor , and bearing a large portion of grayish white ashes ; also soiling the fingers and having a dull blackish trace . Instead therefore of regarding this tree as petrified // July , and converted into a lithoxyle , we look upon it as carbonized and converted into the substance above named , into which calcareous matter has entered by infiltration , and filled up the fissures formed by the decomposition of some parts , and the shrinking of the fibres , with sulphuret of iron here and there disseminated . A single glance at its cross fracture shows that its vertical layers are not calcareous . It was probably carbonized in some of the coal fields , with which that region abounds , and then swept into the river , where it now lies , and afterwards filled up with the calcareous matter which now constitutes so large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand of the river . Calcareous lithoxyles are exceedingly rare ; in fact we know of none , unless some of the petrifications observed by Riche , Peron , and Le Sueur in their voyage to the terres australes , may be so considered . These are our conjectures-they may be wrong , and it looks somewhat like vanity , we confess , to sit here in our attic , and presume to know what is done on the Illinois , better than those who have been on the spot to examine .
