WE looked forward to the appearance of this volume with interest , and are satisfied with its execution . It comes as near to the plan proposed of sin . /Innuat Register , as could be expected , under all the difficulties incident to a first essay . Some portions of it , indeed , appear to have been executed in haste ; and several parts would beav an increased expansion and detail . The portion dedicated to the separate states , is somewhat meagre . It should be wholly omitted , or more elaborately wrought up . With adequate pains bestowed on this department , we are quite sure that it might be made equal in interest and value , to any portion of an American Annual Register . More than any other part , it would carry the recommendation of novelty , to most readers in this country . Almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs ; and some indistinct notion , at least , of what is going on in Europe . But let our readers search their memories at the end of the year , and see how good an account they can give of the events , which have taken place in each of the twenty-four states of this confederacy . Let it not be said , that we know little of what is passing in our sister states , because there is little of importance to be known . Far from it . There is not a state in the union , whose internal administration is not a rich study for the American citizen , politician , and statesman ; while many of the states stand before us in the aspect of republics growing up into a consequence , which must ultimately compare with that evI*n of the Union . For this , and other reasons , we sincerely hope , that great diligence will be bestowed on that department of ' The American Register , ' which is devoted to the affairs of the separate states . It will , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The requisite materials and means of information are not concentrated , as they are in reference to the general government , and the political affairs of the Union . But after they shall have been duly collected and condensed , we feel persuaded they will be found , in the judgment of all intelligent readers , to add highly to the value of ' The Register . ' It is not to be inferred from these remarks , that the present volume contains // *nothing in this way . A beginning is made , as ample , perhaps , as ought to have been expected , of a selection of notices , pertaining to the separate states ; but this department will bear and reward all the diligence , with which it can be cultivated . The strictly historical portion of the work falls , of course , into the two great divisions of domestic and foreign ; and the former is necessarily chiefly devoted to the doings of the first session of the last congress . This part of the work ( in some respects the most delicate , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been as satisfactorily executed , in reference to such questions , as the nature of things admits . The leaning towards the administration is obvious ; but the arguments , adduced by those opposed to the measures of the administration , are , we think , fairly dealt by . The course to be pursued , in a work making pretensions to historical dignity , in reference to questions of party politics , is not altogether easy to be settled . The frantic partiality of the violent newspapers , is , of course , to be avoided , not as being beneath the gravity of history , but as *unworthy the order of beings , whom Providence has endowed with reason and speech . On the other hand , the nature and operation of what is called impartiality , in the historian of polical occurrences , especially contemporaneous occurrences , require to be well understood , before it is too urgently recommended . A real , honest impartiality , which , without a shade of human weakness , in the form of favor or of enmity , should pronounce on men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , be a glorious quality in a historian . But such an impartiality is plainly not given to frail man , certainly not in reference to the political events , which are passing around us , and the prominent political characters of the day . He must have his feelings , in respect to these events and characters ; and these feelings will bias his judgment . There is indeed , a state of mind , which may sometimes exist in reference to contemporary political events , that of a cold indifference , or a strong aversion to both of two prominent parties , which would seem to promise something like impartiality , in forming and expressing judgments upon them . But even this promise is delusive . For , not to urge the rarity of the thing itself ( it being next to impossible , that a precise equipoise even in indifference or aversion should exist ) , the result will be , that alternate injustice will be done to both parties . The // credit , which may occasionally be awarded to both , will be coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn will perhaps be obnoxious , will not be emphatically expressed , from a fear of disturbing the stoical balance of assumed impar-. tiality . If the feeling cherished toward the two parties be that of equal and decided hostility , manifold injustice will he done to one , or the other , or both . It is next to impossible , that both parties should be alike worthy of hatred ; consequently , to hate them alike is itself an injury to the least odious . Besides this , a strong passion of hostility wholly unfits the mind to discourse on the acts of others . Take , for instance , the writings of Burke on the French revolution . He was certainly very impartial between the Girondists and the Jacobins ; but the fervor of his feelings unfitted him to write the history of either , and especially to do any justice to the points , on which they were divided . It did fit him out with an *ipostolic mission , to rouse the fear and hatred of the world against both ; but this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate more clearly our meaning , on the subject of impartiality in a writer on contemporary politics , we will instance the Life of Napoleon , ' by Sir Walter Scott . Apart from literary execution , the main fault of this book is its claim to be impartial . We do not mean to set this down as a hypocritical and affected impartiality . We believe the eminent author designed to be impartial , and occasionally put himself under constraint to attain that end . It being , however , in the nature of things physically impossible for an Englishman , of the government side in politics , a person for twenty or thirty years employed in writing in reviews , magazines , registers , and newspapers , and separate works on the British and the government side of the question , to be really impartial ; that is , to have no prepossession in favor of his own country , and no prejudice against its most dangerous enemy ; the assumed character of impartiality can have no other result , than , that while it perhaps leads him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will give additional weight to his unfavorable view of the entire character and policy of his hero . Take an example from what he says of Lafayette . We presume that Sir Walter Scott , considering that this country contains about one half of those , by whom his book was to be read , felt a strong desire to be impartial toward the man , who had lately passed , in wonderful triumph , throughout the Amercan Continent . He does not , ac // cordingly , speak of him in the terms , with which he was usually mentioned , and is still , when mentioned at all , by the political disciples of Mr Pitt ,  --  terms of the bitterest hatred . He even speaks of him in something like the language of praise ; but this serves only to give additional force to the sarcastic gentleness , with which he condemns his conduct at the most critical moment . We refer to the dreadful scene of the removal from Versailles . Lafayette , we are told , advanced at the head of his civic army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this great force seemed to restore a portion of tranquillity , though no one seemed to know , with certainty , how it was likely to act . Lafayette had an audience of the king , explained the means he had adopted for the security of the palace , recommended to the inhabitants to go to rest , and unhappily set the example by retiring himself . Before doing so , however , he also visited the assembly , pledged himself for the safety of the royal family , and the tranquillity of the night , and , with some difficulty , prevailed on the president Mounier to adjourn the sitting which had been voted permanent . He thus took upon himself the responsibility for the quiet of the night . We are loath to bring into question the worth , honor , and fidelity of Lafayette ; and we can therefore only lament , that weariness should have so far overcome him , at an important crisis , and that he should have trusted to others the execution of those prechutions , which were most grossly neglected . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is followed up by more in the same strain . We give Sir Walter Scott credit , for being loa*th to bring into question the worth , honor , and fidelity of Lafayette . ' He nevertheless does it ; and this being the case , we , as friends to Laf*iyette , should like to have it done heartily ; with all the warmth , which a failure at this important crisis ' demands . If duty dictates , we would have the historian adopt the language of Si*yes , which was at least manly , in declaring for the death of Louis ( an expression which has escaped Sir Walter in narrating the scene ) , and vote la mort-sans phrase . ' This digression , we hope , will not be thought unseasonable , in connexion with our notice of a historical survey of the  |p6-litical  events of our own country and our own day . We have already stated , that , in narrating the domestic political history of the year , we think the editor of ' The Annual Register ' has practised about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // stating the arguments of those opposed to the measures , which he himself approves . In expressing this opinion , we do not , of course , in any degree , intend to offer ourselves as vouchers for the correctness of the single opinions or sentiments which he avows . In the literary execution of this part of The Register , ' we are inclined to recommend less ample quotations from the speeches , made while measures are under discussion in Congress , and indeed from documents of any kind . Such documents as it may be proper to present entire , might advantageously be given in a smaller type in the Appendix . With respect to the debates , as an ample provision is now made for their entire publication , in a work exclusively dedicated to their preservation , their omission in the historical Register would be attended with no sacrifice to its readers , and would afford space for an ampler detail of matters of fact . The execution of the portion of The Register , ' which relates to foreign history , was not accompanied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , to which the domestic history was exposed . The pages devoted to the different foreign countries of America , and the old world , though varying in fulness of detail , are highly instructive . We apprehend there is no reader , however assiduous in reading or preserving his newspapers , who could go through these pages , without finding his recollections corrected , brought into order , and filled up . Of several of the countries , our newspapers give us but little intelligence . Of none of them do they give us a regular chain of intelligence . The nature of a newspaper would render this almost impossible , with the greatest diligence and care . Its columns must , in general , be engrossed with the news of the day . At subsequent and stated periods , to write the successive articles of intelligence ; to sift out the truth ; to furnish the requisite documentary information ; and to throw the whole into a historical chapter , though obviously a work , to which the intelligent editor of a newspaper would come well prepared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he can reasonably be expected to bestow ; and it is precisely the province of the writer of an Annual Register . We deem it no more than strict justice to say , that this department of The Annual Register ' is much better filled , than the corresponding part of any English register , with which we are acquainted . But we do not wish our readers to take our opinion of the // work on trust ; and we shall therefore lay before them a more detailed account of the matter contained in it , and the mode in which it is treated . The period at which its historical portion commences , is the fiftieth year of the Independence of the country ; the beginning of the administration of the present chief magistrate , in some respects , starting under new auspices ; and the opening of a new congress . These tangible points of departure at home , are met with sufficiently corresponding events of peculiarity , in the aspect of foreign affairs , to constitute altogether a marked epoch . It may be considered politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age at home , and the reign of the colonial system abroad . In the first and introductory chapter , the views apposite to this state of things are expressed , with no little originality and force . The successive events by which the change in foreign politics was brought about , particularly the severance of the different parts of Spanish and Portuguese America from political dependence on Europe ; the councils of the continental alliance , in reference to these events ; the policy of Great Britain and the United States , in regard to the intercourse of the remaining colonies of the former , are sketched with vigor . The last of these topics , the colonial dispute between the United States and Great Britain , has since grown up into a great question of controversy , which will undoubtedly receive an ample developement in the next volume of ' The Register . ' We can not but observe on the kind of fatality , which leads the citizens of the United States to make the controversies of the confederacy with foreign powers , a matter of domestic party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting reproach of our polhics ) in the controversies growing out of the French revolution , was ascribed to the infancy and consequent weakness of our own government , the newness of our institutions , and the want of a national feeling , sufficiently strong and peculiar to master all minor impulses . It was to be hoped , as it was unanimously and heartily predicted would be the case , that our foreign relations would never again be reproachfully made the topics of domestic division . After recapitulating the principles of the colonial policy of Great Britain , as far as they were then unfolded , the introductory chapter presents us with the visit of Lafayette , as a happy incident at the close of the revolutionary age , singular , even unparalleled , in its nature , and genial in its influence . // The political history of the year is related in the following chapters , from the second to the fifth inclusive . The first treats of the inauguration of the present chief magistrate , whose speech is given entire . The business transacted at the ensuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account given of the formation of the opposition to the national administration ; the rise and progress of the controversy relative to the Creek lands narrated , and a general survey taken of the position of Indian affairs . These topics , with the trials of Commodores Stuart and Porter , the measures of internal improvement pursued during the recess of congress , the progress of manufactures , and the extraordinary agitations of the commercial world , in the course of the summer , fill up the first chapter . The next chapter introduces us to the proceedings of the nineteenth congress , and relates the proposal and discussion of the amendments of the constitution , brought forward in the two houses ; of which , as is well known , the principal features were a division of the United States into as many districts , as the number of electors to be chosen , and the removal of the eventual decision of the election , from the House of Representatives . Could the former question have been presented alone , and discussed without any association with the state of parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed . A small majority of the House of Representatives voted against the resolution which related to this point . The objections to it were , either , in general , to all changes in the constitution , or grounded on the opinion that many of the alleged evils incident to the present system , would continue to flow from that proposed as a substitute . It is true , however , that a part of the opposition to the measure , proceeded on the principle , that it was an encroachment on the rights of the states . This argument was sustained , in a very able speech , by Mr Stevenson , of Virginia . The vote on the other proposed amendment , was strong in the affirmative ( one hundred and twenty-three to sixty-four ) ; and yet it is probable , that if the question had been pushed , in any tangible detail , it would have met with very slender support . To resolve , in the general , that the election of the president ought , in no case , to devolve on the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To embody the principle of that resolution , in any specific measure , would be found very seriously to intrencli on the delicate part of the equality guarantied , in some respects , to the states . Though the resolution // in favor of a system of districts was rejected , and that in favor of removing the eventual election from the House , sustained hy a large majority of that body , *et when the latter resolution was referred to a committee of one from each state , that committee found themselves unable to agree on any report , and were discharged from the further consideration of the subject . The next subject taken up in The Register , ' is the Panama mission ; and the proceedings of the two houses upon this question are related in detail . The proposed extension of the judiciary system is then discussed , and with the subject of the finances , the appropriation bills , and the proposed relief of the revolutionary officers , completes the history of the session . We are aware that an analysis so hasty as this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of the volume . It may serve however , at least , to assist those who have not yet seen it , in forming a correct anticipation of its nature . A moment 's reflection will be sufficient to produce a strong impression of the value of such a work in our political history , did we possess it in a complete series from the foundation of the government . While many good books , from the nature of their subjects , lose their value with time , and are scarcely thought of after the gloss of novelty is worn from the first edition , the volumes of a historical journal like this , will be prized , almost in proportion to their age . An American Annual Register , commencing with the Revolution , if such a thing could be conceived of in that day of poverty and tribulation , and continued down to the present time , would be positively invaluable to all , whom it imports to be acquainted with our political history . Although it is , of course , not to be expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the interest belonging to a record of the past , yet we are persuaded that a great majority , even of those who consider themselves attentive observers of affairs , would find no little instruction in perusing the condensed narrative of the transactions even of the last congress , as related in the first part of this work . With the sixth chapter begins , what may be called , in the strictest sense , the foreign history . The West Indies , British , Spanish , and Haytian , are treated in this chapter . The incasures adopted by the British government , for the improvement // of the condition of the blacks , and the proceedings relative to these measures in the islands , are described . The political position of Cuba is next briefly discussed ; and the remainder of the chapter devoted to a very excellent abstract of the proceedings connected with the French recognition of Hayti . The seventh chapter passes in review the subjects of Mexico , Central America , Rio de la Plata , Chile , and Paraguai ; the eighth is dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth to Brazil . There is perhaps no range of subjects , of which we hear and read so much , to so little purpose , for want of a previous generalization of the main facts relative to so large a family of states . The sketches here given , are executed from good sources , and with commendable dili-. gence . They contain information , curious certainly in itself , highly interesting to the political student , and of unequalled moment to the American statesman . It is too early to say , to what extent our politics will be affected by the emancipation of Portuguese and Spanish America ; but it is not too early to say , that there is no part of the political map of the world , which we of North America may find more temptation or necessity to study , than that which comprehends the regions , which lie to the south of us on this continent . The succeeding chapters are devoted to Great Britain ; to France ; to Spain and Portugal ; to Russia and the other states of Europe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American reader will wish to take along with him , on these states , in order to form a correct and sufficient acquaintance with the political character and historical events of the times . We might refer , for a specimen of the kind and degree of information contained in these chapters , to the sketch of the origin and progress of the war between Russia and Persia . The fifteenth chapter presents a condensed and satisfactory sketch of the Burmese war , from the origin of hostilities to the treaty of peace ; and the sixteenth , the last chapter of the historical portion of the work , is occupied with events on the western coast of Africa , among the Barbary powers , and in E* , ypt . Under this last head , are related , sufficiently in detail , the history and fortunes of the present tributary sovereign of that country , Mohammed Ali . The fifty or sixty pages which follow , under the head of Local History and Domestic Occurrences , ' form the part of The Register , ' which is dedicated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that greater extension could be advantageously given to this department . We have no doubt that when the first difficulties of organizing channels of information shall be overcome , this section of ' The Register ' will become especially rich in matter and interest . It must be borne in mind , that some of the states , New York at least , numbers nearly half the population of the memorable thirteen , who fought the battles of our Independence ; and that her resources , and her public works are , in no degree , below the proportion of her population . Nor can we be unmindful of the vast system of internal improvements now in active progress in Pennsylvania and Ohio , and projected in Massachusetts , in Maryland , and Virginia . The progress of manufactures , the legislative organization , the local controversies of the ' different states have something of interest . Few , if any of the topics which we have thus glanced at , are wholly omitted in the present volume . We name them only to strengthen the impression of the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving to them all the space which can be spared from the other divisions of the work . The other main portion of the work contains a selection of public documents , both foreign and domestic ; a selection of important law cases follows these ; and the volume closes with obituary notices of distinguished persons , who have died in the course of the year , particularly of Adams and Jefferson . Such is a hasty analysis of the first volume of The American Annual Register , ' a work essentially modelled on The Annual Register ' of Dodsley , which was projected , and in its historical portion , for many years , written by Burke ; and which , with a very fluctuating style of execution , and amidst several able rival publications , has maintained its rank to the present day . A work of the kind , in this country , has long been a deside*aturn , and has once or twice been attempted , and for a short time carried on . The plan of an Annual Register was submitted to the public four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been necessarily relinquished by him , it has been revived , in New York , by the editor of the present work . To say that this work is everything that the public could expect in such an enterprise , and everything that the editor and his collaborators could make it , would be to say , that they are to learn nothing by experience ; and by bringing // into system the numerous and disconnected parts of the organi-* zation , implied in such a work . We exhort them and their publishers to persevere , believing that a well conducted Annual Register will not only render an immediate and essential service to its readers in this country ; but that those portions of it , which relate to domestic affairs ( the largest part in general of the work ) will , by affording a better vehicle of information than elsewhere exists , discharge a very important office to the cause of free institutions , by conveying to foreign countries an accurate and detailed statement of their operation here .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
