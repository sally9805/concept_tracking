txt OPINION , says one of our most able statesmen , " Opinion is the queen of the world . " But her decrees are not , like the laws of the Medes and Persians , unalterable . Changes sometimes take place ; and the frequency of change is , generally , in an inverse ratio to the magnitude of the body changing . Small communities change often ; while larger ones are more slow and gradual in their changes ; and it is a long time before an opinion , which has been entertained by the bulk of mankind , will be abandoned . Yet such changes have actually occurred , in the sciences , in politics , and in religion . The opinions now maintained are , many of them , directly opposite to those , which were supported a few centuries ago . and these changes have been the result of greater light and knowledge . Thus , the ancient systems of astronomy were overthrown by Copernicus , limited monarchy and self-government take the place of despotism , and " the glorious Gospel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precepts of the Old Testament , which were suited to the hard hearts of a stiffnecked generation ; and when this " new and better covenant " had been obscured , by a long night of ignorance and superstition , it was again brought to light by a few magnanimous reformers ; and knowledge has been since that time increasing , though we are yet far from the virtues of the first professors of Christianity . Of the many changes in public opinion , I would call your attention to those only , which have an immediate bearing on the cause of permanent and universal peace . Piracy was a common practice with the polished Athenians , the most polite and refined nation of antiquity , and that piracy was practised in the most bloody and ferocious manner ; it being the custom to murder all the prisoners , excepting a few , reserved for slavery . With our Scandinavian ancestors , a hero was famous in proportion to the success of his piracies . A renowned pirate was considered as the most praiseworthy and honourable of mankind , enjoying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propitiate by sac- rifices of human victims . The greatest glory and pleasure of this warlike nation consisted in intoxicating themselves with mead , drunk from the sculls of their slaughtered enemies , and their greatest disgrace was to die in bed ; to avoid which , they dashed themselves in pieces , by leaping from precipices . As their state of society was unfriendly to agriculture , and their support , depending on pillage , precarious , it was lawful for parents to expose their children to perish , or to sell them into slavery , when it was inconvenient to support them . Less than two centuries ago , vessels were fitted out in British ports on both sides the Atlantic , for the avowed purpose of piracy ; and the brave Dampier returned to England to publish his journal of a cruise in the Pacific ocean , and to enjoy the glory and plunder he had acquired by his heroic deeds of murder and robbery ; and was not only unpunished and uncensured for his crimes , but advanced to the station of a commander in the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these particulars ! So far is piracy from being honourable , in our days , that all private war , even though sanctioned by a license , and waged against the subjects of a hostile power , has become , in a great measure , disgraceful ; and a laudable attempt has been made by our govern- ment , to put a stop to privateering throughout the Christian world . The time was , when piracy was considered as honourable as any war ; and the time will come , when no war , at least no offensive war , will be thought more honourable than piracy . In ancient times , differences were settled by judicial combat . Public opinion sanctioned the practice , and the conqueror was honoured , while the vanquished was consigned to contempt and ignominy . Unfortunately , this savage custom is not entirely obliterated , but public opinion is so far corrected , that the vanquished are sometimes buried with military honours . Slavery is so intimately connected with war , that it fairly comes within the range of my subject . The present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty years ago , the slave trade was as honourable , as it was lucrative . Now it is made piracy , by law , and is viewed with horror and disgust , by every virtuous member of society . Formerly , prisoners of war were put to the torture , or murdered in cold blood , or enslaved . Now , the moment an enemy lays down his arms , he ceases to be a foe , and is treated with all the hospitality , which is due to a stranger . So great is our detestation of a contrary line of conduct , ! lrit. notwithstanding our sympathy for the suffer- ing Greeks , we are shocked at their barbarities , and lament that they have inherited the cruelty , along with the bravery of their pagan ancestors ; regardless of the precepts of that benign religion , by the sacred name of which they are called . The time was , when women and children were carried into captivity and sold for slaves ; now , not only they , but , all other non-combatants , except seamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not take up your time , to enumerate customs , which have long since , and forever , passed away ; but which were once as strenuously advocated , as the custom of war is now , or ever has been ; for your memory will furnish you with changes in public opinion , as great as any I have mentioned . We may therefore safely conclude , from the experience of the past , that , as mankind advance in knowledge and refinement , other changes , ameliorating the condition of the human species , may be effected ; and that , among other evils , the custom of war , the most direful scourge that has ever afflicted mankind , may cease . What gives us the greatest encouragement in this hope , is the fact , that society itself has the supreme control over that passion , which above all others , is a cause of war , a love of military glory . And what is this glory ? A bubble , " a puff of noisy breath , " which every individual in d /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish ; a vampyre , which lives on the breath of the people , and starves the living , to feed the ead . So long as mankind continue to elevate invaders and conquerors , those scourges of their race , to the highest pinnacle of renown , so long must they expect to smart beneath their lash . What induced Alexander to depopulate his paternal dominions , to enable him to conquer Persia ? The love of glory . What induced Charles the Twelfth to draw , from his iron hills , " the soldier and his sword , " and impoverish a country already poor ? It was the example of Alexander , which fired his mind , with the love of military glory . What induced Frederick of Prussia to make war on the young , defenceless , orphan Queen of Hungary ? He tells you himself , " the hope of acquiring rcnoicn " In what do these characters differ from the marauder , who robs the sheepfold and butchers the flock , for sport ; from the highwayman , who plunders the traveller of a jewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bully , who waylays , robs , and insults a defenceless woman , that he may boast of it ; in what do they differ , except in the magnitude of their crimes , and the multitude of their offences ? As such men are influenced by public opinion , if they met the same contempt in one case as in the other ; if , instead of being entitled " the great , " they were brand- ed as infamous , there would be no such characters . It is evident , that the continuance of the custom of war depends on the voice of the people , not only in republican governments , where it is the supreme law , but also in the most absolute monarchies ; for even despots bow to the " Queen of the world " and acknowledge her power . Public opinion can not only prevent those wars which originate in a love of glory , which are by far the greater part , but it can also overawe the love of power , of wealth , of revenge , and say to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is not probably in this assembly , nor in all our happy country , a man so hardened , as to assert , that war is a blessing , that it is not a curse , a most direful calamity . War 's greatest apologists universally agree to call it an evil ; a tremendous evil . Since then , all acknowledge war to be an evil of enormous magnitude , it is unnecessary for me to descant on its horrors and atrocities . Unfortunately , they have been too well exemplified , in our day . What pencil can paint , what language can describe , the horrors of Borodino , Moscow ' , Berezina and Waterloo ? horrors which have not been equalled since the sack of Jerusalem . Nor are these miseries confined to the wounded soldier , consumed , alive , in the burning hospital , amid the /z/ shrieks and groans of twelve thousand others , as wretched as himself ; ( a ) nor to him who , overcome with hunger and fatigue , and pierced by the northern blast , falls , unheeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which soon covers him ; ( b ) nor to him who , benumbed with cold , seated on the dead body of his fellow-soldier , gnaws a half wasted human limb , or the remains of a scanty pittance of horse flesh , of which he has just robbed his dying comrade ; too happy , if the excess of his sufferings has brought on a delirium , which causes his hysteric laugh to prevail over the dying groans of his companions ; ( c ) nor to him who , having escaped these dangers , is tumbled , by a fellow-soldier 's arm , from the bridge , into the freezing current of the Berezina , or is trampled to death , beneath the hoofs of the flying cavalry , or is crushed beneath the ponderous wheels of the retreating artillery ; ( d ) nor to him , who lay fourteem nights and days , oh how long those nights and days ! expiring on the field of Waterloo , ( e ) Nor is this all , no , nor trampled harvests , nor burning cottages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor houseless age , nor starving childhood , nor even the shrinks of virgin beauty , flying , in vain , from the hot pursuit of lust ; no , these do not fill up the picture . In the background , obscured from vulgar gaze , the aged parent , robbed , by the conscription or impressment , of /z/ his last earthly hope , the widowed mother , with her defenceless orphans , the betrothed virgin , with all her fond anticipations blasted , and the cup of connubial felicity dashed untasted from her lips , and the thousand ramifications of misery , wherever there are hearts to bleed or bosoms to heave , all these are necessary to make up the scene . And when all these w 7 ell authenticated facts , and ten thousand others , are collected together , and there is added to them , all that the most vivid imagination can conceive , still the picture falls far , very far , short of the original . Now what is the cause of all this intensity of suffering ? Ambition . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must die ? We , the people . But , because there is no evil , however great , which may not be productive of some good , war has its advocates , who would put a few adventitious circumstances in the scale against the immensity of suffering and grief , which it causes . War , say its abettors , gives opportunity for the display of fortitude and heroism . So did the Inquisition . But would any one wish for its rc-establislmierit , that another Cranmer , ( by turns a persecutor and persecuted , ) might burn his own right hand to a cinder , or that a Huss might exhibit an heroic fortitude and contempt of death , in all its most horrid forms . Public opinion has frowned on religious persecution and annihilated /z/ it . The despot of Spain , with all his folly , dare not restore the Inquisition , and when public opinion shall equally frown on war , no despot will be able to resist her . But , without war , what should we do for materials for history ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest the annals of Newgate and the newspapers of the day should lack interest ? Are mankind such vultures , that nothing will suit their appetite but blood and carnage . Are not tornadoes , inundations , earthquakes and pestilence , sufficient to satisfy our longings for the miseries of our fellow-creatures ? What prevents us from taking an interest in the march of intellect , the progress of science , improvements in the arts , the spread of the Gospel , and the increasing comforts of all classes of men at home and abroad . But , our moral taste is vitiated , in our youth even in our infancy . Almost the first sounds we hear are martial , the first playthings we handle are military , the first pictures and spectacles we see are warlike , and the first books we read exalt valour over every other virtue , and conquerors above all other men . Were it not for this , a safety lamp would interest us more than a Congreve rocket , the tunnel under the Thames more than the trophy at Waterloo ; the canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than the battle of the Nile , which , to say nothing of the loss of /z/ lives and limbs , cost more money than both ; and , to come back to our own country , had not our taste been thus vitiated , our grand canal , which , like most other great and noble enterprises , was at its commencement sneered at by little minds , but by the completion of which , the stupendous genius , that planned the gigantic work , has covered himself with unfading laurels , and erected a monument , infinitely surpassing the trophies of Alexander or Caesar , of Tamerlane or Napoleon ; I say , were it not for prejudices imbibed in our youth , this splendid and bloodless victory of art over nature , would be a greater cause of exultation than all the glory of the late war , though purchased at less than a twentieth part of the expense . But war is an interesting spectacle . So is a city on fire ; but what modern Nero would set fire to this city , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur of the scene ? The view of a volcano is grand and majestic , but who would wish to see the vineyards , villas and villages , which adorn the base of Vesuvius , inundated by a flood of burning lava , and Naples , like Herculaneum and Pompeii , buried under a shower of cinders , that he might gratify his admiration of the sublime . But , say our opponents , war is necessary to drain off the refuse of society , and cleanse the body politic of its peccant humors : a fine com- /z/ ( diluent to the dignity of human nature in general , and to the army and navy in particular ! But fact speaks a contrary doctrine , and assures us that where one vagabond is disposed of in war , ten others are made ; to say nothing of the brave , the generous and humane , who , infatuated by a love of fame , rush blindly into the same destructive vortex . That war corrupts the public morals and lowers the standard of morality is proverbial ; so that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mending its morals , acts as wisely as the man , who subjects himself to a loathsome disease , in order to purify his blood . But , say the friends of war , allowing all your arguments to be correct , still it is necessary to keep up a martial spirit for the purpose of self-defence . In the reign of Queen Elizabeth , every man in England wore a sword . History does not inform us who first laid it aside , nor is the time of the change distinctly marked , but the fashion altered , and the citizen of London is now infinitely less exposed to insult , than when he went armed . What protects the unarmed citizen ? Public opinion ; and public opinion , when well informed , will equally protect the state , that seeks for peace . Besides , the progress of the principles of peace will , like all other great changes , be gradual and general , though they may prevail more in one country than in another ; and experience has shewn , that where they have been adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join our lukewarm friends and say , however good your motive , your object is chimerical and Utopian , and your hopes will never be realized , wars will continue so long as the world stands . The same objections were made against the early reformers , the opposers of the slave trade and the advocates for religious toleration . Yet , these causes have succeeded in a measure , are still in progress , and will advance until the most sanguine expectations of their first movers shall be realized . The greatest changes must have a beginning . All the great moral revolutions , which the world has witnessed , have each been commenced by one or two individuals . Luther and Calvin began the reformation ; Clarkson and Wilberforce undertook the abolition of the slave trade . Had not individuals made the attempt , the Roman Catholic superstition and the slave trade would have continued to this day undiminished . But were it always peace , we should have none of the " pomp and circumstance of glorious war . " We should miss our triumphs , our illuminations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles , and all that display of beauty , eloquence , glitter and parade , which are so captivating to the fancy of the young , and which renew the youthful vigor of the hoary veteran . These are fine flowers . /z/ it must be confessed , but they are manured with the blood of the brave , and watered with the tears of widows and orphans , and their fruits are often " the grapes of Sodom and the clusters of Gomorrah . " Instead of a triumphal procession , after a victory , should the livid and disfigured corses of the dead be borne along , followed by litters filled with the wounded , and surrounded by widows and orphans ; if , instead of martial music , were heard the loud groans of the wounded , and the shrieks of the bereaved , one such triumph would forever sicken us of war . But no , while loud Te Deums rend the air , the sigh which breaks the heart , and the " tear which scalds the cheek , " are shut out from our observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too futile to require refutation , and we pass to other reflections . To those who judge a matter before they hear it , we can say nothing . Of those who are too wise in their own conceits ever to change an opinion , according to the proverb , we can have but little hope . But to men of candour and enlarged views , we say , the subject deserves investigation ; the object we aim at is all important ; the blessings we seek are unspeakable ; they are certainly worth an endeavour . As great changes have taken place in public opinion as that which we contemplate . Public opinion has already passed over more than /z/ half the distance , which separates the barbarous customs of our ancestors from a total abolition of the custom of war , and it must , to every one , appear infinitely more probable , that it will advance until it reaches the utmost bounds of our wishes , than that it should retrograde into those shades of ignorance , cruelty , oppression and injustice , which were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution of public opinion has commenced ; and , " revolutions do not go back . " The time will come , and that shortly , when nations will settle their disputes by amicable adjustment or arbitration , and will look back on war with as much amazement , as we do on the ordeal by battle and the burning of heretics , and with equal astonishment , that mankind should ever have thought of settling their differences by the sword , or their faith by the faggot . The friends of peace have much to encourage them . All their reasonable expectations have been thus far realized . The reign of peace , like the kingdom of Heaven , of which it is the harbinger , " cometh not with observation . " By its very nature it is without tumult , pomp and display . It is not in the whirlwind , it is not in the earthquake , but , it is in the " still small voice . " It is not like the cataract , dashing impetuously from precipice to precipice , bedewing the skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding the /z/ spectator in breathless and painful admiration ; but it is like the gentle stream , diffused over a thousand valleys and plains , making the desert to rejoice and blossom as the rose , and only marking its course by the verdure it causes . A great , but silent change has already been wrought , not only throughout this country , but also in a great part of Europe . Large bodies move slowly ; but when they are once set in motion , they are not easily resisted . I would not intrude so much on your time , as to mention all the omens of the present day , which are auspicious to the cause of peace . Not the least favourable , is the formation of peace societies , on both sides of the Atlantic . The circumstance , that these societies were projected simultaneously , in various parts of the world , without the knowledge of each other , is a demonstration of a great change in public opinion . That gentlemen high in office , in rank , and in influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace , without fear of singularity , would have been considered incredible , twenty-five years ago . The glorious stand which has been made against slavery , both in this country and Great Britain , may be reckoned among occurrences , favourable to the cause of peace . It is not possible that enlightened men should have their attention aroused /z/ to the state of negro slavery , without being led to the slavery of the soldier , who not only , like the other , loses his right to a trial by jury , and is subject to the same degrading punishments , but , is also compelled to murder his fellow-man , and to put his conscience into the keeping of his commander ; and is reduced to the state of a machine , an instrument , a tool in the hands of sordid avarice , or no less selfish ambition , without being able to throw off his awful responsibility to that God , whose laws he is compelled to violate ; and is set to fight like a dog or a game cock , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier is worse off than the slave ; for , since public opinion has frowned gladiatorial shows out of countenance , slaves are not compelled to fight for the amusement of their masters . I may here be met by the objection , that negro slavery is involuntary , while the servitude of the soldier is otherwise . This is not the case . To say nothing of impressment , conscription , and trepanning , as practised in Europe , what better are our own rendezvous ; where a man is inveigled , and often enlisted in a state of partial , if not total ebriety , and when once enlisted , there is no escape but by desertion , which is punished with death , and that sometimes without a trial ? Is it possible , that a people should be sensible to negro slavery , and unmindful of the slavery of the white man ? If public opinion /z/ can abolish one species of slavery , it can the other , and there is no doubt it can and will abolish both . What we could save by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , Were we as humane and benevolent , as we are ambitious of military glory , SLAVERY , that disgrace and opprobrium of a free people , would long ago have been wiped away , and all our black population , except what could safely be permitted to live in freedom among us , would have been colonized abroad . The vessels which lay rotting at our wharves during the late war , would have been sufficient for their transportation , and the sailors employed on board our navy and privateers , sufficient for the navigation of those vessels , and the expenses of the war would nearly , if not quite , have paid the ransom . Arbitration on national differences , and the abolition of private war on the ocean , two changes , in which our country has the glory of having taken the lead , may be considered as accomplishing the ardent desires of the friends of peace . When we left some of our differences with Great Britain to the arbitration of the Emperor of Russia , it certainly was not expected , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have enforced it , but public opinion ? If one national difference may be settled by arbitration , all others may be . If private war on the ocean /z/ can be abolished , why may not public war share the same fate ? There is one other circumstance , favourable to the cause of peace , which I mention , not for its magnitude , but for its singularity . I allude to the interchange of captured standards between France and Spain ; a bright spot in a vast expanse of blackness , which , like a single lamp in a gloomy sepulchre , is remarkable , not so much for its brilliancy , as for the contrast which makes darkness visible . Oh , if all the nations of Christendom could be persuaded to follow this example ; if all the trophies of victory in the world should be heaped together in one vast pile and consumed ; we might safely affirm , that never a burnt offering , since Abel 's , has been so acceptable to the God of peace , and that such a peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peace himself . I have , hitherto , addressed my highly respected audience as philanthropists only . But this solemn temple , this sacred desk , remind me that I am addressing an assembly of Christians ; and however , as moral philosophers , we may augur , from the signs of the times , that the custom of war , like other barbarous customs , is about to be banished from civilized society , yet , it is on the holy word of God , on the Gospel of peace , that we chiefly rest our hopes . In all the prophecies of /z/ the Old Testament , the reign of Christ is identified with the reign of peace , " when the wolf shall dwell with the lamb , " and men " shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks , when nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more , but they shall sit , every one , under his own vine and fig-tree , and none shall molest or make them afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Peace on earth and good will towards men " was the burthen of the song of angels , when they proclaimed the advent of the Messiah . That there is to be a . time of universal peace throughout the world , no one doubts , who believes the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures ; and it is equally certain , that this glorious event will be consummated by a general diffusion of the peaceable principles of the Christian religion , and by a change of views , respecting the lawfulness of war , among Christians themselves ; for the precepts taught by Christ and his Apostles are in exact harmony with the prophecies , which predicted his coming . In our Saviour 's sermon on the mount , there is not one passage which authorizes war ; but the whole tenor of that discourse forbids it , in the most peremptory terms . It is urged by some , that the words of our Saviour are not to be taken in their literal meaning ; but give them every possible latitude , short of leaving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any government , to make war , consistently with the principles there inculcated . The whole tenor of his practice agreed with his preaching , to the very moment when he said , " it is finished . " He , indeed , on one occasion , was understood , by his disciples , to command them to buy swords ; but , no sooner was one of them drawn , than he commanded it to be sheathed , as though he had allowed them , to take a figurative expression for a literal command , in order to give this last testimony against the use of the sword . Had there been any intention of resistance , HE had no need of swords , who had not only all the powers of nature , but also legions of angels at his command . The Apostles and disciples of Christ followed in his steps , and preached his doctrine , and the whole of the New Testament breathes nothing but peace , and love , and forgiveness , and longsuftering , and a new system of morality , that of returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood the precepts of the Gospel , and for the first two or three centuries of the Christian era , no professor of the religion of Jesus bore arms ; but , on the contrary , when a Roman soldier was converted , he thought it a duty to throw down his arms , at the rik of his life ; and many suffered martyrdom , rather than break what they firmly believed to be the commands of their mas- /z/ ter . " While the lamp of Christianity burnt bright , " while the Church of Christ was pure and persecuted , the custom of war was unknown to Christians . But the corruption of the Church began with her temporal power , and she in turn became a persecutor . She " hated the light " and the lamp of Christianity was extinguished , or was kept alive only in remote places , in dens and caves , amid mountain torrents and perpetual snows . When the Bible was refused to the people , it required no great casuistry to convince the ignorant that war , especially war against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded . This is not astonishing , for casuists of later days , with the Bible in their hands , have reconciled the precepts of the Gospel with conquest , rapine and desolation . Solemn anathemas have been thundered by Christian bishops against Christian nations , and solemn Te Deums have been chaunted in honor of victories obtained over the disciples of Christ . But the Bible is no longer monopolized by the clergy , and denied to the laity , and now that it is in the hands of every one who desires it , we have reason for pious gratitude , that the light of Christianity , if it has not yet abolished the custom of war , has very much tamed its ferocity , and we have every reason to hope , that , as the influence of the Gospel shall increase , as mankind shall be more enlightened by its be- /z/ iiign rays , wars will be less and less ferocious , and the intervals of peace longer and longer , until " nation shall no longer lift up sword against nation , nor learn war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however interesting it may be in a temporal point of view , is swelled to a magnitude which defies conception , when we consider man as an immortal being , whose existence shall never have an end , and shall extend through a long eternity of happiness or misery . How mean ! how abject ! how contemptible are all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them , when compared with the immortal soul of the meanest slave , that writhes under the scourge . Comparing all earthly glory with one such soul , is weighing gas against gold . Earth makes distinctions , which Heaven laughs to scorn , and Lazarus the beggar shall be exalted to a pinnacle of immortal glory , while the laurels of Caesar the conqueror , shall be trampled in the dust , or only mark a pre-eminence in misery . On this view of our subject , what heart is so hard as not to shrink with horror , at the sight of contending armies , where Christians are set in battle array against Christians , agitated by the direful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , thousands of immortal souls , each worth the temporal existence of a peopled world , unprepared , into the awful presence of their judge , and , if we /z/ believe the scriptures , consigning many of them to endless misery and anguish ? Oh , most merciful God ! didst thou create immortal souls to be thus trifled with ? Oh , benign Saviour of the world ! are these thy children , thy professed followers , who , for glory , or for some such fancied and as fleeting good , can , not only inflict the greatest temporal evils on innocent widows and orphans , and bereaved parents ; but can delight and glory in the eternal destruction of their fellow-creatures . Christians , fold not your arms in listless apathy , and think to pass through life guiltless of your brother 's blood . What says the Prince of Peace ? " He that is not with me is against me . " The continuance of war depends on public opinion , and no person , male or female , is without an influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is your duty to investigate it , by reading what has been written on both sides . If you are converted , it is your duty to " strengthen your brethren , " and to endeavour to convince others . Not a third , perhaps not a tenth part of our population , have ever seen any publications on the subject of permanent and universal peace ; or , if they have seen them , have never read them , but , wrapped up in seemingly impenetrable prejudices , imbibed probably in infancy , have refused to give the subject even their serious consideration . But ' mankind are not always the same , and he who turns a deaf /z/ ear at one time , may listen at another . Those who have not the power of persuasion , may at least circulate tracts , favourable to the cause of peace , or may put their names , and the weight of their character into the pacific scale . Every one is accountable for his influence in society , and no one knows the bounds to which it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , his neighborhood ; but it may reach throughout his country , and grow wider and wider , until it meets itself at the antipodes , and it may continue not only through his life , but long after he shall have been forgotten , and endure till the heavens shall have been rolled together as a scroll , and throughout the countless ages of eternity . Happily we are not circumscribed by any party , politics , or sectarian principles . All " who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth , " find themselves compelled , if they act up to their principles , to be on our side . Let us , who are willing to avow pacific principles , practise them in our lives , and " keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace , " and however we may differ in sentiment concerning particular doctrines , let it be seen that we agree in the precepts of our holy religion , and that we are kind and charitable one toward another , and tender of each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , as it was of the primitive converts , " See how these Christians love one another . " /z/ NOTE A. Page 10 . " The hospitals , containing more than TWELVE THOUSAND WOUNDED , began to burn . The heart frozen with horror , recoils at the fatal disaster which ensued . Almost all these wretched victims perished . The few who were still living , were seen crawling , half burnt , under the smoking ashes , or groaning under the heaps of dead bodies , making ineffectual efforts to extricate themselves ! " Labaume 's Narrative , p. 211 . " Amongst the burning houses were three large barns filled with poor soldiers , chiefly wounded . They could not escape from two of these , without passing through the one in front , which was on fire ; the most active saved themselves by leaping out of the windows , but all those who were sick or crippled , not having strength to move , saw the flames advancing rapidly to devour them .

" Labaume 's Narrative , p. 278 . " Whenever a soldier sunk from fatigue , his next neighbour rushed on him and stripped him of his clothes , even before he was dead .

Why do you trample me under your feet 1 Why do you take from me the remainder of my money and my bread 1 You even take away my clothes ! ' If some officer , urged by generous feelings , ( lid not arrive in time to prevent it , many in the like situation would have been assassinated by their own comrades . " Ib. p. 407 . " Every day furnished scenes too painful to relate .

When they were consumed , these livid spectres , unable to get up , fell by the side of those on whom they had been seated . Many , in a state of mental alienation , in order to warm themselves , plunged their bare feet into the fire ; some , with a convulsive laugh , threw themselves into the flames , and uttering shocking cries , perished in the most horrible contortions ; others in a state of equal madness , followed their example , and shared the same fate ! " Ib. p. 410 . " Multitudes of these desolate fugitives lost their speech , others were seized with frenzy , and many were so maddened by the extremes of pain and hunger , that they tore the dead bodies of their comrades into pieces , and feasted on the remains !

When these were finally removed on sledges to be burnt , the most extraordinary figures were presented by the variety of their attitudes , for none seem to have been frozen in a composed state . Each was fixed in the last action of his life , in the last direction given to his limbs ; even the eyes retained the last expression , either of anger , pain or entreaty . In the roads , men were collected round the burning ruins of their cottages , which a mad spirit of destruction had fired , picking and eating the burnt bodies of fellow-men , while thousands of horses were moaning in agony , with their flesh mangled and hacked to satisfy the cravings of a hunger that knew no pity . In many of the sheds , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcasses , which , festering by the communication of animal heat , had mingled the dying and the dead in one mass of putrefaction .

" On seeing the enemy , those who had not crossed , mingling with the Poles , rushed towards the bridge ; artillery , baggage , cavalry , and infantry , all endeavoured to pass first . The strong threw into the water the weak , who impeded their advance , and trampled under foot the sick and wounded whom they found in their way . Many hundreds were crushed under the wheels of the artillery ; others , who had hoped to save themselves by swimming , were frozen in the river , or perished by slipping from the ice . Thousands and thousands of hopeless victims , notwith- standing these sorrowful examples , threw themselves into the Berezina , where they nearly all perished in convulsions of grief or despair .

" The French troops , as they poured into the devoted city , had spread themselves in every direction in search of plunder , and in their progress they committed outrages so horrid on the persbns of all whom they discovered , that fathers , desperate to save their children from pollution , would set fire to their places of refuge , and find a surer asylum in the flames . The streets , the houses , the cellars flowed with blood , and were filled with violation and carnage ! " R. K.

" Labaume 's Narrative , p. 214 . " The few houses that escaped their ( the first division of the French army , ) ravages , were burnt by the second division , who completed what their comrades had left unfinished in the work of devastation . In the ruins were entombed ; sol . tiers and peasants , children wantonly murdered , and young gals massacred an the spot where they had been violated . "
