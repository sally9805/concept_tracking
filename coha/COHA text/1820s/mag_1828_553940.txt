txt ART . VII. -. f1 Discourse on the Genius and Character of the Rev. Horace Jklolley , LL . D. late President of Trans yl** vansa University , by CHARLES CALDWELL , M. D. Professor of the Institutes of Medicine and Clinical Practice in said University ; with an dppendix , containing copious . N'otes , Biographical and illustrative . Boston . 1828 . Hilliard , Gray , Little , &amp; Wilkins . IT is very frequently remarked , that the lives of literary men are barren of incident . That of president Holley was perhaps less so than the lives of literary men generally are , in this country ; but it &amp;till furnishes no exception to the rule . The history of such men is necessarily a record of the exercise of intellectual power , in the various duties of the professional career , rarely varied by the occurrence of events of a novel and marked character . This circumstance , while it increases the difficulty of preparing a biographical account of their lives , filled with details of general interest , makes it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who enjoyed the benefit of their efforts , and witnessed the displays of their talent , to contribute , in every proper way , to the preservation of their memory . The man , who discharges faithfully the duties of the academical or of the spiritual instructer , and especially the man who discharges them , not only with fidelity , but with extraordinary skill and vigor , who brings to them the energies of a brilliant genius , and the fruits of mature studies , ought to rank among the greatest benefactors of his generation . But yet , from the very necessity of the case , his merit is not embodied ( if we may so speak ) in any series of striking actions or events , to which posterity can be referred , in proof of its extent and reality . A process precisely the reverse of that , which takes place in the Jives of statesmen and heroes , and which gives to them the credit of much that is done by those about them , operates in the case of him , whose life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of much of the praise which is his due . The prince or the chief magistrate , whose administration has been signalized by important events , beneficial to the country , enjoys a distinguished place in history , and a full share of the glory of transactions , of which perhaps the larger portion of the credit really belongs to the subaltern agents . A military chief of necessity concentrates // upon himself the renown of victories , to which thousands may have contributed as much conduct and gallantry as himself . On the other hand , we are too apt to give to the pupil the whole of the credit , which is due iii part to the master who formed his mind . The influence of intellect on intellect is too elevated , undefined , and ethereal to admit of a gross partition of the praise . The eloquent writer , the eloquent speaker , and the accomplished scholar receive the undivided applause of the community , which witnesses the display of their talents and acquisitions ; and it is an afterthought and a tardy justice which go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the discipline , which have perhaps contributed most essentially to these displays . it frequently happens , in the case of men whose eminence is purely intellectual , and who are not engaged in the academic career , that they exercise a powerful influence on society around them ; that they contribute to raise and purify the standard of taste , to set other men on thinking and on acting , and are in reality the authors , in this way , of substantial improvement ; that there is nevertheless not enough of visible action in their lives , to furnish the basis of any adequate memorial . They live in the hearts of their contemporaries . A grateful tradition of them goes down for a few generations . Some fine traits of their characters , and a few happy expressions , are repeated and recollected , and then all that they were is lost and forgotten . This has been the fortune of many excellent men in our own country , who , having written little or nothing of a permanent nature , have left nothing behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters and services , inestimable in their day and generation . These considerations lead us to rejoice in every successful attempt , to commemorate an individual of merit , belonging to the class of society , in which life is unmarked by incident and adventure , but in which a full proportion of the actual service of the community is performed . They lead us to rejoice in the appearance of the present work , furnishing , as it does , a satisfactory , and , we trust , a permanent memorial of a man of rare talent , of uncommon mental vigor , and of brilliant accomplishments , exercised during a short but distinguished career . It appears to us well calculated to satisfy the enriosity , which the public naturally takes in the life of such a man . It presents his character and his various official relations in a light , which must be satisfactory and consoling to his friends . // it does justice to his merit . It will afford to aftertimes , no inadequate conception of the peculiarity of his intellect . The narrative portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often happen in the case of similar biographies . President Holley 's existence was marked with more than a common share of variety , and from the termination of his studies at college , to the melancholy close of his career , an unusual diversity of incident and scene will be found to be comprehended . The work before us , as our readers are probably , for the most part , aware , consists of a Discourse on the Genius and Character of president Holley , illustrated with copious Notes . The former is the production of an academic associate , drawn forth by the request of the medical class of Transylvania University , on occasion of the decease of its late president . It is of the nature of a philosophical analysis of his mind , and extends to a general account of his intellectual and moral character , and of the quality of his action in the various official positions to which he was called . Dr Caidwell remarks , in an early page of his discourse , that the elements of that intellectual greatness , high cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object so imposing and attractive , are to be found in his character as a scholar , a philosopher , an orator , a teacher , and a man ' ; and the discourse is chiefly taken up , with the description of him in these several capacities . In the various portions of this description , Dr CaIdwell has interspersed his own views and speculations on different topics , and has given to the whole the appearance of an elaborate and carefully digested performance . In the great variety of topics , necessarily passed in review in such a discourse , few persons will he found to think alike on all . Dr Caldwell , with all the just and fervid admiration entertained and expressed by him of his subject , occasionally uses a measured language of eulogy , and has evidently aimed throughout at impartiality and truth . It would scarcely be expected of us to undertake an analysis of a performance of this character ; nor would it be hardly decorous to enter upon a minute criticism of matters of taste . Embodied as it is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Holley , contained in the Appendix , it is likely to enjoy an extent of circulation // and a permanence , which seldom fall to the lot of the best occasional productions. * The Appendix contains , in the form of Notes to the different parts of the discourse , a series of notices of the life of president Holley ; and in these , of course ( Dr Caldwell having purposely forborne to treat the subject in that respect ) , the biographical interest of the work is contained . Several of these notes , particularly those which are of a biographical character , are from the pen of the individual most nearly affected by the premature decease of president Holley , and are written with a simplicity and ease , which would do credit to a practised author . They constitute a sketch of unusual spirit and interest , and represent their distinguished subject in the happiest light . We are sensible of the injustice which we do to a performance , that owes so much of its attraction to the gracefulness of manner in which it presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-of-fact ahstract . Those , who feel an interest in president Holley 's character , must recur to the volume itself ; and can not fail to lay it down , with their impressions of his talent and worth rendered deeper and stronger . President Holley was descended from the celebrated Dr Edmund Halley , and was blessed with parents of uncommon worth . The father appears to have been endowed with an understanding , and to have formed to himself a character of a very high order . The following account of himself , furnished by this excellent and uncommon man , to his son the president , exhibits a fair sample of the best kind of the true New England character . " After I had advanced towards manhood , say sixteen or seventeen , my father was ill for a number of years . My two elder brothers were of age and gone from home . It fell , therefore , to my lot to carry on the farm . I worked hard during the day , and at night had to go after doctors and medicine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go eight or nine miles , when I was so weary that I have fallen asleep on my horse and rode for miles without knowing where I was , contriving to balance , however , so as to keep my seat . This I mention to show the practice and habits at that early day . * We would suggest the expediency of comprising in the new cdition of this work , which we are happy to hear is proposed , the doquent discourse delivered by Mr Pierpout on the death of president Ilolley. // " My father continued ill for years after I was of age , but , by my own exertions and the persevering industry of my mother and sisters , we lived in good style for that day , and punctually paid every demand . I worked at different places for two years , got forward , clothed myself well , and had something beforehand . But when at work upon a plough one day I cut my knee , and lay ten or twelve weeks under the care of the doctors , expecting to have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee got well , but was stiff . After the pain had ceased , and I was yet too weak to work , I concluded some other course must be fallen upon for a support . I studied hard to qualify myself to keep school . I succeeded so well that I obtained a small school the following winter , and gave so much satisfaction that I was engaged also for the next . In the course of the summer my knee became strong , and I was able to labor , keeping school in the winter , as agreed upon , at a higher price . The next summer , I worked my father 's farm on shares ; but the season was bad , my crops were light , and I lost a horse which I owed for in part . I was therefore again reduced to a level with the world . " This you will say was discouraging and no time to marry . I was , notwithstanding , actually negotiating with your mother , and in the following October we were married . Soon after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wages enabling me to pay the residue for my dead horse , and get myself well clothed . The following spring I was applied to , by a committee from Salisbury , to keep school in that place , they having received a flattering account of my success where I had taught . I agreed for six months , for seven dollars and fifty cents a month , which was then a great price . This term , I fulfilled my duties so much to the satisfaction of the district , that they hired me for another year at a still higher price . I then purchased a small house in the furnace neighborhood Salisbury , and began to keep house . There Milton , yourself , and Edward were born . I continued to keep the school for three years , the salary being raised to five pounds a month , wheat being four shillings a bushel , or what was called the old way , continental money having begun to depreciate . " I grew tired of keeping school , and an offer being made , I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , having acquired three hundred dollars . This brought me down to nearly the close of the war . I then formed a partnership with William Davis of Sharon . We made a large purchase of goods of Richard Smith of New London , who , being in Holland , had assisted our government , in its struggle , to procure a quantity of gunpowder . For this service , the legislature of Connecticut granted him the privilege of bringing into the country twenty or thirty thousand dollars ' worth of dry goods . This purchase of // Richard Smith was made late in the fall , and in the following spring came the news of peace . The price of goods fell . Mr Davis , discouraged , sold out for little or nothing , and quit business . I worried through , paid Smith , and cleared something . " In June , 1783 , I formed a partnership with Read and Bogardus , who were large importers , and lived in the city of New York . This business was carried on in the most satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Redhook , on the Hudson , in 1794. " ' pp. 110-112 . The letters of this most sensible father and excellent man , form by no means the least interesting portion of the volume , and show us a character , which wanted nothing but adventitious circumstances , to have come out among those which take the lead in their generation . A single circumstance , giving him notoriety with the public at large , might have formed him into one of the distinguished men of his day . We can not but observe , in passing , that president Holley 's letter to his elder brother , on his father 's death , is a happy specimen of his manner . Such of our readers , as may not have an opportunity to read the work before us , will thank us for a brief sketch of president Holley 's history . He was born at Salisbury in Connecticut , on the thirteenth of February , 1781 . Blessed at his birth with a sound and healthful frame , no physical infirmities checked the expansion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood of his father 's house , when he was little more than three years old , and discovered a fondness , not usual with children , for school and its duties . The first ten years of his life passed in this way , chiefly at school or in such light labor as was suited to his years , and which , intermingled with the customary sports of childhood , served both to develope his corporeal powers , and to give a healthful tone to his mind . With such faculties , and such a disposition to use them , he soon became familiar with the common rudiments of knowledge ; and as nothing further was to be acquired at a district school , he was permitted to avail himself of other modes of gratifying his active spirit . His father , in addition to the cultivation of a farm , was pretty extensively engaged in country trade , which gave occasion to the transportation of considerable quantities of produce and merchandise , and to many errands of business from home . New York was then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and intercourse with it then was , as it still // is , carried on through the freighting villages on the Hudson river . A drive to Redhook , or Rhinebeck , or Poughkeepsie , on a smooth road , through a cultivated and pleasant district , with a pair of good horses , under independent circumstances , and charged with business , was no repulsive employment to a boy of manly temper and enterprising spirit . It was well adapted to promote many valuable ends . It was calculated to help forward a knowledge of men and things-of the modes of business and the relative values of commodities  --  to throw a youth in a beneficial way upon his own resources , and to aid in giving firmness and tone to character ; and in this kind of occupation , this new school of practical education , was Horace frequently and cheerfully engaged , while yet a boy of twelve or thirteen years of age , the promptitude , accuracy , and fidelity with which he discharged his trust , always bringing tokens of parental approbation . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intention to bring up his son to his own pursuits in trade , but the strong desire , evinced by the latter , to obtain a liberal education , at length induced his father to consent to his preparing himself for college . Accordingly in 1797 , at the age of sixteen years , he was placed at a school in Williamstown , Massachusetts , connected with the college in that place , with the view , when the proper time should arrive , of being entered as a student in that seminary . Conceiving , however , that the college at New Haven afforded greater advantages , he changed his destination , and was entered in 1799 a student at Yale . Here he was distinguished among the most industrious and successful of his contemporaries , and enjoyed a large share of the favor of the eminent president of the college , the late Dr Dwight . In his senior year , he became the subject of serious religious impressions , during what is usually termed a revival of religion , in New Haven . To this circumstance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law ( to which he at first devoted himself ) , for that of divinity . In the summer of 1804 , Mr Holley established himself at New Haven as a student of divinity under the direction of Dr Dwight . In the following year , he formed a matrimonial connexiori with the lady who is left to deplore his loss , and to commemorate his worth . In September 1805 , he was ordained as pastor over the church at Greenfield Hill , thus becoming the successor of his master , president Dwight , who had been transferred from that church to the scene of his more extended usefulness and brilliant reputation as president of Yale Col // lege. * The society stipulated to give him five hundred and sixty dollars per annum , ' as long as said society and Mr Holley could agree . ' There never was the slighest disaffection between them , but after the experience of nearly three years , it was found by Mr Holley , that a salary of five hundred and sixty dollars , was an inadequate support for a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministerial labors , was unable to pursue any subsidiary occupation . An amicable dissolution of the pastoral connexion was accordingly sought and obtained . A short time only elapsed , before his settlement on the eighth of March , 1809 , in the louis-street church in Boston . This connexion , observes his biographer , continued for ten years ; and perhaps no society and minister ever lived together more harmoniously , he giving to that excellent people the most entire and perfect satisfaction , and receiving from them every demonstration of affection and esteem . ' The following extract will convey an idea of the manner , in which a portion of his duties as a preacher and a christian minister were discharged . His sermons were generally extemporaneous , or , if written , were seldom finished , hut left to be filled out by the suggestions of the moment . His method of composing , or of preparing them , was as follows . His mind , being ever active , was richly stored with information on all subjects . He never forgot anything he had once learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever he read or saw in his walks during the week , was made tributary to his Sabbath exercises . Frequently a visit , or an accidental conversation with one of themselves , would furnish the train of thought upon which his hearers hung with intense interest , while its unconscious author , surprised and delighted , could easily follow in another a course of reasoning , which he could not by himself pursue . Hence these sermons were always practical , always addressed to the heart and understanding ; and hence , in part , their power . It was his custom to enter his study on Saturday evening , and remain there until a late hour , more for the purpose of reflection than composition , to arrange the plan of a discourse , and to make notes . A fter a few hours ' sleep , he was again in his study , when he would suffer no interruption , either for breakfast , or from any other circumstance . This was particularly the case when there was anything remarkable in the subject or the occasion . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his theme , and rivetted all attention for an hour or more , with scarcely a recurrence to his notes . If the evening service required a similar effort , he ate no dinner . If he dined , he would take a familiar subject and treat it less elaborately , as he could not so soon again excite his mind to the necessary point of ardor , when it had once been suffered to cool . He preferred , however , not to be interrupted until the services of the day were finished , when his mind still dwelt with pleasure on the thoughts which had so filled and engrossed it . It may be supposed that by so long an abstinence , and such a great and continued effort , considerable exhaustion was necessarily induced . It was then he enjoyed a social circle with his family , and and two or three friends , who loved to discourse upon the strains of eloquence which had not yet died upon the ear , and whose salutary influence still warmed the heart , and excited the understanding . Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as occasions for discovering what improvement of the discourse had been made by the devoted listeners of the preceding day . This kind of intercourse suggested topics for other discourses . Persons in affliction or want weie first attended to . The meanest were not neglected , all were benefited , all had lessons of instruction and pleasure . The other members of his parish had different portions of the week devoted to them , and thus a new stock of materials was gathered for the coming Sabbath . ' pp. 143-145 . In 1815 , Dr Holley was elected to the presidency of 1'ransylvania University , but did not then accept the trust . In 1817 , the election was renewed , and after a visit to Lexington , to examine into the condition and prospects of the institution , he accepted the appointment ; and in 1818 entered upon the discharge of its duties . He remained in this office about nine years , during which the institution rose with astonishing rapidity , from the insignificant state in which be found it , into one of great reputation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume before us , relative to the history of this place of education , and the efforts and agency of Dr Holley as its president . They form one of the most valuable parts of the work , but for various reasons , we shall not attempt to abridge this portion of it . It is sufficient to observe , that causes of dissatisfaction arose , and that Dr Holley determined to leave the institution , where he had reason to think his usefulness was declining . This determination he carried into effect in the spring of 1827 . The following letter from the trustees , at that period , is a grateful testimonial to his character . // " Lezington , Kentucky , March 24th , 1827 . " DEAR SIR , " The Trustees of Transylvania University , being deeply impressed with a sense of the value and importance of your faithful and distinguished services in presiding over the institution for nearly nine years past , have appointed the undersigned a committee to express to you their decided approbation of the course you have pursued , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When they recollect that during the sixteen years which preceded your coming amongst us , only twenty-two persons received the collegiate honors of this institution , and that during your comparatively short stay , six hundred and sixty-six young men have graduated and gone forth into the world , learned , enlightened , and adorned  --  and who are now the pride and ornaments of our common country-they can not but deeply regret the causes which have induced you to separate yourself from the institution . " Within the walls of Transylvania , the fond recollections of her polite , kind , generous , learned , accomplished , and much loved President will never perish . The patronage of the Commonwealth may be withdrawn , the institution may decline , the walls themselves may be crumbled ; but so long as the name remains , there will be associated with it the most affectionate remembrances that flow from mutual attachments , or have a habitation in the hearts of those who are susceptible of the emotions of gratitude . To whatever clime your destiny may direct you , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so long and so intimately associated with you ; and whom we on this occasion represent . Farewell . " ' pp. 215 , 216 . On his retirement from the presidency at Lexington , Dr Holley proposed a plan of private education to the parents of some of his former pupils , of which the general nature appears from the subjoined sketch . " 1 . That the number of pupils be so regulated as not to exceed the power of the instructers to superintend them . 2 . Instructers and pupils to constitute a family , embracing all the ties , associations , and sympathies of that union of intimate and friendly relations . This arrangement would give rise to a community in study , travelling , observing , and in such interesting adventures as might occur ; all of which might be turned to the advantage of the pupil . 3 . Course of study in the languages necessary in a complete education ; namely , English , French , Spanish , Italian , Greek , and Latin . Course in history , mathematics , geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accomplishments generally . 4 . Residence // in different cities and towns , and learning all things relating to them on the spot . 5 . The proper apportioning and blending of exercise , amusement , study , attention to health , society , drawing , observation , and all other requisite modes and sources of improvement . 6 . Paris to be the chief place of residence , where all sorts of instruction can be most readily obtained , and where the best teachers can be procured on the easiest terms . 7 . Excursions , for the improvement of the more advanced youths , to be made to London , Edinburgh , Dublin , Rome , and such other places of science , literature , taste , and the arts , as experience and judgment might indicate . " ' pp. 270 , 271 . This plan of education was readily adopted by those parents to whom it was proposed by president Holley , and his arrangements were made to carry it into effect . On his arrival , however , at New Orleans , he was waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different undertaking . They suggested the idea of forming a literary institution in the neighborhood of that city . After considerable hesitation in abandoning his former plan , Dr Holley finally determined to accede to the new propositions , and engaged with characteristic ardor , in the project of founding a college near New Orleans . But under the influence of the extreme heat of the month of July , combined with the fatigues incident to the formation of his new establishment , his health soon became impaired , and he deemed it necessary to leave New Orleans for the North . On his passage to New York , he fell a victim to the terrible fever of the tropics . Human nature , in the varied catalo nue of its sufferings , seldom presents a scene of distress , greater than that depicted to us in the following passage . Three days and nights , the storm without , and disease within , continued their force unspent . One and another of the crew fell victims , while others sunk and rose again . Such medicines were administered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the situation of the sufferers ; a situation but little adapted to the comforts and necessities of the sick . Rest and quietness were out of the question . A still , dark room , a bed of suitable dimensions , with constant and careful attendants , any one circumstance included in the word home , had been more than luxury . Let those who would learn the full meaning of that dearest of all names , experience a distressing , paralyzing illness at sea , and they will know its full import . Hitherto no one had expressed a fear of a dangerous disease on board , so little do we feel and understand impending evil . It now became calm , and there was // time and opportunity to attend to the suffering and the helpless . The danger of Dr Holley 's situation became too apparent . His eyes were half closed , his mind wandering . The same medicines were repeated , the doses doubled , and all other means of relief applied , which the kind-hearted , though unskilled , in their goodness could command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps have been checked , had now acquired force and strength , and soon triumphed over one of the finest of con3titutions , as well as most brillant of intellects . The fifth of the disease , and the thirty-first of the month was the fatal day . The sun rose in all the brightness and intense heat of a tropical region . It was a dead calm . Not a breath of air skimmed the surface of the sea , or fanned the burning brow of the sufferer . The writer of this article , who still lay in silent anguish , a speechless spectator of the scene , expected , while conscious of anything but distress , to be the next victim , and who , losing at times even all sense of suffering in the womanish feeling occasioned by the circumstance of there not being a female hand to perform the last sad offices of humanity , has a confused recollection of horror , of the solemn looks of the passengers pacing to and fro upon the deck , of a deathlike stillness , broken by groans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice trying to soothe the last moments , and to interpret the last accents of his dying parent . All this she heard , without sense enough to request to be carried to the spot , or to realize that it meant death . When the groans and spasms had ceased , it seemed to be only a release from pain , a temporary sleep . When all was hushed , and the report of pistols , and the fumes of burning tar announced the fatal issue , trusting in that Divine Being , into whose presence she expected soon to be ushered , believing , as far as recollection had exercise , that the separation was but for a little space , she heard , with the firmness of despair , and with silent awe , the parting waters receive the scarce breathless form of him who had been her pride and boast , as he had been the admiration of all to whom he was known , his winding sheet a cloak , his grave the wide ocean , his monument the everlasting Tortugas . All this she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holley was thus prematurely closed , at the age of forty-six . Our country has certainly produced few persons , who have given indications of more brilliant talent ; although , with the fate so common among literary and professional men , a general tradition of his superiority is nearly all that will go down to posterity . His efforts in writing were all of the class , that may be called occasional , and few even of these were committed to the press . Having formed himself // to a style of extemporaneous speaking , and not being called upon to encounter the after-toil of writing out his discourses , not a few of his highest strains of eloquence perished with the breath , in which they were uttered . To the publication of occasional performances he was more than commonly averse , and held the maxim , that a man can seldom do himself justice , or safely trust his reputation , in productions of that class . In reviewing the incidents of Dr Holley 's life , it is not easy to suppress the feeling , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the career best adapted to the character of his mind , and affording the fullest scope for the exercise of his talents . It was im1 ) ossible , that he should not have been distinguished in any walk of life , and most distinguished he was unquestionably , in that which he pursued . But it may be doubted , whether his first choice of a profession , that of the law , might not have led him , on the whole , to a more uniformly successful and happy career . We deem it not improper to add , that the work is published for the benefit of the orphan son of president Holley . This consideration , we trust , will secure it that circulation , to which its substantial merit entitles it . With whatever motive it is purchased , we feel confident , that it will he generally and permanently regarded as an interesting and valuable work , and a well deserved tribute to the memory of one of the most distinguished sons of America .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
