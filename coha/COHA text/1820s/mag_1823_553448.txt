ART . XVII. - account of an expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains , pe*formed in the years 1819 and 1820 , by order of the honorable J. C. Calhoun , Secretary of War , under the command of Major Stephen II . Long ; from the notes of Major Long , Mr T. Say , and other gentlemen of the exploring party . Compiled by Edwin James , botanist and geologist for the expedition . In two volumes , with an atlas . Philadelphia , Cary and Lea , 1823 . THE appearance of this work has been for some time anxiously expected ; nor do we fear that the public expectation will be dis*tppointed . An increasing interest pervades the community with regard to the vast region traversed by this enterprising party . They were in many respects much better qualified and fitted out for their expedition , than the company of their distinguished predecessors , Lewis and Clarke ; and the work before us , the record of their observations and discoveries , must be allowed not only to possess the interest inseparable from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our knowledge of the geography and natural history of the valley of the Mississippi and the Missouri . Of that important portion of the work before us , which relates to geology , mineralogy , botany , and zoology , we shall seek an opportunity of speaking separately on another occasion . We propose , at present , to lay before our readers an historical account of this expedition , some general sketches of the country traversed , and of the tribes of native inhabitants visited by the party under Major Long . We can not but feel that we are hardly doing justice to a work of this character , by the meagre abstract we shall be obliged to make ; and we shall esteem ourselves happy , if our readers , dissatisfied with the imperfect reflection of this expedition from our pages , shall feel a desire to inform themselves more thoroughly from the work itself . This expedition started from Pittsburgh , in the spring of 1819 . It was projected by the Secretary at War , for the purpose of exploring the Mississippi , Missouri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains . The chief command of the expedition was given to Major Long . Dr Baldwin was attached to it as a botanist , Mr Say as a zoologist , Mr Jessup as a geologist , Mr Peale as an assistant naturalist , and Mr Seymour as a draftsman . The gentlemen // named , with other officers and members of the party , appear to have cooperated with each other , toward promoting the common object , with singular harmony and zeal . The labors of Dr Baldwin , however , were unhappily brought to a close by consumption in the progress of the expedition ; and the extracts from his botanical journal are sufficient proof of the loss , which the party suffered by this misfortune . The expedition was embarked on board the Western iCngineer , a steam boat , destined to be the first , which should proceed a considerable distance up the Missouri , and which accomplished the trip to the Council Bluff , the station of the military post of the United States in that quarter . On the third of May , the expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeling , where the great national road from Cumberland meets the road from Zanesville , Columbus , and Cincinnati . One hundred and forty miles of this road from Cumberland to Wheeling cost the United States one million eight hundred thousand dollars , being an average of less tLan thirteen thousand dollars a mile . The Newburyport turnpike , built in a part of the country where we should have supposed work could be done as economically as in any portion of it , cost at the rate of at least thirteen thousand dollars a mile . In this estimation , however , is included the compensation made to the owners of the lands traversed by the turnpike , which we presume to have been much greater between Boston and Newburyport , than between Cumberland and Wheeling . The bridges and other works of masonry on the western portions of this great national road , are built of a compact argillaceous sandstone , of a light grey or yellowish white color , less durable than the stone used in the middle and eastern parts of the road , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperishable materials for building , which our country affords . On the eighth , the party passed , at the mouth of the Kenhawa , the little village of Mount Pleasant , situated on the spot , where in 1774 a battle was fought between the Indians on one side , and the Virginian troops on the other , in which Logan , the Mingo chief , avenged himself for the murder of his family . The eloquent speech , which he afterwu*rds delivered , has owed perhaps as much to its reporter , as lord Chatham 's did to the pen of Johnson. - Having arrived at Cincinnati , on tht // ninth , the party was detained there till the eighteenth , by the declining health of Dr Baldwin . On the night of the eighteenth they passed in the river the boats containing the sixth regiment of the United States army , destined , like themselves , to the Missouri , and they arrived on the morning of the nineteenth at Louisville . Having passed the rapids in safety at Louisville , they proceeded down the river at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam equal to one hundred pounds on the square inch . A little below the rapids is an island thus describ-. ed : A small island in the Ohio , about twenty-three miles below the rapds , is called Flint island , from the great numbers of frag* ments of flints , broken arrow points , and various instruments of stone , heretofore used by the Indians , which are found there on turning up the soil . This island has probably been the favorite residence of some tribe , particularly expert in the manufacture of those rude implements , with which the wants of the aboriginal Americans were supplied . The stone employed in these manufactures appears to have been , in most instances , that compact flint , which occurs in nodular masses , in the secondary limestones . In one instance , we met with a triangular prism , of a very hard and compact aggregate of feldspar and hornblende , unlike any rock we have seen in the valley of the Mississippi . This prism was about five inches long , with faces of about an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , forming a complete tube , with an orifice about half an inch in diameter , and smoothly polished , both within and without . We were never able to discover to what use this implement could have been applied ; nor do we recollect to have met with accounts of any thing analogous to it , except , perhaps , those " tubes of a very hard stone , " mentioned by the Jesuit Venegas , as used by the natives of California , in their treatment of the sick . That it may have passed , by means of the intercourse of various tribes of Indians , from the primitive mountains of California to the rapids of the Ohio , is not perhaps improbable . indirect methods of communication may have conveyed the productions of one part of the continent to another , very remote from it . The savages of the Missouri receive an intoxicating bean from their neighbours on the south and west ; these , abain , must probably procure it from other tribes inhabiting , or occasionally visiting , the tropical regions . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May our travellers passed the months of the Cumberland and Tennessee river , the two largest tributaries to the Ohio , and on the thirtieth arrived at a point // above the mouth of the Cash river , where a town has been laid out , called . lmerica . It is on the north bank of the Ohio , about eleven miles above the Mississippi , and for reasons ) which our authors have given in detail , it seems likely that this spot , or some one near it , will become the dep6t of a very extensive trade . They even go so far as to say , that in view of the great extent of . inland navigation centering at this place , and the incalculable amount of products to be realized at no distant period , from the cultivation of the rich valleys and fertile plains of the West , a great proportion of which must find a market here , no doubt can be entertained , that it will eventually become a place of as great wealth and importance , as almost any in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the mouth of the Ohio , having descended that beautiful river , from its head at Pittsburgh to its junction with the Mississippi , a distance of thirteen hundred and thirty-three miles , through a country surpassed in fertility by no part of the United States . Their course was henceforward to be more slowly made against the powerful current of the Mississippi and the Missouri . They passed several steam-boats ascending with stores for the troops of the United States ; and affording the spectacle of the last and most powerful improvements in machinery thus pushed forward into the wilderness , scarcely as yet embraced within the compass of our geography . On the third of June , they passed the insular rock in the middle of the Mississippi , called the Grand Tower . It is about one hundred and fifty feet high , and two hundred and fifty in diameter . Between this rock and the right bank of the river , is a channel of about one hundred and fifty yards wide , with a deep and rapid current . Our authors are of opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock might serve as a pier . Having given a character of the fertility of the soil in the great American bottom , ' above the mouth of the Kaskaskia river on the eastern side of the Mississippi , and having also observed , that the lands on the opposite bank , though less fertile than the American bottom , are yet highly valuable , and have long been objects of scandalous speculation , our authora s*ubjoin the following anecdote , in justifica*on of this remark : Among a variety of stratagems practised in this part of the country to obtain titles to lands , was one which will be beet cxJV'ew Series , No. l4* // 246 April , plained by the following anecdote , related to us by &amp; respectable citizen of St Genevieve . Preparatory to taking possession of Louisiana in 1805 , the legislature passed a law , authorizing a claim to one section of land , in favor of any person , who should have actually made improvements in any part of the same , previous to the year 1804 . Commissioners were appointed to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Improvement Rights . A person , somewhere in the county of Cape Girardeau , being desirous of establishing a claim of this kind to a tract of land , adopted the following method : - The time having expired for the establishment of a right , agreeably to the spirit of the law , he took with him two witnesses to the favorite spot , on which he wished to establish his claim , and in their presence marked two trees , standing on opposite sides of a spring , one with the figures 1803 , the other 1804 , and placed a stalk of growing corn in the spring . He then brought the witnesses before the commissioners , who , upon their declaration that they had seen corn growing at the place specified , in th' spring between 1803 and 1804 , admitted the claim of the appli. cant , and gave him a title to the land . ' vol. i. p. 51 . On the ninth , the party arrived at St Louis , and some very interesting notices are given of prints of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian tumuli , which exist there in considerable numbers . Our limits do not permit us to enlarge our quotations in this part of the abstract we are . attempting of their voyage . One very important fact , however , deserves to be recorded . By occasion of the account of the excavations made in one of these tumuli , our authors mention , that Dr Drake , the highly respected naturalist of Cincinnati , had exhibited to them , in his cabinet , two large marine shells , that had been dug out of ancient Indian tumuli in Ohio , one of which appears to be a cassis cornutus . All the authorities , except Linna*us , regard the cassis cornutus as an Asiatic shell ; and Bruguiere , say our authors , has maintained that Linna , us was mistaken , in referring it to America . The circumstance , that a shell of Asiatic origin has been found in an Indian tumulus in Ohio , would seem to establish an intercourse at least between the Indians of North America and those of Asia . Our authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Asiatic origin of our native tribes ; a theory , which , since the researches of M. de Humboldt , has been very extensively adopted . // Having alluded to the probability of a connexion between our native population and that of the Asiatic isles , we beg leave to digress a moment , with respect to the latter . The newly establiseed Society of Geography ' at Paris , which , under the most favorable auspices , and combining the efforts of some of the most respectable naturalists , travellers , men of science , and philosophers in France , has been instituted for the promotion of the study of geography , has assigned as a prize question , for which the dissertations are to be delivered to the society in February 1824 , the following subject , viz. to investigate the origin of the different nations scattered among the islands of the Pacific ocean to the southeast of the continent of Asia , examining the points of resemblance or dissimilarity between them severally and other nations , in respect to configuration , physical constitution , manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments ; with a comparison of the elements of their languages , in relation to the analogy of words , and grammatical forms ; and taking into consideration the means of communication , as affected by geographical position , prevailing winds , currents , and the state of navigation . ' We could wish that the credit of producing the successful essay on this subject might belong to an American . The subject is evidently identified with American antiquities ; as no one now doubts that these islands . are a link in the chain of humanity , which connects the natives of America with those of Asia . All the printed documents on the subject are as accessible on this side of the water as on the other . Monuments and specimens of the arts of the South Sea islanders abound more in this country , than in any other , and ive presume we might challenge all the cabinets in Europe to produce as many of them , as are  --  to be found in the single museum at Salem . The school at Cornwall in Connecticut furnishes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the dialects of those islands , than it can be in the power of any European scholar to institute ; and we can not but wish that the possession of these facilities might awaken the industry and enterprize of our geographers . The prize to be awarded to the successful essay is twelve hundred francs . But we return to Major Long 's expediti.n . On the twentyfirst of June they passed , in this truly magnificent navigation from river to river , into the Missouri ; and after various ad. // ventures , which , with the observations of our authors upon them , we are forced to omit , arrived on the thirteenth of July at the town of Franklin . This town , at present increasing more rapidly than any other on the Missouri , had been commenced but two years and an half before the time of our journey . It then contained about one hundred and twenty log houses of one story , several framed dwellings of two stories , and two of brick , thirteen shops for the sale of merchandise , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills , two billiard rooms , a court ho use , a log prison of two stories , a post office , and a printing press issuing a weekly paper . At this time bricks were sold at ten dollars per thousand , corn at twenty-five cents per bushel , wheat one dollar , bacon at twelve and an half cents per pound ; uncleared lands from two to ten or fifteen dollars per acre . The price of labour was seventy-five cents per day . Ia 1816 , thirty families only of whites were settled on the left side of the Missouri , above Cote Sans IDessein . In three years , their numbers had increased to more than eight hundred families . ' - vol. i. pp. 88 , 89 . Here the expedition met with a loss in the death of Dr Baldwin . The decease of an enterprising naturalist , while engaged in the pursuit of his studies , demands , if any thing , the feeble tribute it may be in the power of a literary jour*al to pay to his memory . Without any other acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the following notice of this gentleman is so handsome , and apparently so just , that we feel a pleasure in quoting it . Dr Baldwin 's health had so much declined that , on our arrival at Franklin , he was induced to relinquish the intention of ascending farther with the party . He was removed on shore to the house of Dr Lowry , intending to remain there until he should recover so much strength as might enable him to return to his family . But the hopes of his friends , even for his partial recovery , were not to be realized . He lingered a few weeks after our departure , and expired on the thirty-first of August . His diary , in which the latest date is the eighth of August , only a few days previous to his death , shows with what earnestness , even in the last stages of weakness and disease , his mind was devoted to the pursuit , in which he had so nobly spent the most important part of his life . He has left behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death will be regretted not only by those who knew his value as a friend , but by all the lovers of that fitscinating // science , to which his life was dedicated , and which his labours have so much contributed to advance and embellish . We regret that it is not in our power to add to this inadequate testimony of respect , such notices of the life and writings of Dr Baldwin , as might be satisfactory to our readers . His manuscripts were numerous , but his works were left unfinished . The remarks on the Rotbollia , published in Silliman 's Journal , are his only productions , as far as we are informed , hitherto before the public * His Herbarium , it is well known , has contributed to enrich the works of Pursh and Nuttall . He was the friend and correspondent of the venerable Muhlenburgh , and contributed materials for the copious catalogue of North American plants , published by that excellent botanist . In South America he met with Bonpland , the illustrious companion of Humboldt , and a friendly correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had travelled extensively , not only in South America , but in Georgia , Florida , and other parts of North America . His notes and collections are extensive and valuable . During the short period of his connexion with the exploring party , the infirmities , resulting from a long estabPshed and incurable pulmonary disease , then rapidly approaching its fatal termination , could not overcome the activity of his mind , or divert his attention entirely from his favorite pursuit . Though unable to walk on shore , he caused plants to be collected and brought on board the boat ; and not disheartened by the many vexations attending this method of examination , he persevered , and in the course of the voyage from Pittsburg to Franklin , detected and described many new plants , and added many valuable observations relating to such as were before known . ' - vol. i. pp. 93 , 94 . On the nineteenth of July , a temporary division was made in the party . Messrs Say , Jessup , Seymour , and Dougherty , ( an interpreter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluffs , who had joined the party below , ) accompanied by Major Biddle , left Franklin , intending to traverse the country by land to Fort Osage , and there to await the ar- . C* In a letter addressed to Mr Frazer , an extract from which was published in the tenth volume of the London Journal of Literature and the Arts , Dr Baldwin mentions having discovered , near Monte Video , in South America , the Solanum Tuberosum in its native locality . Mr Lambert , however , considered this plant as the Solanum Commersoni of Dunal , and though it produces tuberous roots , and in other respects makes a near approach to S. tuberosum , he was not satisfied of their id*tity , and remarks that it is yet to he proved , that this is the stock from which the common potatoe has been derived . It appears , however , that the original locality of the solanum tuberosum has been ascertained by Ruiz and Favon , after having escaped the observation of Humboldt and Bonpland. ' // rival of the steam boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr Peale , and lieutenants Graham and Smith , and in three days arrived at Charaton , a small village of which the settlement began in 1817 . The steam boat , Western Engineer , in which the party was embarked , was the first that had ever assended the Missouri , above this point ; and we can readily conceive the interest taken in beholding the onward progress of this herald of civilization. - We rejoice to find in the report of the gentlemen of this expedition abundant confirmation of the fact , that coal exists in extensive beds , in various tracts of this thinly wooded country . On the first of August , the steam boat arrived at Fort Osage , and found the party of Mr Say , which had left them at Franklin , there encamped . They had arrived at the rendezvous on the twenty-fourth of July , a week before their companions in the boat . Here another division of the party was projected , which terminated unfortunately for the portion detached . For the sake of a more thorough examination of the tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the region between the Konzas and the Platte , a party was detached from the steam boat , with instructions to cross the river Konzas , at the Konza village , thence to traverse the country by the nearest route to the Platte , and to descend that river to the Missouri . The party consisted of Mr Say , to whom the command was given , Messrs . Jessup , Peele , Seymour , and Swift , Mr J. IDougherty , and five soldiers . Previous to the departure of the steam boat from Fort Osage , Major O'Fallon , the Indian agent , despatched a messenger across the country to the Konzas nation of Indians , residing on the Konzas river , summoning their chiefs to a council to be held at Isle an ? Vache , on the arrival of the Western Engineer . The steam boat moved up the river from Fort Osage , and arrived at the island on the fourteenth of the month . The council with the Indians had been appointed for the eighteenth , but Major O'Fallon 's messenger having reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were unable to attend before the twentyfourth . We subjoin the following account of the council . On the twenty-fourth , the chiefs and principal men of the Konzas , to the number of one hundred avid fifty , assembled under an arbour prepared for their reception . The Indian agent ' addressed them in a speech adapted to the occasion , setting forth // the causes of complaint , which they had given by their repeated insults and depredations upon the whites , giving them notice of the approach of a military force , of sufficient strength to chastise their insolence , and advising them to seize the present opportunity of averting the vengeance they deserved , by proper concessions , and by their future good behaviour , to conciliate those , whose friendship they would have so much occasion to desire . The replies of the chiefs were simple and short , expressive of their conviction of the justice of the complaints made against them , and of their acquiescence in the terms of reconciliation proposed by the agent . There were present at this council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thirteen Osages . The most distinguished men were Na-he-daba , or Long . TV'eck , one of the principal chiefs ; Ka-he-ga-wa-taning-ga , Little &amp;hief , second in rank ; Shon-ga-ne-ga , who had been one of the principal chiefs , bitt had resigned his authority in favor of Ka-he-ga-wa-ta-ning-ga ; Wa-ha-che-ra , Big Knffe , a partizan or leader of war parties ; Wom-pa-wa-ra , He who scares all men , more commonly known to the whites as Plume Blanche , or White Plume , a man rising rapidly in importance , and apparently destined to become the leader of the nation . In addition to the Indians , the officers of the garrison , and a few gentlemen were present at the council . The ceremonies were commenced by a discharge of ordnance from the steam boat ; the flags were hoisted in their appropriate places , a council flag being placed near the chair occupied by the agent . The Indians appeared gratified at the displays made on the occasion , but their attention was more particularly aroused by the exhibition of a few rockets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , on account of the Indians , was delayed until the twenty-fifth of August , many of them were present , and manifested some surprize at witnessing the operations of the steam boat . ' - voh i. pp. 111,112 . At the isle - an Vache , Major Long 's party was strengthened by a detachment of a boat and fifteen men from the United States troops there , and on the twenty-fifth of August moved up the river . On the first of September , while the boat was sailing by the mouth of Wolf river , it was hailed from the shore by Dougherty , on* of Mr Say 's party , detached , as we have stated above , to explore the region between the Konzas and . the Platte . Mr Say 's party had arrived safely at the Konzas village , of which the chiefs and warriors were , as we ' have seen , absent at a council with Major O'Fallon ; and during his visit among this people , Mr Say had opportunity of // making much curious observation on their character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us . Having finished his visit to the Konzas , he proceeded onward with his companions , and had the misfortune to fall in with a war party of the Republican Pawnees , by whom they were robbed and insulted ; and being deprived of their horses , rendered incapable of prosecuting their projected tour . They had no alternative but to return to the village of the Konzas , whence they had just departed . Mr Say 's party were kindly received at the village they had left on the preceding day . . In the evening they had retired to rest in the lodge set apart for their accommodation , when they were alarmed by a party of savages , rushing in armed with bows , arrows and lances , shouting and yelling in a most frightful manner . The gentlemen of the party had immediate recourse to their arms , but observing that some squaws , who were in the lodge , appeared unmoved , they began to suspect that no molestation to them was intended . The Indians collected around the fire in the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed something of a measured tone , and they began to accompany their voices with a sort of drum and rattles . After singing for some time , one who appeared to be their leader , struck the post over the fire with his lance , and they all began to d*ince , keeping very exact time with the music . Each warrior had , besides his arms , and rattles made of strings of deer 's hoofs , some part of the intestines of an animal inflated , and inclosing a few small stones , which produced a sound like pebbles in a gourd shell . After dancing round the fire for some time , without appearing to notice the strangers , they departed , raising the same wolfish howl , with which they had entered ; but their music and their yelling continued to be heard about the village during the night . This ceremony , called the dog dance , was performed by the Konzas for the entertainment of their guests . Mr Seymour took an opportunity to sketch the attitudes and dresses of the principal flgures. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now crossed to Isle au Vache , where the council already mentioned had been held ; but had the mortification to find that the Western Engineer had already ascended the river . Messrs Say and Jessup , unable from illness to travel further on foot , determined to remain for the present at Isle au Vache ; while the rest of the party under the direction of Mr Dougherty , who was thoroughly acquaint . ' // ed with the country , undertook to cross it , in the direction of Wolf river , where this latter person , in the manner we have mentioned , arrived in season to hail the Western Engineer , as she was passing , on the first of September . On the following day the whole party , with the exception of Messrs Say and Jessup , moved up the river ; on the fifteenth of September arrived at the mouth of the Platte , and on the seventeenth encamped near the spot destined to be the winter quarters of the expedition , just above the trading establishment of the Missouri fur company , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most active persons engaged in the Missouri fur trade . The position selected for the establishment of winter quarters for the exploring party , was on the west bank of the Missouri , about half a mile above Fort Lisa , five miles below Council Bluff , and three miles above Boyer 's river . At this place , the party came to anchor on the nineteenth of September , and in a few days had made great progress in cutting timber , quarrying stone , and in other preparations for the construction of quarters . The first object of Major O'Fallon was to obtain redress of the Pawnees for their outrage on Mr Say . Messengers were sent across the country to stop the traders , who had already departed with merchandise for that tribe , and shortly after , Mr Dougherty , with two Frenchmen acquainted with the language of the Pawnees , was sent to them to demand restitution . He had previously been despatched with a deputation of Kouzas to the village of the Otoes , with whom the Koazas had been at war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the fourth of October , a council was held by Major O'Fallon with about one hundred Otoes and a deputation of the Joways . The day before the council , a dance was performed by the Indians , which is thus described : The principal chiefs advanced before their people , and upon invitation seated themselves . After a short interval of silence , Shonga-tonga , the Big-horse , a large , portly Indian of a commanding presence , arose , and said ,  --  " My father , your children have come to dance before your teat agreeably to our custom of honoring brave or distinguished persons . " After a suitable reply by Major O'Fall*n , the amusement of dancing was commenced by the striking up of their rude instrumental and vocal music ; the former consisting of a gong , made of a large keg , over one of the ends of which a skin was stretch.TVew Series , No. 14. 33 // ed , which was struck by a small stick ; and another instrument , consisting of a stick of firm wood , notched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller stick was rubbed forcibly backward and forward ; with these , rude as they were , very good time was preserved with the vocal performers , who sat around them , and by all the natives , as they sat , in the inflection of their bodies , or the movements of their limbs . After the lapse of a little time , three individuals leaped up and danced around for a few minutes , then , at a concerted signal from the master of ceremonies , the music ceased , and they retired to their seats , uttering a loud noise , which , by patting the mouth rapidly with the hand , was broken into a succession of similar sounds , somewhat like the hurried barking of a dog . Several sets of dancers succeeded , each terminating as the first . In the intervals of the dances , a warrior would step forward and strike a flag-staff they had erected with a stick , whip , or other weapon , and recount his martial deeds . This ceremony is called striking the post , and whatever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being delivered in the presence of many a jealous warrior and witness , who could easily detect and would immediately disgrace the striker for exagge. * ration or falsehood . This is called the beggars ' dance , during which some presents are always expected by the performers , as tobacco , whiskey , or trinkets . But on this occasion , as none of those articles were immediately offered , the amusement was not , at first , distinguished by much activity . The master of the ceremonies continually called aloud to them to exert themselves ; but still they were somewhat dull and backward . letan now stepped forward and lashed a post with his whip , declaring that he would thus punish those who did not dance . This threat , from one whom they had vested with authority for this occasion , had a manifest effect upon his auditors , who were presently highly wrought up by the sight of two or three little mounds of tobacco twist , which were now laid before them , and appeared to infuse new life . After lashing the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his martial exploits . He had stolen horses seven or eight times from the Kouzas ; he had first struck the bodies of three of that nation slain in battle . He had stolen horses from the letan nation , and had struck one of their dead . He had stolen horses from the Pawnees , and struck the body of one Pawnee Loup . He had stolen horses several times from the Omawhaws , and once from the Puncas . He had struck the bodies of two Sioux . On a war party , in company with the Pawnees , he had attacked the Spaniards , and penetrated into one of their camps ; the Spaniards , excepting a man and boy , fled , himself being at a distance before his party , he was shot at and missed by the man , whom he immediately shot down and struck . " This , // my father , " said he , " is the only martial act of my life , that I am ashamed of . " After several rounds of dancing , and of striking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Soldier , a war-worn veteran , took his turn to strike the post . He leaped actively about , and strained his voice to its utmost pitch , whilst he portrayed some of the scenes of blood , in which he had acted . He had struck dead bodies of individuals of all the red nations around , Osages , Konzas , Pawnee Loups , Pawnee Republicans , Grand Pawnees , Puncas , Omawhaws , and Sioux , Padoucas , La Plais or Bald Heads , letans , Sauks , Foxes , and Joways ; he had struck eight of one nation , seven of another , &amp;c . He was proceeding with his account when Jetan ran up to him , put his hand upon his mouth , and respectfully led him to his seat . This act was no trifling compliment paid to the well-known brave . It indicated that he had still so many glorious acts to speak of , that he would occupy so much time as to prevent others from speaking , and put to shame the other warriors by the contrast of his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day succeeding this friendly council , the Pawnees , who had been summoned to give account of the outrage mentioned , and of various other acts of violence , appeared at the encampment . They advanced leisurely onward in a narrow pathway , in Indian file , led by a grand chief . Near this pathway , the American band of music had been stationed ; and when Long-hair , the chief , arrived opposite to it , the band struck up suddenly and loudly a martial air . We wished to observe the effect , ' add our authors , which instruments , that he had never seen nor heard before , would produce on this distinguished man , and therefore eyed him closely , and were not disappointed to observe , that he did not deign to look upon them , or to manifest , by any emotion whatever , that he was sensible of their presence . The Indians arranged themselves on the benches prepared for them , and the cessation of the music was succeeded by stillness , which was suddenly interrupted by loud explosions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not appear to attract the notice of the Pawnees . ' We have never seen so complete an illustration of the control possessed by these savages over their curiosity , and the command they are able to exercise over their nerves . The council terminated , after much of the propert9taken from Mr Say 's party had been restored , and promises given , that the offenders should be punished with a whipping. - Having thus established his party at the Council Bluff , Major Long , with Mr Jessup , // on the eleventh of October , took leave of their friends at the encampment , and descended the Missouri in a canoe , on their way back to Washington and Philadelphia . The following chapter contains an interesting journal of occurrences during the winter , succeeded by a series of chapters , compiled from the journal of Mr Say , in which an account is given of the Omawbaws or Mahas , as they are otherwise called . These chapters form a valuable addition to our stock of knowledge with regard to the character and manners of the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without interest . Our limits enable us to make but a few detached extracts from this portion of the volume . The following contains the receipt for a dish , which we think would have filled Mrs Glass or Dr Kitchener with dismay . A singular description of food is made use *f by some tribes of the Snake Indians , consisting chiefly and sometimes wholly of a species of ant , ( Formica , Lin. ) which is very abundant in the region in which they roam . The squaws go in the cool of the morning to the hillocks of these active insects , knowing that then they are assembled together in the greatest numbers . Uncovering the little mounds to a certain depth , the squaws scoop them up in their hands , and put them into a bag prepared for the purpose . When a sufficient number are obtained , they repair to the water , and cleanse the mass from all the dirt and small pieces of wood collected with them . The ants are then placed upon a flat stone , and , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense mass , and rolled out like pastry . Of this substance a soup is prepared , which is relished by the Indians , but is not at all to the taste of white men . Whether or not this species of ant is analogous to the Vachacos , which Humboldt speaks of , as furnishing food to the Indians of the Rio Negro and the Guiana , we have no opportunity of ascertaining . ' vol. i. p. 214 . The following passage will afford some idea of the means made use of , by some of the savage chiefs , to acquire or maintain an ascendency over their miserable subjects . The power of some of the former rulers of the Omawhnws is said to have been almost absolute . That of the celebrated Blackbird Wash*ing-guhSahb*** , seems to have been actually so , and was retained undiminished until his death , which occurred in the year 1800 , of the small-pox , which then almost desolated his nation . Agreeably to his orders , he was interred in a sitting posture , on his favorite horse , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri , " that he might continue to see the // white people ascending the river to trade with his nation . " A mound was raised over his remains , on which food was regularly placed for many years afterwards ; but this rite has been discontinued , and the staff , that , on its summit , supported a white flag , has no longer existence . This chief appears to have possessed extraordinary mental abilities , but he resorted to the most nefarious means to establish firmly the supremacy of his power . He gained the reputation of the greatest of medicine men , and his medicine , which was no other than arsenic itself , that had been furnished him for the purpose , by the villany of the traders , was secretly administered to his enemies or rivals . Those persons who offended him , or counteracted his views , were thus removed agreeably to his predictions , and all opposition silenced , apparently by the operation of his potent spells . He delighted in the display of his power , and on one occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man they arrived on the bank of a fine flowing stream , and although all were parched with thirst , no one but the white man was permitted to taste of the water . As the chief thought proper to give no reason for this severe punishment , it seemed to be the result of caprice . One inferior but distinguished chief called Little-Bow , at length opposed his power . This man was a warrior of high renown , and so popular in the nation , that it was remarked of him , that he enjoyed the confidence and best wishes of the people , whilst his rival reigned in terror . Such an opponent could not be brooked , and the Black-bird endeavored to destroy him . On one occasion , the Little Bow returned to his lodge , after the absence of a few days on an excursion . His wife placed before him his accustomed food ; but the wariness of the Indian character , led him to observe some peculiarity in her behavior , which assured him that all was not right . He questioned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of her countenance , and her replies , so much increased his suspicions , that he compelled her to eat the contents of the bowl . She then confessed , that the Black-bird had induced her to mingle with the food a portion of his terrible medicine , in order to destroy him . She fell a victim to the machination of the Black-bird , who was thus disappointed of his object . With a band of nearly two hundred followers , the Little-Bow finally seceded from the nation , and established a separate village on the Missouri , where they remained until the death of the tyrant . On one occasion , the Black-bird seems to have been touched by remorse , or perhaps by penitence , in his career of enormity . // 258 Ap*i1 , One of his squaws having been guilty of some trifling offence , he drew his knife in a paroxysm of rage , and stabbed her to the heart . After viewing her dead body a few moments , he seated himself near it , and covering his face with his robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any nourishment . His people vainly petitioned that he would " have pity on them , " and unveil his face ; he was deaf to all their remonstrances , and the opinion prevailed , that he intended to die through starvation . A little child was at length brought in by its parent , who gently raised the leg of the chief , and placed the neck of the child beneath his foot . The murderer then arose , harangued his people , and betook himself to his ordinary occupations . Towards the latter part of his life , he became very corpulent , the consequence of indolence and repletion . He was transported by carriers , on a bison robe , to the various feasts to which he was daily invited , and should the messenger find him asleep , they dared not to awaken him by a noise or by shaking , but by respectfully tickling his nose with a straw . ' vol. i. pp. 223-228 . A very affecting story of a young squaw , married to an American trader , and afterwards deserted by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his judicious report to the Secretary at War , at the close of the second volume , has made the remark , that most of the sentiment and reflection ascribed to the savages in the speeches and sayings reported of them , must be set down to the interpreters and reporters . If there is no exaggeration of the same kind in the narration , to which we have just alluded , it proves an unexpected refinement of feeling on the part of the savage female in question ; a refinement which contrasts strongly with the general tenor of the descriptions of their life , manners , and character , contained in other portions of the work . Additional proof of the stoicism , with which the savages support bodily pains , is found in the account of the expiatory tortures of the Minnetarees . Annually , in the month of July , the Minnetarees celebrate their great medicine dance , or dance of penitence , which may well be compared with the Currack-pooja or the expiatory tortures of the Hindoos , so often celebrated at Calcutta . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is well cooked , and served up in their best manaer . The devotees then dance and sing to their music at intervals , for three or four days together in full view of the v*ctuals , without attempting to taste of them . But they do not , even at this time , forego their // accustomed hospitality . And if a stranger enters , he is invited to eat , though no one partakes with him . On the third or fourth day , the severer expiatory tortures commence , to which the preceding ceremonies were but preludes . An individual presents himself before one of the officiating magi , crying and lamenting , and requests him to cut a fillet of skin from his arm , which he extends for that purpose . The devout operator thrusts a sharp instrument through the skin near the wrist , then introduces the knife , and cuts out a piece of the required length , sometimes extending the excision entirely to the shoulder . Another will request hands of skin to be cut from his arm . A third will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full moon or crescent . A fourth submits to the removal of concentric arcs of skin , from his breast . A fifth prays the operator to remove small pieces of skin from various indicated parts of his body ; for this purpose an iron bodkin is thrust through the skin , and the piece is cut off , by passing the knife under the instrument . Various are the forms of suffering which they inflict upon themselves . An individual requests the operator , to pierce a hole through the skin of each of his shoulders , and after passing a long cord through each of these holes , he repairs to a golgotha at some distance from the village , and selects one of the bison skulls collected there . To the chosen cranium he affixes the ends of his cords , and drags it in this painful manner to the lodge , around which he must go with his burden , before he can be released from it . No one is permitted to assist him , neither dares he to put his own hands to the cords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen that the horns of the cranium get hooked under a root or other obstacle , he must extricate it in the best manner he can , by pulling different ways , but he must not touch the rope or the head , with his hands , or in any respect attempt to relieve the painful strain upon his wounds , until his complete task is performed . Some of the penitents have arrows thrust through various muscular parts of their bodies , as through the skin and superficial muscles of the arm , leg , breast , and back . A devotee caused two stout arrows to be passed through the muscles of his breast , one on each side near the mamma* . To these arrows , cords were attached , the opposite ends of which were affixed to the upper part of a post , which had been firmly implanted in the earth for the purpose . He then threw himself backward , into an oblique position , his back within about two feet of the soil , so as to depend with the gseater portion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony , he continued to chant and to keep time to the music of the gong . until from long abstinence and suffering he fainted . The bystanders // then cried out , " Courage , courage , ** with much shouting and noise ; after a short interval of insensibility he revived , and proceeded with his self-inflicted tortures as before , until nature being completely exhausted , he again relapsed into insensibility , upon which he was loosed from the cords , and carried off amidst the acclamations of the whole assembly . Another Minnetaree , in compliance with a vow he had madu , caused a hole to be perforated through the muscles of each shoulder ; through these holes , cords were passed , which were , at the opposite ends , attached by way of a bridle to a horse , that had been penned up three or four days without food or water . In this manner , he led the horse to the margin of the river . The horse , of course , endeavored to drink , but it was the province of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straining at the cords with the muscles of the shoulder , without resorting to the assistance of his hands . And notwithstanding all the exertions of the horse to drink , his master succeeded in preventing him , and returned with him to his lodge , having accomplished his painful task . ' - vol. i. pp. 276-278 . In the sixteenth chapter an account is given of an expedition of Major O'Fallon , and other gentlemen , to the villages of the Pawnees , or Panis , as the name is sometimes written . On this tour they saw the celebrated young chief , renowned for his courage and humanity , displayed in abolishing the practice of human sacrifices , and who appears in the gallery of the House of Representatives in Mr Morse 's picture ; having been one of the party of Indians , who visited Washington last winter . Perceiving at the head of the chapter that it contained a notice of human sacrifices among the Pawnees , we had thought it possible that some analogy might be traced in this horrid feature of maaners between the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in the following account . The Pawnee Loups heretofore exhibited the singular anomaly , amongst the American natives , of a people addicted to the inhuman , superstitious rite , of making propitiatory offerings of human victims to Venus , the Great Star . The origin of this sanguinary sacrifice is unknown ; probably it existed previously to their intercourse with the white traders . This solemn ceremony was performed annually , and immediately preceded their horticultural operations , for the success of which it appears to have been instituted . A breach of this duty , the performance of which they believed to be required by the Great Star , it was supposed would // be succeeded by the total failure of their crops of maize , beans , and pumpkins , and the consequent total privation of their vegetable food . To obviate a national calamity so formidable , any person was at liberty to offer up a prisoner of either sex , that by his prowess in war he had become possessed of . The devoted individual was clothed in the gayest and most costly attire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the magi , who anticipated all his wants , cautiously concealed from him the real object of their sedulous attentions , and endeavored to preserve his mind in a state of cheerfulness , with the view of promoting obesity , and thereby rendering the sacrifice more acceptable to their Ceres . When the victim was thus sufficiently fattened for their purpose , a suitable day was appointed for the performance of the rite , that the whole nation might attend . The victim was bound to a cross , in presence of the assembled multitude , when a solemn dance was performed , and after some other ceremonies , the warrior , whose prisoner he had been , cleaved his head with the tomahawk , and his speedy death was insured by numerous archers , who penetrated his body with their arrows . The present mild and humane chief of the nation , Latelesha , er Knife-chief , had long regarded this sacrifice as an unnecesary and cruel exhibition of power , exercised upon unfortunate and defenceless individuals , whom they were bound to protect , and he vainly endeavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was brought captive into the village , was doomed to the Great Star by the warrior , whose property she had become by the fate of war . She underwent the usual preparations , and , on the appointed day , was led to the cross , amidst a great concourse of people , as eager , perhaps , as their civilized fellow men , to witness the horrors of an execution . The victim was bound to the cross with thongs of skin , and the usual cer*monies being performed , her dread of a more terrible death was about to be terminated by the tomahawk and the arrow . At this critical juncture , Petalesharoo , son of the Knifechief , stepped forward into the area , and in a hurried but firm manner declared that it was his father 's wish to abolish this sacrifice ; that for himself , he had presented himself before them , for the purpose of laying down his life upon the spot , or of releasing the victim . He then cut the cords which bound her to the cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he presented to her , and having mounted another himself , he conveyed her beyond the reach of immediate pursuit ; when , // after having supplied her with food , and admonishing her to make the best of her way to her own nation , which was at the distance of at least four hundred miles , he was constrained to return to his village . The emancipated letan had , however , the good fortune , on her journey of the subsequent day , to meet with a war party of her own people , by whom she was conveyed to her family in safety . This daring deed would , almost to a certainty , have terminated in an unsuccessful attempt , under the arm of any other warrior , and Petalesharoo was , no doubt , indebted for this successful and noble achievement to the distinguished renown , which his feats of chivalry had already gained for hIm , and which commanded the high respect of all his rival warriors. ' - vol. 1 . pp. 357-359 . The appendix to this chapter contains a catalogue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and an extremely curious account of the language of signs , in exten-* sive use among the different tribes of savages . The number and diversity of their dialects and the imperfection probably of all of them as mediums of communication , have led to a surprizing skill , in the use of this language of signs . The extremely arbitrary character of many of these signs makes us , however , somewhat sceptical , as to the extent to which they are used . Thus the third sign in the list is Darkness , which is represented by the hands extended horizontally forward and back upward , passing one over the other , two or three times , touching . ' If this be any thing different from the pantomimic representation of groping , it is evidently a complicated , arbitrary sign , indicative of more concert than we can readily attribute to the different savage nations with each other . The justice of these scruples is confirmed by the fact , stated by our authors , that the language of signs given by them differs in many symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , to question a considerable use of these signs : but if , as our authors state , the members of different tribes , who by various chances have been incorporated with each other , remain for a long time unable to communicate by language ,  --  the vehicle of thought which is acquired with greatest facility ,  --  it can not be presumed that any very detailed communication could take place between isconnected savage nations by means of signs highly arbitrary and conventional . While the events related in the ninth chapter were trans // piring at the encampment , Major Long had accomplished his return to Washington , and on the twenty-eighth of May 1820 , had again ascended to the encampment , having performed the journey from St Louis to the Council Bluff by land . Preparations were now made for pursuing the ulterior objects of the expedition . For a reason , which we shall presently men tion , the farther progress of the party up the Missouri was countermanded by the Secretary at War , and an excursion by land to the source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arkansa and Red rivers , to the Mississippi was ordered . The party organized for this route consisted of the following persons . S. H. Long , Major U. S. Topographical Engineers , commanding the expedition ; J. R. Bell , Captain Light Artillery , to act as Journalist ; W. H. Swift , assistant Topographer , commanding guard ; Thomas Say , Zoologist , &amp;c. ; E. James , Botanist , Geologist , and Surgeon ; T. R. Peale , assistant Naturalist ; Samuel Seymour , Landscape Painter ; Stephen Julien , Interpreter , French and Jadian ; H. Dougherty , Hunter ; D. Adams , Spanish Interpreter ; Z. Wilson , Baggage Master ; Oakley and Duncan , Engagees ; Corporal Parish , and six privates of the U. S. Army . To these we expected an addition , on our arrival at the Pawnee villages , of two Frenchmen , to serve as guides and interpreters , one of them having already been engaged . Twenty-eight horses and mules had been provided , one for each individual of the party , and eight for carrying packs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , being furnished by the commanding officer at Camp Missouri ; the remaining sixteen were supplied by Major Long , and others of the party . Our saddles , and other articles of equipage , were of the rudest kind , being , with a few exceptions , such as we had purchased from the Indians , or constructed ourselves . ' - vol. i. p. 425 . The circumstances of the case obliged the party to start with an inadequate outfit , for the difficult and dangerous excursion proposed , and it was not without expressions of derision on the part of the Indians who witnessed their small numbers , that on the sixth of June they took up their march . An attempt was made during the halt of the party among the Pawnees , to make them acquainted with the vaccine inoculation , but doubts are expressed by our *sthors , whether its nature and efficacy were comprehended by the Indians . The formidable ravages of the small pox , among a people so ill // provided with medical aid , would make this antidote a peculiar blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America had anticipated the observation of Dr Jenner , and were acquainted with the fact , that those who milked the cows were affected with a mild disease , by which they were protected from small pox . In traversing the region between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains , our travellers were in a great degree dependent on the bison , or buffalo , as he is usually called , for their support . The immense herds of this powerful animal , which throng the western plains , to which the progress of civilization has banished them from their former range over the greater part of the continent , form one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the region . The following animated account of an imposing scene will be acceptable to our readers . We rode on through the same uninteresting and dreary country as before , but were constantly amused at observing the motions of the countless thousands of bisons , by which we were all the time surrounded . The wind happening to blow fresh from the south , the scent of our party was borne directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step of its progress through a distance of eight or ten miles , by the consternation and terror it excited among the buffalo . The moment the tainted gale infected their atmosphere , they ran with as much violence as if pursued by a party of mounted hunters , and instead of running from the danger , turned their heads towards the wind . Eager to escape from the terrifying scent , they pushed forward in an oblique direction towards our party , and plunging into the river they swam and waded , and ran with the utmost violence , in several instances breaking through our line of march , which was immediately along the left bank of the Platte . One of the party perceiving from the direction taken by the bull , that preceded the extended column of his companions , that he intended to emerge from the low river bottom , at a particular point , where the precipitous bank was worn by much travelling into a deep notch , urged his horse rapidly forward to gain this station , that he might have a near view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point , than the formidable leader , bounding up the steep , gained the summit of the bank , with his fore feet , and in this position abruptly halted from his full career , and glared fiercely at the horse , which now *ccupied his path . The horse , trembling violently from fear of this sudden apparition , would have wheeled and exerted his utmost speed , had he not been restrained by the greatest strength of his rider ; he re // coiled however a few feet , and sunk down upon his hams . The bull halted but a moment , then being urged forward by the irresistible impulse of the moving column behind , rushed onward by the half sitting horse . The multitude came swiftly on , crowding up the narrow defile . The party had now arrived , and extending along a considerable distance , the bisons ran in a confused manner in various directions to gain the distant bluffs ; numbers were compelled to pass through our line of march , between the horses . This scene added to the plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing , produced a grand effect , which was still heightened , by the fire opened upon them by our hunters . As they ascended the bank , innumerable opportunities offered of selecting and killing the fattest , and it was with difficulty we restrained our hunters from slaughtering many more than we needed . ' - vol. i. pp. 480 , 481 . On the thirtieth of June , the party obtained a distant view of the Rocky Mountains . The plains about them exhibited the phenomenon of the Mirage , in an uncommonly vivid manner . A herd of bisons , at the distance of a mile , seemed to be standing in a pool of water ; and what appeared to us the reflected image was as distinctly seen as the animal itself . ' On the sixth of July , the party encamped at the base of the Rocky Mountains , having reached the barrier , which bounds the plain of almost a thousand miles , over which they had travelled . On the morning of the thirteenth , Dr James , by whom the work before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small detachment destined to explore and ascend the Highest Peak , ' as it is called in our maps ; an elevation , which , though not the highest , in the opinion of our authors , lies , nevertheless , within the region of perpetual snow . It is very suitably named by Major Long , James ' Peak . ' The visit to it was accomplished with considerable difficulty ; the thermometer sinking to 420 on the summit , while , in the encampment , it had stood at 96* the same day at noon , and did not fall to 8O* till late in the evening . Having achieved this object , the party moved onward over the desert , to the banks of the Arkansa . Having encamped on this river , Captain Bell , with Dr James and two men , made an excursion up the river to the mountains , to explore its sources Having effected their purpose , and returned to the encampment , the whole party , on the morning of the nineteenth , turned their backs on // the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a feeling of regret , ' say our authors , that we found our long contemplated visit to these grand and interesting objects to be now at an end . More than a thousand miles of dreary and monotonous plain lay between us and the enjoyments and comforts of civilized countries . This we were to traverse in the heat of summer , but the scarcity of game about the mountains rendered an immediate departure necessary . ' On the twenty-first of July , a division of the party into two sections was ordered , of which the one under Major Long was destined to cross the Arkansa , and travel southward in search of the sources of the Red river ; the other , under Captain Bell , to proceed down the Arkansa , by the most direct route , to Fort Smith . On the twenty-fourth , the two divisions started on their respective destinations . The length , to which our article has already extended , prevents our following the molions of either . Misled by the information of the Kaskain Indians , and in some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Long mistook the Canadian river for the Red river , of whith they were in search , nor did they discover their error , till their arrival at the confluence of the former and the Arkansa , when it was too late to retrace their steps . On the thirteenth of September , they arrived at Fort Smithy the place of rendezvous , which Captain Bell 's party-by the direct route of the Arkansa-had reached before them . A different misfortune had befallen the latter party . In the course of their route , three of the soldiers of the party had deserted in the night , after plundering the company of whatever they could carry off , and taking with them , among articles more easily replaced , some whose loss was irreparable . Our entire wardrobe , with the sole exception of the rude clothing on our persons , and our entire private stock of Indian presents , were incinded in the saddle-bags . But their most important contents were all the manuscripts of Mr Say and Lieutenant Swift , completed during the extensive journey from Engineer cantonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five books , viz , one book of observations on the manners and habits of the mountain Indians , and their history , so far as it could be obtained from the interpreters ; one book of notes on the manners and habits of animals , and descriptions of species ; one book containing a joarnal ; two books containing vocabularies of the // languages of the mountain Indians ; and those of the latter con .. sisted of a topographical journal of the same portion of our expedition . All these being utterly useless to the wretches who now possessed them , were probably thrown away upon the ocean of prairie , and consequently the labor of months was consigned to oblivion by these uneducated vandals . ' Shortly after this untoward accident , the party arrived at the place of rendezvous ; where , being again within the pale of civilization , our imperfect analysis of their interesting narrative may close . To the detailed relation of the expedition of which we have attempted the foregoing abstract , succeeds a ' general description of the country traversed , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . This is a very judicious document , and will materially aid the reader in generalizing the information derived from the main work . The volume is closed by an appendix , consisting of astronomical and meteorological records , and vocabularies of various Indian languages . A considerable accession is made by the latter the stock of materials , in a study daily rising in interest . The Atlas contains two maps , comprising the country drained by the Mississippi , and some well executed engravings of scenes from Indian life and manners , and sketches from nature. - We do not think it necessary to enter into a minute criticism of the style , though it is occasionally less simple than we could wish . There is sometimes an affectation of scientific language , and it is not often that our authors are willing to make use of a less formidable word than infract , for breaking or violating a treaty . With this exception , the literary execution is highly respectable . We have already expressed a desire , on some other occasion , to enter into an examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which our government has sent into the West , appears to have been so well appointed , in respect to the investigation of nature . There is but one sentence in the volumes , which we have read with shame and sorrow . It is that which gives an account of the causes for stinting the objects and abridging the extent of the expedition . It will he perceived , ' say our authors , that the travels and researches of the expedition have been far less extensive , than those contemplatechin the orders of the Secretary of War . The state of the national finances , during the year 1821 , having called for retrenchments in all expenditures // of a public nature , the means for the farther prosecution of the objects of the expedition were accordingly withheld . ' The state of our national finances ! Some great calamity , perhaps , has befallen us . We have bad the armies of all Europe quartered upon us , like France ; we have had an overwhelming taxation , like England ; we have been swept with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been incorporated into foreign empires , like Holland ; cut up into confederations , like Germany ; our substantial population has been sacrificed , perhaps , as in all the old countries , to the great abuses of government or the perilous convulsions of the times . Is it this , which has brought on the state of our finances ? ' Detestable parsimony ! The only country but one in the world , that has not been reduced to an avowed or virtual bankruptcy ; the country , which has grown and is growing in wealth and prosperity beyond any other and beyond all other nations , too poor to pay a few gentlemen and soldiers for exploring its mighty rivers , and taking possession of the empires , which Providence has called it to govern ! One half of the wages of the members of Congress for the hours they have sagely devoted , from time to time , to the nauseous projects and petitions of Colonel Symmes and his moon-stricken disciples , would have enabled this party of gallant officers intelligent and scientific travellers , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor , indeed , we are in spirit , if not in finance , if we will not afford to pay the expense of making an inventory of the glorious inheritance we are called to possess . England , staggering and sinking under her burdens , can fit out her noble expeditions to the Niger and to the Pole . France has her intrepid naturalists in the farthest regions of Ethiopia . Botanists and mineralogists take their departure from Vienna , to go and traverse Brazil . Prussia sends her men of learning to copy manuscripts and study antiquities at Verona and at Rome . Russia , with her Krusen .. sterns , and Kotzebues , and Lisianskis , is actually elbowing us out of the mouths of the Columbia . And even Mohammed Ali Pasha , the Turkish viceroy , the bey of Egypt , has his envoys at Marseilles , at Leghorn , and at Frankfort , to send him home the latest improvements . Whih# these very prosperous , very flourishing countries , of whose aggregate national debt , the principal of ours would not pay six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not find a small party of discovery in powder and ball enough to hunt withal , or blankets and strouding enough to trade with the Indians . If , indeed , this is the sense of the people , and of their representatives , Jet them be honest and act the poverty they allege and feel . honest poverty is no shame in the single man or the state . If we are poor , let us put off these proud airs ; truckle to the British , court the Russians , beg pardon of the Spaniards , and shake hands with the pirates . Let the president at Washington move into comfortable lodgings in the seven buildings , and his white palace be leased out as a hotel . Put Congress back into the brick tenement , from which it lately escaped , and convert the capitol into a cotton factory , that its halls may at length resound with no unprofitable hum . Get the British East India company to charter our extravagant frigates and seventy-fours ; and see , in the last resort , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley of the Missouri at the halves . This would be manly , consistent , radical work ; and when we had come down to this , we might have the face to talk of the low state of our national finances . But do not let us teach the people unnecessarily to grovel . Do not let us take the country at contract , to be administered by those , who will stoop to administer it most meanly . It is not grateful to Providence to be so covetous . Whoever believes that the sins of nations may sometimes be visited upon them , may well fear that this miserly policy , on the part of a people so highly favored , may draw down upon us a touch of real national poverty ; an overwhelming national debt , an all devouring taxation , a dispensation of assignats , and a public bankruptcy . Who knows that a just retribution may not conjure up to plague us some Mississippi company ; some South Sea scheme ; some judicial old tenor at an unheard of discount ; some new emission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base coin upon our community , shake public credit , poison faith between man and man , turn certificates of stock into rags , and render it good husbandry- .. as it was twelve years ago in the Dutch cities  --  to pull down brick houses , for the sake of saving the tax ? When any or all of these events have taken place , we may talk of our national poverty . Till then , it would be more ret*onable , and quite as decent , to return thanks for the public prosperity .
