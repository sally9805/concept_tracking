txt ART . XI. - Marino Faliero , Doge of Venice . .1 tragedy , in five acts , by Lord Byron . London , 1821 , pp. 261 . THE Baron de Grimm , in speaking of the decline of French tragedy , considers it as so obviously to be accounted for , that it was strange more than one explanation of its causes was offered . How is it possible , he asks , that any display of the influence of a single passion on the heroic character should yet remain to be discovered ? Has not every different relation , in which love can be exhibited in romance , been described ? Is it not hopeless to look for a conflict of the different affections which has not been pour* trayed ? Without inquiring into the answers to this argument , by those in France where the theory is held , who were then or are now founding their hopes on what de Grimm considers impossible , it is clear that the English theatre has fully determined in theory if it has not successfully demonstrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope , when young , attempted but suppressed , and what Addison // feared to trust to the united favor of the political and literary factions of his time , a tragedy where the interest does not depend on love , has at least ceased to be considered as impossible . Yet even in those instances where the interest is to be excited by the influence of some other passion , it has been pretty commonly thought expedient to unite this also , not always with the most perfect success to the plot , and there are few dramas which preserve the interest of the passion unmixed , with the purity and simplicity of Douglas , referring to the distress of maternal affection throughout , without a single strophe devoted to the tenderness of a confidante . If we may argue from some expressions in his late letter on Bowles ' Pope , Lord Byron is far from supposing any class of subjects beyond the province of poetry . Though dramatic poetry is not , in this connexion , actually referred to in this letter , yet it is natural that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal range of the art , in general , would not confine any particular branch of it to the interest derived from one passion alone . As it was understood also , that Lord Byron did not mean to restrict himself to the conventional bonds of the acted drama , additional opportunity was given for the boldest choice in the passions , circumstances and history on which the interest of the plot should rely . We have made these remarks before giving our opinion , that the story of the tragedy is neither so valuable , as might have been produced by his lordship 's own invention , nor with the license assumed , taken from history . Very little variation from the facts is exhibited in the story of the play. * Michel Steno , a young nobleman , inscribes on the throne of the Doge of Venice two slanderous lines , reflecting on the chastity of his wife , in revenge for having suffered punishment for some indecorum in the palace . Being tried by the council of forty , he was sentenced to confinement for two months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a month 's arrest . Wrought to frenzy by this inadequate sentence , which he considers an additional insult on the part of the council , Faliero meditates vengeance . In this mood , he has an interview with the leader of a band of conspirators , with whom he unites . By the attachment of one of their number , however , to a young noble , the plot is // arrested in the very moment of its success , and the action concludes with the execution of the conspirators . A pretty obvious fault in the story , the anticipated objection to which we think not fully answered by the noble author , is the great age of the hero . After the few dramas , like Lear , *LEdipus &amp;c. where the action turns on the very interest of the associations connected with extreme age , we seem to require that the violent passions employed to excite tragic interest should be displayed by the young and vigorous . It seems to be the dictate of nature to be shocked at the exposure of the mind to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess fortitude to endure them . The octogenarian chief , blind old Dandolo , ' seems better placed in the war council , than on his galley 's deck in the tumult and danger of the engagement . Very much too of the actual vivacity of sentiment and strength of passion , on which the interest of romance depends , are incompatible with the experience of eighty years , or if found at that period are unnatural and unpleasing . It is well for us that it is so , and fatal beyond description would be the continuance of the feverish excitability of youth , to its possessor . Yet the story of Lord Byron 's tragedy seems even to add to the natural impropriety of the age of his hero . A prince , who has passed a life of eighty years in every variety of action and peril , seems ill in costume , when driven to madness by a boy 's libel on a young lady 's honor . The quest ? ion of the chief of the council of Ten seems unanswerable . And can it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of a century of years , And honours on his head , could thus allow His fury like an angry boy 's to master All feeling , wisdom , faith and fear on such A provocation as a young man 's petulance ? ' Now although it may be and is said , that this event was only the occasion and not the cause of the treason of the Doge , as far as the dramatic effect is concerned we can see no other . The play opens with displaying Faliero in fearful suspense awaiting the senter*ce of the Forty on the libeller . This suspense and agitation , the consolation attempted to be offered and the whole impression conveyed , depend solely on the 1Do*e 's personal dishonor . L*i the bei*utiful close , too , // of the third act , a part of which we shall attempt to extract , the sentiments uttered by Faliero , are in their general tendency directly the reverse of the supposition that he had long suffered under the tyranny of the nobles , although incidentally , as if in anticipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these remarks we suggest from the conviction that though historically true in the particular instance , this story is neither very natural nor highly dramatic . In the preface to the tragedy Lord Byron takes occasion to express great dissatisfaction with Dr Moore for the slighting manner in which he mentions these events in his View of Italy . Without stopping to observe on the sensibility displayed by the poet to any opinion differing from his own in regard to his subject , though expressed while it was yetfere nature and unreclaimed , it is worth remarking that even if the conduct of the Doge should not appear to others , as to the author of Zeluco , extraordinary , it does not therefore follow that it is dramatic , which seems to be the point his lordship should establish . Of the different manners of dramatizing history ; that of Shakspeare in the Hen .. ties , for instance , where a long series of events is crowded together and the poetical interest divided between them as they pass and united to form a whole character or reign , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important fact is adopted and the whole action , on the principle of unity , made to refer to it , the former has clearly the advantage above alluded to : that though any particular event or passion may be unnatural or not dramatic , however intimately connected with the interest , a whole life or reign can not . Accordingly , we very often find a great degree of the actual interest of these productions depending on some character or event which is episodical and subsidiary . A ready answer to this , of course , is that the simplicity and unity of the action are destroyed , but without discussing the hard doctrine of the unities , it is certainly enough for us that art be as unique as nature itself . The order of events is not thus in reality . One great and important circumstance is not prepared , foreseen and produced by a thousand others acting in as regular and direct concert as the balance wheels of an engine , but passions and agents conflict , events of various degrees of importance occur and vary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the attention must not be distracted by this variety , it would seem that the simplicity of an action is // carried too far when it becomes unnaturally distinct and naked . The other objection we find to the plot , and which we will dismiss as soon as possible , is the means of its discovery . The motive of Bertram to betray the conspirators , personal gratitude to a young nobleman , is not , it appears , displayed with sufficient distinctness , and we think the scene of the disclosure not eminently successful . This , it should seem , should be a portion of the action , of vast interest . We have traced a powerful conspiracy against the state , boldly conceived , prudently conducted and long matured . As it were to insure its success , the chief of the republic with his family and retainers unites himself with it , and we witness the final council which is to be followed in a few hours by the fatal execution . It is natural to expect that the means by which all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , to the peril averted . For although the change of feeling in any individual must of course be always extremely disproportionate in importance to the danger of the state , abstractly considered , it became the duty of the poet to present in strong relief those personal motives which , at the time , have weighed more in the mind of the delator than hi* reason or his oath . In the scene between Bertram and Lioni we think this is not done . It seems as if so much important business had crowded on the poet in the two last acts ( to use the phrase of the theatre ) that he was forced to slur it . In this scene a gay young nobleman returns right weary from a revel , ' and after a soliloquy most beautiful indeed and perfectly in character , observing aloud the calm beauty of the night , and contrasting it with the scene he had left , lie is visited by a plebeian , a leader of the conspiracy , who comes to warn him to remain within during its execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third act and the tone of raillery with which he is at first treated by Lioni , render this part of the tragedy , in our opinion , far less impressive than was demanded . For the reasons we have given we pass the scene following the declaration of the partial sentence . The torrent of angry reproach uttered by the prince against the nobles , mixed with a sentiment like remorse for having served them so long , is wonderfully impressive . The interview between the Doge and Angiolina , of which the following is the close , is , in our opinion , beautifully written . // . Ilngiolina. - My lord , I look 'd but to my father 's wishes% Hallow 'd by his last words , and to my heart For doing all its duties , and replying With faith to him with whom I was affianced . Ambitious hopes ne'er cross 'd my dreams ; and should The hour you speak of come , it will be seen so . Doge. -I do believe you ; and I know you true : For love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be illusion , and ne'er saw Lasting , but often fatal , it had been No lure for me , in my most passionate days , And could not be so now , did such exist . But such respect , and mildly paid regard As a true feeling for your welfare , and A free compliance with all honest wishes ; A kindness to your virtues , watchfulness iNot shown , but shadowing o'er such little failings As youth is apt in , so as not to check Rashly , but win you from them ere you knew You had been w6n , but thought the change your choice ; A pride not in your beauty , but your conduct , *- . A trust in you  --  a patriarchal love , And not a doting homage-friendship , faith* Such estimation in your eyes as these Might claim , I hoped for . dngiolina.  --  and have ever had . Do*e .. -I think so .

To your own faith and honor , for my own . . fhz*iolina. - You have done well. -I thank you for that trust , Which I have never for one moment ceased To honor you the more for . Doge. - Where is honor , Innate and precept-strengthen 'd t is the rock Of faith connubial ; where it is not-where Light thoughts are lurking , or the vanities Of worldly pleasure rankle in the heart , Or sensual throbs convulse it , well I know T were hopeless for humanity to dream // Of honesty in such infected blood , Although t were wed to him it covets most : An incarnation of the poet 's god In all his marble-chisell 'd beauty , or The demi-deity , Alcides , in His majesty of superhuman manhood , Would not suffice to bind where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves it : Vice can not fix , and virtue can not chano*e The once fall'n woman must forever faIl ' ; For vice must have variety , while virtue Stands like the sun , and all which rolls around Drinks life , and light , and glory from her aspect . *ngiolina.  --  and seeing , feeling thus this truth in others .

Doge. *-To thus much-that A miscreant 's angry breath may blast it all-. - A villain , whom for his unbridled bearing , Even in the midst of our great festival , I caused to be conducted forth , and taught How to demean himself in ducal chambers ; A wretch like this may leave upon the wall The blighting venom of his sweltering heart , And this shall spread itself in * poison ; And woman 's innocence , man 's honor , pass // Into a by-word ; and the doubly felon ( Who first insulted virgin modesty By a gross affront to your attendant damsels Amidst the noblest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just expulsion By blackening publicly his sovereign 's consort , And be absolved by his upright compeers. *n*ioiina.  --  but he has been condemn 'd into captivity .

Llngiolina. - With me , my lord ? Doge. - Yes , Angiolina . Do not marvel ; I Have let this prey upon me till I feel My life can not be long ; and fain would have you Regard the injunctions you will find within This scroll ( Giving her a paper ) - . Fear not : they are for your advantage : Read them hereafter at the fitting hour . . Ingiolina. - My lord , in life , and after life , you shall Be honor 'd still by me : but may your days Be many yet  --  and happier than the present ! This passion will give way , and you will be Serene , and what you should be. -. -. what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , or be nothing ; But never more-oh ! never , never more , O'er the few days or hours which yet aivait The blighted old age of Faliero , shall Sweet Quiet shed her sunset ! Never more Those summer shadows rising from the past Of a not ill-spent nor inglorious life , Mellowing the last hours as the night approaches , Shall soothe me to my moment of long rest . I had but little more to ask , or hope , Save the regards due to the blood and sweat , And the soul 's labor through which I had toil 'd To make my country honor 'd . As her servantHer servant , though her chief-I would have gone Down to my fathers with a name serene And pure as theirs ; but this has been denied me. - Would I had died at Zara ! .

At least , whate'er may urge ; let me implor* That you will take some little pause of rest : Your sleep for many nights has been so turbid , That it had been relief to have awaked you , Had not hoped that Nature would o'erpower At length the thoughts which shook your slumbers thus .

Doge. - Come then , My gentle child-forgive me ; thou wert made For better fortunes than to share in mine , Now darkling in their close toward the deep vale Where Death sits robed in his all-sweeping shadow . When I am gone-it may be sooner than Even these years warrant , for there is that stirring Within-above-around , that in this city Will make the cemeteries populous As e'er they were by pestilence or war ,  - -  When I am nothing , let that which I was Be still sometimes a name on thy sweet lips , A shadow in thy fancy , of a thing Which would not have thee mourn it , but remember ; - Let us begone , my child  --  the time is pressing .

The thoughts suggested to him by the hour of night , the remembrance of the characters of his ancestry , and the reflection on his present purpose , are surprisingly natural . He is then introduced to the meeting of the conspirators . The following is part of the passage alluded to above in the close of the third act . Doge. - Ye , though ye know and feel our mutual mass Of many wrongs , even ye are ignorant What fatal poison to the springs of life , To human ties , and all that 's good and dear , Lurks in the present institutes of Venice : All these men were my friends ; I loved them , they Requited honorably my regard : We served and fought ; we smiled and wept in concert ; We revell 'd or we sorrow 'd side by side ; We made alliances of blood and marriage ; We grew in years and honors fairly , till Their own desire , not my ambition , made Them choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all social memory ! all thoughts In common ! and sweet bonds which link old friendships , When the survivors of long years and actions , Which now belong to history , sooth the days Which yet remain by treasuring each other , And never meet , but each beholds the mirror Of half a century on his brother 's brow , And sees a hundred beings , now in earth , Flit round them whispering of the days gone by , And seeming not all dead , as long as two Of the brave , joyous , reckless , glorious band , Which once were one and many , still retain A breath to sigh for them , a tongue to speak Of deeds that else were silent , save on marbleOime . - Oiine ! and must 1 ( 10 this deed ?

But let these last and lingering thoughts have way , To which you only and the Night are conscious , And both regardless ; when the hour arrives , T is mine to sound the knell , and strike the blow , Which shall unpeople many palaces , And hew the highest genealogic trees Down to the earth , strew 'd with their bleeding fruit , And crush their blossoms into barrenness : This will I-must I-have I sworn to do , Nor aught can turn me from my destiny ; But still I quiver to behold what I Must be , and think what I have been ! Bear with me . Israel Bertuccio. - Re- man your breast ; I feel no such re* morse , I understand it not : why should you change ?

When all is over , you 'll be free and merry , And calmly wash those hands incarnadine ; But I , outgoing thee and all thy fellows In this surprising massacre , shall be , // Shall see , and feel-oh God ! oh God ! t is true , And thou dost well to answer that it was " My own free will and act , " and yet you err , For I will do this ! Doubt not-fear not ; I Will be your most unmerciful accomplice ; And yet I act no more on my free will , Nor my own feelings - both compel me back ; But there is hell within me and around , And like the demon who believes and trembles Must I abhor and do .

I am resolved-.come on . ' The next act opens with the scene between Bertram and Lioni already described , and closes with the arrest of Faliero and the dispersion of the conspirators . The last comprises the trial and execution , first of the leaders of the conspiracy and afterwards of the Doge . The duchess is present during Faliero 's trial , and utters an affecting appeal to the council . The following is the concluding apostrophe of the Doge . Doge ... -I speak to Time and to Eternity , Of which I grow a portion , not to man . Ye elements ! in which to be resolved I hasten , let my voice be as a spirit Upon you ! Ye blue waves ? which bore my banner , Ye winds ! which fiutter 'd o'er as if you loved it , And fill 'd my swelling sails as they were wafted To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which I have bled for , and thou foreign earth , Which drank this willing blood from many a wound !

I perish , but not unavenged ; for ages Float up from the abyss of time to be , And show these eyes , before they close , the doom Of this proud city , and I leave my curse // On her and hers for ever ! -* Yes , the hours Are silently engendering of the day , When she , who built gainst Attila a bulwark , Shall yield , and bloodlessly and basely yield Unto a bastard Attila , without Shedding so much blood in her last defence As these old veins , oft drain 'd in shielding her , Shall pour in sacrifice. - She shall be bought And sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! . - She shall stoop to be A province for an empire , petty town In lieu of capital , with slaves for senates , Beggars for nables , panders for a people ! Then when the Hebrew s in thy palaces , The Hun in thy high places , and the Greek Walks o'er thy mart , and smiles on it for his ! When thy patricians beg their bitter bread In narrow streets , and in their shameful need Make their nobility a plea for pity ! Then , when the few who still retain a wreck Of their great fathers ' heritage shall fawn Round a barbarian Vice of Kings ' Vice-gerent , Even in the palace where they sway 'd as sovereigns , Even in the palace where they slew their sovereign , Proud of some name they have disgraced , or sprung From an adultress boastful of her guilt With some large gondolier or foreign soldier , Shall bear about their bastardy in triumph To the third spurious generation ; - when Thy sons are in the lowest scale of being , Slaves turn 'd o'er to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for greater cowardice , And scorn 'd even by the vicious for such vices As in the monstrous grasp of their conception Defy all codes to image or to name them ; Then , when of Cyprus , now thy subject kingdom , All thine inheritance shall be her shame Entail 'd on thy less virtuous daughters , grown A wider proverb for worse prostitution ; - When all the ills of conquer 'd states shall cling thee , Vice without splendor , sin without relief Even from the gloss of love to smooth it o'er , But in its stead coarse lusts of habitude , Prurient yet passionless , cold studied lewdness , Depraving nature 's frailty to an art ; - When these and more are heavy on thee , when // Smiles without mirth , and pastimes without pleasure , Youth without honor , age without respect , Meanness and weakness , and a sense of wo Gainst which thou wilt not strive , and dar'st not murmur , Have made thee last and worst of peopled deserts , Then , in the last gasp of thine agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou den of drunkards with the blood of princes !

Strike as I struck the foe ! Strike as I would Have struck those tyrants ! Strike deep as my curse ! Strike-  --  and but once ! The Doge throws himself upon his knees , and as the executioner raises his sword the scene closes . ' We do not know if Lord Byron believes like Cowper , that it is necessary to introduce harsh and prosaic lines to relieve the monotony of blank verse , but many of them are certainly to be found . It is strange that Cowper should have taken up the idea* that it was necessary to attempt to be harsh and unmusical . With a language formed on the originals that ours is , it is not , at any rate , a very difficult task to relieve the monotony of too great sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are confident a sufficient relief to the harmony of any poet 's language will be found in the nature of the northern dialects , without looking far or long for harsh consonants and unmusical accents . This system of neglect of quantity and arrangement seems to be carried a little too far . There can be no question that the poetry of Pope , for instance , when flowing with constant regularity , and the cesura falling in the same place in every line with undeviating certainty , which regularity he evidently bestows as the last merit on the passages intended to be most impassioned , is unfavorable to the complete expression of strong emotion . Uniformity in all works of art , confers the pleasure of exciting the idea of the triumph of art , and in pure description or enumeration , this regularity may also be agreeable from the impression of order and distinctness it can not but give : // Warms in the sun f refreshes in the breeze , Glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees , Lives through all life extends through all extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antithesis and enumeration expressed in these lines , render the plain and strong division of the c*esura rather pleas** ant than otherwise . Can the reader , however , conceive of passages like the following , from Childe Harold , being set off into regularly recurring metrical periods of this kind , without losing all their sublimity ? Arches on arches f as it were that Rome , Collecting all the trophies J of her line , Would build up all her triumphs in one dome , Her Coliseum stands . ' Here one can hardly mark the place for the ca*sura , partien-. larly in the second line , where any pause seems unnecessary . After all this , however , the modern poets , in seeking the reverse of wrong , have in many instances fallen* into a style far more unpleasant than the regularity of Pope , since it is equally unnatural and more negligent . Who could believe , for instanee , that the following lines were measure and rhyme ' and still more were Moore 's , whose songs so often rob the Hybla bees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild song , which once t was rapture to hear , when our voices , both mingling , breathed like one on the ear ; and as echo far off through the valley my sad orison rolls , I think , oh my love , t is thy voice from the kingdom of souls faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear . ' * Lord Byron has carried that disregard of scrupulous regularity , which , when restrained by rhyme , was so successful and sublime in Childe Harold , much too far in the blank verse of this poem . The lines oonstantly terminate with an unaccented and unimportant monosyllable , producing the most prosaic effect : Is doom 'd to expiate his rash insult with- ' But if his insults sink no deeper in- ' &amp;c . Irish Melodies . We believe it is in the preface to the National Airs ' that Moore professes to sacrifice metre and even sense to his wild music . ' Without entrenching at all on the province of the composer , we may express our surprise that any air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sung in it are nonsense . // The frequent recurrence of lines like these and the following is unpleasant : I can see no one not even a patrician . ' By the reference of the Avogadori . ' Against the Genoese , which is still maintained . ' As well had there been time to have got together . ' The poet is not sparing of colloquial familiarities . The following sounds like the subscription to a letter of civility : imploring you In all things to rely upon my duty As doth become your near and faithful kinsman , And not less loyal citizen and subject . Exit . ' And however impatient the prince might have been , we venture to say , if he had spoken English , he would not have said , From me fear nothing : out with it . ' We are not sure , on the whole , that the method of the English dramatists , of uniting prose and poetry in the same performance , is not necessary to avoid the unfavorable effect produced , either by reciting indifferent and low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with themselves . As to destroying the unity of the composition , not to speak of the example of the great teachers of unity , we hardly know how the passage above , and many others , can lay claim to the name of poetry but from the number of syllables , and nothing indeed could be more ludicrous than the attempt to add the dignity of poetry to such circumstances as an indifferent and formal ceremony of parting . In the preface to this tragedy , Lord Byron gives the Mysterious Mother ' the praise of being a Roman performance , in that it is not a pulrng love-play . ' We have already alluded to the unaccountable prejudice on this subject , and were it wholly past , however it might be a subject of wonder , it could hardly call for animadversion . Yet , even now it is thought an hazardous enterprise to undertake a play without at least attaching a love-plot to it , and though the author of Waverly ( as be chooses to be called ) has done much , romance is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , can not bestow either the epithets or the sentiment of Lord Byron // on many beautiful performances ; yet it would seem from the-. ory and appears from the effect , that instead of claiming the exclusive interest of scenic compositions , this passion should have been contented with a subordinate influence on the pub-. lic stage . The most important effects on our happiness , produced by the social affections , are undoubtedly those , which retire to the solitude of domestic content or disappointment . It is not easy to suppose any thing less adapted for the exaggeration of dramatic effect than either . The repose and peace of the one , and the peculiar associations attached to suffering in the other , would seem to be least of all the natural subjects of the free exposure of the theatre . The stage is the only perfect criterion of dramatic performances , and let it be supported with the greatest purity and talent possible , one need only bring the question to this test to have it answered . The best acting , supported by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love-scenes of any tragedy , and the moment we destroy the effect produced by the associations of delight in the poetry which we enjoy from having read the performance , this tediousness is converted into disgust . Not the Venus when in the dress and with the attributes of Alecto , as she was sometimes painted , seems less attractive than a dramatic heroine , whose sentiments and character are distorted and exaggerated to the proper stage effect . Accordingly , we find that this interest is seldom long employed successfully , but when in connexion or opposition to the more distinct and obvious motives and passions . Juliet has seen her lover but a few hours when his approaching fate from his public crime stamps his countenance , in her eyes , with the impress of the tomb , and Belvidera is first introduced as the pledge of her husband 's fidelity to his treason against the republic . With the ancients this is even more extensively true than with us , and the political revolutions or religious destiny of the drama 's persons sternly overrule the conflicts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to their habits of private society , as to the reserve imposed on the female sex , which gives the effect of the irresolution of Hamlet to the timidity of Electra . It seems , however , if the unity and simplicity of the drama , which Lord Byron justly values so highly , are to be restored to the severity of the Grecian model , there can not be a more obvious step than to bestow on the public and domestic passions their ap // 244 July , propriate influence . It is something to provide with scrupulous accuracy that no time be left to be employed by the imagination , that the drama 's persons are carefully brought on every different enterprise to the same hall , and that the attention is never distracted by any variety of action ; but it is more necessary to unity that the sentiments and habits of different characters should he observed , and that not be publicly exhibited , which if it escaped from the inmost recesses of solitude in actual life would be phrensy or folly . This is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Racine declares , that though he can meet all objections to the action , still that on which he most congratulates himself is the reflection , that he has attained that simplicity which was so much to the taste of the ancients . When united or opposed to the sources of dramatic interest , we all know how powerful is the attraction of love in the drama . Yet this will not explain and can not justify the theory of its relative importance , as a source of theatrical effect , which in the drama of one people has enshrined it as the sole muse of the stage , and in that of their national rival has demanded its presence , as invariably necessary to poetical effect . It would have seemed as if those who held this theory had never heard of conquests or kingdoms , of the desolation of countries and the revolutions of empires , the waves of the mighty tide , which sweeps on kings , consuls , and Ca*sars ' to their fate . They could not have reflected on the causes and events of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conflicts of public and private duty , the struggles of mental freedom and chivalric submission , which have enslaved or emancipated nations . Those who denied tragedy to be adapted but to one passion must have been reckless spectators indeed of the mighty tragedies on the theatre of empires . it would seem that they could not have witnessed one age building up all the treasures of commerce and the refinements of art , and the next opening the gates of the North to a merciless and resistless invasion . They could not have gazed on the portentous veil which covers the destiny of the world , sometimes lifted for a moment to disclose the agents and engines of approaching convulsion , and then dropped till the moment of desolation arrives . When such a theory is adopted we reject as unpoetical the glorious actions of all who have fought the great contest of improvement , against powerful vice and // enthroned ignorance , against the gigantic resources of whole empires wielded by the venal band Who are to judge of danger which they fear , And honor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in this country that we have no such fixed associations on this subject to combat , and that with whatever effect the pas*ion of love may be emplQyed by an American poet , he need not fear , from any prejudices of theory to attempt the success of appealing to the sympathy felt by the human breast in the great actions of those , who have improved or defended society . Before closing this article we would make an extract somewhat amusing from the preface to the tragedy . It is now four years , that I have meditated this work ; and before I had sufficiently examined the records , I was rather disposed to have made it turn on a jealousy in Faliero . But perceiving no foundation for this in historical truth , and aware that jealousy is an exhausted passion in the drama , I have given it a more historical form . I was besides well advised by the late Matthew Lewis , on that point , in talking with him of my intention , at Venice in 1817 . " If you make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to contend with established writers , to say nothing of Shakspeare , and an exhausted subject ; stick to the old fiery doge 's natural character , which will bear you out , if properly drawn ; and make the plot as regular as you can . " Sir William Drun*n*ond gave me nearly the same council . How far I have followed these instructions , or whether they have availed me , is not for me to decide . I have had no view to the stage ; in its present state it is , perhaps , not a very exalted object of ambition ; besides , I have been too much behind the scenes to have thought it so at any time . And I can not conceive any man of irritable feeling ptttting himself at the mercies of an audience ; the sneering reader and the loud critic , and the tart review are scattered and distant calamities ; but the trampling of an intelligent or of an ignorant audience on a production , which , be it good or bad , has been a mental labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate orievance , heightened by a man 's doubt of their competency to judge and his certainty of his own imprudence in electing them his judges . Were I capable of writing a play which could be deemed stage-worthy , success would give me no pleasure , and failure great pain . It is for this reason that even during the time of being on* of the committee of one of the theatre : , I never made // the attempt , and never will. * But surely there is dramatic power somewhere , where Joanna Baillie , and M ilman , and John Wilson exist . The " City of the Plague , " and the " Fall of Jerusalem , " are full of the best mater-jet for tragedy that has been seen since Horace Walpole , except passages of Ethwald and de Montfort . It is the fashion to underrate Horace* Walpole ; firstly , because he was a nobleman , and secondly , because he was a gentleman ; but to Aay nothing of the composition of his incomparable letters , and of the Castle of Otranto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of the " Mysterious Mother , " a tragedy of the highest order , and not a puling love-play . He is the father of the first romance , and of the last tragedy in our language , and surely worthy of a higher place , than any living writer , be he who he may . ' While I was in the sub-committee of Drury Lane theatre , I can vouch for my colleagues , and I hope for myself , that we did our best to bring back the legitimate drama . I tried what I could to get De Montfort revived , but in vain ; and equally in vain in favor of Sotheby 's Ivan , which was thought an acting play ; and I endeavored also to wake Mr Coleridge to write a tragedy . Those , who are not in the secret , will hardly believe that the School for Scandal is the play , which has brought least money , averaging the number of times it has been acted , since its production ; so manager Dibdin assured me . Of what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so that I may be traducing , through ignorance , some excellent new writers ; if so , I beg their pardon . I have been absent from England nearly five years , and , till last year , I never read an Eng . lish newspaper since my departure , and am now only a*are of theatrical matters , through the medium of the Parisian Gazette of Galigniani an English newspaper printed in Paris and only for the last twelve months . Let me then deprecate all offence to tragic and comic writers , to whom I wish well , and of whom I know nothing . The long complaints of the actual state of the drama arise , however , from no fault of the performers . I can conceive nothing better than Kemble , Cook , and Kean , in their very different manners , or than Elliston in gentleman 's comedy , and some parts of tragedy . Miss O'Neil I never saw , having made and kept a determination to see nothing , which should divide or disturb my recollection of Siddons ; Siddons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw any thing at all resembling them even in person ; for this reason , we shall never see again Coriolanus or Macbeth . When Kean is blamed for want of dignity , we should remember that it is a grace and not an art , and not to be attained by study . In all not supernatural parts , he is perfect ; even his very defects belong , or seem to belong , to the parts themselves , and appear truer to nature . But of Kemble we may say , with reference to his acting , what the cardinal de Retz said of the Marquis of Montrose , " that he was the only man he ever saw , who remInded him of the heroes of Plutarch .
