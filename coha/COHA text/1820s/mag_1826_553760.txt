txt ART . IV. - Geschichte der Democratic in den Vereinigten Staaten von JV'ord dmerica , von JOHANN GEORG HhLSEMANN . Gottingen. 1823. - The History of Democracy in the United States of North america . By JOHN GEORGE HubSEMANN . THIS work , as far as its historical contents go , is a meagre compilation from Ebeling 's Geography and History of North America . Its object is , to present the most unfavorable picture , which can possibly be borne out by a semblance of facts , of the origin , progress , and present state of the American institutions . hi the earlier periods of our history , for obvious reasons , more impartiality is observed , or rather the libel is in those portions of the work composed with less relish . The author throws in his red pepper as he proceeds ; till at last , not merely the seasoning but the entire composition of his dish , is borrowed from the hottest pages of Turreau , Bristed , Felix Beaujour , and other gentlemen of that cast . The performance is wholly destitute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a reference to the object in view ; for with all the curiosity , with which scandal is almost sure to be read , we would defy Sir Benjamin Backbite himself , to read any one chapter in this work , without a yawn . It possesses none of the sturdy , heart of oak defamation of the Quarterly ; none of Blackwood 's flippant insolence ; none of the romancing calumny of the French libellers ; but is a tame imitation of the Baron Von Fiirstenw*irther and the excellent Messrs Schmidt and Gall . In a word , it is the most narcotic lampoon we ever read . We have been induced to notice it , not for the three or four hundred pages of text , of which it consists , and of which we have now given the character , but for the preface of some fifteen or twenty pages , which introduces it , and is apparently from a different hand . The author of the book purports to be a Mr Hiilsemann , which is , being interpreted , a man of husks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of straw , a fictitious being , fabricated to disguise the real personality of the author . The preface breathes the air of authority ; it does not expressly claim an official origin ; but there is a chancery pomp about it , which no one can mistake . It unquestionably came from the bureau of a minister , and from the pen of a first under secretary ; and some starveling bookseller 's drudge was hired to put the // materials together , to which it is appended . In short , our readers may perhaps be surprised , after the sorry character we have given of this performance , and not more sorry than just , to hear that it is to all appearance a semiofficial emanation of the Austrian cabinet . The only consolation we lay to our souls , under the severity of its maledictions is , that in the opinion of this cabinet , we are no worse off , than the rest of the world ; and that from the same lofty source , from which a libel is here pronounced on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Buda was told , two or three years before , that totus mundus stultizat . In this general fatuity of the human race , and of America in particular , it is a token of grace , that a Metternich and a Gentz remain to rule and counsel the nations . We propose to comment on a few of the propositions contained in this preface , for the sake of showing to the American public , from a source to which probably not many of our fellow citizens would have access , the opinions and principles , which actuate the continental governments of Europe . However absurd these opinions , however false these principles , they acquire a practical importance , when they enter into the springs of the policy of powerful states . The writer of the preface , speaking in the person of the author of the work , says , that his object is not to give a civil history of America , but to direct attention to those events and to the prominent principles in the conduct of individuals , which illustrate the relation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' In other words , as will presently appear , the author designs to show , that there is an essential hostility between the system of Europe and the system of America . To this candid avowal of his object sncceeds a more than candid avowal of the manner in which he shall pursue it . He tells us that he feels the less scruple , in thus avowing his design , as in all historical investigations , he recognises impartiality , as a duty only in reference to facts , but not in reference to principles . For impartiality , as it is called , ' continues he , is everywhere but imaginary , inasmuch as those writers who set themselves up as a standard , which all must follow , assume as an axiom the principle of universal toleration and universal illumination , and consequently contemplate events under the influence of a partiality , resting on their own mode of judging them , if not on external circumstances . ' We have quoted this scarcely intelligible trash , to give our readers a specimen of the court logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat it , we might say , that the writer knows nothing even of the seat of the quality , which he undertakes to define . He confounds impartiality first with veracity and then with probity. lIe admits the duty of impartiality in matters of fact ; in other words he does not hold it lawful to tell downright falsehoods , in writing history ; but he does pot admit the duty of impartiality in matters of principle . We are willing to believe the writer a much better man , than this proposition would lead one to suppose . He means , that he does not think it right , under pretence of being impartial , to be indift*rent on questions of principle . Certainly not ; and what he disclaims as impartiality toward principle , is what decent men , in this part of the world , think it unnecessary to disclaim , it being dishonesty . Impartiality , then , in a historian , is fi'e*dom from that attachment to persons or interests , which leads a writer , by a strong bias , to attribute actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the most favorable to those he likes . It is not a thing of abstraction , it refers not exclusively to actions nor to principles ; but to both as ascribed to men . Perfectly impartial a man of stron0 feelings can not well he ; and all that can be hoped is , that a love of truth as stroug , with a philosophical command of temper , will prevent all respectable historians from going far in attributino* without foundation , to the parties or the men they dislike , corrupt principles or bad deeds . The author of this preface , however , emancipates himself , by his jesuistical logic , from one half of this dtity . He owns that , in matters of fact , he does not see his way quite clear to assert what is false of America ; but as to matters of principle , he may say of us , what he pleases . But we have , on the whole , the charity to believe , that the writer bewildered himself , in his attempt to deal with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for we find him in the next paragraph , in pursuit of an entirely different train of thought ; and as it contains the elements of his political system , we shall quote it almost entire . In the author 's judgment , it is a duty to declare one 's self expressly against that , which one regards as evil ; and toleration , in such a case , so far from being a duty , is at best a weakness . From an European point of view , the prevailing tendency of things in America is hostile , and rests upon principles directly opposed to the entire basis of our civilization . The prevailing tendency in North America is in direct warfare with our religion , and with // our monarchico-aristocratic interests and sentiments ; and for this reason , th' author can regard only as pernicious , whatever rests on a transatlantic basis . It would be a very erroneous inference from this candid confession , to see in it hatred toward North America as such . The champions of the prevailing European policy are content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . So long as it remains beyond the ocean , we regard it only as alien to us . But we must resist it , if it endeavor to force its way into Europe ; and if it present itself in a posture hostile and destructive to our first and dearest interests . No one would take it ill ( to quote the most prominent representative of the prevalent principles of the North American republic ) , should General Lafayette , renouncing France and Europe , seek a new home in America , in order to find beyond the ocean , a political condition , which he has striven in vain to create in Europe . But he and , with him , all those who in France , in Spain , and in Western Europe generally , are known by the name of liberals , and who are all more or less in opposition to the dominant policy of Europe , are justly considered as the enemies of religion , of the state , and of social order ; they are justly denounced , pursued , and punished as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years , to destroy the religious and political institutions , on which European civilization reposes , and to give us up as a prey to general la*vlessness , the consequence of the removal of all authority . With how much precision and with what severity , gov.ernments ought to proceed against these ruinous efforts , must be left to the wisdom of such governments ; and prudence may suggest , in point of fact , a greater or less degree of moderation , according to the circumstances of the case . But it is only in reference to the application of the principle , that the idea of nioderalion can be admitted . The principle itself knows no limit , and can not too sternly be upheld . ' A precious code of political law ! We sometimes hear remarks in this country , by way of censure of a supposed disposition , in the friends of our free institutions , to lavish reproach on the governments and policy of Europe . Many very estimable , very narrowminded , and very ill informed good people are tired of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lhe old world abused ; they think it discourteous toward friendly foreign states ; and they are quite sure , the Europeans do not rail at us , as we do at them . We have translated the foregoing passage for their especial behoof . We translate it from a semiofficial work ; from a source of the first authenticity . It is de // sirable they should know , that those , who govern the destinies of Europe , proclaim that the prevailing tendency in America is directly hostile to the religious and political basis , on which the civilization of Europe rests ; and that it is formally announced , that our great and good Lafayette and all , who with him , bear the honorable name of liberals , deserve to be denounced , pursued , and punished , as enemies of religion , of the state , and of social *order . There is a pleasing and consolatory coincidence in reference to this proud and insolent denunciation , which we will not omit to state . It was made , as appears from the date of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voy .. age of Lafayette to America was projected . What a noble commentary does his voyage and all its accompanying incidents furnish to the paltry malice , with which a price is here set upon his venerable head ! There is one reflection which forces itself upon the mind in this connexion ; that the privileged orders in Europe are indebted to the doctrines of an enlightened liberalism , in other words , are indebted to the lessons of our constitutions , for their preservation . The spirit of the French revolution , that spirit which indeed breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the established interests of Europe , was the growth , not of liberalism , but of despotism . In the political , as well as in the physical world , the violence of the reaction is determined by the violence of the pressure . Govern men by force , and by force they must right themselves . A despotism without law can not be reformed by law . If the people , in the ordinary constitution of the government , are never assembled by their elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representatives of the people should be the safe and pacific organ of reform . Before our example had proved the practicability of free institutions on a large scale , the only expedient for reform was to take the life of the sovereign and his favorites , and kindle a civil war , a remedy generally worse than the disease . Now the nations have found out , that reforms by constitutional law are infinitely more efficacious . Our revolution has taught this , in its successful issue ; as the French revolution , the legitimate consequence of the despotism which had for ages preexisted in France , taught it by contrast and miscarriage . The result has been , that in a state of extreme excitement ; at a moment when all Europe , after the downfall of Bonaparte , was in arms ; and when a solemn promise , at least of the Ger // man sovereigns , authorized their subjects to demand the introduction of representative governments , a promise that has been either in the letter or in the spirit , and sometimes in both , flagitiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em battled nations have laid down their arms ; a whole generation of young men , with Waterloo medals at their buttonholes , have gone peaceably about their business ; and are content to wait the fulness of time . Whether it will ever come , depends upon the sovereigns and governments , who have now to show a discretion , commensurate with the moderation of their subjects . If what this writer asserts be indeed true , that the institutions of America are in deadly hostility to those of Europe , it deserves the consideration of the European governments , wbat will be the result of the comparison , which their subjects will make of their own condition with ours . Permanently concealed from Europe it can not be , that a system of representative republicanism is here in happy operation . Such is now the state of literary communication , the sluiceways of knowledge ( to borrow a phrase from the late Mr Adams ) flow so full and strong , that this fact will soon he known in every cottage south of the Vistula . Mr Hume tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all government is of opinion , since the mass of the people , having the physical force , would not submit to their governors , but from choice . If this be indeed so , and if the contrast of our institutions with the European be so violent as this author states , what hope can there be that the people of Europe will much longer be of opinion , that it is better to be governed by a few exhausted families , than to govern themselves ? It seems to us that there is no hope , and the governors of Europe have , more than any one else , reason to rejoice , that a way is shown them , by which , if they will but adopt it , that change , which must take place , may be brought about , not by bloody revolution , but by constitutional legislation . In the following paragraph of this preface we find the avowal of doctrines , which it becomes the American statesman to remark ; regarding them , as they are , as the suggestions of a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire of Brazil . Theascendancy of the democratic party in America , which has been decisive since the beginning of this century , and which is daily increasing , is not to be deplored by us , chiefly because it annihilates all the hopes , which may have been excited for that // country , by men like Washington and Hamilton . But this ascendancy is especially disastrous for Europe , for the firm support thereby afforded to the cause of revolution . For this very reason , it is highly desirable for us , that , at least in other portions of the New World , institutions should be preserved or established , more nearly , in accord with our own , to serve as a counterpoise to the prevalent policy of North America . This is the point of view , from which we ought to contemplate , what is commonly called the struggle between Europe and America . The liberals in France and the radicals in England are to be considered , in different degrees , the advanced guard of the transatlantic army , and we may regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to force back the van of the enemy , and to carry the war into his own territory . ' In other words , as a happy expedient to prevent the contagion of our institutions from spreading , monarchical institutions are to be preserved or restored in the Spanish American colonies , and the republics of North America are mean time to be the theme of systematic defamation . The first part of this suggestion deserves a moment 's consideration . It comes from the only court ml Europe , except the Spanish and Portuguese , which has a direct family interest in South America ; and it was thus thrown out to the world , at the time that intrigues were going on to establish the United Provinces of la Plata as a monarchy under a French prince ; and to create a member of the Spanish family the emperor of Mexico . Contemporaneously , as is well known , an effort was made , by the Spanish government , to engage the continental alliance , to furnish the force requisite to resubjugate the colonies . France was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Austria was enlisted in virtue of her family connexion with Brazil . Could the means have been found of engaging Russia , and conciliating England , unquestionably a war would have been kindled between the two hemispheres . Happily for the peace of the world , England declared , that such a movemeni should be the signal , with her , for an immediate recognition of the new states ; and the late administration of our own government declared to the world , in the famous message of Mr Monroe , of December , 1823 , that a crusade expressly undertaken against republics would unquestionably attract the consideration of the Congress of the United States of America , as an enterprise threatening us , as well as the immediate objects of it . There is no dQubt , that this united expression of the feelings of the English // and American governments had great efficacy in arresting in its inception the projected movement in Europe . We have thought it worth xvhile , thus to dwell upon the expression of the writer before us , to show that France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preservation and the erection of inonarchical institutions in America had presented themselves , as great objects of policy ; and also that these objects were avowedly pursued , in order to afford a counterbalance to the influence of the United States of America . These facts ought to be borne in mind by the American statesman , who would come to an enlightened conclusion as to the zeal and vigilance , with which we ought to cherish that sympathy between ourselves and our sister republics , for which so solid a foundation exists in nature . The writer proceeds to observe , that the question has often , with propriety , been asked , why the liberals , those malecontents , do not at once renounce OUR continent , to which , by their interests and their character , they have become alien ? ' After ob-* serving that discontent with home has always been the great principle of colonization , and that a great majority of the emigrants to North America , in every period , have gone out from that principle , he sums up with the observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrants , they all agree in the common character of dissatisfaction with the relations existing in the mother country , be that dissatisfaction religious , political , or personal . ' Why do not these malecontents renounce our continent ? ' OUR continent ?  --  but we will let that pass ; because we might not express the feelings which the phrase excites , without falling into a tone too harsh for this place . We will give some reasons , however , why the malecontents do not renounce our continent . ' It is not a very easy process to renounce a continent . An ocean is to be crossed ; a foreign land explored ; and a new settlement made . These are all expensive , and beyond the means of vast numbers , who would gladly renounce our continent . ' Let the writer of this preface read the work of Mr Gall , or that of the Baron Von Fiirstenwiirther , and there behold a picture of the distress incident to renouncing a continent , enough to move the heart of a minister , or his secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this journal a single passage . // At Dusseldorf our author received information , with regard to the unfortunate emigrants , who , three years before , had left Germany for Holland , without any mode of supporting themselves in the Dutch ports , and finding no means of procuring a passage for America , were obliged , under circumstances of the extremest misery , to return , lie says " Many , unwilling to admit the necessity of returning , remain* ed still in the neighborhood of the Dutch cities till the approach of *vinter . At last , violently undeceived , they set out on their return . Half starved , covered with rags filled with vermin , and from the total prostration and wasting of strength scarce able to creep on , they arrived in the neighborhood of Dusseldorf . And yet it was out of the question to afford the most miserable any repose , for it was necessary to hurry them forward , to make room for those that followed . Those , who could not march , were sent on in warons Almost every family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven children , of whom the oldest was scarce twelve years , had become insane at the loss of his wife . I want nothing , ' was his constant cry , in his delirium , I want nothing , but a little bread for my poor children . One loaf , yes , one loaf , I have only earned one ; but the poor worms can not get their fill of that , and leave some for me to eat and be strong enough to work tomorrow for another. - See ! look there ! Three big , big dogs ! See how they eat 0 how they eat their fill ! O God ! God ! let my poor children only eat their fill once ! Shall we go to America ? Oh yes , to America ; there , there is plenty of land-all belongs to God-there I shall have a great , great field  --  and there we 11 raise the corn and potatoes , and eat as much as we want ! * But this is not the worst . Recollecting always the source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a malice as well as an unreasonableness in them , which deserves severe reprehension . Why do not the malecontents leave Europe ? ' Because the governments throw all possible obstacles in the way of their departure . Do they not pursue them with a claim of inalienable allegiance ? Even in England , was it not till two years ago penal , for any man of that class , from which alone most of the emigrants would naturally proceed , the mechanics , to leave his country ? In the German states , an enormous tax , we believe twenty per centum , is levied upon every transfer of real estate , made by an individual , who sells his property // with an intention to emigrate . And yet the official agent of one of these governments very cooly asks why , if the malecontents do not like the country , they do not leave it . With how much justice might the question be retorted . War was carried on in Europe for one generation , for the purpose of seating a single family on the throne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to this family , You are but one family out of nine millions of families of Frenchmen . You are dissatisfied with our actions , you are unwilling to live with us on a footing of equality . You are unwilling to submit to the man whom we prefer as our ruler . Why do you not leave us in peace , and go and live elsewhere ? In this expostulation there would be a world of good sense . And for ourselves , we know not what the hearts of the men are made of , who could consent that their own country and every other country in Europe should be wasted with a thirty years ' war , in order that one of themselves should be placed on a throne , for which sickness ; want of energy , and old age unfitted him . But how the men , who have heen leaders in the great counsels of restoring one family , at an immense cost of happiness and life to all the rest , can seriously call upon the great body of liberal politicians , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not comprehend . The only other topic in this preface of importance is one , that regards the composition of society , in America . The writer infers from the mode in which America was peopled , and from the nature of our institutions , that we are all , as he calls it , of the third estate . What the writer means is true enough ; that we have no clergy , endowed hy the government , and no hereditary nobility , constituting a first and second estate . But why this makes the aggregate of our society the third estate , may not be so clear . If there he neither a first nor a second , we perceive not how there can be a third . There is then hut one estate ; that is , every citizen enjoys an equality of political right , and all the consideration , which his character and standing give him . We should not h*ive been at the pains to rectify our writer 's statement on this subject , did we not apprehend that the practical application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , has not yet fully been felt and made , even in this country . During the period which elapsed hetween the overthrow of the British government in the United States and the establishment of the various systems of government , in the various states of the Union , there was a pretty strong current , in favor of the // proposition , that there is , in the nature of human society a founclation for the threefold divisions of the one , the frw , and the many . If this be taken merely as tfte enunciation of the proposition , that the various functions of government ought not to be collected into the same hands , it is a safe doctrine . But it is known to have had , in the minds of many , a far more extensive application ; and to have led to the adoption of some provisions in most of our forms of government , which may hereafter appear not their most useful parts . On this great topic , we will not now enlarge . We will only state two authorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the principle , which forms the basis of the senatorial representation of Massachusetts , with great vigor , and , as we think , great success ; although some of the arguments , which he presents against that principle , in the French republican constitutions , do not , we own , apply to us . Mr Jefferson has expressed the opinion , that the unlimited negative of the Senate is a defect in the constitution of the United States . We have , however , given more space to this German writer than anything in the nature of his performance requires ; and we leave the effectual refutation of it to time and the steady progress of liberty and truth .
