Greek Ode to the Memory of Lord Byron , with Translation 287-345 /z/ &c.; L WENT to Italy late in the autumn of 1821 , for the benefit of my health . Lord Byron , accompanied by Mr. Rogers as far as Florence , had passed on a few days before me , and was already at Pisa when I arrived . His travelling equipage was rather a singular one , and afforded a strange catalogue for the Dogana : seven servants , five carriages , nine horses , a monkey , a bull-dog and a mastiff , two cats , three pea-fowls and some hens , ( I do not know whether I have classed them in order of rank , ) formed part of his live stock ; these , and all his books , consisting of a very large library of modern /z/ works , ( for he bought all the best that came out , ) together with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Cjesar , " impediments . " I had long formed a wish to see and be acquainted with Lord Byron ; but his known refusal at that time to receive the visits of strangers , even of some who had brought him letters of introduction from the most intimate friend he had , and a prejudice excited against his own countrymen by a late insvdt , would have deterred me from seeking an interview with him , had not the proposal come from himself , in consequence of his hearing Shelley speak of me. 20th November . - " This is the Lung ' Arno : he has hired the Lanfranchi palace for a year . It is one of those marble piles that seem built for eternity , whilst the family whose name it bears no longer exists , " said Shelley , as we entered a hall that seemed built for giants . " I remember the lines in the Inferno , " said I : " a Lanfranchi was one of the persecutors of Ugolino . " " The same , " answered Shelley ; " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room . Fletcher , his valet , is as superstitious as his master , and says the house is haunted , /z/ SO that he can not sleep for rumbhng noises overhead , which he compares to the rolHng of bowls . No wonder ; old Lanfranchi 's ghost is unquiet , and walks at night . " The palace was of such size , that Lord Byron only occupied the first floor ; and at the top of the staircase leading to it was the English bull-dog , whose chain was long enough to guard the door , and prevent the entrance of strangers ; he , however , knew Shelley , growled , and let us pass . In the anti-room we found several servants in livery , and Fletcher , ( whom Shelley mentioned , and of whom I shall have occasion to speak , ) who had been in his service from the time he left Harrow . " Like many old servants , he is a privileged person , " whispered Shelley . " Don Juan had not a better Leporello , for imitating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Metre , and when in Greece remarked upon one of the bas-reliefs of the Parthenon , ' La ! what mantel-pieces these would make , my Lord ! ' " When we were announced , we found his Lordship writing . His reception was frank and kind ; he took me cordially by the hand , and said : " You are a relation and schoolfellow of Shelley 's - we " do not meet as strangers - you must allow me to con- b2 /z/ " tinue my letter on account of the post , Hei'e ' s some " thing for you to read , Shelley , ( giving him part of " his MS. of ' Heaven and Earth ; ' ) tell me what you " think of it . " During the few minutes that Lord Byron was finishing his letter , I took an opportunity of narrowly observing him , and drawing his portrait in my mind. * Thorwaldsen 's bust is too thin-necked and young for Lord Byron . None of the engravings gave me the least idea of him . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards , whilst he was sitting to Bertolini , the Florentine sculptor , for his bust , I had an opportunity of analyzing his featm-es more critically , but found nothing to alter in my portrait . Bertolini 's is an admirable likeness , at least was so in the clay model . I have not seen it since it was copied in marlile , nor have I got a cast ; he promised Bertolini shoiUd send me one . Lord Byron prided himself on his neck ; and it must be confessed that his head was worthy of being placed on it . BertoUni destroyed his ebauches more than once before he could please himself . When he had finished , Lord Byron said , " It is the last time I sit to sculptor or painter . " This was on the 4th of January , 1822. /q/ I saw a man of about five feet seven or eight , apparently forty years of age : as was said of Milton , he barely escaped being short and thick . His face was fine , and the lower part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved and definite outline that distinguishes Grecian beauty . His forehead was high , and his temples broad ; and he had a paleness in his complexion , almost to wanness . His hair , thin and fine , had almost become grey , and waved in natural and graceful curls over his head , that was assimilating itself fast to the " bald first Caesar 's . " He allowed it to grow longer behind than it is accustomed to be worn , and at that time had mustachios , which were not sufficiently dark to be becoming . In criticising his features it might , perhaps , be said that his eyes were placed too near his nose , and that one was rather smaller than the other ; they were of a greyish brown , but of a peculiar clearness , and when animated possessed a fire which seemed to look through and penetrate the thoughts of others , while they marked the inspirations of his own . His teeth were small , regular , and white ; these , I afterwards found , he took great pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a club , perhaps a cloven foot ; but it would have been difficult to have distinguished one from the other , either in size or in form . On the whole , his figure was manly , and his countenance handsome and prepossessing , and very expressive ; and the famihar ease of his conversation soon made me perfectly at home in his society . Our first interview was marked with a cordiality and confidence that flattered while it delighted me ; and I felt anxious for the next day , in order that I might repeat my visit . When I called on his Lordship at two o'clock , he had just left his bed-room , and was at breakfast , if it can be called one . It consisted of a cup of strong green tea , without milk or sugar , and an egg , of which he ate the yolk raw . I observed the abstemiousness of his meal . " My digestion is weak ; I am too bilious , " said he , " to " eat more than once a-day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was forced to put a napkin between them . /q/ ' bles . To be sure , I drink two bottles of wine at dinner , ' but they form only a vegetable diet . Just now I live on * claret and soda-water . You are just come from Geneva , ' Shelley tells me . I passed the best part of the summer ' of 1816 at the Campagna Diodati , and was very nearly ' passing this last there . I went so far as to write to ' Hentsh the banker ; but Shelley , when he came to visit ' me at Ravenna , gave me such a flattering account of ' Pisa that I changed my mind . Then it is troublesome ' to travel so far with so much live and dead stock as I do ; ' and I do n't like to leave behind me any of my pets that ' have been accumulating since I came on the Continent. * ' One can not trust to strangers to take care of them . You ' will see at the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me that they are almost as bad fellow-travellers as the monkey f , which I will shew you . " * He says afterwards in " Don Juan , " canto X , stanza 50 : " He had a kind of inclination , or Weakness , for what most people deem mere vermin , Live animals . " f He afterwards bought another monkey in Pisa , in the street , because he saw it Ul-used. /z/ Here he led the way to a room , where , after playing with and caressing the creature for some time , he proposed a game of billiards . I brought the conversation back on Switzerland and his travels , and asked him if he had been in Germany ? " No , " said he , " not even at Trieste . I hate despot " ism and the Goths too much . I have travelled little " on the Continent , at least never gone out of my way . " This is partly owing to the indolence of my disposition , " partly owing to my incumbrances . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting Naples , but was at that time anxious " to get back to Venice . But Paestum can not surpass the " ruins of Agrigentum , which I saw by moonlight ; nor " Naples , Constantinople . You have no conception of " the beauty of the twelve islands where the Turks have " their country-houses , or of the blue Symplegades " against which the Bosphorus beats with such resistless " violence . " Switzerland is a country I have been satisfied with " seeing once ; Turkey I could live in for ever . I never " forget my predilections . I was in a wretched state of /z/ * ' health , and worse spirits , when I was at Geneva ; but " quiet and the lake , physicians better than Polidori , soon " set me up . I never led so moral a life as during my " residence in that country ; but I gained no credit by " it . Where there is a mortification , there ought to be " reward . On the contrary , there is no story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . I was watched by " glasses on the opposite side of the Lake , and by glasses " too that must have had very distorted optics . I was " waylaid in my evening di'ives - I was accused of cor " rupting all the grisettes in the Rue Basse . I believe " that they looked upon me as a man-monster , worse " than the piqueur . " Somebody possessed Madame de Stael with an opinion " of my immorality . I used occasionally to visit her at " Coppet ; and once she invited me to a family-dinner , " and I found the room full of strangers , who had come " to stare at me as at some outlandish beast in a raree " show . One of the ladies fainted , and the rest looked " as if his Satanic Majesty had been among them . Ma " dame de Stael took the liberty to read me a lecture " before this crowd ; to which I only made her a low " bow . /z/ " I kneM very few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have a great respect for Sismondi . " I was forced to return the civilities of one of their Pro " fessors by asking him , and an old gentleman , a friend " of Gi-ay 's , to dine with me . I had gone out to sail * ' early in the morning , and the wind prevented me from " returning in time for dinner . I understand that I ofFend " ed them mortally . Polidori did the honours . " Among our countrymen I made no new acquaintances ; * ' Shelley , Monk Lewis , and Hobhouse were almost the " only English people I saw . No wonder ; I shewed a " distaste for society at that time , and went little among " the Genevese ; besides , I could not speak French . " What is become of my boatman and boat ? I suppose " she is rotten ; she was never worth much . When I " went the tour of the Lake in her with Shelley and " Hobhouse , she was nearly wrecked near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of being " drowned . It would have been classical to have been " lost there , but not so agreeable . Shelley was on the " Lake much oftener than I , at all hours of the night and " day : he almost lived on it ; his great rage is a boat . " We are both building now at Genoa , 1 a yacht , and " he an open boat . " L O R D B Y R O N. jg We played at billiards till the carriage was announced , and I accompanied him in his drive . Soon after we got off the stones , we mounted our horses , which were waiting for us . Lord Byron is an admirable horseman , combining grace with the security of his seat . He prides himself much on this exercise . He conducted us for some miles till we came to a farm-house , where he practises pistol-firing every evening . This is his favourite amusement , and may indeed be called almost a pursuit . He always has pistols in his holster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London carried by his courier . We had each twelve rounds of ammunition , and in a diameter of four inches he put eleven out of twelve shots . I observed his hand shook exceedingly . He said that when he first began at Manton 's he was the worst shot in the world , and Manton was perhaps the best . The subject turned upon duelling , and he contended for its necessity , and quoted some strong arguments in favour of it . " I have been concerned , " said he , " in many duels as " second , but only in two as principal ; one was with " Hobhouse before I became intimate with him . The " best marksmen at a target are not the surest in the " field . Cecil 's and Stackpoole 's affair proved this . They c 2 /z/ " fought after a quarrel of three years , during which they " were practising daily . Stackpoole was so good a shot " that he used to cut off the heads of the fowls for dinner " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every " wish to kill his antagonist , but he received his death- " blow from Cecil , who fired rather fine , or rather was the " quickest shot of the two . All he said when falling was , " ' D n it , have I missed him ? ' Shelley is a much " better shot than I am , but he is thinking of metaphysics " rather than of firing . " I understand that Lord Byron is always in better spirits after having culped ( as he calls it ) the targe often , or hit a five-franc piece , the counterpart of which is always given to the farmer , who is making a little fortune . All the pieces struck , Lord Byron keeps to put , as he says , in his museum . We now continued our ride , and returned to Pisa by the Lucca gate . " Pisa with its hanging tower and Sophia-like dome re " minds me , " said Lord Byron , " of an eastern place . " /z/ He then remarked the heavy smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance a vale of mist , through which the golden clouds of evening appeared . " It is fine , " said Lord Byron , " but no sunsets are to be " compared with those of Venice . They are too gorgeous " for any painter , and defy any poet . My rides , indeed , " would have been nothing without the Venetian sunsets . " Ask Shelley . " " Stand on the marble bridge , " said Shelley , " cast your eye , if you are not dazzled , on its river glowing as with fire , then follow the graceful curve of the palaces on the Lung ' Arno till the arch is naved by the massy dungeontower ( erroneously called Ugolino 's ) , forming in dark relief , and tell me if any thing can surpass a sunset at Pisa . " The history of one , is that of almost every day . It is impossible to conceive a more unvaried life than Lord Byron led at this period . I continued to visit him at the same hour daily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals till it was time to take our evening drive , ride , and pistol-practice . On our return , which was al- /z/ ways in the same direction , we frequently met the Countess GuiccioH , with whom he stopped to converse a few minutes . He dined at half an hour after sunset , ( at twenty-four o'clock ) ; then drove to Covmt Gamba 's , the Countess Guiccioli 's father , passed several hours in her society , returned to his palace , and either read or wrote till two or three in the morning ; occasionally drinking spirits diluted with water as a medicine , from a dread of a nephritic complaint , to which he was , or fancied himself , subject . Such was his life at Pisa . The Countess Guiccioli is twenty-three years of age , though she appears no more than seventeen or eighteen . Unlike most of the Italian women , her complexion is delicately fair . Her eyes , large , dark , and languishing , are shaded by the longest eyelashes in the world ; and her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her falling shoulders in a profusion of natural ringlets of the darkest auburn . Her figure is , perhaps , too much embonpoint for her height , but her bust is perfect ; her features want little of possessing a Grecian regularity of outline ; and she has the most beautiful mouth and teeth imaginable . It is im- /z/ possible to see without admiring - to hear the GuiccioU speak without being fascinated . Her amiabihty and gentleness shew themselves in every intonation of her voice , which , and the music of her perfect Italian , give a peculiar charm to every thing she utters . Grace and elegance seem component parts of her nature . Notwithstanding that she adores Lord Byion , it is evident that the exile and poverty of her aged father sometimes affect her spirits , and throw a shade of melancholy on her countenance , which adds to the deep interest this lovely girl creates . " Extraordinary pains , " said Lord Byron one day , " were " taken with the education of Teresa . Her conversation is " lively , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read all the best authors of her own and the French " language . She often conceals what she knows , from the " fear of being thought to know too much ; possibly because " she knows I am not fond of blues . To use an expression " of Jeffrey 's , ' If she has blue stockings , she contrives that " her petticoat shall hide them . ' " Lord Byron is certainly very much attached to her , without being actually in love . His description of the /z/ Georgioni in the Manfrini palace at Venice is meant for the Countess . The beautiful sonnet prefixed to the Prophecy of Dante was addressed to her ; and I can not resist copying some stanzas written when he was about to quit Venice to join her at Ravenna , which will describe the state of his feelings at that time . " River* that rollest by the ancient wails ' &#9632; Wliere dwells the lady of my love , when she " Walks by the brink , and there perchance recalls " A faint and fleeting memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream shoiUd be " A miiTor of my heart , where she may read " The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee , " Wild as thy wave , and headlong as thy speed ? " What do I say - a mirror of my heart ? " Are not thy waters sweeping , dark and strong ? " Such as my feelings were and are , thou art ; " And such as thou art , were my passions long . * The Po. /q/ " Time may have somewhat tamed them , not for ever ; " Thou overflow'st thy banks , and not for aye ; " Thy bosom overboils , congenial river ! " Thy floods subside ; and mine have sunk away - " But left long wrecks behind them , and again " Borne on oui- old unchanged career , we move ; " Thou tendest wildly onward to the main , " And I to loving one I should not love . " The current I behold will sweep beneath " Her native walls , and murmur at her feet ; " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The twilight air , unharm 'd by summer 's heat . " She will look on thee ; I have look 'd on thee , " Fidl of that thought , and fi-om that moment ne'er " Thy waters could I dream of , name or see , " Without the inseparable sigh for her . " Her bright eyes will be imaged in thy stream ; " Yes , they will meet the wave I gaze on now : " Mine can not witness , even in a dream , " That happy wave repass me in its flow . /z/ " The wave that bears my tears returns no more : " Will she return by whom that wave shall sweep ? " Both tread thy banks , both wander on thy shore ; " I near thy source , she by the dark-blue deep . " But that which keepeth us apart is not " Distance , nor depth of wave , nor space of earth , " But the distraction of a various lot , " As various as the climates of our birth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bora far beyond the mountains , but his blood " Is aU meridian , as if never fann 'd " By the bleak wind that chills the polar flood . My blood is all meridian ; were it not , " I had not left my clime ; - I shall not be , " In spite of tortures ne'er to be forgot , " A slave again of love , at least of thee . " ' T is vain to struggle - let me perish young - " Live as I lived , and love as I have loved : " To dust if I return , from dust I sprung , " And then at least my heart can ne'er be moved . " /q/ Calling on Lord Byron one evening after the opera , we happened to talk of Cavalieri Serventi , and Italian women ; and he contended that much was to be said in excuse for them , and in defence of the system . " We will put out of the question , " said he , " a Cavalier " Serventecism ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women get all the money they can , and have " ( as is the case in all such contracts ) no love to give in " exchange . - I speak of another , and of a different service . " " Do you know how a girl is brought up here ? " continued he . " Almost from infancy she is deprived of the en " dearments of home , and shut up in a convent till she has " attained a marriageable or marketable age . The father " now looks out for a suitable son-in-law . As a certain " portion of his fortune is fixed by law for the dower of " his children , his object is to find some needy man of " equal rank , or a very rich one , the older the better , who " will consent to take his daughter off his hands , under the " market price . This , if she happen to be handsome , is " not difficult of accomplishment . Objections are seldom " made on the part of the young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects of the intended , who perhaps visits /z/ " her once in the parlour as a matter of form or curiosity . " She is too happy to get her hberty on any terms , and he " her money or her person . There is no love on either " side . What happiness is to be expected , or constancy , " from such a liaison ? Is it not natural , that in her inter " course with a world , of which she knows and has seen no " thing , and unrestrained mistress of her own time and ac " tions , she should find somebody to like better , and who " likes her better , than her husband ? The Count Guiccioli , " for instance , who is the richest man in Romagna , was sixty " when he married Teresa ; she sixteen . From the first they " had separate apartments , and she always used to call him " Sir . What could be expected from such a preposterous " connexion ? For some time she was an Angiolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man ; but young women , " and your Italian ones too , are not satisfied with your " good old men . Love is not the same dull , cold , calculat " ing feeling here as in the North . It is the business , the " serious occupation of their lives ; it is a want , a neces " sity . Somebody properly defines a woman , ' a creature " that loves . ' They die of love ; particularly the Romans : " they begin to love earlier , and feel the passion later than " the Northern people . When I was at Venice , two down " /q/ gers of sixty made love to me. - But to return to the " Guiecioli . The old Count did not object to her availing " herself of the privileges of her country ; an Italian would " have reconciled him to the thing : indeed for some time " he winked at our intimacy , but at length made an excep " tion against me , as a foreigner , a heretic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , a liberal . " He insisted - the Guiecioli was as obstinate ; her family " took her part . Catholics can not get divorces . But , to " the scandal of all Romagna , the matter was at length " referred to the Pope , who ordered her a separate main " tenance , on condition that she should reside under her " father 's roof All this was not agreeable , and at length I " was forced to smuggle her out of Ravenna , having dis " closed a plot laid with the sanction of the Legate for " shutting her up in a convent for life , which she narrowly " escaped . - Except Greece , I was never so attached to any " place in my life as to Ravenna , and but for the failure of " the Constitutionalists and this fracas , should probably " never have left it . The peasantry are the best people " in the world , and the beauty of their women is extraor " dinary . Those at Tivoli and Frescati , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse creatures , compared to ' the Romagnese . You may talk of your English women , ' and it is true that out of one hundred Italians and Ens ; - ' lish you will find thirty of the latter handsome ; but then ' there will be one Italian on the other side of the scale , &#9632; who will more than balance the deficit in numbers - one ' who , like the Florence Venus , has no rival , and can have ' none in the North . I have learnt more from the pea ' santry of the countries I have travelled in than from ' any other source , especially from the women : they are ' more intelligent , as well as communicative , than the ' men . I found also at Ravenna much education and ' liberality of thinking among the higher classes . The ' climate is delightful . I was unbroken in upon by ' society . It lies out of the way of travellers . I was ' never tired of my rides in the pine-forest : it breathes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesca Female hearts are such a genial soil For kinder feeling , whatsoe'er their nation .

" There is something inspiring in such an au ' . * " The people liked me , as much as they hated the " Government . It is not a little to say , I was popular " with all the leaders of the Constitutional party . They " knew that I came from a land of liberty , and wished well " to their cause . I would have espoused it too , and as- * The following lines wiU shew the attachment Lord Byron had to the tranquil life he led at Ravenna : " Sweet hour of twilight , in the solitude " Of the pine forest and the silent shore " Which bounds Ravenna 's immemorial wood , " Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow 'd o'er " To where the last Caesarean fortress stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Dryden 's lay made haunted ground to me , " How have I loved the twUight hour and thee !

I did not , " however , take part in their intrigues , nor join in their poh " tical coteries ; but I had a magazine of one hundred stand " of arms in the house , when every thing was ripe for " revolt . A curse on Carignan 's imbecihty ! I could have " pardoned him that too , if he had not impeached his " partisans .

" They knew that this must eventually drive me out of the " country . I did not follow them immediately ; I was not " to be bullied . I had myself fallen under the eye of the " Government . If they could have got sufficient proof , " they would have arrested me : but no one betrayed me ; " indeed there was nothing to betray . I had received " a very high degree , without passing through the inter " mediate ranks . In that corner you see papers of one of " their societies . Shortly after the plot was discovered , I " received several anonymous letters , advising me to dis " continue my forest rides ; but I entertained no apprehen " sions of treachery , and was more on horseback than ever . /q/ " I never stir out without being well armed , and sleep " with pistols . They knew that I never missed my aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time " at Ravenna that made a deep impression on me ; I " alluded to it in ' Don Juan/ The military Commandant " of the place , who , though suspected of being secretly " a Carbonaro , was too powerful a man to be arrested , was " assassinated opposite to my palace ; a spot perhaps " selected by choice for the commission of the crime . " The measures which were adopted to screen the mur " derer prove the assassination to have taken place by " order of the police . I had my foot in the stirrup at my ' ' ' usual hour of exercise , when my horse started at the report of a gun . On looking up I perceived a man " throw down a carbine and run away at full speed , and " another stretched upon the pavement a few yards from " me . On hastening towards him , I found that it was the " unhappy Commandant . A crowd was soon collected , but " no one ventured to offer the least assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bleeding body and " carry it into my palace ; but it was represented to me " that by so doing I should confirm the suspicion of being " of his party , and incur the displeasure of the Government . " However , it was no time to calculate between huma- /z/ " nity and danger . I assisted in bearing him into the " house , and putting him on a bed . He was ah-eady dead " from several wounds ; he appeared to have breathed his * ' last without a struggle . I never saw a countenance so " calm . His adjutant followed the corpse into the house . " I remember his lamentation over him : - ' Povero diavolo ! " non aveva fatto male , anche ad un cane . ' " " I am sorry , " said he , " not to have a copy of my " Memoirs to shew you ; I gave them to Moore , or rather " to Moore 's little boy , at Venice . I remember saying , " ' Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made one " reservation in the gift , - that they were not to be j ) ublish " ed till after my death . " I have not the least objection to their being circulated ; " in fact they have been read by some of mine , and several " of Moore 's friends and acquamtances ; among others , " they were lent to Lady Burghersh . On returning the " MS. her Ladyship told Moore that she had transcribed " the whole work . This was un pen for , and he suggest " ed the propriety of her destroying the copy . She did " so , by putting it into the fire in his presence . Ever " since this happened , Douglas Kinnaird has been recom " /q/ mending me to resume possession of the MS. , thinking " to frighten me by saying that a spurious or a real copy , " surreptitiously obtained , may go forth to the world .

The second " part will prove a good lesson to young men ; for it treats " of the irregular life I led at one period , and the fatal " consequences of dissipation . There are few parts that * ' may not , and none that will not , be read by women . " Another time he said : - " A very full account of my marriage and separation is " contained in my Memoirs . After they were completed , " I wrote to Lady Byron , proposing to send them for her " inspection , in order that any mistatements or inaccuracy " ( if any such existed , which I was not aware of , ) might be " pointed out and corrected . In her answer she declined " the offer , without assigning any reason ; but desiring , if " not on her account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might never appear , and finishing with a threat . " My reply was the severest thing I ever wrote , and con " tained two quotations , one from Shakspeare , and ano " ther from Dante. * I told her that she knew all I had " written was incontrovertible truth , and that she did not " wish to sanction the truth . I ended by saying , that she " might depend on their being published . It was not till " after this correspondence that I made Moore the depo " sitary of the MS . " The first time of my seeing Miss Millbank was at " Lady s . It was a fatal day ; and I remember ' * that in going upstairs I stumbled , and remarked to " Moore , who accompanied me , that it was a bad omen . " I ought to have taken the warning .

Her figure was perfect for her height , and " there was a simplicity , a retired modesty about her , " which was very characteristic , and formed a happy con " trast to the cold artificial formality , and studied stiffness , " which is called fashion .

" It had been predicted by Mrs. Williams , that twenty " seven was to be a dangerous age for me . The fortune " telling witch was right ; it was destined to prove so . I /z/ " shall never forget the 2d of January ! Lady Byron " ( Byrn , he pronounced it ) was the only unconcerned per " son present ; Lady Noel , her mother , cried ; I trembled " like a leaf , made the wrong responses , and after the cere " mony called her Miss Millbank .

She " had spirit enough to have done so , and would properly " have resented the affront . " Our honeymoon was not all sunshine ; it had its " clouds : and Hobhouse has some letters which would " serve to explain the rise and fall in the barometer , - but " it was never down at zero .

" We had a house in town , gave dinner-parties , had " separate carriages , and launched into every sort of " extravagance . This could not last long . My wife 's " 10,000/. soon melted away . I was beset by duns , and at " length an execution was levied , and the bailiffs put in " possession of the very beds we had to sleep on . This * ' was no very agreeable state of affairs , no very pleasant " scene for Lady Byron to witness ; and it was agreed she " should pay her father a visit till the storm had blown " over , and some arrangements had been made with my " creditors .

" In my reply I disclaimed his authority as a parent ' over my wife , and told him I was convinced the senti ' ments expressed were his , not hers . Another post , however , brought me a confirmation ( under her own ' hand and seal ) of her father 's sentence .

" I have prejudices about women : I do not like to see " them eat . Rousseau makes Julie un peu gounnajide ; " but that is not at all according to my taste . I do not " like to be interrupted when I am writing . Lady Byron /z/ " did not attend to these whims of mine . The only harsh " thing I ever remember saying to her was one evening " shortly before our parting . I was standing before the " fire , ruminating upon the embarrassment of my affairs , " and other annoyances , when Lady Byron came up to " me and said , ' Byron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied , ' damnably ! ' I was afterwards sorry , and " reproached myself for the expression : but it escaped " me unconsciously - involuntarily ; I hardly knew what " I said . " I heard afterwards that Mrs. Charlment had been the " means of poisoning Lady Noel 's mind against me ; - that " she had employed herself and others in watching me in " London , and had reported having traced me into a house " in Portland-place . There was one act of which I might " justly have complained , and which was unworthy of any " one but such a confidante : I allude to the breaking open " my writing-desk . A book was found in it that did not " do much credit to my taste in literature , and some letters " from a married woman with whom I had been intimate ' * before my marriage .

The " gravest accusation that has been made against me is that " of having intrigued with Mrs. Mardyn in my own house ; " introduced her to my own table , &c.; There never was " a more unfounded calumny . Being on the Committee " of Drury-lane Theatre , I have no doubt that several " actresses called on me : but as to Mrs. Mardyn , who was " a beautiful woman , and might have been a dangerous " visitress , I was scarcely acquainted ( to speak ) with her . " I might even make a more serious charge against " than employing spies to watch suspected amours , * /z/ " I had been shut up in a dark street in London , writing " ( I think he said ) ' The Siege of Corinth , ' and had refused " myself to every one till it was finished .

But Dr. Bailey could not conscientiously make me out a certificate for Bedlam ; and perhaps the Lawyer gave a more favourable report to his employers . The Doctor said afterwards , he had been told that I always looked down when Lady Byron bent her eyes on me , and exhibited other symptoms equally infallible , particularly those that marked the late King 's case so strongly . I do not , however , tax Lady Byron with this transaction ; probably she was not privy to it . She was the tool of others . Her mother always detested me ; she had not even the decency to conceal it in her own house . Dining one day at Sir Ralph 's , ( who was a good sort of man , and of whom you may form some idea , when I tell you that a leg of mutton was always served at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , ) I broke a tooth , and was in great pain , which I could not avoid shewing . ' It will do you good , ' said Lady Noel ; ' I am glad of it ! ' I gave her a look ! " You ask if Lady Byron were ever in love with me - " I have answered that question already - No ! I was the " fashion when she first came out : I had the character of " being a great rake , and was a great dandy - both of which " young ladies like . She married me from vanity and the /z/ " hope of reforming and fixing me . She was a spoiled child , " and naturally of a jealous disposition ; and this was in " creased by the infernal machinations of those in her con " fidence .

She had the habit of drawing people 's " characters after she had seen them once or twice . She " wrote pages on pages about my character , but it was as " vinlike as possible . " Lady Byron had good ideas , but could never express " them ; wrote poetry too , but it was only good by accident . " Her letters were always enigmatical , often unintelligible . " She was governed by what she called fixed rules and " principles , squared mathematically. * She would have " made an excellent wrangler at Cambridge .

I need not tell you of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when our se " paration was made public .

I remember a few : " Nero , Apicius , Epicurus , Caligula , Heliogabalus , Henry " the Eighth , and lastly the . All my former friends , " even my cousin , George Byron , who had been brought up " with me , and whom I loved as a brother , took my wife 's " part . He followed the stream when it was strongest " against me , and can never expect any thing from me : he " shall never touch a sixpence of mine . I was looked upon " as the worst of husbands , the most abandoned and " wicked of men , and my wife as a suffering angel - an " incarnation of all the virtues and perfections of the sex . " I was abused in the public prints , made the common talk " of private companies , hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted in the streets , afraid to go to the theatre , " whence the unfortunate Mrs. Mardyn had been driven " with insult . The Examiner was the only paper that /z/ " dared say a word in my defence , and Lady Jersey the " only person in the fashionable world that did not look " upon me as a monster . " I once addressed some lines to her that made her my " friend ever after . The subject of them was suggested " by her being excluded from a certain cabinet of the " beauties of the day . I have the lines somewhere , and " will shew them to you . " In addition to all these mortifications my affairs were " irretrievably involved , and almost so as to make me what " they wished . I was compelled to part with Newstead , " which I never could have ventured to sell in my mo " ther 's life-time .

It so happened that " three married women were on a wedding visit to my " wife , ( and in the same room , at the same time , ) whom " I had known to be all birds of the same nest . Fancy " the scene of confusion that ensued ! " I have seen a great deal of Italian society , and swvmi " in a gondola , but nothing could equal the profligacy of " high life in England , especially that of when I " knew it . " There was a lady at that time , double my own age , " the mother of several children who were perfect angels , " with whom I had formed a liaison that continued without " interruption for eight months . The autumn of a beauty " like her 's is preferable to the spring in others . She told " me she was never in love till she was thirty ; and I " thought myself so with her , when she was forty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " equal ardour . I was as fond of , indeed more attached " than I ought to have been , to one who had bestowed her " favours on many ; but I was flattered at a preference that i2 /z/ had led her to discard another , who in personal attractions and fiishion was far my superior . She had been sacrificed , almost before she was a woman , to one whose mind and body were equally contemptible in the scale of creation ; and on whom she bestowed a numerous family , to which the law gave him the right to be called father . Strange as it may seem , she gained ( as all women do ) an influence over me so strong , that I had great difficulty in breaking with her , even when I knew she had been inconstant to me ; and once was on the point of going abroad with her , - and narrowly escaped this folly . I was at this time a mere Bond-street lounger - a great man at lobbies , coffee , and gambling house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounging and boxing - not to mention drinking ! If I had known you in early life , you would not have been alive now . I remember Scroope Davies , H ; and myself , clubbing 19/. , all we had in our pockets , and losing it at a hell in St. James's-street , at chicken-hazard , which may be called foul ; and afterwards getting drunk together till H. and S. D. quarrelled . Scroope afterwards wrote to me for my pistols to shoot himself ; but I declined lending them , on the plea that they would be forfeited as a deodand . I knew my answer would have more effect than four sides of prosing. /q/ " Do n't suppose , however , that I took any pleasure in " all these excesses , or that parson A.K. or W - were asso " ciates to my taste .

Every thing in a Venetian life , - its gondolas , " its effeminating indolence , its Siroccos , - tend to ener " vate the mind and body . My rides were a resource and " a stimulus ; but the deep sands of Lido broke my horses " down , and I got tired of that monotonous sea-shore ; - to " be sure , I passed the Villagiatura on the Brenta. * * To give the reader an idea of the stories cii'culated and believed about Lord Byron , I will state one as a specimen of the rest , which I heard the other day : - " Lord Byron , who is an execrably bad horseman , was riding one evening in the Brenta , spouting ' Metastasio . ' A Venetian , passing in a close carriage at the time , laughed at his bad Italian ; vipon which his Lordship horsewhipped him , and threw a card in at the window . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lord Byron was an excellent horseman , never read a line of ' Metastasio , ' /q/ " I wrote little at Venice , and was forced into the search " of pleasure , - an employment I was soon jaded with the " pursuit of . " Women were there , as they have ever been fated to " be , my bane . Like Napoleon , I have always had a great " contempt for women ; and formed this opinion of them " not hastily , but from my own fatal experience . My " writings , indeed , tend to exalt the sex ; and my imagina " tion has always delighted in giving them a beau idSal " likeness , but I only di " ew them as a painter or statuary " would do , - as they should be. * Perhaps my prejudices , " and keeping them at a distance , contributed to prevent " the illusion from altogether being worn out and destroy " ed as to their celestial qualities . and pronounced Italian like a native .

The /might-service of " the Continent , with or without the A ; , is perhaps a sla " very as bad , or worse , than either . An intrigue with " a married woman at home , though more secret , is " equally difficult to break . I had no tie of any kind at " Venice , yet I was not without my annoyances . You " may remember seeing the portrait of a female which " Murray got engraved , and dubbed my ' Fornarina . ' " Harlowe , the poor fellow who died soon after his " return from Rome , and who used to copy pictures from " memory , took my likeness when he was at Venice : and " one day this frail one , who was a casual acquaintance of " mine , happened to be at my palace , and to be seen by " the painter , who was struck with her , and begged she /z/ " might sit to him . She did so , and I sent the drawing home " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ; " for the jade was handsome , though the most troublesome " shrew and termagant I ever met with . To give you an " idea of the lady , she used to call me the Gra7i Cane della " Madonna . When once she obtained a footing inside my " door , she took a dislike to the outside of it , and I had " great difficulty in uncolonizing her . She forced her way " back one day when I was at dinner , and snatching a knife " from the table , oflfered to stab herself if I did not consent " to her stay . Seeing I took no notice of her threat , " as knowing it to be only a feint , she ran into the balcony " and threw herself into the canal . As it was only knee " deep and there were plenty of gondolas , one of them " picked her up . This affair made a great noise at the " time . Some said that I had thrown her into the water , " others that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the real story . " I got into nearly as great a scrape by making my court " to a spinster . As many Dowagers as you please at Ve " nice , but beware of flirting with Raggazzas . I had been " one night under her window serenading , and the next " morning who should be announced at the same time but /z/ " a priest and a police officer , come , as I thought , either to " shoot or marry me again , - I did not care which . I was " disgusted and tired with the life I led at Venice , and was " glad to turn my back on it . The Austrian Government , " too , partly contributed to drive me away . They inter " cepted my books and papers , opened my letters , and " proscribed my works .

" It is difficult to judge , from the contradictory nature of his writings , what the rehgious opinions of Lord Byron really were . Perhaps the conversations I held with him may throw some light upon a subject that can not fail to excite curiosity . On the whole , I am inclined to think that if he were occasionally sceptical , and thought it , as he says , " A pleasant voyage , perhaps , to float , " Like Pyrrho , on a sea of speculation , " * /z/ yet his wavering never amounted to a disbelief in the divine Founder of Christianity . " I always took great delight , " observed he , " in the * ' English Cathedral service . It can not fail to inspire " every man , who feels at all , with devotion . Notwith " standing which , Christianity is not the best source of in " spiration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " direct profession of faith . Metaphysics open a vast field ; " Nature , and anti-Mosaical speculations on the origin of " the world , a wide range , and sources of poetry that are " shut out by Christianity . " I advanced Tasso and Milton . " Tasso and Milton , " rephed he , " wrote on Christian " subjects , it is true ; but how did they treat them ? The " ' Jerusalem Delivered ' deals little in Christian doctrines , " and the ' Paradise Lost ' makes use of the heathen my " thology , which is surely scarcely allowable . Milton dis " carded papacy , and adopted no creed in its room ; he " never attended divine worship . /z/ " His great epics , that nobody reads , prove nothing . ' He took his text fiom the Old and New Testaments . ' He shocks the severe apprehensions of the Cathohcs , as ' he did those of the Divines of his day , by too great a ' familiarity with Heaven , and the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , by making the ' Devil his hero , and deifying the daemons . " He certainly excites compassion for Satan , and en ' deavours to make him out an injured personage - he gives ' him human passions too , makes him pity Adam and Eve , ' and justify himself much as Prometheus does . Yet ' Milton was never blamed for all this . I should be very ' curious to know what his real belief was. * The ' Paradise ' Lost ' and ' Regained ' do not satisfy me on this point . ' One might as well say that Moore is a fire- worshipper , ' or a follower of Mokanna , because he chose those sub ' jects from the East ; or that I am a Cainist . " Another time he said : * A religious work of Milton 's has since been discovered , and will throw light on this interesting subject . /q/ " One mode of worship yields to another ; no rehgion " has lasted more than two thousand years . Out of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred millions are Christians . Query , - What is " to become of the six hundred millions that do not be " lieve , and of those incalculable millions that lived before " Christ ? " People at home are mad about Missionary Societies , ' and missions to the East . I have been applied to , to ' subscribe , several times since , and once before I left Eng ' land . I'he Catholic priests have been labouring hard for ' nearly a century ; but what have they done ? Out of ' eighty millions of Hindoos , how many proselytes have ' been made ? Sir J. Malcolm said at Murray 's before ' several persons , that the Padres , as he called them , had ' only made six converts at Bombay during his time , and ' that even this black little flock forsook their shepherds ' when the rum was out . Their faith evaporated with the ' fumes of the arrack . Besides , the Hindoos beheve that ' they have had nine incarnations : the Missionaries ' preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' despise , have had one . It is nine to one against them , ' by their own shewing. /z/ " Another doctrine can never be in repute among the " Solomons of the East . It can not be easy to persuade men " who have had as many wives as they pleased , to be con " tent with one ; besides , a woman is old at twenty in that " country . What are men to do ? They are not all St. " Anthonies. - I will tell you a story . A certain Signior " ' Antonio of my acquaintance married a very little round " fat wife , very fond of waltzing , who went by the name of " the Tentazione di Sant ' Antonio .

The sect of Anything-arians sounds well , " does it not ? " Calling on him the next day , we found him , as was sometimes the case , silent , dull , and sombre . At length he said : - /z/ " Here is a little book somebody has sent me about " Christianity , that has made me very uncomfortable : the " reasoning seems to me very strong , the proofs are very " staggering .

It is not a matter of volition to un " believe . Who likes to own that he has been a fool all " his life , - to unlearn all that he has been taught ip his " youth ? or can think that some of the best men that ever " lived have been fools ? I have often wished I had been " born a Catholic . That purgatory of theirs is a comfort " able doctrine ; I wonder the reformers gave it up , or did " not substitute something as consolatory in its room . It " is an improvement on the transmigration , Shelley , which " all your wiseacre philosophers taught . " You believe in Plato 's three principles ; - why not in " the Trinity ?

I know , " however , that I am considered an infidel . My wife and " sister , when they joined parties , sent me prayer-books . " There was a Mr , Mulock , who went about the Conti " nent preaching orthodoxy in politics and religion , a " writer of bad sonnets , and a lecturer in worse prose , - " he tried to convert me to some new sect of Chris " tianity . He was a great anti-materialist , and abused " Locke . " On another occasion he said : " I am always getting new correspondents . Here are three letters just ari'ived , from strangers all of them .

Hear what she says : " ' I can not longer exist without acknowledging the " tvmiultuous and agonizing delight with which my soul " burns at the glowing beauties of yovn-s . ' " A third is of a very different character from the last ; " it is from a Mr. Sheppard , inclosing a prayer made for " my welfare by his wife a few days before her death . The " letter states that he has had the misfortune to lose this " amiable woman , who had seen me at Ramsgate , many " years ago , rambUng among the cliffs ; that she had been " impressed with a sense of my irreligion from the tenor of " my works , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her last moments .

" January . " A circumstance took place in Greece that impressed " &#9632; itself lastingly on my memory . I had once thought " of founding a tale on it ; but the subject is too har " rowing for any nerves , - too terrible for any pen !

Her crime ( if crime it be to love as they loved ) " was too fully proved ; they were torn from each other 's " arms , never to meet again : and yet both might have /z/ " escaped , - she by abjuring her religion , or he by adopt- " ing hers .

" One of the principal incidents in ' The Giaour ' is de " rived from a real occurrence , and one too in which I " myself was nearly and deeply interested ; but an unwill " ingness to have it considered a traveller 's tale made me " suppress the fact of its genuineness . The Marquis of " Sligo , who knew the particulars of the story , reminded " me of them in England , and wondered I had not authen " ticated them in the Preface : - " When I was at Athens , there was an edict in force " similar to that of Ali 's , except that the mode of punish " ment was different . It was necessary , therefore , that " all love-affairs should be carried on with the greatest " privacy .

We had not met for several " days , and all my thoughts were occupied in planning an " assignation , when , as ill fate would have it , the means I " took to effect it led to the discovery of our secret . The " penalty was death , - death without reprieve , - a horrible " death , at which one can not think without shuddering ! " An order was issued for the law being put into immediate " effect . In the mean time I knew nothing of what had " happened , and it was determined that I should be kept " in ignorance of the whole affair till it was too late to in " terfere . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sentence . I was taking one of my " usual evening rides by the sea-side , when I observed " a crowd of people moving down to the shore , and " the arms of the soldiers glittering among them . They " were not so far off , but that I thought I could now and " then distinguish a faint and stifled shriek . My curio " sity was forcibly excited , and I dispatched one of my fol " lowers to enquire the cause of the procession . What was /z/ " my horror to learn that they were carrying an unfortu " nate girl , sewn up in a sack , to be thrown into the sea ! " I did not hesitate as to what was to be done . I knew I " could depend on my faithful Albanians , and rode up " to the officer commanding the party , threatening , in case " of his refusal to give up his prisoner , that I would adopt " means to compel him . He did not like the business he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body " guard , and consented to accompany me back to the city " with the girl , whom I soon discovered to be my Turkish " favourite . Suffice it to say , that my interference with " the chief magistrate , backed by a heavy bribe , saved " her ; but it was only on condition that I should " break off all intercourse with her , and that she should " immediately quit Athens , and be sent to her friends in " Thebes . There she died , a few days after her arrival , of " a fever - perhaps of love . " " The severest fever I ever had was at Patras . I had left " Fletcher at Constantinople - convalescent , but unable to " move from weakness , and had no attendants but my " Albanians , to whom I owe ray life . /q/ " They were devotedly attached to me , and watched me " day and night .

They are " not people to make idle threats , and would have carried " them into execution had any thing happened to me . " You may imagine the fright the poor devil of a Doctor " was in ; and I could not help smiling at the ludicrous " way in which his fears shewed themselves . I believe he " was more pleased at my recovery than either my faithful " nurses , or myself I had no intention of dying at that " time ; but if I had died , the same story would have been " told of me as was related to have happened to Colonel " Sherbrooke in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest , a friend of mine declared that he saw me " in St. James 's Street ; and somebody put my name down " in the book at the Palace , as having enquired after the " King 's health . /z/ " Every body would have said that my ghost had ap " peared .

" I mean to " return to Greece , and shall in all probability die there . " Little did I think , at the time he was pronouncing these words , that they were prophetic !

One need have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the employment not " over pleasant , and not a little dangerous , what with " Irish authors and pretty poetesses . Five hundred plays " were offered to the Theatre during the year I was Lite " rary Manager . You may conceive that it was no small /q/ " task to read all this trash , and to satisfy the bards that " it was so . " When I first entered upon theatrical affairs , I had " some idea of writing for the house myself , but soon " became a convert to Pope 's opinion on that subject . " Who would condescend to the drudgery of the stage , " and enslave himself to the humours , the caprices , the " taste or tastelessness , of the age ? Besides , one must " write for particular actors , have them continually in one 's " eye , sacrifice character to the personating of it , cringe to " some favourite of the public , neither give him too many " nor two few lines to spout , think how he would mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a passion , " strut such and such a scene . Who , I say , would sub " mit to all this ? Shakspeare had many advantages : he " was an actor by profession , and knew all the tricks of the " trade . Yet he had but little fame in his day : see what " Jonson and his contemporaries said of him . Besides , how " few of what are called Shakspeare 's plays are exclusively " so ! - and how , at this distance of time , and lost as so " many works of that period are , can we separate what " really is from what is not his own ? /z/ " The players retrenched , transposed , and even altered the text , to suit the audience or please themselves . Who knows how much rust they rubbed off ? I am sure there is rust and base metal to spare left in the old plays . When Leigh Hunt comes we shall have battles enough about those old ruffioni , the old dramatists , with their tiresome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . It is but lately that people have been satisfied that Shakspeare was not a god , nor stood alone in the age in which he lived ; and yet how few of the plays , even of that boasted time , have survived , and fewer still are now acted ! Let us count them . Only one of Massinger 's ( New Way to pay Old Debts ) , one of Ford 's , * one of Ben Jonson 's , * and half-a-dozen of Shakspeare 's ; and of these last , ' The Two Gentlemen of Verona ' and ' The Tempest ' have been turned into operas . You can not call that having a theatre . Now that Kemble has left the stage , who will endure Coriolanus ? Lady Macbeth died with Mrs. Siddons , and Polonius will with Munden . Shakspeare 's Comedies are quite out of date ; many of them are insufferable to read , much more to see . They are gross food , only fit for an English or German palate ; * Of which I have forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the French and Itahans , the " pohtest people in the world . One can hardly find ten " lines together without some gross violation of taste or " decency . What do you think of Bottom in the " ' Midsummer Night 's Dream ? ' or of Troilus ' and Cres " sida 's passion ? " Here I could not help interrupting him by saying , " You have named the two plays that , with all their faults , contain , perhaps , some of the finest poetry . " " Yes , " said he , " in ' Troilus and Cressida : ' " ' Prophet may you be ! " If I be false , or swerve a hair from truth . " When Time is old , and hath forgot itself , " When water-di'ops have worn the stones of Troy , " And bUnd Oblivion swallow 'd cities up , " And mighty states characterless are grated " To dusty nothing , - yet let memory " From false to false , among false maids in love , " Upbraid my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false " As air , as water , wind , or sandy earth , " As fox to lamb , as wolf to heifer 's calf , " Pard to the hind , or stepdame to her son ; /z/ " Yea , let them say , to stick the heart of falseliood - " As false as Cressid ! ' " These lines he pronounced with great emphasis and effect , and continued : " But what has poetry to do with a play , or in a play ? " Thei-e is not one passage in Alfieri strictly poetical ; " hardly one in Racine . " Here he handed me a prospectus of a new translation of Shakspeare into French prose , and read part of the first scene in ' The Tempest , ' laughing inwardly , as he was used to do ; and afterwards produced a passage from Chateaubriand , contending that we have no theatre . " The French very properly ridicule our bringing in " ' enfant au premier acte , barbon an dernier .

Does he ever deviate from the /q/ " rules prescribed by the ancients , from the classical sim " plicity of the old models ? It is very difficult , almost " impossible , to write any thing to please a modern au " dience . I was instrumental in getting up ' Bertram , ' and " it was said that I wrote part of it myself . That was not " the case . I knew Maturin to be a needy man , and in " terested myself in his success : but its life was very " feeble and ricketty . I once thought of getting Joanna " Baillie 's * De Montfort ' revived ; but the winding-up was " faulty . She was herself aware of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet , after all , it failed . She must have " been dreadfully annoyed , even more than Lady was . " When it was bringing out , I was applied to , to write a " prologue ; but as the request did not come from Kean , " who was to speak it , I declined . There are fine things " in all the Plays on the Passions : an idea in ' De Montfort ' " struck me particularly ; one of the characters said that " he knew the footsteps of another. * * " De Montfort. - ' T is Rezenvelt : I heard his well-known foot !

' All the dra " matic beauty would be lost in translation - the nominative " cases would kill it . Nothing provokes me so much as " the squeamishness that excludes the exhibition of many " such subjects from the stage ; - a squeamishness , the pro " duce , as I firmly believe , of a lower tone of the moral " sense , and foreign to the majestic and confident virtue of " the golden age of our country . All is now cant - me " thodistical cant . Shame flies from the heart , and takes " refuge in the lips ; or , our senses and nerves are much a more refined than those of our neighbours .

It " is a play , - not a poem , like ' Remorse ' and ' Fazio ; ' and " the best proof of its merit is , that people are continually " quoting it . What may not be expected from such a " beginning ? " The Germans are colder and more phlegmatic than " we are , and bear even to see ' Werner . ' " To write any thing to please , at the present day , is " the despair of authors . " It was easy to be perceived that during this tirade upon the stage , and against Shakspeare , he was smarting under the ill-reception ' Marino Faliero ' had met with , and indignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty . This , however , was not the only occasion of his abusing the old dramatists. /z/ Some days after I revived the subject of the drama , and led him into speaking of his own plays . " I have just got a letter , " said he , " from Murray . What /z/ ' do you think he has enclosed me ? A long dull extract ' from that long dull Latin epic of Petrarch 's , Africa , which ' he has the modesty to ask me to translate for Ugo Fos- ' colo , who is Avriting some Memoirs of Petrarch , and has got Moore , Lady Dacre , &c.; to contribute to . What ' am I to do with the death of Mago ? I wish to God , Med- ' win , you would take it home with you , and translate it ; ' and I will send it to Murray . We will say nothing about ' its being yours , or mine ; and it will be curious to hear ' Foscolo 's opinion upon it . Depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " In the course of the day I turned it into couplets , ( and lame enough they were , ) which he forwarded by the next courier to England . Almost by return of post arrived a furiously complimentary epistle in acknowledgment , which made us laugh very heartily . " There are three good lines , " said Lord Byron , " in " Mago 's speech , which may be thus translated : * Ugo Foscolo afterwards took them for his motto . /q/ " ' Yet , thing of dust ! " Man strives to climb the earth in his ambition , " TUl death , the monitor that flatters not , " Points to the grave where all his hopes are laid . ' " " What do you think of Ada ? " said he , looking earnestly at his daughter 's miniature , that hung by the side of his writing-table . " They tell me she is like me - but she has " her mother 's eyes . " It is very odd that ray mother was an only child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife is an only child ; and Ada is an " only child . It is a singular coincidence ; that is the least " that can be said of it . I ca n't help thinking it was des " tined to be so ; and perhaps it is best . I was once anxious " for a sor : but , after our separation , was glad to have had " a daughter ; for it would have distressed me too much to " have taken him away from Lady Byron , and I could not " have trusted her with a son 's education . I have no idea " of boys being brought up by mothers . I suflPered too " much from that myself : and then , wandering about the " world as I do , I could not take proper care of a child ; " otherwise I should not have left Allegra , poor little /z/ " thing ! * at Ravenna . She has been a great resource to me , " though I am not so fond of her as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes equal - there will be enough " for them both . I have desired in my will that Allegra " shall not marry an Englishman . The Irish and Scotch " make better husbands than we do . You w ill think it was " an odd fancy , but I was not in the best of humours with " my countrymen at that moment - you know the reason . " I am told that Ada is a little termagant ; I hope not . I " shall write to my sister to know if this is the case : per " haps I am wrong in letting Lady Byron have entirely " her own way in her education . I hear that my name is " not mentioned in her presence ; that a green curtain is " always kept over my portrait , as over something forbid " den ; and that she is not to know that she has a father , " till she comes of age .

I might " claim her of the Chancellor , without having recourse to " either one or the other . But I had rather be unhappy " myself , than make her mother so ; probably I shall never " see her again . " Here he opened his writing-desk , and shewed me some hair , w hich he told me was his child 's . During our drive and ride this evening , he declined our usual amusement of pistol-firing , without assigning a cause . He hardly spoke a word during the first half-hour , and it was evident that something weighed heavily on his mind . There was a sacredness in his melancholy that 1 dared not interrupt . At length he said : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " piest day of my life : as it is ! " He stopped , seemingly ashamed of hang betrayed his feelings . He tried in vain to rally his spirits by turning the conversation ; but he created a laugh in which he could not join , and soon relapsed into his former reverie . It lasted till we came within a mile of the Argive gate . There our silence was all at once interrupted by shrieks that seemed to proceed /z/ from a cottage by the side of the road . We pulled up our horses , to enquire of a contadino standing at the little garden-wicket . He told us that a widow had just lost her only child , and that the sounds proceeded from the wailings of some women over the corpse . Lord Byron was much affected ; and his superstition , acted upon by a sadness that seemed to be presentiment , led him to augur some disaster . " I shall not be happy , " said he , " till I hear that my " daughter is well . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at , who have never kept a " register of them . I always write to my sister on Ada 's " birthday . I did so last year ; and , what was very remark " able , my letter reached her on my wedding-day , and her " answer reached me at Ravenna on my birthday ! Several " extraordinary things have happened to me on my birth " day ; so they did to Napoleon ; and a more wonderful " circumstance still occurred to Marie Antoinette . " The next morning 's courier brought him a letter from England . He gave it me as I entered , and said : " I was convinced something very unj ) leasant hung over /q/ " me last night : I expected to hear that somebody I knew " was dead ; - so it turns out ! Poor Polidori is gone ! " When he was my physician , he was always talking of " Prussic acid , oil of amber , blowing into veins , suffocating * ' by charcoal , and compounding poisons ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , for he has pre " scribed a dose for himself that would have killed fifty " Miltiades ' , - a dose whose effect , Murray says , was so " instantaneous that he went off without a spasm or strug " gle . It seems that disappointment was the cause of this " rash act . He had entertained too sanguine hopes of " literary fame , owing to the success of his ' Vampyre , ' " which , in consequence of its being attributed to me , was " got up as a melo-drame at Paris . The foundation of the " story was mine ; but I was forced to disown the publica " tion , lest the world should suppose that I had vanity " enough , or was egotist enough , to write in that ridiculous " manner about myself . * Notwithstanding which , the " French editions still persevere in including it with my " works . My real ' Vampyre ' I gave at the end of ' Ma- /z/ " zeppa , ' something- in the same way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monk Lewis , and Shelley and his " wife , were present . The latter sketched on that occa " sion the outline of her Pygmalion story , ' The Modern " Prometheus , ' the making of a man ( which a lady Avho had " read it afterwards asked Sir Humphrey Davy , to his " great astonishment , if he could do , and was told a story " something like Alonzo and Imogene ) ; and Shelley hini " self , or ' The Snake , ' ( as he used sometimes to call him , ) " conjured up some frightful woman of an acquaintance of " his at home , a kind of Medusa , who was suspected of " having eyes in her breasts . " Perhaps Polidori had strictly no right to appropriate " my story to himself ; but it was hardly worth it : and " when my letter , disclaiming the narrative part , was writ " ten , I dismissed the matter from my memory . It was " Polidori 's own fault that we did not agree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon get attached to people ; and " was more sorry still for the scrape he afterwards got " into at Milan . He quarrelled with one of the guards " at the Scala , and was ordered to leave the Lombard " States twenty-four hours after ; which put an end to all " his Continental schemes , that I had forwarded by re " /q/ commending him to Lord ; and it is difficult for a " young physician to get into practice at home , however " clever , particularly a foreigner , or one with a foreigner 's " name . From that time , instead of making out pre " scriptions , he took to writing romances ; a very unprofit " able and fatal exchange , as it turned out . /z/ " I told you I was not oppressed in spirits last night " without a reason .

Have you ever " had your fortune told ? Mrs. Williams told mine . She " predicted that twenty-seven and thirty-seven were to be " dangerous ages in my life . * One has come true .

" " I doii't think these two last very likely ; but it was " part of her prediction . But there are lucky and un- " lucky days , as well as years and numbers too .

" And another on his sending me the congratulations of the " season , which ended in some foohsh way like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Let us , prithee , have none of the day ! " I think I can give no stronger proof of the sociabihty of Lord Byron 's disposition , than the festivity that presided over his dinners . Wednesday being one of his fixed days : " You will " dine with me , " said he , " though it is the 2d January . " His own table , when alone , was frugal , not to say abstemious /q/ * ; but on the occasion of these meetings every sort of wine , every luxury of the season , and Enghsh dehcacy , were displayed . I never knew any man do the honours of his house with greater kindness and hospitality . On this eventful anniversary he was not , however , in his usual spirits , and evidently tried to drown the remembrance of the day by a levity that was forced and unnatural ; - for it was clear , in spite of all his efforts , that something oppressed him , and he could not help continually recurring to the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he gave with evident pleasure , and we all drank in bump- * His dinner , when alone , cost five Pauls ; and thinking he was overcharged , he gave his bills to a lady of my acquaintance to examine. !

" f He ordered the remnants to be given away , lest his servants ( as he said ) should envy him every mouthful he eats . o 2 /z/ ers . The conversation turning on his separation , the probabiUty of their being reconciled was canvassed . " What ! " said he , " after having lost the five best years " of our hves ? - Never ! But , " added he , " it was no " fault of mine that we quarrelled . I have made advances " enough . I had once an idea that people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the passions " has subsided , - but that hope is all over with me ! " Writing to a friend the day after our party , I finished my letter with the following remark : " Notwithstanding the tone of raillery with which he sometimes speaks in ' Don Juan ' of his separation from Lady Byron , and his saying , as he did to-day , that the only thing he thanks Lady Byron for is , that he can not marry , &c.,; it is evident that it is the thorn in his side - the poison in his cup of life ! The veil is easily seen through . He endeavours to mask his griefs , and to fill up the void of his heart , by assuming a gaiety that does not belong to it . All the tender and endearing ties of social and domestic life rudely torn asunder , he has been wandering on from place to place , without finding any to rest in . Switzerland , /q/ Venice , Ravenna , and I might even have added Tuscany , were doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed himself and all his servants in deep mourning . He did not wait for me to enquire the cause . " I have just heard , " said he , " of Lady Noel 's death . " I am distressed for poor Lady Byron ! She must be in " great affliction , for she adored her mother ! The world " will think I am pleased at this event , but they are much " mistaken . I never wished for an accession of fortune ; " I have enough without the Wentworth property . I have " written a letter of condolence to Lady Byron , - you may " suppose in the kindest terms , - beginning , ' My dear " Lady Byron , " ' If we are not reconciled , it is not my fault ! ' ' " I shall be dehghted , " I said , " to see you restored to her and to your country ; which , notwithstanding all you say and write against it , I am sure you like . Do you remember a sentiment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves not his country , can love nothing . ' /z/ " I am becoming more weaned from it every day , " said he after a pause , " and have had enough to wean me " from it ! - No ! Lady Byron will not make it up with " me now , lest the world should say that her mother " only was to blame ! Lady Noel certainly identifies " herself very strongly in the quarrel , even by the ac " count of her last injunctions ; for she directs in her " will that my portrait , shut up in a case by her orders , " shall not be opened till her grand-daughter be of " age , and then not given to her if Lady Byron should " be alive . " I might have claimed all the fortune for my life , " if I had chosen to have done so ; but have agreed to " leave the division of it to Lord Dacre and Sir Francis " Burdett . The whole management of the affair is con " fided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any " suggestion or objection , if they award Lady Byron the " whole . " I asked him how he became entitled ? " The late Lord Wentworth , " said he , " bequeathed a " life interest in his Lancashire estates to Lady Byron 's LORD BYRON . Ill " mother , and afterwards to her daughter : that is the way " I clami . " Some time after , when the equal partition had been settled , he said : " I have offered Lady Byron the family mansion in " addition to the award , but she has declined it : this is " not kind . " The conversation turned after dinner on the lyrical poetry of the day , and a question arose as to which was the most perfect ode that had been produced . Shelley contended for Coleridge 's on Switzerland , beginning , " Ye clouds , " &c.; ; others named some of Moore 's Irish Melodies , and Campbell 's Hohenlinden ; and , had Lord Byron not been present , his own Invocation to Manfred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been cited . " Like Gray , " said he , " Campbell smells too much of the " oil : he is never satisfied with what he does ; his finest " things have been spoiled by over-polish - the sharpness " of the outline is worn off . Like paintings , poems may /z/ " be too highly finished . The great art is effect , no matter " how produced . " I will shew you an ode you have never seen , that I " consider little inferior to the best which the present pro " lific age has brought forth . " With this he left the table , almost before the cloth was removed , and returned with a magazine , from which he read the following lines on Sir John Moore 's burial , which perhaps require no apology for finding a place here : " Not a diuiii was heard , nor a funeral note , " As his corse to the ramparts we hurried ; " Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot " O'er the grave where our hero we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , " The sods with our bayonets turning , - " By the struggUng moonbeam 's misty Ught , " And the lantei'n dimly burning . " No useless coffin confined his breast , " Nor in sheet nor in shroud we bound him " But he lay Ukc a warrior taking his rest , " With his martial cloak around him . /q/ " Few and short were the prayers we said , " And we spoke not a word of sorrow ; " But we stedfastly gazed on the face of the dead , " And we bitterly thought of the moiTow . " We thought , as we heap 'd his narrow bed , " And smooth 'd down his lonely pillow , " That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head , " And we far away on the billow ! " Lightly they ' 11 talk of the spirit that ' s gone , " And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him ; " But nothing he ' 11 reck , if they let him sleep on " In the grave where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heavy task was done , " When the clock told the hour for retiring ; " And we heard by the distant and random gun , " That the foe was suddenly firing , " Slowly and sadly we laid him down , From the field of his fame fresh and goiy ; " We carved not a line , we raised not a stone , " But we left him alone with his glory . " /z/ The feeling with which he recited these admirable stanzas , I shall never forget . After he had come to an end , he repeated the third , and said it was perfect , particularly the lines " But he lay like a warrior taking his rest , * ' With his martial cloak around him . " " I should have taken , " said Shelley , " the whole for a rough sketch of Campbell 's . " " No , " replied Lord Byron : " Campbell would have " claimed it , if it had been his . " I afterwards had reason to think that the ode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at none of his own being mentioned ; and , after he had praised the verses so highly , could not own them . No other reason can be assigned for his not acknowledging himself the author , particularly as he was a great admirer of General Moore . Talking after dinner of swimming , he said : - /q/ " Murray published a letter I wrote to him from Venice , " which might have seemed an idle display of vanity ; " but the object of my writing it was to contradict what " Turner had asserted about the impossibihty of crossing " the Hellespont from the Abydos to the Sestos side , in " consequence of the tide . One is as easy as the other ; we did both . " Here he turned round to Fletcher , to whom he occasionally referred , and said , " Fletcher , how far was it Mr. Ekenhead " and I swam ? " Fletcher replied , " Three miles and a half , my Lord . " ( Of course he did not diminish the distance . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron , " is not much above a mile ; but the current is prodigiously " strong , and we were carried down notwithstanding all " our efforts . I do nt know how Leander contrived to " stem the stream , and steer straight across ; but nothing is " impossible in love or religion . If I had had a Hero on " the other side , perhaps I should have worked harder . " We were to have undertaken this feat some time before , " but put it off in consequence of the coldness of the water ; " and it was chilly enough when we performed it . I know I " should have made a bad Leander , for it gave me an ague " that 1 did not so easily get rid of There were some p 2 /z/ " sailors in the fleet who swam further than I did - I do " not say than I could have done , for it is the only exer " cise I pride myself upon , being almost amphibious . " I remember being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in making the land , - the wind " blowing olf the shore , and the tide setting out . Crowds of " people were collected on the beach to see us . Mr. - - " ( I think he said Hobhouse ) was with me ; and , " he added , " I had great difficulty in saving him - he nearly drowned me . " When I was at Venice , there was an Italian who knew " no more of swinmiing than a camel , but he had heard of " my prowess in the Dardanelles , and challenged me . Not " wishing that any foreigner at least should beat me at my " own arms , I consented to engage in the contest . Alex " ander Scott proposed to be of the party , and we started " from Lido . Our land-lubber was very soon in the rear , " and Scott saw him make for a Gondola . He rested him " self first against one , and then against another , and gave " in before we got half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more of him , but continued our course through the " Grand Canal , landing at my palace-stairs . The water of " the Lagunes is didl , and not very clear or agreeable to /q/ " bathe in . I can keep myself up for hours in the sea : I " delight in it , and come out with a buoyancy of spirits I " never feel on any other occasion . " If I believed in the transmigration of your Hindoos , " I should think I had been a Merman in some former state " of existence , or was going to be turned into one in the next . " When I published ' Marino Faliero ' I had not the most " distant view to the stage . My object in choosing that " historical subject was to record one of the most remark " able incidents in the annals of the Venetian Republic , " embodying it in what I considered the most interesting " form - dialogue , and giving my work the accompaniments " of scenery and manners studied on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a woman , become a traitor " to his country , and conspire to massacre all his fellow " nobles , and that the young Foscari should have a sickly " affection for his native city , were no inventions of mine . I " painted the men as I found them , as they were , - not as " the critics would have them . I took the stories as they " were handed down ; and if human nature is not the same ' ' in one country as it is in others , am I to blame ? - can I /z/ " help it ? But no painting , however highly coloured , " can give an idea of the intensity of a Venetian 's affection " for his native city . Shelley , I remember , draws a very " beautiful picture of the tranquil pleasures of Venice in a " poem* which he has not published , and in which he does " not make me cut a good figure . It describes an evening " we passed together . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marino Faliero ' and ' The Two Foscari ' dramajs , /z/ The lines to which Lord Byron referred are these : If I had been an unconnected man , " I from this moment should have form 'd the plan " Never to leave fair Venice - for to me " It was delight to ride by the lone sea ; " And then the town is silent - one may write " Or read in gondolas by day or night . " Having the little brazen lamp alight , " Unseen , uninterrupted : books are there , " Pictures , and casts from all those statues fair " Which were twin-born with poetry , - and all " We seek in towns , with little to recall " Regrets for the green country . I might sit " In Maddalo 's great palace , " &c.; Julian and Muiklalu. /q/ " historic poems , or any thing , in short , but tragedies or " plays . In the first place , I was ill-used in the extreme " by the Doge being brought on the stage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3500 lines : * a good acting " play should not exceed 1500 or 1800 ; and , conformably " with my plan , the materials could not have been com " pressed into so confined a space . " I remember Hogg the Ettrick Shepherd telling me , ' many years ago , that I should never be able to condense ' my powers of writing sufficiently for the stage , and ' that the fault of all my plays would be their being too long for actine . The remark occurred to me when I ' was about ' Marino Fahero ; ' but I thought it unnecessary ' to try and contradict his prediction , as I did not study ' stage-effect , and meant it solely for the closet . So much ' was I averse from its being acted , that , the moment I ' heard of the intention of the Managers , I applied for an ' injunction ; but the Chancellor refused to interfere , or ' issue an order for suspending the representation .

What audience will listen " with any patience to a mere tirade of poetry , which stops " the march of the actor ? No wonder , then , that the " unhappy Doge should have been damned ! But it was no " very pleasant news for me ; and the letter containing it " was accompanied by another , to inform me that an old " lady , from whom I had great expectations , was likely to " live to an hundred .

" No event in ancient times ever struck me as njore " noble and dramatic than the death of Demosthenes . " You remember his last words to Archias ? - But sub " jects are not wanting . " * He seemed to think somewhat differently afterwards , when , after the review in ' The Quarterly ' of his plays , he wi'ote to me , saying , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Lord Byron , that I had had a letter from Procter* , and that he had been jeered on ' The Duke of Mirandola not having been included in his ( Lord B. 's ) enumeration of the dramatic pieces of the day ; and that he added , he had been at Harrow with him . " Ay , " said Lord Byron , " I remember the name : he " was in the lower school , in such a class . They stood " Farrer , Procter , Jocelyn . " I have no doubt Lord Byron could have gone through all the names , such was his memory . He immediately sat down , and very good-naturedly gave me the following note to send to Barry Cornwall , which shews that the arguments of the Reviewers had not changed his Unitarian opinions , ( as he called them ) : " Had I been aware of your tragedy when I wrote my " note to ' Marino Faliero , ' although it is a matter of no " consequence to you , I should certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other writers who " still do honour to the drama . * Barry Cornwall . /q/ " My own notions on the subject altogether are so dif " ferent from the popular ideas of the day , that we differ " essentially , as indeed I do from our whole English lite " rati , upon that topic . But I do not contend that I am " right - I merely say that such is my opinion ; and as it " is a solitary one , it can do no great harm . But it does " not prevent me from doing justice to the powers of those " who adopt a different system , " I introduced the subject of Cain : - " When I was a boy , " said he , " I studied German , " which I have now entirely forgotten . It was very little " I ever knew of it . Abel was one of the first books my " German master read to me ; and whilst he was crying " his eyes out over its pages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed a crime in ridding " the world of so dull a fellow as Gessner made brother " Abel . " I alwavs thought Cain a fine subject , and when I took " it up I determined to treat it strictly after the Mosaic " account . I therefore made the snake a snake , and took a " Bishop for my interpreter . /z/ " I had once an idea of following the Arminian Scrip " tures , and making Cain 's crime proceed from jealousy , " and love of his uterine sister ; but , though a more pro " bable cause of dispute , I abandoned it as unorthodox . " One mistake crept in , - Abel 's should have been made the first sacrifice : and it is singular that the first form of religious worship should have induced the first murder . " Hobhouse has denounced ' Cain ' as irreligious , and has " penned me a most furious epistle , urging me not to " publish it , as I value my reputation or his friendship . He " contends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " have put my name to in the days of Pope , Chvu'chill , " and Johnson , ( a curious trio ! ) Hobhovise used to write " good verses once himself , but he seems to have forgotten " what poetry is in others , when he says my ' Cain ' reminds " him of the worst bombast of Dryden 's . Shelley , who is " no bad judge of the compositions of others , however " he may fail in procuring success for his own , is most " sensitive and indignant at this critique , and says ( what " is not the case ) that ' Cain ' is the finest thing I ever " wrote , calls it worthy of Milton , and backs it ag ? : nst " Hobhouse 's poetical Trinity . /q/ " The Snakes rage has prevented my crest from rising . " I shall write Hobhouse a very unimpassioned letter , but " a firm one . The publication shall go on , whether Mur " ray refuses to print it or not .

" I hardly know what to make of all the contradictory " opinions that have been sent me this week . Moore says , " that more people are shocked with the blasphemy of the " sentiments , than delighted with the beauty of the lines . " Another person thinks the Devil 's arguments irresistible , " or irrefutable . says that the Liberals like it , but " that the Ultraists are making a terrible outcry ; and that " the he and him not being in capitals , in full dress " uniform , shocks the High-church and Court party . Some " call me an Atheist , others a Manichsean , - a very bad and " a hard-sounding name , that shocks the illiterati the more " because they do n't know what it means .

" They ought to be grateful to him for giving them a sub " ject to write about . What would they do without evil in " the Prince of Evil ? Othello 's occupation would be gone . " I have made Lucifer say no more in his defence than was " absolutely necessary , - not half so much as Milton makes " his Satan do . I was forced to keep up his dramatic " character . Au reste , I have adhered closely to the Old " Testament , and I defy any one to question my moral . " Johnson , who would have been glad of an opportunity " of throwing another stone at Milton , redeems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasphemy into " the mouths of his infernal spirits . By what rule , then , am " I to have all the blame ? What would the INIethodists at " home say to Goethe 's ' Faust ' ? His devil not only talks " very familiarly of Heaven , but very familiarly in Heaven . " What would they think of the colloquies of Mephisto " pheles and his pupil , or the more daring language of the " prologue , which no one will ever venture to translate ? " And yet this play is not only tolerated and admired , as " every thing he wrote must be , but acted , in Germany . /z/ " And are the Germans a less moral people than we are ? " I doubt it much . Faust itself is not so fine a subject " as Cain . It is a grand mystery . The mark that was " put upon Cain is a subhme and shadowy act : Goethe " would have made more of it than I have done * .

If ' Cain ' he blas " phemous , ' Paradise Lost ' is blasphemous ; and the words of the " Oxford gentleman , ' Evil , be thou my good , ' are from that very " poem , from the mouth of Satan , - and is there any thing more " in that of Lucifer , in the Mystery ? ' Cain ' is nothing more than " a drama , not a piece of argument .

' I am very fond of a private theatre , " said he . " 1 " remember myself and some friends at Cambridge getting " up a play ; and that reminds me of a thing which hap " pened , that was very provoking in itself , but very hu " morous in its consequences . " On the day of representation , one of the performers " took it into his head to make an excuse , and his part was " obliged to be read . Hobhouse came forward to apolo- " gize to the audience , and told them that a Mr. had " declined to perform his part , &c.; The gentleman was " highly indignant at the ' o , ' and had a great inclination to " pick a quarrel with Scroope Davies , who replied , that he " supposed Mr. wanted to be called the Mr. so and so . " He ever after went by the name of the ' Definite Article . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sujjpose we " were to get up a play . My hall , which is the largest in " Tuscany , would make a capital theatre ; and we may send " to Florence for an audience , if we can not fill it here . " And as to decorations , nothing is easier in any part of /z/ " Italy than to get them : besides that , Wilhams will assist " us . " It was accordingly agreed that we should commence with " Othello . " Lord Byron was to be lago . Orders were to be given for the fitting up of the stage , preparing the dresses , &c.,; and rehearsals of a few scenes took place , lerhaps Lord Byron would have made the finest actor in the world . His voice had a flexibility , a variety in its tones , a power and pathos beyond any I ever heard ; and his countenance was capable of expressing the tenderest , as well as the strongest emotions . I shall never forget his reading lago 's part in the handkerchief scene . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finished , " in making Othello 's jealousy turn upon that circum " stance. * The handkerchief is the strongest proof of * Calderon says , in the Cisma di : f Inglaterra , ( I have not the original , ) " She gave nie , too , a handkerchief , - a spell - " A flattering pledge , my hopes to animate - " An astrologic favour - fatal prize " That told too true what tears must weop these eyes ! " /z/ " love , not only among the Moors , but all Eastern nations : " and yet they say that the plot of ' Marino Faliero ' hangs " upon too slight a cause . " All at once a difficulty arose about a Desdeniona , and the Guiccioli put her Veto on our theatricals . The influence of the Countess over Lord Byron reminded me of a remark of Fletcher 's , that Shelley once repeated to me as having overheard : - " That it was strange every woman should be able to manage his Lordship , but her Ladyship /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Dowton , who hated Kean , used to say that his Othello reminded him of Obi , or Three - fingered Jack , - not Othello . But , whatever his Othello might have been , Garrick himself never surpassed him in Ligo . I am told that Kean is not so great a favourite with the public since his return from America , and that party strengthened against him in his absence . I gtiess he could not have staid long enough to be spoiled ; though I calculate no actor is improved by their stage . How do you reckon ? /z/ " Kean began by acting Richard the Third when quite a " boy , and gave all the promise of what he afterwards " became . His Sir Giles Overreach was a wonderful per " formance . The actresses were afraid of him ; and he " was afterwards so much exhausted himself , that he fell " into fits . This , 1 am told , was the case with Miss " O'Neil. * " Kemble did much towards the reform of our stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to revise the dresses . Garrick used to act Othello " in a red coat and epaulettes , and other characters had " prescriptive habits equally ridiculous . I can conceive " nothing equal to Kemble 's Coriolanus ; and he looked " the Roman so well , that even ' Cato , ' cold and . stilti.sh as " it is , had a run . That shews what an actor can do for a " play ! If he had acted ' Marino Faliero , ' its fate would " have been very different . " Kemble pronounced several words affectedly , which " should be cautiously avoided on the stage . It is no- * And he might have added Pasta . /q/ " thing that Campbell writes it Sepulcre in ' Hohenlin " den . ' The Greek derivation is much against his pronun " ciation of ache . " He now began to mimic Kemble 's voice and manner of spouting , and imitated him inimitably in Prospero s lines : " ' Yea , the great globe itself , it shall dissolve , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ' Leave not a rack behind ! ' * ' When half seas over , Kemble used to speak in blank " verse : and with practice , I do n't think it would be " diflRcult . Good prose resolves itself into blank-verse . " Why should we not be able to improvise in hexameters , " as well as the Italians ? Theodore Hook is an impro " visatore . " " The greatest genius in that way that perhaps Italy ever produced , ' said Shelley , " is Sgricci . " " There is a great deal of knack in these gentry , " replied Lord Byron ; " their poetry is more mechanical than you /z/ " suppose . More verses are written yearly in Italy , than " millions of money are circulated . It is usual for every " Italian gentleman to make sonnets to his mistress 's eye " brow before he is married , - or the lady must be very im " inspiring indeed . " But Sgricci ! To extemporize a whole tragedy seems a " miraculous gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucca , on the subject of the ' Iphigenia in Tauris , ' and " never was more interested . He put one of the finest " speeches into the mouth of Iphigenia I ever heard . " She compared her brother Orestes to the sole remaining " pillar on which a temple hung tottering , in the act of " ruin . The idea , it is true , is from Euripides , but he " made it his own . I have never read his play since I was " at school . I do n't know how Sgricci 's tragedies may " appear in print , but his printed poetry is tame stuff . " The inspiration of the impvoviser is quite a separate " talent : - a consciousness of his own powers , his own elo " cution - the wondering and applauding audience , - all " conspire to give him confidence ; but the deity forsakes " him when he coldly sits down to think . Sgricci is not only " a fine poet , but a fine actor . Mrs. Siddons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting ; Miss O'Neil /q/ " I would not go to see , for fear of weakening the impres " sion made by the queen of tragedians . When I read " Lady Macbeth ' s part , I have Mrs. Siddons before me , " and imagination even supphes her voice , whose tones were " superhuman , and power over the heart supernatural . " It is pleasant enough sometimes to take a peep be " hind , as well as to look before the scenes . " I remember one leg of an elephant saying to another , " ' D - n your eyes , move a little quicker ; ' and overhear " ing at the Opera two people in love , who were so dis " traits that they made the responses between the inter " vals of the recitation , instead of during the recitation " itself . One said to the other , ' Do you love me ? ' then " came the flourish of music , and the reply sweeter than " the music , ' Can you doubt it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specimens , " said he , " and am surprised to find in the extracts from the old " dramatists so many ideas that I thought exclusively my " own . Here is a passage , for instance , from ' The Duchess " of Malfy , ' astonishingly like one in ' Don Juan . ' s 2 /z/ " ' The leprosy of lust ' I discover , too , is not mine , " ' Thou tremblest , ' - ' ' T is with age then , ' which I am " accused of borrowing from Otway , was taken from the " Old Bailey proceedings . Some judge observed to the " witness , ' Thou tremblest ; ' - ' T is with cold then , ' was " the reply . " These Specimens of Lamb 's I never saw till to ' day . I am taxed with being a plagiarist , when I am " least conscious of being one ; but I am not very scru " pulous , I own , when I have a good idea , how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell to what " extent Shakspeare is indebted to his contemporaries , " whose works are now lost ? Besides which . Gibber " adapted his plays to the stage . " The invocation of the witches was , we know , a servile " plagiarism from Middleton . Authors were not so squea " mish about borrowing from one another in those days . " If it be a fault , I do not pretend to be immaculate , " I will lend you some volumes of Shipwrecks , from " which my storm in ' Don Juan ' came . " Lend me also ' Casti 's Novelle , ' " said L " Did you never see in Italian , - /q/ " Round her she makes an atmosphere of light ; " The very au- seemed lighter from her eyes ? " " The Germans , " said he , " and I believe Goethe himself , consider that I have taken great liberties with ' Faust . ' All I know of that drama is from a sorry French translation , from an occasional reading or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when at Diodati , and f ; om the Hartz mountain-scene , that Shelley versified from the other day . Nothing I envy him so much as to be able to read that astonishing production in the original . As to originality , Goethe has too much sense to pretend that he is not under obligations to authors , ancient and modern ; - who is not ? You tell me the plot is almost entirely Calderon 's . The fete , the scholar , the argument about the Logos , the selling himself to the fiend , and afterwards denying his power ; his disguise of the plumed cavaUer ; the enchanted mirror , - are all from Cyprian . That magico prodigloso must be worth reading , and nobody seems to know any thing about it but you and Shelley . Then the vision is not unlike that of Marlow 's , in his ' Faustus . ' The bed-scene is from ' Cymbeline ; ' the song or serenade , a translation of Ophelia 's , in ' Hamlet ; ' and , more than all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and /z/ " perhaps the oldest poem . I had an idea of writing a " * Job , ' but I found it too sublime . There is no poetry to " be compared with it . " I told him that Japhet 's soliloquy in ' Heaven and Earth , ' and address to the mountains of Caucasus , strongly resembled Faust 's . " I shall have commentators enough by and by , " said he , " to dissect my thoughts , and find owners for them . " " When I first saw the review of my ' Hours of Idleness , ' * " I was fiirious ; in such a rage as I never have been " m smce . " I dined that day with Scroope Davies , and drank three " bottles of claret to drown it ; but it only boiled the more . " That critique was a masterpiece of low wit , a tissue of " scurrilous abuse . I remember there was a great deal of " vulgar trash in it which was meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they could get , ' - ' not * Written in 1808. /q/ " looking a gift horse in the mouth , ' and such stable ex " pressions . The severity of ' The Quarterly ' killed poor " Keats , and neglect , Kirke White ; but I was made of " different stuff , of tougher materials . So far from their " bullying me , or deterring me from writing , I was bent on " falsifying their raven predictions , and determined to shew " them , croak as they would , that it was not the last time " they should hear from me . I set to work immediately , " and in good earnest , and produced in a year ' The Eng " lish Bards and Scotch Reviewers . ' For the first four days " after it was announced , I was very nervous about its fate . " Generally speaking , the first fortnight decides the pub " lie opinion of a new book . This made a prodigious " impression , more perhaps than any of my works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a year and a half it passed through four " editions , and rather large ones . To some of them , con " trary to the advice of my friends , I affixed my name . " The thing was known to be mine , and I could not have " escaped any enemies in not owning it ; besides , it was " more manly not to deny it . There were many things in " that satire which I was afterwards sorry for , and I wished " to cancel it . If Galignani chose to reprint it , it was no /z/ " fault of mine . I did my utmost to suppress the publi ' ' cation , not only in England , but in Ireland . I will tell " you my principal reason for doing so : I had good grounds " to believe that Jeffrey ( though perhaps really responsible " for whatever appears in ' The Edinburgh , ' as Gifford is for " ' The Quarterly , ' as its editor ) was not the author of that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disowned it ; and though " he would not give up the aggressor , he said he would " convince me , if I ever came to Scotland , who the person " was . I have every reason to believe it was a certain " lawyer , who hated me for something I once said of Mrs. " . The technical language about ' minority pleas , ' " ' plaintiffs , ' ' grounds of action , ' &c.; a jargon only intelli " gible to a lawyer , leaves no doubt in my mind on the " subject . I bear no animosity to him now , though , inde " pendently of this lampoon , which does him no credit , " he gave me cause enough of offence . " The occasion was this : - In my separation-cause , that " went before the Chancellor as a matter of form , when the " proceedings came on , he took upon himself to apply " some expressions , or make some allusions to me , which " must have been of a most unwarrantable nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with /q/ " the purport of them . What they precisely were I never " knew , or should certainly have made him retract them . 1 " met him afterwards at Coppet , but was not at that time * ' acquainted with this circumstance . He took on himself " the advocate also , in writing to Madame de Stael , and " advising her not to meddle in the quarrel between Lady " Byron and myself . This was not kind ; it was a gratui ' ' tons and unfeed act of hostility . But there was another " reason that influenced me even more than my cooled re " sentment against Jeffrey , to suppress ' English Bards and " Scotch Reviewers . ' In the duel-scene I had unconscious " ly made part of the ridicule fall on Moore . The fact " was , that there was no imputation on the courage of either " of the principals . One of the balls fell out in the car " riage , and was lost ; and the seconds , not having a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this publication I went abroad : and " Moore was so offended by the mention of the leadless " pistols , that he addressed a letter to me in the nature " of a challenge , delivering it to the care of Mr. Hanson , " but without acquainting him with the contents . This " letter was mislaid , - at least never forwarded to me. /z/ " But , on my return to England in 1812 , an enquiry was " made by Moore , if I had received such a letter ? adding , " that particular circumstances ( meaning his marriage , or " perhaps the suppression of the satire ) had now altered " his situation , and that he wished to recall the letter , and " to be known to me through Rogers . I was shy of this " mode of arranging matters , one hand presenting a pistol , " and another held out to shake ; and felt awkward at the " loss of a letter of such a nature , and the imputation it " might have given rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was at length found , I returned it to Moore " with the seal unbroken ; and we have since been the best " friends in the world . I correspond with no one so regu* ' larly as with Moore . " It is remarkable that I should at this moment number " among my most intimate friends and correspondents " those whom I most made the subjects of satire in ' Eng " lish Bards . ' I never retracted my opinions of their " works , - I never sought their acquaintance ; but there are " men who can forgive and forget . The Laureate is not " one of that disposition , and exults over the anticipated " death-bed repentance of the objects of his hatred . " Finding that his denunciations or panegyrics are of little /q/ " or no avail here , he indulges himself in a pleasant vision " as to what will be their fate hereafter .

I said in a Note to ' The Two Fos " cari , ' in answer to his vain boasting , that I had done " more real good in one year than Mr. Southey in the " whole course of his shifting and turn-coat existence , on " which he seems to reflect with so much complacency . I " did not mean to pride myself on the act to which I have " just referred , and should not mention it to you , but that " his self-sufficiency calls for the explanation . When Cole " ridge was in great distress , I borrowed 100/. to give " him . " Some days after this discussion appeared Mr. Southey 's reply to the Note in question . I happened to see ' The Literary Gazette ' at Mr. Edgeworth 's , and mentioned the general purport of the letter to Lord Byron during our evening ride . His anxiety to get a sight of it was so great , that he wrote me two notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procure the paper . I at length succeeded , and took it to the Lanfranchi palace at eleven o'clock , /z/ ( after coming from the opera , ) an hour at which I was fi-equently in the habit of calHng on him . He had left the Guiccioh earher than usual , and I found hiin waiting with some impatience . I never shall forget his countenance as he glanced rapidly over the contents . He looked perfectly awful : his colour changed almost prismatically ; his lips were as pale as death . He said not a word . He read it a second time , and with more attention than his rage at first permitted , commenting on some of the passages as he went on . When he had finished , he threw down the paper , and asked me if I thought there was any thing of a personal nature in the reply that demanded satisfaction ; as , if there was , he would instantly set off for England and call Southey to an account , - muttering something about whips , and branding-irons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - words of Mr. Southey 's . I said that , as to personality , his own expressions of " cowardly ferocity , " " pitiful renegado , " " hireling , " much stronger than any in the letter before me . He paused a moment , and said : ' ' Perhaps you are right ; but I will consider of it . You " have not seen my ' Vision of Judgment . ' I wish I had a /q/ " copy to shew you ; but the only one I have is in London . " I had ahnost decided not to pubhsh it , but it shall now go " forth to the ' . vorld . I will write to Douglas Kinnaird by " to-morrow 's post , to-night , not to delay its appearance . " The question is , whom to get to print it .

" Another time he said : " T am glad Mr. Southey owns that article on * Foliage , ' " which excited my choler so much . But who else could " have been the author ? Who but Southey would have " had the baseness , under the pretext of reviewing the " work of one man , insidiously to make it a nest egg for " hatching malicious calumnies against others ? " It was bad taste , to say the least of it , in Shelley " to write AOtoc after his name at Mont Anvert . I knew " little of him at that time , but it happened to meet my eye , ' * and I put my pen through the word , and Mwpoq too , that 150 C O N V E R S A T I O N ; s O F had been added by some one else by way of comment - and a very proper comment too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There it should have stopped . It would have been more creditable to Mr. Southey 's heart and feelings if he had been of this opuiion ; he would then never have made the use of his travels he " did , nor have raked out of an album the silly joke of a boy , in order to make it matter of serious accusation against him at home . I might well say he had impudence enough , if he could confess such infamy . I say nothing " of the critique itself on ' Foliage ; ' with the exception of " a few sonnets , it was unworthy of Hunt . But what was the " object of that article ? I repeat , to vilify and scatter his dark and devilish insinuations against me and others . Shame on the man who could wound an already bleeding " heart , - be barbarous enough to revive the memory of a " fatal event that Shelley was perfectly innocent of - and " found scandal on falsehood ! Shelley taxed him with writing that article some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that he had treasured up some opinions " of Shelley 's , ten years before , when he was on a visit at Keswick , and had made a note of them at the time .

' Handing it to Shelley , as he was in the habit of doing his daily compositions , he said : " Shelley , I have been writing a Faustish kind of drama : " tell me what you think of it . " After reading it attentively , Shelley returned it . " Well , " said Lord Byron , " how do you like it ? " " Least , " replied he , " of any thing I ever saw of yours . It is a bad imitation of ' Faust ; ' and besides , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron changed colour immediately , and asked hastily what lines ? Shelley repeated , " ' And water shall see thee , " ' And fear thee , and flee thee . ' " " They are in ' The Curse of Kehamah . " " His Lordship , without making a single observation , in- /z/ stantly threw the poem into the fire . He seemed to feel no chagrin at seeing it consume - at least his countenance betrayed none , and his conversation became more gay and lively than usual . Whether it was liatred of Southey , or respect for Shelley 's opinions , which made him commit an act that I considered a sort of suicide , was always doubtful to me . I was never more surprised than to see , two years afterwards , ' The Deformed Transformed ' announced ; ( supposing it to have perished at Pisa ) ; but it seems that he must have had another copy of the manuscript , or had re-written it perhaps , without changing a word , except omitting the ' Kehama ' lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe he could have quoted almost every line he ever wrote . One day a correspondent of Lord Byron 's sent him from Paris the following lines - a sort of epitaph for Southey - which he gave me leave to copy . " Beneath these poppies buried deep , The bones of Bob the Bard lie hid ; Peace to his manes ! and may he sleep As soundly as his readers did ! /q/ Through every sort of verse meandering , Bob went without a hitch or fall , Through Epic , Sapphic , Alexandrine , To verse that was no verse at all ; Till Fiction liaving done enough .

It occupied about four " teen days . Douglas Kinnaird tells me that he can get " no bookseller to publish it . It was offered to Murray , " but he is the most timid of God 's booksellers , and starts " at the title . He has taken a dislike to that three-sylla " bled word Mystery , and says , I know not why , that it is " another ' Cain .

There is nothing ob " jectionable in it , that I am aware of You have read it ; " what do you think ? If ' Cain ' be immoral ( which I deny ) , " will not the Chancellor 's refusal to protect , and the " cheapness of a piratical edition , give it a wider circula " tion among the lower classes ? Will they not buy and read " it for the very reason that it is considered improper , and " try to discover an evil tendency where it was least " meant ? May not impiety be extracted by garbhng the /q/ " Bible ? I defy the common people to understand such " mysteries as the loves of the Angels , at least they are " mysteries to me . Moore , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that he writes must succeed . " I told him that the laughter of the fiends in the Cave of Caucasus reminded me of the row of the Furies in the ' Eumenides ' of iEschylus . " I have never read any of his plays since I left Harrow , " said Lord Byron . " Shelley , when I was in Switzerland , " translated the ' Prometheus ' to me before I wrote my " ode ; but I never open a Greek book . Shelley tells me " that the choruses in ' Heaven and Earth ' are deficient . " He thinks that lyrical poetry should be metrically regular . " Surely this is not the case with the Greek choruses that " he makes such a fuss about . However , Hunt will be " glad of it for his new periodical work . I talked of writ " ing a second part to it ; but it was only as Coleridge pro " mised a second part to ' Christabel . ' I will tell you how " I had an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leave off ?

The appearance of the land " strangled by the ocean will serve by way of scenery and " decorations . The affectionate tenderness of Adah for " those from whom she is parted , and for ever , and her " fears contrasting with the loftier spirit of Aholibamah " triumphing in the hopes of a new and greater destiny , " will make the dialogue .

Adah joins in " his entreaties , and endeavours to cling to the sides of /z/ the vessel . The proud and haughty Ahohbamah scorns to pray either to God or man , and anticipates the grave by plunging into the waters . Noah is still inexorable . The surviving daughter of Cain is momentarily in danger of perishing before the eyes of the Arkites . Japhet is in despair .

I remember what Fontenelle said of its having no atmosphere , and the dark spots being caverns where the inhabitants reside . There was another objection : all the human interest would have been destroyed , which I have even endeavoured to give my Angels . It was a very Irish kind of compliment Jeffrey paid to Moore 's ' Lalla Rookh , ' when he said the loves were those of Angels ; meaning that they were like nothing on earth . What will he say of ' The Loves of the Angels ? ' - that they are like ( for he has nothing left ) nothing in Heaven ? " /z/ " I wrote ' The Prophecy of Dante ' at the suggestion " of the Countess .

" I had , however , a much more extensive view in writing " that poem than to describe either his banishment or his " grave . Poets are sometimes shrewd in their conjectures . " You quoted to me the other day a line in ' Childe Ha " rold , ' in which I " made a prediction about the Greeks * : " in this instance I was not so fortunate as to be prophetic . " This poem was intended for the Italians and the " Guiccioli , and therefore I wished to have it translated .

It was looked at in a poli " tical light , and they indulged in my dream of liberty , " and the resurrection of Italy . Alas ! it was only a " dream ! /z/ " Terza Rima does not seem to suit the genius of English " poetry - it is certainly unealculated for a work of any " length . In our language , however , it may do for a short " ode . The public at least thought my attempt a failure , " and the public is in the main right . I never perse " cute the public . I always bow to its verdict , which " is generally just . But if I had wanted a sufficient " reason for ray giving up the Prophecy - the Prophecy " failed me . " It was the turn political affairs took that made me re " hnquish the work . At one time the flame was expected " to break out over all Italy , but it only ended in smoke , " and my poem went out with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itahans about Dante .

The GuiccioH , for instance , " could almost repeat any part of the ' Divine Comedy ; ' " and , I dare say , is well read in the ' Vita Niiova , ' that " prayer-book of love . /z/ " Shelley always says that reading Dante is unfavourable " to writing , from its superiority to all possible composi " tions .

In the first place , he put too " high a price on the copies of the two first Cantos that " came out , only printing a quarto edition , at , I think , a /z/ " guinea and a half . There was a great demand for it , " and this induced the knavish booksellers to buccaneer .

" The thing was plainly this : he disowned and refused " to acknowledge the bantling ; the natural consequence " was , that others should come forward to adopt it . " Mr. John Murray is the most nervous of God 's book " sellers . When ' Don Juan ' first came out , he was so " frightened that he made a precipitate retreat into the " country , shut himself up , and would not open his letters . " The fact is , he prints for too many Bishops .

' Christabel ' was the origin of all Scott 's metrical " tales , and that is no small merit . It was written in 1795 , " and had a pretty general circulation in the literary " world , though it was not published till 1816 , and then " probably in consequence of my advice .

" What do you think of the picture of an English Oc " tober day ?

What perfect harmony of versification ! " And he began spouting ' Kubla Khan : ' " ' It was an Abyssinian maid , " And on her dulcimer she play 'd , " Singing of Mount Abora ' - Madame de Stael was fond of reciting poetry that " had hardly any thing but its music to recommend it . " " And pray , " asked I , " what has ' Kubla Khan ? ' " " I ca n't tell you , " said he ; " but it delights me . " And he went on till he had finished the Vision .

Nothing , to me at least , is so " entertaining as a work of this kind - as private biography : " * Hamilton 's Memoirs , ' for instance , that were the origin of " the style of Voltaire . Madame de Stael used to say , that " ' De Grammont ' was a book containing , with less matter , " more interest than any she knew . Alfieri 's ' Life ' is delight " ful . You will see my Confessions in good time , and you will * ' wonder at two things - that I should have had so much " to confess , and that I should have confessed so much .

If he had never " gone to Germany , nor spoilt his fine genius by the tran- /z/ " scendental philosophy and German metaphysics , nor " taken to write lay sermons , he would have made the " greatest poet of the day . What poets had we in 1795 ? " Hayley had got a monopoly , such as it was . Coleridge " might have been any thing : as it is , he is a thing ' that " dreams are made of . ' " Being one day at Moloni 's the bookseller 's at Pisa , a report was in circulation that a subject belonging to the Lucchese States had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnt alive . A priest who entered the library at that moment confirmed the news , and expressed himself thus : - " Scelerato ! " said he , " he took the consecrated wafers oiF the altar , and threw them contemptuously about the church ! What punishment can be great enough for such a monstrous crime ? Burning is too easy a death ! I shall go to Lucca , - I would almost go to Spain , - to see the wretch expire at the stake ! " Such were the humane and Christian sentiments of a minister of the Gospel ! I quitted him with disgust , and immediately hastened to Lord Byron 's . " Is it possible ? " said he , after he had heard my story . /q/ " Can we believe that we live in the nineteenth century ? * ' However , I can believe any thing of the Duchess of Lucca .

Surely the Grand Duke of " Tuscany will interfere , for he has himself never signed " a death-warrant since he came upon the throne . " Shelley entered at this moment horror-struck : he had just heard that the criminal was to suffer the next day . He proposed that we should mount and arm ourselves as well as we could , set off immediately for Lucca , and endeavour to rescue the prisoner when brought out for execution , making at full speed for the Tuscan frontiers , where he would be safe . Mad and hopeless as the scheme was . Lord Byron consented , carried away by his feelings , to join in it , if other means should fail . We agreed to meet again in the evening , and in the mean time to get a petition signed by all the English residents at Pisa , to be presented to the Grand Duke . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write immediately to Lord " Guilford . " He did so , and received an answer a few hours after , telling him that the same report had reached Lord Guilford ; but that he had learned , on investigation , that it was unfounded . It appeared that the Duchess had issued a proclamation which made the peasant amenable , when apprehended , to the ancient laws of Spain ; but that he had escaped to Florence and given himself up to the police , who had stipulated not to make him over to the authorities at Lucca , but on condition of his being tried by the Tuscan laws . Speaking of Coppet and Madame de Stael , he said : " I knew Madame de Stael in England . When she " came over she created a great sensation , and was much " courted in the literary as well as the political world . " On the supposition of her being a Liberal , she was " invited to a party , where were present Whitbread , " Sheridan , and several of the Opposition leaders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she soon sported " her Ultraisms . No one possessed so Httle tact as Ma " dame de Stael , - which is astonishing in one who had " seen so much of the world and of society . She used " to assemble at her routs politicians of both sides of the " House , and was fond of setting two party-men by the " ears in arsument . I once witnessed a curious scene of " this kind . She was battling it very warmly , as she used " to do , with Canning , and all at once turned round to " ( I think he said ) Lord Grey , who was at his elbow , for his " opinion . It was on some point upon which he could not " but most cordially disagree . She did not understand " London society , and was always sighing for her coterie " at Paris . The dandies took an invincible dislike to " the De Staels , mother and daughter . Brummel was her " aversion ; - she , his . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Auguste ( the present " Baron ) was to have married Miss Millbank ; I , the " present Duchess of Broglio . I could not have been " worse embroiled . " Madame de Stael had great talent in conversation , and " an overpowering flow of words . It was once said of a z 2 /z/ " large party that were all trying to shine , ' There is not " one who can go home and think . ' This was not the " case with her . She was often troublesome , some thought " rude , in her questions ; but she never offended me , " because I knew that her inquisitiveness did not proceed " from idle curiosity , but from a wisli to sound peoples " characters . She was a continual interrogatory to me , in " order to fathom mine , which requires a long plumb line . " She once asked me if my real character was well drawn " in a favourite novel of the day ( ' Glenarvon ' ) . She was " only singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . There are many who pin their faith on that " insincere production . " No woman had so much bonne foi as Madame de Stael : " hers was a real kindness of heart . She took the greatest " possible interest in my quarrel with Lady Byron , or " rather Lady Byron 's with me , and had some influence " over my wife , - as much as any person but her mother , " which is not saying much . I believe Madame de Stael " did her utmost to bring about a reconciliation between " us . She was the best creature in the world . " Women never see consequences - never look at things /q/ " straight forward , or as they ought . Like figurantes at " the Opera , they make a hundred pirouettes and return " to where they set out . With Madame de Stael this was " sometimes the case . She was very indefinite and vague " in her manner of expression . In endeavouring to be new " she became often obscure , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Napoleon was a " system , and not a man ? ' " I can not beUeve that Napoleon was acquainted with " all the petty persecutions that she used to be so gar " rulous about , or that he deemed her of sufficient im " portance to be dangerous : besides , she admired him " so much , that he might have gained her over by a " word . But , like me , he had perhaps too great a con " tempt for women ; he treated them as puppets , and " thought he could make them dance at any time by " pulling the wires . That story of ' Gardez vos enfans did " not tell much in her favour , and proves what I say . I " shall be curious to see Las Cases ' book , to hear what " Napoleon 's real conduct to her was . " I told him I could never reconcile the contradictory opinions he had expressed of Napoleon in his poems . /z/ " How could it be otherwise ? " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I spoke in the character of " a Frenchman and a soldier . But Napoleon was his own " antithesis ( if I may say so ) . He was a glorious tyrant , " after all . Look at his public works ; compare his face , " even on his coins , with those of the other sovereigns of " Europe . I blame the manner of his death : he shewed " that he possessed much of the Italian character in con " senting to live . There he lost himself in his dramatic " character , in my estimation . He was master of his own " destiny ; of that , at least , his enemies could not deprive " him . He should have gone off the stage like a hero : it " was expected of him . " Madame de Sta'el , as an historian , should have named " him in her ' Allemagne ; ' she was wrong in suppress " ing his name , and he had a right to be offended . Not " that I mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help thinking , must have arisen indirectly from some " private enemy . But we shall see . " She was always aiming to be brilliant - to produce a " sensation , no matter how , when , or where . She wanted " to make all her ideas , like figures in the modern French /q/ " school of painting , prominent and shewy , - standing out " of the canvass , each in a light of its own . She was vain ; " but who had an excuse for vanity if she had not ? I can " easily conceive her not wishing to change her name , or " acknowledge that of Rocca . I liked Rocca ; he was a " gentleman and a clever man ; no one said better things , " or with a better grace . The remark about the Meillerie " road that I quoted in the Notes of ' Childe Harold , ' ' La " route vaut mieiix que les souvenirs , ' was the observation of " a thorough Frenchman .

" Talking of romances , he said : " ' The Monk ' is perhaps one of the best in any lan " guage , not excepting the German . It only wanted " one thing , as I told Lewis , to have rendered it perfect . " He should have made the damon really in love with " Ambrosio : this would have given it a human interest . " ' The Monk ' was written when Lewis was only twenty , " and he seems to have exhausted all his genius on it . " Perhaps at that age he was in earnest in his belief of " magic wonders . That is the secret of Walter Scott 's " inspiration : he retains and encourages all the su ) er " stitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvellous , and it amounted to a mania with him , in " Germany ; but the groundwork of ' The Monk , ' is neither " original nor German : it is derived from the tale of " ' Santon Barsisa . ' The episode of ' The Bleeding Nun , ' " which was turned into a melo-drama , is from the " German . /z/ " There were two stories which he ahnost believed by " telhng . One happened to himself whilst he was residing " at Manheim . Every night , at the same hour , he heard " or thought he heard in his room , when he was lying " in bed , a crackling noise like that produced by parch " ment , or thick paper . This circumstance caused en " quiry , when it was told him that the sounds were attri " butable to the following cause : - The house in which he " lived had belonged to a widow , who had an only son . " In order to prevent his marrying a poor l ) ut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sent to sea . " Years passed , and the mother heard no tidings of him , ' * nor the ship in which he had sailed . It was supposed " that the vessel had been wrecked , and that all on board " had perished . The reproaches of the girl , the upbraid " ings of her own conscience , and the loss of her child , " crazed the old lady 's mind , and her only pursuit became " to turn over the Gazettes for news . Hope at length " left her : she did not live long , - and continued her old " occupation after death . " The other story that I alluded to before , was the " original of his ' Alonzo and Imogene , ' which has had such " a host of imitators . Two Florentine lovers , who had been /z/ " attached to each other ahnost from childhood , made a " vow of eternal fidehty . Mina was the name of the lady - " her husband 's I forget , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time absent with his " regiment , when , as his disconsolate lady was sitting " alone in her chamber , she distinctly heard the well " known sound of his footsteps , and starting up beheld , " not her husband , but his spectre , with a deep ghastly " wound across his forehead , entering . She swooned with " horror : when she recovered , the ghost told her that in " future his visits should be announced by a passing-bell , " and these words , distinctly whispered , ' Mina , I am here ! ' " Their interviews now became frequent , till the woman " fancied herself as much in love with the ghost as she had " been with the man . But it was soon to prove otherwise . " One fatal night she went to a ball : - what business had " she there ? She danced too ; and , what was worse , lier " partner was a young Florentine , so much the counter " part of her lover , that she became estranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the " waltz , and her ear drank in the music of his voice and " words , a passing-bell tolled ! She had been accustomed " to the sound till it hardly excited her attention , and now " lost in the attractions of her fascinating partner , she heard /q/ " but regarded it not . A second peal ! - she listened not " to its warnings . A third time the bell , with its deep " and iron tongue , startled the assembled company , " and silenced tliQ music ! Mina then turned her eyes " from her partner , and saw reflected in the mirror , a " form , a shadow , a spectre : it was her husband ! He " was standing between her and the young Florentine , " and whispered in a solemn and melancholy tone the " accustomed accents , ' Mina , I am here ! ' - She instantly " fell dead . " Lewis was not a very successful writer . His ' Monk ' " was abused furiously by Matthias , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to suppress it . ' Abellino ' " he merely translated . ' Pizarro ' was a sore subject with " him , and no wonder that he winced at the name . Sheri " dan , who was not very scrupulous about applying to him " self literari/ property at least , manufactured his play " without so much as an acknowledgment , pecuniary or " otherwise , from Lewis 's ideas ; and bad as ' Pizarro ' is , " I know ( from having been on the Drury-Lane Committee , " and knowing , consequently , the comparative profits of " plays , ) that it brought in more money than any other play " has ever done , or perhaps ever will do . /z/ " But to return to Lewis . He was even worse treated about ' The Castle Spectre , ' which had also an immense run , a prodigious success . Sheridan never gave him any of its profits either . One day Lewis being in company with him , said , - ' Sheridan , I will make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to make a wager , ( however he might find it inconvenient to pay it if lost , ) asked eagerly what bet ? ' All the profits of my Castle Spectre , ' replied Lewis . ' I will tell you what , ' said Sheridan , ( who never found his match at repartee , ) ' I will make you a very small one , - what it is worth . ' " I asked him if he had known Sheridan ? " Yes , " said he . " Sheridan was an extraordinary com " poiuid of contradictions , and Moore will be much " puzzled in reconciling them for the Life he is writing . " The upper part of Sheridan 's face was that of a God - a " forehead most expansive , an eye of peculiar brilliancy " and fire ; but below he shewed the satyr . " Lewis was a pleasant companion , and would always " have remained a boy in spirits and manners - ( unlike me ! ) " He was fond of the society of younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew a man , except Shelley , who " was companionable till thirty . I remember Mrs. Pope " once asking who was Lewis 's male-love this season ! " He possessed a very lively imagination , and a great " turn for narrative , and had a world of ghost-stories , " which he had better have confined himself to tell " ing . His poetry is now almost forgotten : it will be " the same with that of all but two or three poets of the " day . " Lewis had been , or thought he had been , unkind to a " brother whom he lost young ; and when any thing " disagreeable was about to happen to him , the vision " of his brother appeared : he came as a sort of mo " nitor . " Lewis was with me for a considerable period at " Geneva ; and we went to Coppet several times together ; " but Lewis was there oftener than I. " Madame de Stael and he used to have violent arffu " ments about the Slave Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his property was in negroes and " plantations . Not being satisfied with three thousand /z/ " a-year , he wanted to make it five ; and would go to " the West Indies ; but he died on the passage of sea " sickness , and obstinacy in taking an emetic . " I said to him , " You are accused of owing a great deal to Wordsworth . Certainly there are some stanzas in the Third Canto of ' Childe Harold ' that smell strongly of the Lakes : for instance - ' I live not in myself , but I become Portion of that around me ; - and to me High mountains are a feeling ! ' " ' " Very possibly , " replied he . " Shelley , when I was in " Switzerland , used to dose me with Wordsworth physic " even to nausea : and I do remember then reading some " things of his with pleasure . He had once a feeling of " Nature , which he carried almost to a deification of it : - " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfactory to reflect , that where a man becomes a " hireling and loses his mental independence , he loses also /z/ " the faculty of writing well . The lyrical ballads , jaco " binical and puling with affectation of simplicity as they " were , had undoubtedly a certain merit* : and Wordsworth , " though occasionally a writer for the nursery-masters and " misses , ' Who took theii ' little porringer , And ate their porridge there , ' " now and then expressed ideas worth miitating ; but , like " brother Southey , he had his price ; and since he is turned " tax-gatherer , is only fit to rhyme about lasses and wag ' ' goners . Shelley repeated to me the other day a stanza " from ' Peter Bell ' that I thought inimitably good . It is " the rumination of Peter 's ass , who gets into a brook , and " sees reflected there a family-circle , or tea-party . But " you shall have it in his own words : ' Is it a party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cramin 'd ? /z/ " Or Wordsworth unexcised , unhired , who then " Season 'd his pedlar poems with democracy .

A very pretty Arcadian " notion !

' The burlesque is well done , " particularly that of me , but not equal to Horace Smith 's , " I M as pleased with Hogg ; and he wrote me a very witty " letter , to which I sent him , I suspect , a very dull reply . " Certain it is that I did not spare the Lakists in it ; and he " told me he could not resist the temptation , and had shewn " it to the fraternity . It was too tempting ; and as I could " never keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less " that of other people , I could not blame him . I remember " saying , among other things , that the Lake poets were " such fools as not to fish in their own waters ; but this was " the least offensive part of the epistle . " " Bowles is one of the same little order of spirits , " who has been fussily fishing on for fame , and is equally " waspish and jealous . What could Coleridge mean by " praising his poetry as he does ? " It was a mistake of mine , about his making the woods " of Madeira tremble , &c.; ; but it seems that I might /z/ " have told him that there were no woods to make trem " ble with kisses , which would have been quite as great " a blunder . " I met Bowles once at Rogers 's , and thought him a " pleasant , gentlemanly man - a good fellow , for a parson . " When men meet together after dinner , the conversation " takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good stories . The reverend gentleman pre " tended , however , to be much shocked at Pope 's letters " to Martlia Blount . " I set him and his invariable principles at rest .

I believe he applied to me some lines " in Shalsspeare. * A man is very unlucky who has " a name that can be punned upon ; and his own did " not escape . " I have been reading ' Johnson 's Lives , ' a book I am " very fond of . I look upon him as the profoundest of I do remember tliee , my Lord Biron , ' " &c.; /z/ " critics , and had occasion to study him when I was ** writing to Bowles . " Of all the disgraces that attach to England in the " eye of foreigners , who admire Pope more than any of " our poets , ( though it is the fashion to under-rate him " among ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no place assigned to him in Poets ' Corner . I " have often thought of erecting a monument to him at " my own expense , in Westminster Abbey ; and hope to " do so yet . But he was a Catholic , and , what was worse , " puzzled Tillotson and the Divines . That accounts for " his not having any national monument . Milton , too , " had very nearly been without a stone ; and the mention " of his name on the tomb of another was at one time con " sidered a profanation to a church . The French , I am told , " lock up Voltaire 's tomb . Will there never be an end to " this bigotry ? Will men never learn that every great poet " is necessarily a religious man ? - so at least Coleridge says . " " Yes , " replied Shelley ; " and he might maintain the converse , - that every truly religious man is a poet ; meaning by poetry the power of communicating intense and impassioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the room . Lord Byron was devouring , as he called it , a new novel of Sir Walter Scott 's . " How difficult it is , " said he , " to say any thing new ! " Who was that voluptuary of antiquity , who offered a " reward for a new pleasure ? Perhaps all nature and art " could not supply a new idea . " This page , for instance , is a brilliant one ; it is full of " wit . But let us see how much of it is original . This " passage , for instance , comes from Shakspeare ; this hon " mot from one of Sheridan 's Comedies ; this observation " from another writer ( naming the author ) ; and yet the " ideas are new-moulded , - and perhaps Scott was not " aware of their being plagiarisms . It is a bad thing to " have too good a memory . " " I should not Uke to have you for a critic , " I observed . " ' Set a thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I never travel without Scott 's Novels , " said he : " they " are a library in themselves - a perfect literary treasure . I " could read them once a-year with new pleasure . " /q/ I asked him if he was certain about the Novels being Sir Walter Scott 's ? " Scott as much as owned himself the author of ' Waver " ley ' to me in Murray 's shop , " replied he . " I was talking " to him about that novel , and lamented that its author had " not carried back the story nearer to the time of the Re " volution . Scott , entirely oif his guard , said , ' Ay , I " might have done so , but ' There he stopped . It was in " vain to attempt to correct himself : he looked confused , " and relieved his embarrassment by a precipitate retreat . " On another occasion I was to dine at Murray 's ; and " being in his parlour in the morning , he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dinner . He had " received several excuses , and the party was a small one ; " and , knowing all the people present , I was satisfied that " the writer of that novel must have been , and could have " been , no other than Walter Scott . " He spoiled the fame of his poetry by his superior " prose . He has such extent and versatility of powers in " writing , that , should his Novels ever tire the public , " which is not likely , he will apply himself to something " else , and succeed as well . /z/ " His mottoes from old plays prove that he , at all events , " possesses the dramatic faculty , which is denied me . And " yet I am told that his ' Kalidon Hill ' did not justify " expectation . I have never met with it , but have seen " extracts from it . " " Do you think , " asked I , " that Sir Walter Scott 's Novels owe any part of their reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " said he ; " such works do not gain or lose by it . " I am at a loss to know his reason for keeping up the " incognito , - but that the reigning family could not " have been very well pleased with ' Waverley . ' There is " a degree of charlatanisin in some authors keeping up " the Unknown . Junius owed much of his fame to that " trick ; and now that it is known to be the work of Sir " Philip Francis , who reads it ? A political writer , and one " who descends to personalities such as disgrace Junius , " should be immaculate as a public , as well as a private " character ; and Sir Philip Francis was neither . He " had his price , and was gagged by being sent to In ' &#9632; dia . He there seduced another man 's wife .

He hated " Hastings to a violent degree ; all he hoped and prayed " for was to outlive him. - - But many of the newspapers of " the day are written as well as Junius . Matthias 's book , " ' The Pursuits of Literature , ' now almost a dead-letter , " had once a great fame . " When Walter Scott began to write poetry , which " was not at a very early age , Monk Lewis corrected " his verse : he understood little then of the mechanical " part of the art . The Fire King in ' The Minstrelsy of " the Scottish Border , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballads in that work , and , except some of Leyden 's , " perhaps one of the best , was made from a story picked " up in a stage-coach ; - I mean that of Will Jones . ' ' They boil 'd Will Jones within the pot , And not much fat had Will . ' /z/ " I hope Walter Scott did not write the review on " ' Christabel ; ' for he certainly , in common with many of " us , is indebted to Coleridge . But for him , perhaps , " ' The Lay of the Last Minstrel ' would never have been " thought of The line ' Jesu Maria shield thee well ! ' " is word for word from ' Christabel .

Rogers was very much offended at its being said that his ' Pleasures , ' &c.; were to be found shining in green and gold morocco-bindings in most parlour-windows , and on the book-shelves of all young ladies . " " But , do n't we all write to please them ? I am sure " I was more pleased with the fame my ' Corsair ' had , " than with that of any other of my books .

Rogers has been a spoilt child ; no won " der that he is a little vain and jealous . And yet " he deals praise very liberally sometimes ; for he wrote " to a little friend of mine , on the occasion of his late " publication , that ' he was born with a rose-bud in his " mouth , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " prettily turned Orientalisms . Before my wife and the " world quarrelled with me , and brought me into disre " pute with the public , Rogers had composed some very " pretty commendatory verses on me ; but they were kept " corked up for many long years , under hope that I might " reform and get into favour with the world again , and " that the said lines ( for he is rather costive , and does not " like to throw away his effusions ) might find a place in " ' Human Life . ' But after a great deal of oscillation , and /q/ " many a sigh at their hard destiny - their still-born fate , - " they were hermetically sealed , and adieu to my immor " tality !

O Samuel , Samuel ! But , " added he , after a pause , " these things are , as Lord Kenyon " said of Erskine , ' mere spots in the sun .

It is " strange that people will not let me alone . I am sure I " lead a very quiet , moral Ufe here . " * * &#9632; 3f V V Hr /z/ A fortnight after he said : " I hear that your Doctor , in company with some Rus " sians , the other day , called Shelley a scelerato , and has " been preaching two sermons , two following Sundays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he means " them ; and Mrs. Shelley being there , it was still more in " decent . The Doctor is playing with penknives when he " handles poets . " The next morning he gave us a song upon the Doctor , to the tune of " The Vicar and Moses . " 2d /z/ " I have often wished , " said I to Lord Byron one day , " to know how you passed your time after your return from Greece in 1812 . " " There is little to be said about it , " replied he . " Per " haps it would have been better had I never returned ! " I had become so much attached to the Morea , its cli " mate , and the life I led there , that nothing but my mo " ther 's death and my affairs would have brought me " home . However , after an absence of three years , behold ! " I was again in London . My Second Canto of ' Childe " Harold ' was then just published ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of all I could say , the world " would discover in that poem , made every one curious to " know me , and to discover the identity . I received every " where a marked attention , was courted in all societies , " made nuich of by Lady Jersey , had the entre at Devon " shire-house , was in favour with Brummel , ( and that was " alone enough to make a man of fashion at that time ; ) in " fact , I was a lion - a ball-room bard - a hot-pressed dar " ling ! ' The Corsair ' put my reputation au comble , and * In August 1811. /q/ " had a wonderful success , as you may suppose , by one " edition being sold in a day . " Polidori , who was rather vain , once asked me what " there was he could not do as well as I ? I think I named " four things : - that I could swim four miles - write a book , " of which four thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four bottles of wine - and I forget what the other " was , but it is not worth mentioning . However , as I told " you before , my ' Corsair ' was sufficient to captivate all " the ladies . " About this period I became what the French call " im homme d. bonnes fortunes , and was engaged in a " liaison , - and , I might add , a serious one . " The lady had scarcely any personal attractions to " recommend her . Her figure , though genteel , was too " thin to be good , and wanted that roundness which ele " gance and grace would vainly supply . She was , however , /z/ " young , and of the first connexions , ylu rcste , she pos " sessed an infinite vivacity , and an imagination heated by " novel-reading , which made her fancy herself a heroine of " romance , and led her into all sorts of eccentricities . She " was married , but it was a match of convenance , and no " couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendent of one another , than she and her husband . It " was at this time that we happened to be thrown much " together . She had never been in love - at least where " the affections are concerned , - and was perhaps made " without a heart , as many of the sex are ; but her head " more than supplied the deficiency . " I was soon congratulated by my friends on the con " quest I had made , and did my utmost to shew that I " was not insensible to the partiality I could not help per " ceiving . I made every effort to be in love , expressed " as nuich ardour as I could muster , and kept feeding " the flame with a constant supply of biUets-doiLX and " amatory verses . In short , I was in decent time duly " and regularly installed into what the Italians call " service , and soon became , in every sense of the word , " a pafifo. /q/ " It required no Qdipus to see where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , and she gained " an ascendancy over me that I could not easily shake off . " I submitted to this thraldom long , for I hate scenes , and " am of an indolent disposition ; but I was forced to snap " the knot rather rudely at last . Like all lovers , we had " several quarrels before we came to a final ruptiu-e . One " was made up in a very odd way , and without any verbal " explanation . She will remember it . Even during our in " timacy I was not at all constant to this fair one , and she " suspected as much . In order to detect my intrigues she " watched me , and earthed a lady into my lodgings , - and " came herself , terrier-like , in the disguise of a carman . " My valet , who did not see through the masquerade , let " her in ; when , to the despair of Fletcher , she put off the " man , and put on the woman . Imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her after-conduct was unaccountable madness - a com " bination of spite and jealousy . It was perfectly agreed " and understood that we were to meet as strangers . We " were at a ball . She came up and asked me if she might " waltz . I thought it perfectly indifferent whether she /z/ " waltzed or not , or with whom , and told her so , m different " terms , but with much coolness . After she had finished , a " scene occurred , which was in the mouth of every one . /z/ " Soon after this she promised young * * " if he would call me out . ***** " * * * * Yet can any one believe that she " should be so infatuated , after all this , as to call at my " apartments ? ( certainly with no view of shooting herself . ) " I was from home ; but finding ' Vathek ' on the table , she " wrote in the first page , ' Remember me ! ' " Yes ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irri " tability of the moment , Avrote under the two words these " two stanzas : - ' Remember thee , remember thee ! Till Lethe quench life 's burning stream , Remorse and shame shall cUng to thee . And haunt thee like a feverish dream ! /q/ Remember thee ! Ay , doubt it not ; Thy husband too shall think of thee ; By neither shalt thou be forgot , Thou ***** to him , thou ***** to me ! ' " " I am accused of ingratitude to a certain personage . It " is pretended that , after his civilities , I should not have " spoken of him disrespectfully . Those epigrams were " written long before my introduction to him ; which was , " after all , entirely accidental , and unsought-for on my part . " I met him one evening at Colonel J ' s . As the " party was a small one , he could not help observing me ; " and as I made a considerable noise at that time , and was " one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire I would be presented to him . I would willingly " have declined the honour , but could not with decency . " His request was in the nature of a command . He was " very polite , for he is the politest man in Europe , and " paid me some compliments that meant nothing . This " was all the civility he ever shewed me , and it does not " burthen my conscience much . " I will shew you my Irish ' Avatara . ' Moore tells me /z/ " that it has saved him from writing on the same subject : " he would have done it much better . I told M to get " it published in Paris : he has sent me a few printed " copies ; here is one for you .

For the dungeon he quits is the place of his birth . /q/ Ay ! roar in his train ; let thine orators lash Then- fanciful spirits to pamper his pride : Not thus did thy Grattan indignantly flash His soul on the freedom implored and denied !

" What a noble fellow , " said Lord Byron , after I had finished reading , " was Lord Edward Fitzgerald ! - and what " a romantic and singular history was his ! If it were not " too near our times , it would make the finest subject in " the world for an historical novel . ' " What was there sd singular in his life and adventures ? " I asked . " Lord Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " a boy . He served in America , and was left for dead in " one of the pitched battles , ( I forget which , ) and returned " in the list of killed . Having been found in the field after /q/ " the removal of the wounded , he was recovered by the " kmdness and compassion of a native , and restored to his " family as one from the grave . On coming back to Eng " land , he emplo-yed himself entirely in the duties of his " corps and the study of military tactics , and got a regi " ment . The French Revolution now broke out , and with " it a flame of liberty burnt in the breast of the young " Irishman . He paid this year a visit to Paris , where he " formed an intimacy with Tom Paine , and came over with " him to England . /z/ " There matters rested , till , dining one day at his regi " mental mess , he ordered the band to play ' Ca ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days afterwards he re " ceived a letter from head-quarters , to say that the King " dispensed with his services . " He now paid a second visit to America , where he lived " for two years among the native Indians ; and once again " crossing the Atlantic , settled on his family estate in Ire " land , where he fulfilled all the duties of a country-gen " tleman and magistrate . Here it was that he became " acquainted with the O'Connors , and in conjunction with " them zealously exerted himself for the emancipation /z/ of their country . On their imprisonment he was pro " scribed , and secreted for six weeks in what are called " the liberties of Dublin ; but was at length betrayed " by a woman . " Major Sirr and a party of the military entered his " bed-room , which he always kept unlocked . At the voices " he started up in bed and seized his pistols , when " Major Sirr fired and wounded him . Taken to prison , he " soon after died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brouaht " to trial . Such was the fate of one who had all the qua " lifications of a hero and a patriot ! Had he lived , per " haps Ireland had not now been a land of Helots . " " What did you mean , " asked I one day , " by that hne in ' Beppo , ' - ' Some play the devil , and then write a novel ' ? " " I alluded , " replied he , " to a novel that had some fame " in consequence of its being considered a history of my " life and adventures , character and exploits , mixed up " with innumerable lies and lampoons upon others . Ma " /q/ dame de Staiil asked me if the picture was like me , - " and the Germans think it is not a caricature .

Hence , however , it has " been alleged that murder is my instinct ; and to make " innocence my victim and my prey , part of my nature . I * ' imagine that this dark hint took its origin from one of " my Notes in ' The Giaour , ' in which I said that the coun " tenance of a person dying by stabs retained the character " of ferocity , or of the particular passion imprinted on it , " at the moment of dissolution . A sage reviewer makes " this comment on my remark : - ' It must have been the " result of personal observation ! ' " But I am made out a very amiable person in that " novel ! The only thing belonging to me in it , is part of " a letter ; but it is mixed up with much fictitious and " poetical matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bookseller in Bond Street , no small sum if he would /z/ " compile the Notes of that book into a story ; but that he " deehned the offer . * * * * * /z/ ****** But if I know " the authoress , I have seen letters of hers much better " written than any part of that novel . A lady of my ac " Cjuaintance told me , that when that book was going to " the press , she was threatened with cutting a prominent " figure in it if . But the story would only fur- " nish evidence of the luiauthenticity of the nature of the " materials , and shew the manner and spirit with which " the piece was got up . - Yet I do n't know why I have " been led to talk about such nonsense , which I paid no * ' more attention to than I have to the continual calum " nies and lies that have been unceasingly circulated about " me , in public prints , and through anonymous letters .

It was under the waspish " ness produced by this discovery that I made him figure " also in my ' Be ) po ' as an ' antique gentleman of rhyme , ' " a ' bustling Botherby , ' &c.; I always thought him the most " insufferable of bores , and the curse of the Ilampbell , as " Edgeworth was of his club . There was a society formed /q/ " for the suppression of Edgeworth , and sending him back " to Ireland ; - but I should have left the other to his ' Snug coterie and literary lady , ' " and to his that Rogers pretended to take " for an old arm-chair , if he had not made himself an active " bore , by dunning me with disagreeable news , - and , what " was worse , and more nauseous and indigestible still , with " his criticisms and advice .

I said what I thought of him the other " day ; and all who are not blinded by bigotry must think /q/ " the same . The works he wrote at seventeen are much " more extraordinary than Chatterton 's at the same age . " A question was started , as to which he considered the easiest of all metres in our language . " Or rather , " replied he , " you mean , which is the least " difficult ? I have spoken of the fatal facihty of the octo " syllabic metre . The Spenser stanza is difficult , because " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " The couplet is more difficult still , because the last line , " or one out of two , must be good .

" During our evening ride the conversation happened to turn upon the rival Reviews . " I know no two men , " said he , " who have been so infa " mously treated , as Shelley and Keats .

" I took leave of Lord Byron on the 15th of March , to visit Rome for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened at Pisa , the particulars of which were variously stated . The Courier Francois gave the followinff account of it : - /z/ " A superior officer went to Lord Byron a few days ago . A very warm altercation , the reason of which was unknown , occurred between this officer and the English poet . The threats of the officer became so violent , that Lord Byron 's servant ran to protect his master . A struggle ensued , in which the officer was struck with a poniard by the servant , and died instantly . The servant fled . " This was one among many reports that were circulated at Rome , to which I was forced one day to give a somewhat flat contradiction . But the real truth of the story can not be better explained than by the depositions before the /q/ Governor of Pisa , the copies of which were sent me , and are in my possession. * They state that " Lord Byron , in company with Count Gamba , Captain Hay , Mr. Trelawney , and Mr. Shelley , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1822 , and was perhaps a quarter of a mile from the Piaggia gate , when a man on horseback , in a hussar uniform , dashed at full speed through the midst of the party , violently jostling urtando ) one of them . Shocked at such ill-breeding , Lord Byron pushed forward , and all the rest followed him , and pulled up their horses on overtaking the hussar . His Lordship then asked him what he meant by the insult ? The hussar , for first and only answer , began to abuse him in the grossest manner ; on which Lord Byron and one of his companions drew out a card with their names and address , and passed on . The hussar followed , vociferating and threatening , with his hand on his sabre , that he would draw it , as he had often done , effectually . They were now about ten paces from the Piaggia gate . Whilst this altercation was eoine on , a common soldier of the artillery interfered , and called out to the hussar , ' Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original depositions. /z/ mand us to arrest them ! ' Upon which the hussar gave the word to the guard at the gate , ' Arrest - arrest them ! ' still continuing the same threatening gestures , and using language , if possible , more offensive and insulting . " His Lordship , hearing the order given for their arrest , spurred on his horse , and one of the party did the same ; and they succeeded in forcing their way through the soldiers , who flew to their muskets and bayonets , whilst the gate was closed on the rest , together with the courier , who was foremost . " Mr. Trelawney now found his horse seized by the bridle by two soldiers , with their swords drawn , and himself furiously assaulted by the hussar , who made several cuts at him with his sabre , whilst the soldiers struck him about the thighs . He and his companions were all unarmed , and asked this madman the reason of his conduct ; but his only reply was blows . " Mr. Shelley received a sabre-stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . Captain Hay , endeavouring to parry a blow with a stick that he used as a whip , the edge of the weapon cut it in two , and he received a wound on his nose . The courier also sufl'eretl severely from several /q/ thrusts he received from the hussar and the rest of the soldiers . After all this , the hussar spurred on his horse , and took the road to the Lung ' Arno . " When his Lordship reached the palace , he gave directions to his secretary to give immediate information to the police of what was going on ; and , not seeing his companions come up , turned back towards the gate . On the way he met the hussar , who rode up to him , saying , ' Are you satisfied ? ' His Lordship , who knew nothing or hardly any thing of the affray that had taken place at the gate , answered , ' No , I am not ! Tell me your name ! ' - ' Serjeant-Major Masi , ' said he . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and laid hold of the bridle of the Serjeant 's horse . His Lordship commanded him to let it go ; when the Serjeant spurred his horse , and rushed through an immense crowd collected before the Lanfranchi palace , where , as he deposes , he was wounded and his chaco fovuid , but how or by whom they knew not , seeing that they were either in the rear or in their way home . They had further to depose that Captain Hay was confined to his house by reason of his wound ; also that the courier had spit blood from the thrust he received in the breast , as might be proved by the evidence of the surgeons . " /z/ There was also another deposition from a Mr. James Crawford . It stated that " the dragoon would have drawn his sabre against Lord Byron , in the Lung ' Arno , had it not been for the interposition of the sei-vant ; and that Signor Major Masi was knocked off his horse as he galloped past the Lanfranehi palace , Lord Byron and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It appears that Signor Major Masi was wounded with a pitchfork , and his life was for some time in danger ; but it was never known by whom the wound had been given . One of the Countess 's servants , and two of Lord Byron 's , were arrested and imprisoned . It was suspected by the police that , being Italians and much attached to their master , * they had revenged his quarrel ; but no proof was adduced to justify the suspicion . * Lord Byron was the best of masters , and was perfectly adored by his servants . His kindness was extended even to their children . He liked them to have their families with them : and I remember one day , as we were entering the hall after our ride , meeting a little boy , of three or fom- years old , of the coachman 's , whom he took up in his arms and presented with a ten-Paid piece . /q/ During the time that the examination was taking place before the poHce , Lord Byron 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troop , who were on the point of forcing open the doors , but they were too well guarded within to dread the attack . Lord Byron , however , took his ride as usual two days after . " It is not the first time , " said he , " that my house has " been a bender , and may not be the last . " All Lord Byron 's servants were banished from Pisa , and with them the Counts Gamba , father and son . Lord Byron was himself advised to leave it ; and as the Countess accompanied her father , he soon after joined them at Leghorn , and passed six weeks at Monte Nero . His return to Pisa was occasioned by a new persecution of the Gambas . An order was issued for them to leave the Tus can States in four days ; and on their embarkation for Genoa , the Countess and himself took up their residence ( for the first time together ) at the Lanfranchi palace where Leigh Hunt and his family had already arrived . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's melancholy fate I revisited Pisa , and on the day of my arrival learnt that Lord Byron was gone to the sea-shore , to assist in performing the last offices to his friend. * We came to a spot marked by an old and withered trunk of a fir-tree ; and near it , on the beach , stood a solitary hut covered with reeds . The situation was well calculated for a poet 's * It is hoped that the following memou- , as it relates to Lord Byron , may not be deemed misplaced here . ' Percy Bysshe Shelley was removed from a private school at thirteen , and sent to Eton . He there shewed a character of great eccentricity , mixed in none of the amusements natural to his age , was of a melancholy and reserved disposition , fond of solitude , and made few friends . Neither did he distinguish himself nuich at Eton , for he had a great contempt for modern Latin verses , and his studies were directed to any thing rather than the exercises of his class . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably imbibed a romantic turn of mind ; at least , we find him before fifteen publishing two Rosa-Matilda-hke novels , called ' Justrozzi ' and ' The Rosicrucian , ' that bore no marks of being the productions of a boy , and were much talked of , and reprobated as immoral by the journalists of the day . He also made great progress in chemistry . He used to say , that nothing ever delighted him so nuich as the discovery that there /q/ grave . A few weeks before I had ridden with him and Lord Byron to this very spot , which I afterwards visited were no elements of earth , fire , or water ; but before he left school he nearly lost his life by being blown up in one of his experiments , and gave up the pursuit . He now turned his mind to metaphysics , and became infected with the materialism of the French school . Even before he was sent to University College , Oxford , he had entered into an epistolary theological controversy with a dignitary of the Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the second term , he printed a pamphlet with a most extravagant title , ' The Necessity of Atheism . ' This silly work , which was only a recapitulation of some of the arguments of Voltaire and the philosophers of the day , he had the madness to circulate among the bench of Bishops , not even disguising his name . The consequence was an obvious one : - he was summoned before the heads of the College , and , refusing to retract his opinions , on the contrary preparing to argue them with the examining Masters , was expelled the University . This disgrace in itself affected Shelley but little at the time , but was fatal to all his hopes of happiness and prospects in Ufe ; for it deprived him of his first love , and was the eventual means of alienating him for ever from his family . For some weeks after this expulsion his father refused to receive him under his roof ; and when he did , treated him with such marked coldness , that he soon quitted what he no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ more than once . In front was a magnificent extent of the blue and windless Mediterranean , with the Isles of Elba thence eloped to Gretna Green with a Miss Westbrook , - their united ages amounting to thirty-three . This last act exasperated his father to such a degree , that lie now broke off all communication with Shelley . After some stay in Edinburgh , we trace him into Ireland ; and , that country being in a disturbed state , find him publishing a pamphlet , which had a great sale , and the object of which was to soothe the minds of the people , teUing them that moderate firmness , and not open rebellion , would most tend to concihate , and to give them their Uberties . He also spoke at some of their public meetings with great fluency and eloquence . Returning to England the latter end of 1812 , and being at that time an admirer of Mr. Southey 's poems , he paid a visit to the Lakes , where himself and his wife passed several days , at Keswick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with ' The Age of Reason , ' ' Spinosa , ' and ' The Pohtical Justice , ' composed his ' Queen Mab , ' and presented it to most of the literary characters of the day - among the rest to Lord Byron , who speaks of it in his note to ' The Two Foscari ' thus : - " I shewed it to Mr. " Sotheby as a poem of great power and imagination . I never m rote " a line of the Notes , nor ever saw them except in their published " form . No one knows better than the real author , that his opinions /q/ and Gorgona , - Lord Byron 's yacht at anchor in the offing : on the other side an almost boundless extent of sandy " and mine differ materially upon the metaphysical portion of that " work ; though , in common with all who are not blinded by baseness " and bigotry , I highly admire the poetry of that and his other produc. " tions . " It is to be remarked here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into the hands of a knavish bookseller , who published it on his own account ; and on its publication and subsequent prosecution Shelley disclaimed the opinions contained in that work , as being the crude notions of his youth . His marriage , by which he had two children , soon tm'ned out ( as might have been expected ) an unhappy one , and a separation ensuing in 1816 , he went abroad , and passed the summer of that year in Switzerland , where the scenery of that romantic country tended to make Nature a passion and an enjoyment ; and at Geneva he formed a friendship for Lord Byron , which was destined to last for life . It has been said that the perfection of every thing Lord Byron wrote at Diodati , ( his Third Canto of * Childe Harold , ' his ' Manfred , ' and ' Prisoner of ChiUon , ' ) owed sometliing to the critical judgment that Shelley exercised over those works , and to his dosing him ( as he used to say ) with Wordsworth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Memoii ' at Como , where he wrote ' Rosalind and Helen , ' an eclogue , and an ode to the 2i2 /z/ Avilderness , uncultivated and uninhabited , here and there interspersed in tufts with underwood curved by the sea- Eugaiiean Hills , marked with great pathos and beauty . His first visit to Italy was short , for he was soon called to England by his wife 's melancholy fate , which ever after threw a cloud over his own . The year subsequent to this event he married Mary VVolstonecraft Godwin , daughter of the celebrated Mary Wolstonecraft and Godwin ; and shortly before this period , heir to an income of many thousands a-year and a baronetage , he was in such pecuniary distress that he was nearly dying of hunger in the streets ! Finding , soon after his coming of age , that he was entitled to some reversionary property in fee , he sold it to his father for an annuity of 1 000/. a-year , and took a house at Marlow , where he persevered more than ever in his poetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckinghamshire tliat he wrote his ' Alastor , or the Spuit of Solitude ; ' perhaps one of the most perfect specimens of harmony in blank verse that our language possesses , and full of the wUd scenes which his imagination had treasured up in his Alpine excursions . In this poem he deifies Nature lauch in the same way that " Wordsworth did in his earlier productions . . Inattentive to pecuniary matters , and generous to excess , he soon found that he could not live on his income ; and , still unforgiven by his family , he came to a resolution of quitting his native country , and never returning to it . There was another circumstance also that tended to disgust him with England : his children were taken from him /q/ breeze , and stunted by the barren and dry nature of the soil in which it grew . At equal distances along the coast by the Lord Chancellor , on the ground of his Atheism . He again crossed the Alps , and took up his residence at Venice . There he strengthened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Islam , ' an allegorical poem in the Spenser stanza . Noticed very favourably in Blackwood 's Magazine , it fell under the lash of ' The Quarterly , ' which indidged itself in much personal abuse of the author , both openly in the review of that woik , and insidiously under the critique of Hunt 's ' Foliage . ' Perhaps little can be said for the philosophy of ' The Loves of Laon and Cythra . ' Like Mr. Owen of Lanark , he believed in the perfectibility of human nature , and looked forward to a period when a new golden age woidd return to earth , - when all the different creeds and systems of the world wovdd be amalgamated into one , - crime disappear , - and man , freed from shackles civil and religious , bow before the throne " of his own aweless soul , " or " of the Power unknown . " Wild and visionary as such a speculation must be confessed to be in the present state of society , it sprang from a mind enthusiastic in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amelioration of mankind and of society : and however mistaken the means of bringing about this reform or " revolt " ' may be considered , the object of his whole life and writings seems to have been to develope them . This is particularly observable in his next work ' The Prometheus Unbound , ' a bold /z/ stood high square towers , for the double purpose of guarding the coast from smuggUng , and enforcing the quaran- attempt to revive a lost play of jEschylus . This drama shews an acquaintance with the Greek tragedy-writers Avhich perhaps no other person possessed in an equal degree , and was written at Rome amid the flower-covered ruins of the Baths of Caracalla . At Rome also he formed the story of ' The Cenci ' into a tragedy , which , but for the harrowing nature of the subject , and the jjrejudice against any thing bearing his name , could not have failed to have had the greatest success , - if not on the stage , at least in the closet . Lord Byron was of opinion that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unworthy of the immediate followers of Shakspeare . After passing several months at Naples , he finally settled with his lovely and amiable wife in Tuscany , where he passed the last four years in domestic retirement and intense application to study . His acquirements were great . He was , perhaps , the first classic in Europe . The books he considered the models of style for prose and poetry were Plato and the Greek dramatists . He had made himself equally master of the modern languages . Calderon in Spanish , Petrarch and Dante in Italian , and Goethe and Schiller in German , were his favourite authors . French he never read , and said he never could understand the beauty of Racine. /q/ tine laws . This view was bounded by an immense extent of the Italian Alps , which are here particularly picturesque Discouraged by the ill success of his writings - persecuted by the malice of his enemies - hated by the world , an outcast from his family , and a martyr to a painful complaint , - he was subject to occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , though he continued to write , he had given up pubUshing . There were two occasions , however , that induced him to break through his resolution . His ardent love of liberty inspired hun to write ' Hellas , or the Triumph of Greece , ' a drama , since translated into Greek , and which he inscribed to his friend Prince Maurocordato ; and his attachment to Keats led him to publish an elegy , which he entitled ' Adonais . ' This last is perhaps the most perfect of all his compositions , and the one he himself considered so . Among the mourners at the funeral of his poet-friend he draws this portrait of himself ; ( the stanzas were afterwards expunged from the Elegy : ) " ' Mid others of less note came one frail form , - A phantom among men , - companionless As the last cloud of an expiring storm , Whose thimder is its knell . He , as I guess , Had gazed on Natures naked loveliness /z/ from their volcanic and manifold appearances , and which being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow . Actaeon-like ; and now he fled astray With feeble steps on the world 's wilderness , And his own thoughts along that laigged wayPursued , like raging hounds , their father and then " prey . His head was bound with pansies overblown , And faded violets , white and pied and blue ; And a light spear , topp cl with a cypress cone , ( Round whose rough stem dark ivy tresses shone , Yet dripping with the forest 's noonday dew , ) Vibrated , as the ever-beating heart Shook the Aveak hand that grasp 'd it . Of that crew He came the last , neglected and apart , - A herd-abandon 'd deer , struck by the hunter 's dart ! " The last eighteen months of Shelley 's life were passed in daily intercourse with Lord Byron , to whom the amiability , gentleness , and elegance of his manners , and his great talents and acquirements , had endeared him . Like his friend , he wished to die young : he perished in the twenty-ninth year of his age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upsetting of an open boat . The sea had been to him . /q/ As a foreground to this picture appeared as extraordinary a group . Lord Byron and Trelawney were seen standing as well as Lord Byron , ever the greatest delight ; and as early as 1813 , in the following lines written at sixteen , he seems to have anticipated that it would prove his gi'ave . " To-morrow comes : Cloud upon cloud with dark and deep'ning mass RoU o'er the blacken 'd waters ; the deep roar Of distant thunder mutters awfully : Tempest imfolds its pinions o'er the gloom That shrouds the boding surge ; the pitiless fiend With all his winds and lightnings tracks his prey ; The torn deep yawns , - the vessel finds a grave Beneath its jagged jaws . " For fifteen days after the loss of the vessel his body was undiscovered ; and when found , was not in a state to be removed . In order to comply with his wish of being buried at Rome , his corpse was directed to be burnt ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executor , and duty as a friend , superintended the ceremony which I have described . The remains of one who was destined to have little repose or happiness here , now sleep , with those of his fiiend Keats , in the burial- /z/ over the burning pile , with some of the soldiers of the guard ; and Leigh Hunt , whose feelings and nerves could not carry him through the scene of horror , lying back in the carriage , - the four post-horses ready to drop with the intensity of the noonday sun . The stillness of all around was yet more felt by the shrill scream of a solitary curlew , which , perhaps attracted by the body , wheeled in such narrow circles round the jiile that it might have been struck with the hand , and was so fearless that it could not be driven away . Looking at the corpse , Lord Byron said , " Why , that old black silk handkerchief retains its form * ' better than that human body ! " Scarcely was the ceremony concluded , when Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to dissipate , in some degree , the impression of it by his favourite recreation . He took off his clothes therefore , and swam off to his yacht , which was riding a few miles distant . The heat of the sun and checked perspiration threw him into a fever , which he felt coming on before he left the water , ground near Caius Cestus 's PjTamid ; - " a spot so beautiful , " said he , " that it might abnost make one in love with death . " /q/ and which became more violent before he reached Pisa . On his return he immediately ordered a warm bath . " I have been very subject to fevers , " said he , " and am " not in the least alarmed at this . It will yield to my usual " remedy , the bath . " The next morning he was perfectly recovered . When I called , I found him sitting in the garden under the shade of some orange-trees , with the Countess . They are now always together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bestows on her all the pretty cUminutive epithets that are so sweet in Itahan . His kindness and attention to the Guiccioli have been invariable . A three years ' constancy proves that he is not altogether so unmanageable by a sensible woman as might be supposed . In fact no man is so easily led : but he is not to be driven . His spirits are good , except when he speaks of Shelley and Williams . He tells me he has not made one voyage in his yacht since their loss , and has taken a disgust to sailing . " I have got Hunt with me , " said he . " I will tell you " how I became acquainted with hira. /z/ " One of the first visits I paid to Hunt was in prison . I " remember Lady Byron was with me in the carriage , and " I made her wait longer than I intended at the gate of the " King 's Bench . " When party feeUng ran highest against me , Hunt was " the only editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dared say a word in my justification . I shall always " be grateful to him for the part he took on that occasion . " It was manly in him to brave the obloquy of standing " alone . " Shelley and myself furnished some time ago a suite " of apartments in my house for him , which he now occu " pies . I believe I told you of a plan we had in agita " tion for his benefit . His principal object in coming out " was to establish a literary journal , whose name is not " yet fixed . " I have promised to contribute , and shall probably make " it a vehicle for some occasional poems ; - for instance , I " mean to translate Ariosto . I was strongly advised by " Tom Moore , long ago , not to have any connection with " such a company as Hunt , Shelley , and Co. ; but I /q/ " have pledged myself , and besides could not now , if I " had ever so great a disinclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes . He has a large family , has " undertaken a long journey , and undergone a long series " of persecutions . " Moore tells me that it was proposed to him to con " tribute to the new publication , but that he had de " clined it . You see I can not get out of the scrape . " The name is not yet decided upon , - half-a-dozen have " been rejected . " Hunt would have made a fine writer , for he has a great " deal of fancy and feeling , if he had not been spoiled by " circumstances . He was brought up at the Blue-coat " foundation , and had never till lately been ten miles from " St. Paul 's . What poetry is to be expected from such a " course of education ? He has his school , however , and " a host of disciples . A friend of mine calls ' Rimini , , " Niynini Pimiju ; and ' Foliage , ' Follyage . Perhaps he " had a tumble in * climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Rimini ' has a great deal of merit . There never were " so many fine things spoiled as in ' Rimini . ' " " Since you left us , " said he , " I have had serious " thoughts of visiting America ; and when the Gambas " were ordered out of Tuscany , was on the point of em " barkation for the only country which is a sanctuary for " liberty . " Since I have been abroad , I have received many civi " lities from the Americans * ; among the rest , I was * I have been favoured with a sight of a letter addressed liy Lord Byron to Mr. Cliurch , one of the American Consuls , in which he thus speaks of his Grecian project a few months after : " The accounts are so contradictory , as to what mode will be best " for supplying the Greeks , tliat I have deemed it better to take up " ( with the exception of a few supplies ) what cash and credit I " can muster , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * deemed superfluous or unnecessary . Here we can learn nothing " but from some of the refugees , who appear chiefly interested for " themselves ; ' My accounts from an agent of the Committee , an /q/ " acquainted with the captain of one of their frigates " lying in the Leghorn roads , and used occasionally to " dine on board his ship . He offered to take me with " him to America . I desired time to consider ; but at " last declined it , not wishing to relinquish my Grecian " project . " Once landed in that country , perhaps I should not " have soon left it ; - I might have settled there , for I shall " never revisit England . On Lady Noel 's death , I thought " I should have been forced to go home ( and was for a " moment bent on doing so on another occasion , which " you know ) ; but I told Hanson that I would rather make " any sacrifice . " The polite attentions of the American sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the captain " English gentleman lately gone up to Greece , are hitherto favour " able ; but he had not yet reached the seat of the Provisional " Government , and I am anxiously expecting further advice .

We led the same sort of life in town , and travelled in company a great part of the years 1809 , 10 , and 11 . He was present at my marriage , and was with me in 1816 , after my separation . We were at Venice , and visited Rome together , in 1817 . The greater part of my ' Childe Harold ' was composed when we were together , and I could do no less in gratitude than dedicate the /q/ " complete poem to him . The First Canto was inscribed " to one of the most beautiful little creatvu-es I ever saw , " then a mere child : Lady Charlotte Harleigh was my " lanthe . " Hobhouse 's Dissertation on Italian literature is much " superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " understood the antiquities better than Nibbi , or any of " the Cicerones ; but the knowledge is somewhat mis " placed where it is .

You have often heard me " speak of him . The tribute I paid to his memory was a " very inadequate one , and ill expressed what I felt at " his loss . " It may be asked when Lord Byron writes . The same question was put to Madame de Stael : " Vous ne comptez pas sur ma chaise-a-porteur , " said she .

The fairness too of his manuscripts ( I do not speak of the handwriting ) astonishes no less than the perfection of every thing he writes . He hardly ever alters a word for whole pages , and never corrects a line in subsequent editions . I do not believe that he has ever read his works over since he examined the proof-sheets ; and yet he remembers every word of them , and every thing else worth remembering that he has ever known , I never met with any man who shines so much in conversation . He shines the more , perhaps , for not seeking to shine . His ideas flow without effort , without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not nice about expressions or words ; - - there are no concealments in him , no injunctions to secresy . He tells every thing /q/ that he has thought or done without the least reserve , and as if he wished the whole world to know it ; and does not throw the slightest gloss over his errors . Brief himself , he is impatient of difFuseness in others , hates long stories , and seldom repeats his own . If he has heard a story you are telling , he will say , " You told me that , " and with good humour sometimes finish it for you himself He hates argument , and never argues for victory . He gives every one an opportunity of sharing in the conversation , and has the art of turning it to subjects that may bring out the person with whom he converses . He never shews the author , prides himself most on being a man of the world and of fashion , and his anecdotes of life and living characters are inexhaustible . In spirits , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miserly in trifles - about to lavish his whole fortune on the Greeks ; to-day diminishing his stud - to-morrow taking a large family under his roof , or giving 1000/. for a yacht ; * /z/ dining for a few Pauls when alone , - spending hundreds when he has friends . " Nil fuit unquam sic impar sibi . " I am sorry to find that he has become more indolent . He has almost discontinued his rides on horseback , and has starved himself into an unnatural thinness ; and his digestion is become weaker . In order to keep up the stamina that he requires , he indulges somewhat too freely in wine , and in his favourite beverage , Hollands , of which he now drinks a pint almost every night . He said to me humorously enough - " Why do n't you drink , Medwin ? Gin-and-water is the " source of all my inspiration .

" Born an aristocrat , I am naturally one by temper , " said Lord Byron . Many of the lines in ' The Hours of Idleness , ' particularly the Farewell to Newstead , shew that in early life he prided himself much on his ancestors : but it is their exploits tliat he celebrates ; and when he mentioned his having * The following passage in an unpublished life of Alfieri , which I lately met with , might not inaptly be applied to Lord Byron : " Des son enfance tous les symptomes d'un caractere fier , indomtable et melancolique se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mais quelquefois tres babillard , tres vif , et presque toujours dans les extremes - obstine et rebelle a la force , tres soumis aux avis donnes par amitid ; contenu plutot par la crainte d ' etre grond , que par toute autre chose ; inflexible quand on voudroit le prendre a rebours ; - tel fut-il dans ses jeunes annees. " /z/ had his pennant hauled down , he said they might have respected a descendant of the great navigator . Ahnost from infancy he shewed an independence of character , which a long minority and a maternal education contributed to encourage . His temper was quick , but he never long retained anger . Impatient of control , he was too proud to justify himself when right , or if accused , to own himself wrong ; yet no man was more unopiniated , more open to conviction , and more accessible to advice , * when he knew that it proceeded from friendship , or was motived by affection or regard . " Though opposed to the foreign policy of England , he was no revolutionist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all his friends Sir Valter Scott had the most influence over him . The sight of his hand-writing , he said , put him in spirits for the day . Shelley 's disapprojiation of a poem caused him to destroy it . In compliance with the wishes of the pubhc , he relinquished the drama . Disown it as he may , he is ambitious of fame , and almost as sensitive as Voltaire or Rousseau : even the gossip of this litde town annoys him . " Extract Jrom a Letter to a Friend , written at Pisa . /q/ constitution of his own country , was that he wished to see it transplanted on the Continent , and over the world : and his first and last aspirations were for Greece , her liberty and independence . " Like Petrarch , disappointed love , perhaps , made him a poet . You know my enthusiasm about him . I consider him in poetry what Michael Angelo was in painting : he aimed at sublime and effect , rather than the finishing of his pictures ; he flatters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . If the eagle flights of his genius can not always be followed by the eye , it is the fault of our weak vision and limited optics . It requires a mind particularly organized to dive into and sound the depths of his metaphysics . What I admire is the hardihood of his ideas - the sense of power that distinguishes his writings from all others . He told me that , when he wrote , he neither knew nor cared what was coming next. * This is the real inspiration of the poet . But , note or text . I never know the word which will come next . " Don Juan , Canto IX . Stanza 41. /z/ " Which is the finest of his works ? - It is a question I have often heard discussed . I have been present when ' Childe Harold/ ' Manfred/ ' Cain/ ' The Corsair/ and even ' Don Juan/ were named ; - a proof , at least , of the versatility of his powers , and that he succeeded in many styles of writing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , - a work on his poetical character and writings is already before the public " Lord Byron 's has been called the Satanic school of poetry . It is a name that never has stuck , and never will stick , but among a faction . " To superficial or prejudiced readers he appeared to confound virtue and vice ; but if the shafts of his ridicule fell on mankind in general , they were only levelled against the hypocritical cant , the petty interests , and despicable cabals and intrigues of the age . No man respected more the liberty from which the social virtues emanate . No writings ever tended more to exalt and ennoble the dignity of man and of human nature . A generous action , the memory of I alluded to Sir E. Brydges ' Letters . /q/ patriotism , self-sacrifice , or disinterestedness , inspired him with the subHniest emotions , and the most glowing thoughts and images to express them ; and his indignation of tyranny , vice , or corruption , fell like a bolt from Heaven on the guilty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate , private and political , with which he has been assailed . But ' in defiance of politics , - in defiance of personality , - his strength rose with oppression ; and , laughing his opponents to scorn , he forced the applause he disdained to solicit . ' " That he was not perfect , who can deny ? But how many men are better ? - how few have done more good , less evil , in their day ? ' Bright , brave , and glorious was his young career ! ' And on his tomb may be inscribed , as is on that of Raleigh - ' Reader ! should you reflect on his errors , Remember his many virtues , And that he was a mortal ! ' " /z/ The high admiration in which Lord Byron was held in Germany may be appreciated by the following communication , and tribute to his memory , which I have just received from the illustrious and venerable Goethe , who , at the advanced age of seventy-five , retains all the warmth of his feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Qth July , 1824 . " It has been thought desirable to have some details relative to the commvuiication that existed between Lord Noel Byron , alas ! now no more ! and Goethe : a few words will comprise the whole subject . " The German poet , who , up to his advanced age , has habituated himself to weigh with care and impartiality the merit of illustrious persons of his own time , as well as his immediate contemporaries , from a consideration that this knowledge would prove the surest means of advancing his own , might well fix his attention on Lord Byron ; and , having watched the dawn of his great and early talents , could not fail to follow their progress through his important and uninterrupted career . " It was easy to observe that the public appreciation of his /q/ merit as a poet increased progressively with the increasing perfection of his works , one of which rapidly succeeded another . The interest which they excited had been productive of a more unmingled delight to his friends , if selfdissatisfaction and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers of an imagination all-comprehensive and sublime , and thrown a blight over an existence which the nobleness of his nature gifted him with a more than common capacity for enjoying . " His German admirer , however , not permitting himself to come to a hasty and erroneous conclusion , continued to trace , with undiminished attention , a life and a poetical activity equally rare and irreconcileable , and which interested him the more forcibly , inasmuch as he could discover no parallel in past ages with which to compare them , and found himself utterly destitute of the elements necessary to calculate respecting an orb so eccentric in its course . " In the mean while , the German and his occupations did not remain altogether unknown or unattended to by the Enghsh writer , who not only furnished unequivocal proofs of an acquaintance with his works , but conveyed to him . /z/ through the medium of travellers , more than one friendly salutation . " Thus I was agreeably surprised by indirectly receiving the original sheet of a dedication of the tragedy of ' Sardanapalus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and accompanied by a request that it might be printed at the head of the work . " The German poet , in his old age , well knowing himself and his labours , could not but reflect with gratitude and diffidence on the expressions contained in this dedication , nor interpret them but as the generous tribute of a superior genius , no less original in the choice than inexhaustible in the materials of his subjects ; - and he felt no disappointment when , after many delays , ' Sardanapalus ' appeared without the preface : he , in reality , already thought himself fortunate in possessing a fac-siinile in lithograph* , and attached to it no ordinary value . " It appeared , however , that the Noble Lord had not * Goethe does not mention of what nature the lithograph was . /q/ renounced his project of shewing his contemporary and companion in letters a striking testimony of his friendly intentions , of which the tragedy of ' Werner ' contains an extremely precious evidence . " It might naturally be expected that the aged German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unhoped-for kindness ( proof of a disposition so thoroughly amiable , and the more to be prized from its rarity in the world ) , should also prepare , on his part , to express most clearly and forcibly a sense of the gratitude and esteem with which he was affected . " But this undertaking was so great , and every day seemed to make it so much more difficult , - for what could be said of an earthly being whose merit could not be exhausted by thought , or comprehended by Avords ? " But when , in the spring of 1823 , a young man of amiable and engaging manners , a Mr. S , brought , direct from Genoa to Weimar , a few words under the hand of this estimable friend , by way of recommendation , and when shortly after there was spread a report that the Noble /z/ Lord was about to consecrate his great powers and varied talents to high and perilous enterprize , I had no longer a plea for delay , and addressed to him the following hasty stanzas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm South , Ijringing communion sweet , - Calling us amid noblest thoughts to wander Free in our souls , though fetter 'd in our feet . How shall I , who so long his bright i ) ath traced , Say to him words of love sent from afar ? - To him who with his inmost heart hath struggled , Long wont with fate and deepest woes to war ? May he be happy ! - thus himself esteeming . He well might coimt himself a favoured one ! By his loved Muses all his sorrows banish 'd . And he self-known , - e'en as to me he ' s known ! " " These lines arrived at Genoa , but found him not . This excellent friend had already sailed ; but , being driven back by contrary winds , he landed at Leghoi-n , where this effusion of iny heart reached him . On the eve of his departure , July 23d , 1823 , he found time to send me a reply , full of the most beautiful ideas and the divinest sentiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth and friendship among the choicest documents which I possess . " What emotions of joy and hope did not that paper once excite ! - but now it has become , by the premature death of its noble writer , an inestimable relic , and a source of unspeakable regret ; for it aggravates , to a peculiar degree in me , the mourning and melancholy that pervade the whole moral and poetical world , - in me , who looked forward ( after the success of his great efforts ) to the prospect of being blessed with the sight of this master-spirit of the age , - this friend so fortunately acquired ; and of having to welcome , on his return , the most humane of conquerors . " But still I am consoled by the conviction , that his country will at once awake , and shake off , like a troubled dream , the partialities , the prejudices , the injuries , and the calumnies with which he has been assailed , - that these will subside and sink into oblivion , - that she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of temperament , or the defect of the times in which he lived , ( against which even the best of mortals wrestle painfully , ) /z/ were only momentary , fleeting , and transitory ; whilst the imperishable greatness to which he has raised her now aiul for ever remains , and will remain , illimitable in its glory , and incalculable in its consequences . Certain it is , that a nation who may well pride herself on so many great sons , will place Byron , all radiant as he is , by the side of those who have done most honour to her name .

You only did me too much honour in what you were pleased to say in that work ; but it has hardly given me less i ) leasure than the praise itself , to become at length aware ( which I have done by mere accident ) that I am indebted for it to one of whose good opinion I was really ambitious . So many changes have taken place since that period in the Milan circle , that I hardly dare recur to it ; - some dead , some banished , and some in the Austrian dungeons . - Poor Pellico !

You say that " his character is little worthy of enthusiasm , " at the same time that you mention his productions in the manner they deserve . I have knowm Walter Scott long and well , and in occasional situations which call forth the real character - and I can assure you that his character is worthy of admiration - that of all men he is the most opeji , the most honourable , the most amiable . With his politics I have nothing to do : tliey differ froni mine , which renders it difficult for me to speak of them .

Attribute it to what motive you please , but believe the truth . I say that Walter Scott is as nearly a thorough good man as man can be , Ijecause I know it by experience to be the case . If you do me the honour of an answer , may I request a speedy one ? - because it is possible ( though not yet decided ) that circumstances may conduct me once more to Greece . My present address is Genoa , where an answer will reach me in a short time , or be forwarded to me wherever I may be . I beg you to believe me , with a Uvely recollection of our brief acquaintance , and the hope of one day renewing it , Your ever obUged And obedient humble servant , ( Signed ) NOEL BYRON . /z/ The Editor is indebted fur the following interesting Account of Lord Byron 's Residence in Greece , &c.; to " The Westminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high name in the periodical literature of England . The motives which induced Lord Byron to leave Italy and join the Greeks struggling for emancipation from the yoke of their ignorant and cruel oppressors , are of so obvious a nature , that it is scarcely worth while to allude to them . It was in Greece that his high poetical faculties had been first most powerfully developed ; and they who know the delight attendant , even in a very inferior degree , upon this intellectual process , will know how to appreciate the tender associations which , " soft as the memory of buried love , " cling to the scenes and the persons that have first stimulated the dormant genius . Greece , a land of the most venerable and illustrious Iiistory , of a peculiarly grand and beautiful scenery , inhabited by various races of the most wild and picturesque manners , was to him the land of excitement , - never-cloying , never-wearying , everchanging excitement : - such must necessarily have been the chosen and favourite spot of a man of powerful and original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restless and untameable spirit , of warm affections , of various information , - and , above all , of one satiated and disgusted with the formality , hypocrisy , and sameness of daily life . Dwelling upon that country , as it is clear from all Lord Byron 's writings he did , with the fondest solicitude , and being , as he was &#9632; well known to be , an ardent though jjerhaps not a very systematic lover of freedom , we may be certain that he was no unconcerned spectator of its recent revolution : and as soon as it appeared to him that his presence might be useful , he prepared to visit once more the shores of Greece . The imagination of Lord Byron , however , was the subject and servant of his reason - in this instance he did not act , and perhaps never did , under the influence of the delusions of a wild enthusiasm , by which poets , very erroneously as regards great poets , are supposed to be generally led . It was not until after very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after acquiring all possible information on the subject , that he determined on it ; and in this as in every other act regarding this expedition , as we shall find , proved himself a wise and practical philanthropist . Like aU men educated as he had been . Lord Byron too often probably obeyed the dictates of impulse , and threw up the reins to passions which he had never been taught the necessity of governing ; but the world are under a grievous mistake if they fancy that Lord Byron embarked for Greece with the ignorant ardour of a schoolboy , or the flighty fanaticism of a crusader . It appeared to him tJuit there was a good chance of his being useful in a country which he loved - a field of honourable distinction was open to him , and doubtless he expected to derive no mean gratification from witnessing so singular and instructive a spectacle as the emancipation of Greece . - A glorious career apparently presented itself , and he determined to try the event . When he had made up his mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his most intimate friends , and constant companions , then at Rome , saying , " T , YOU must have lieard I am going to Greece ; why do you not come to me ? I am at last determined - Greece is the only place I ever was contented in - I am serious - and did not WTite before , as I might have given you a journey for nothing : - they all say I can be of great use in Greece . I do not know how , nor do they , but at all events let us try ! " He had , says this friend , who knew him well , become ambitious of a name as distinguished for deeds , as it was already by his writings . It was but a short p 2 /z/ time before his decease , that he composed one of the most beautiful and touching of his songs on his 36tli birth-day , which remarkably jiroves the birth of this new passion . One stanza runs as follows : If thou regret thy youtli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Up to the field , and give Away thy breath - Awake vot GreeceShe is awake . Awake mi ) spirit ! - Lord Byron embarked from Legliorn and arrived in Cephalonia in the early part of August , 1 823 , attended by a suite of six or . seven friends in an English vessel ( the Hercules , Captain Scott ) , which he had hired for the express purpose of taking him to Greece . His Lordship had never seen any of the volcanic mountains , and for this purpose the vessel deviated from its regular course in order to pass the island of Stromboli . The vessel lay off ' this place a whole night in the hopes of witnessing the usual phenomena , when , for the first time within the memory of man , the volcano emitted no hre - the disappointed poet was obliged to proceed in no good humour with the fabled ftjrse of Vulcan . Lord Byron was an eager and constant observer of natine , and generally spent the principal part of the night in solitary contem ) ) lation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For many a joy could he from night 's soft presence glean . " He was far above any affectation of poetical ecstasy , but his whole works demonstrate the sincere delight he took in feeding his imagination with the glories of the material world . Marine imagery is more characteristic of his writings than those of any other poet , and it was to the Mediterranean and its sunny shores that he was indebted for it all . As the stately ves. - el glided slow Beneath the shadow of that ancient mount . He watched the hillows ' melancholy flow . And , sunk albeit in thought as he was wont , More placid seem 'd his eye , and smooth his pallid front . It was a point of the greatest inijiortance to determine on the particular part of Greece to which his Lordship should direct his course - the country /z/ was afflicted by intestine divisions , and Lord Byron thought that if he wished to serve it , he must keep aloof from faction . The different parties had their different seats of influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was in appearance to choose a party . In a country where communication is impeded by natural obstacles and unassisted by civilized regulations , which had scarcely succeeded in expelling a barbarian master , and where the clashing interests of contending factions often make it advantageous to conceal the truth , the extreme difficulty of procuring accurate information may be easily supposed . It , therefore , became necessary to make some stay in a place which might serve as a convenient jjost of observation , and from which assistance could be rendered where it appeared to be most needed . Cephalonia was fixed upon ; where Lord Byron was extremely well received by the English civil anil military authorities , who , generally speaking , seemed well inclined to further the objects of his visit to Greece . Anxious , however , to avoid involving the government of the island in any difficulty respecting himself , or for some other cause , he remained on board the vessel until further intelligence could be procured . At the time of Lord Byron 's arrival in the Ionian Islands , Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doubt of her ultimate success , was in a most unsettled state . The third campaign had commenced , and had already been marked by several instances of distinguished success . Odysseus and Niketas had already effectually harassed and dispersed the two armies of Yusuff Pasha , and jMustapha Pasha , who had entered Eastern Greece , by the passes of Thermopylfp . Corinth , still held by the Turks , was reduced to the greatest extremities - and , indeed , surrendered in the course of the autunni. - The Morea might almost be said to be thoroughly emancipated . Patras , Modon , and Coron , and the @#@ astle of the Morea , did then and still hold out against the combined assaults of famine and the troops of the besiegers . But the ancient Peloponnesus had , at this moment , more to fear from the dissensions of its chiefs , than the efforts of the enemy - they had absolutely assumed something like the character of a civil war . The generals had been ordered on different services , when it appeared that the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in satisfying old demands for arrears . Much confusion arose , and a bloody conflict actually took place in the streets of Tripolitza , between a troop of Spartiates /z/ and anotlicr of Arcadians , the followers of rival leaders . The military chiefs , at the head of whom was the able but avaricious Colocotronis , at that time Vice-president of the Executive Government , were jealous of the party which may be termed the civil faction . Over this party presided iVIavrocordatos ' who , as a Constantinopolitan , was considered as a foreigner , and who , on account of his being a dexterous diplomatist , a good letter-writer , and a lover of intrigue , was regarded with feelings of jealousy and hatred by the rude and iron-handed generals of the Morea . Mavrocordatos was Seci'etary for Foreign Affairs , and was accused of holding correspondence with foreign Courts without the knowledge of the Government , and of aiming at getting himself elected the President of the Legislative Body . It turned out that the actual President fled from the seat of government , and that Mavrocordatos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to retreat , and had just resigned the office and retired to the island of Hydra , where the civil and commercial pai-ty was strong , and where he was held in considerable estimation , when Lord Byron arrived at Cephalonia . At this moment , too , Western Greece was in a very critical situation - Mustapha . Pasha of Scutari , was advancing into Acarnania in large force , and was on the point of being resisted by the chivalrous devotion of the brave IVIarco Botzaris . This chief , worthy of the best days of Greece , succeeded on the 9th of August ( O.S. ) by his famous night-attack , in cutting off a considerable part of the Tiu'kish army , and fell a sacrifice to his generous efforts . In spite of this check , however , the Pasha advanced and proceeded towards Anatolicon and Messolonghi ; the latter place was invested by IMustajjha , and the Albanian chief , Onier-Vrioncs , by the early part of October . The Turkish fleet had arrived in the waters of Patras about the middle of June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the other ports of Western Greece , up to the ari-ival of Lord Byron . Previous to Marco Botzaris ' arrival at Carpenissi , the little village where he discomfited the Turks , he had heard of Lord liyron 's arrival in Greece ; and it is not a little remarkable that the last act he did before proceeding to the attack , was to write a warm invitation for his Lordship to come to Messolonghi , offering to leave the army , and to give him a public reception in a manner suitable to the occasion and serviceable to the cause . To all who know the circumstances of that memorable battle and the character /q/ of this heroic man , this letter can not fail to be interesting . We will translate the part which relates to Lord Byron . It is dated at the " piccolo villagio " " of Carpenissi on the of August . " I am delighted , " he says to a friend in Cephalonia , " with your account of Lord Byron 's disposition with respect to our country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention to Western Greece , has caused us the greatest satisfaction ; and I feel ohhged by your continued exertions in the service of our country . I am not a little pleased at his Lordship 's peculiar attention to my fellow-countrymen the Suliotes , on whom he has conferred the honour of selecting them for his guards . Avail yourself of this kindness of his Lordship , and persuade him to come as speedily as possible to jMessolonglii , where we will not fail to receive him with every mark of honour due to his person ; and as soon as I hear of his arrival , I will leave the army here and proceed to join him with a few companions . All will soon be right ; the disturbances in Roumelia are only temporary and m ill be easily settled . I trust you are informed of all that has occurred here- - that the Pacha of Scutari has advanced to Aspropotamos and Agrapha , and has penetrated to Carpenissi . We are going to meet him ; wa have possession of all the strong posts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Botzaris alludes to almost the first act of Lord Byron in Greece , which was the arming and provisioning of forty Suliotcs whom he sent to join in the defence of Messolonghi . After the battle he transmitted bandages and medicines , of which he had brought a large store from Italy , and pecuniary succour to those who had been wounded in the battle . He had already made a very generous offer to the Government , to which he himself alludes , as well as to the dissensions in Greece , in a letter of which this is an extract : " I offered to advance a thousand dollars a month for the succour of Messolonghi , and the Suliotes under Botzaris ( since kill 'd ) ; but the Government have answered me through of this island , that they wish to confer with me previously , which is in fact saying they wish me to expend my money in some other direction . I will take care that it is for the jiublic cause , otherwise I will not advance a para . The opposition say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power say the others wish to seduce me ; so between the two I have a difficidt part to play : however , I will have nothing to do with the factions , unless to reconcile them , if possible " Though strongly solicited in the most flattering manner by Count Metaxa , the Exarch of Messolonghi , and others to repair to that ) lace , Lord Byron had /z/ too reasonable a fear of falling into the hands of a party to take a decided step in his present state of information . - He determined to communicate alone with the established Government : for this purpose he despatched two of the friends who had accompanied him to Greece , Mr. Trelawney and Mr. Hamilton Browne , in order to deliver a letter from him to the Government , and to collect intelhgence respecting the real state of things . The extreme want of money which was at that time felt in Greece , and the knowledge that Lord Byron had brought large fvmds with the intention of devoting them to the cause , made all parties extremely eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the pressing entreaties that were made to him ; but after waiting undecided six weeks in his vessel he took up his residence on shore . Avoiding the capital of Cephalonia he retired to the small village of Metaxata , within five or six miles of Argostoli , wliere he remained all the time he was on the island . It is difficult for one iniaciiuainted with the European reputation of Lord Byron 's writings , and with the peculiar wants , and the peculiar character of the Greeks , to conceive a just idea of the sensation which his arrival created in Greece . It is impossible to read the letters which were addressed to him at this time from every quarter , and not be struck with the glorious sphere of action which presented itself , and at the same time not proportionately lament the stroke which deprived the country of his assistance before he had comparatively effected any thing of importance . Established at Metaxata as a convenient place of observation , he resumed his usual occupations , while he kept a watchful eye on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active intercourse ith e ery part of it . Those who know Lord Byron 's character , know that he rarely resisted the impulse of his feelings , and that fortunately these impulses were generally of the most benevolent kind . As usual , the neighbourhood of his residence never ceased to experience some kinil and nuuiificent exertion of his unfailing , but by no means indiscrimiriate or ill apj ) lied , generosity . His physician says , that the day seemed sad and gloomy to him when he had not employed liimself in some generous exertion . He provided even in Greece for many Italian families in distress , and indulged the people of the country even in paying for the religious ceremonies which they deemed essential to their success . Oiu ' informant mentions one circumstance in particular which aflbrtis some idea of the Avay in which he loved to be of service . While at Metaxata , the fall of a large mass of /q/ earth had buried some persons aHve . He heard of the accident while at dinner , and starting up from the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took with him a supply of medicines . The labourers , who were engaged in digging out their companions , soon became alarmed for themselves , and refused to go on , saying , they believed they had dug out all the bodies which had been covered by the ruins . Lord Byron endeavoured to induce them to continue their exertions ; but finding menaces in vain , he seized a spade and began to dig most zealously : at length the peasantry joined him , and they succeeded in saving two more persons from certain death . It was to Metaxata that Dr. Kennedy , a methodistical physician then residing in Cephalonia , used to resort for the purpose of instilling the importance of religious meditation and certain scriptural truths into the mind of Lord Byron , who had the reputation of not holding them in sufficient reverence . These conferences we are informed by an auditor of them , if not of the most instructive , were yet of a very amusing kind . The Doctor , though he is said to be an able man in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his Lordship ; who having the advantage quickness of intellect , and often in the clearness of his logic , would frequently put Dr. Kennedy 's ideas in disorder by a single vigorous onset . Lord Byron shewed a most remarkable acquaintance with the Bible , and by his quotations , apt ly applied to the question in dispute , very often brought his antagonist to a stand ; when , turning down the page , for he generally brought a little library of theology to the contest , he would promise to return to the next meeting with a full and satisfactory answer to the argument . The disputes chiefly turned upon the questions which are agitated between the different sects of Christians m England ; and the audience do not seem to think , that the Doctor had the advantao-e : he , however , flattered himself that he had made the desired impression ; for e are informed that he afterwards made particular inquiries of his Lordship 's suite , into any change that might have taken place in his antagonist 's manner of thinking and acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maliciously , we think , that Lord Byron merely entered into these discussions , in order to master the cant of this religious sect , as it was his intention in some future Canto to make Don Juan a Methodist . This is a very gratuitous supposition . Lord Byron had , when not irritated , the most courteous and affable manners ; he carried himself towards all who had access to him with /z/ the most scrupulous delicacy , and it was quite sufficient for Dr. Kennedy to desire these interviews , to procure them . Although some ludicrous scenes occurred , the admonitory party was treated with the utmost kindness , and full credit given to him for the purity of his intentions . The two friends whom Lord Byron had despatched to the Government proceeded to the Morea , and crossed the country to Tripolitza , from which place it appeared that the two assemblies had removed to Salamis . At Tripolitza , however , they had an ojiportimity of seeing Colocotronis , some of the other distinguished chiefs , as well as the confidential officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his precipitate retreat from the chair of the legislative assembly . Here , consequently , they were able to collect a considerable quantity of information , and procure answers to the questions with which Lord Byron had charged them ; after doing which , they proceeded onwards to the place where the assembly was collecting . The queries are of a very searching and judicious nature , and like the other extracts which we shall have to make from his correspondence , prove the aptitude of his intellect and the benevolence of his designs ; the answers to tliem , collected vith considerable care and discrimination , were complete enough to affi ; ) rd a very accurate idea of the state , resources , and intentions of the country . From the letters also he would be able to form a good idea of the contending factions , and the men who headed them : Colocotronis was found to be in great power ; his palace was filled with armed men , like the castle of some ancient feudal chief , and a good idea of his character may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he had told Mavrocordatos , that unless he desisted from his intrigues , he would put him on an ass and whip him out of the Morea ; and that he had only been withheld from doing it by the representations of his friends , who had said that it would injure the cause . He declared his readiness to submit to a democratic government if regularly constituted ; but swore that he and the other chiefs and their followers would shed the last drop of their blood , ratlier than submit to the intrigues of a foreigner . He himself at that time intended to proceed to the Congress at Salamis to settle the affairs of the country , and he invited Lord Byron and all the other British Phillhellenes to conununicate with the general Government , and to send their succours to them alone . His sentiments were shared by the other chiefs , and the name of Mavrocordatos was never mentioned with respect in the Peloponnesus , where it seemed he had LORD BYRON 'S RESIDENCE IN GREECE . gQ ? lost all Influence . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suite were very solicitous that Lord Byron 's friends should proceed to Hydra , instead of to Salamis , and expressed a hope that Lord Byron himself would act in the difference between the Prince and Colocotronis , not as a simple mediator , but in a decisive manner , " avec une main dejer as they were convinced that the former character would be useless . The Congress met at Salamis to deliberate on the most important questions - the form of the government , and the measures of the future campaign . The legislative assembly consisted of fifty , and the executive of five . Every thing is described as " wearing the appearance of reality - the chiefs and people acknowledging and , as far as strangers could judge , obeying the Government and its decrees . They received the agents of Lord Byron in the most friendly manner , and opened every thing to them without reserve - and enabled them to convey to him a very instructive account of the real state of affairs . Ulysses , ( Odysseus ) a brave and dexterous mountain-chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still in command of Athens , was about to lead 5000 Albanians into Negropont , whither Mr. Trelawney agreed to accompany him as his aide-de-camp , being promised any number of men he chose under his command , and under the expectation of passing the winter there very agreeably between Turk and woodcock shooting . Colocotronis and his son , a fine , spirited young man , with all their forces , were to undertake the siege of Patras . Tombasi , the admiral of Hydra , was in command at Candia , where active warfare was expected . Staicos was to remain at Corinth , which surrendered in October , very soon after the Congress . Marco Botzari 's brother with his Suliotes , and Mavrocordatos , were to take charge of Messolonghi , which at that time ( October 1823 ) , was in a very critical state , being blockaded both by land and sea . " There have been , " says Mr. Trelawney , " thirty battles fought and won by the late Marco Botzari and his gallant tribe of Suliotes , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in danger , and thousands of throats cut . A few thousand dollars would provide ships to relieve it - a portion of this sum is raised " - and Mr. Trelawney adds , in a spirit worthy of him and his deceased friend , " / would coin my heart to save this key of Greece . ' " A report like this was sufficient to show the point where succour was most needed ; and Lord Byron 's determination to relieve Messolonghi was still more decidedly confirmed by a letter which he received from Mavrocordatos from /z/ Hydra ( Oct. 21 ) , in answer to one which his Lordship had addressed to him on the subject of the dissensions which reigned in the Government , and the Prince 's desertion of his post . In this very able and creditable letter Mavrocordatos attempts to set Lord Byron right with respect to the dissensions in the Iorea , and points out with great justice that though the Government may be divided , the nation is not ; and that whatever at anytime may have been the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fought to the last extremity against the common enemy . He attributes such dis , -. ensions as do exist to the want of money ; and predicts their immediate disappearance when means are found to pay the fleets and armies . He goes on to speak of Lord IJyron 's intentions : - " I should do myself an injustice , ray Lord , if I vere not to speak to you with the frankness which you expect from me ; I ciinnot agree with you when you say your best plan is to rest in oljservation . I will never advise you to run the ri.sk of appearint ; to embrace the interests of a party ; I ) ut : dl the world knows , and no one better than myself , tliat you are come here with the firm intention of succouring Greece - this Greece is now before you , under your eyes ; you may see at the first glance which is the iart in danger , - that Slessolonghi is blockaded by land and by sea , that it is destitute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the Turks ; who afterwards will have no difiiculty in penetrating into the Morea and seizing upon its most fertile provinces , from whence it wiU be hard , nay , impossible to dislodge them . To carry succour to this place , to save it , is to save Greece itself . Is this declaring for a party ? Is it not rather to do that which the feelings of honour and humanity dictate to us all ? Influenced by these and other reasons , I never know vhen to leave off inviting you to come to the succour of ftlessolonghi . " At this time Mavrocordatos was endeavouring to collect a fleet for the relief of Messolonghi . Lord Byron ' ' s intentions , under the circumstances to wliich this letter alludes , may be seen from the following extract of a letter from him , dated the SOtli Oct. 18J3 . " Corinth is taken - and a Turkish squadron is said to be beaten in the Archipelago - the public progress of the Greeks is considerable - but their internal dissensions still cimtinue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mitigate or extinguish them - though neither is an easy task . I have remained here partly in expectation of the squadron in relief of Messolonghi , partly of Mr. Parry 's detachment , and partly to receive from Malta or Zante the sum of four liundred thousand piastres , which , at the desire of the Greek Government , I have advanced for the payment of the expected squadron . The Bills are negociating , and will be cashed in a siiort time , as thev could have been immediately in any other mart , but the miserable /z/ Ionian merchants have little money and no great credit , and are besides politically shy on this occasion , for although I had the letters of , one of the strongest houses of the Blediterranean , also of , there is no business to be done on fair terms except through English merchants ; these , however , have proved both able , and willing , and upright , as usual . " He continues - " It i.s my intention to proceed by sea , to Nauplia di Romania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean the advance of the 4tM ) , 000 piastres for the fleet . My time here has not been entirely lost ; indeed you will perceive by some former documents that any advantage from my then proceeding to the Iorea was doubtful . We have at last named the Deputies , and I have written a strong remonstrance on their divisions to Mavrocordatos , which I understand was forwarded to the legislative body by the Prince . " He did not , however , depart for the Government at the time he had expected , and conceived it necessary to address the Government arain on the subject of their dissensions . The following extract is a translation of the concluding part of this very admirable letter : " The affair of the Loan , - the expectation , so long and vainly indulged , of the arrival of the Greek fleet , and the dangers to which Alessolonglii is still exposed , have detained me here , and will still detain me till some of them are removed . But when the money shall be advanced for the fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , of what use my presence can be in the present state of things . We have heard some rumours of new dissensions - nay , of the existence of a civil war . With all my heart I desire that these reports may be false or exaggerated , for I can imagine no calamity more serious than this ; and I must frankly confess , that unless union and order are confirmed , all hopes of a loan will be vain , and all the assistance which the Greeks could expect from abroad - an assistance which might be neither trifling nor worthless - will be suspended or destroyed ; and what is worse , the great powers of Europe , of whom no one was an enemy to Greece , but seemed inclined to favour her in consenting to the establishment of an independent power , will be persuaded that the Greeks are unable to govern themselves , and will perhaps themselves undertake to arrange your disorders in such a way as to blast the brightest hopes you indulge , and which are indulged by your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , I desire the well-being of Greece and nothing else ; I will do all I can to secure it ; but I can not consent - I never will consent , to the English public , or English individuals , being deceived as to the real state of Greek affairs . The rest , gentlemen , depends on you - you have fought gloriously - act honourably towards your fellow-citizens and towards the world ; and then it will be no more said , as has been repeated for 2,000 years with /z/ the Roman historian , that Philopoemen was the last of the Grecians . Let not calumny itself ( and it is difficult to guard against it in so difficult a struggle ) compare the Turkish Pasha with the patriot Greek in peace , after you have exterminated him in war . " 30th Nov. 1823 . N. B. " In another letter , written a few days after this , we find a circumstance mentioned which probably turned his views from the Morea to Western Greece . It must be remembered that the Suliotes were his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them still higher in his estimation . " The Suliotes ( now in Acarnania ) are very anxious that I should take them under my direction , and go over and put things to rights in the Morea , which without a force seems impracticable ; and really though very reluctant , as my letters will have shown you , to take such a measure , there seems hardlv any milder remedy . However , I will not do any thing rashly , and have only continued here so long in the hope of seeing things reconciled , and have done all in my power there-for . Had I gone sooner they would have forced me into one party or the other , and I doubt as much now . But we will do our best . Dec. 7- 1823 . " His Lordship seems to have been too sensitive on this point , and , as we think , attached too great an importance to these dissensions . We may quote against him a sentence from a letter of one of his intimate friends . " I am convinced if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the liberty of Greece will be definitively founded on a firm basis . True , there is much difference of opinion existing amongst the people in authority here , as well as in every other country , and some little squabbling for place and power , but they all unite against the common enemy . Love of liberty and execration of their barbarous oppressors Mtuate them . What they want , to ensure success and consolidate the Government is , money - money - money . " Lord Byron in his correspondence , however , continues to allude to these uivfortunate differences , and is pleasant upon the gasconading which distinguishes the Greek of this day as it did the Greek of the age of Cleon . " C vill tell you the recent special interposition of the Gods in behalf of the Greeks , who seem to have no enemies in heaven or earth to be dreaded but their own tendency to discord among themselves . But these too , it is to be hoped , will be mitigated ; and then we can take the field on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guerre ' of defending the same fortresses year after year , and taking a few ships , and starving out a castle , and making more fuss about them than Alexander in his cups , or Buonaparte in a bidletin . Our friends have done something /q/ in the way of the Spartans , but they have not inherited their style . Dec. 10 , 1823 . " Soon after the date of this letter the long desired squadron arrived in the waters of Messolonghi ; and in a letter written three days after the date of the last , ( Dec. 1.3th. ) his Lordship says , " I momentarily expect advices from Prince Mavrocordatos , who is on board , and has ( I understand ) despatches from the legislative to me ; in consequence of which , after paying the squadron , I shall probably join him at sea or on shore . " In the same light and agreeable manner in which he touches upon every subject , he proceeds to speak of the committee supplies , which had been sent out to him as its agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great readiness , and executed with considerable judgment and discrimination . " The mathematical , medical , and musical preparations of the Committee have arrived in good condition , abating some damage from wet , and some ditto from a portion of the letter-press being spilt in landing ( I ought not to have omitted the press , but forgot it at the moment - excuse the same ) ; they are pronounced excellent of their kind , but till we have an engineer , and a trumpeter ( we have chirurgeons already ) , mere ' pearls to swine , ' as the Greeks are ignorant of mathematics , and have a bad ear for our music ; the maps , &c.; I will put into use for them , and take care that all ( with proper caution ) are turned to the intended uses of the Committee . " He speaks again of the supplies , however , with more pleasantry than foresight ; for the very articles which he seems to have thought thrown away , proved of remarkable service , more particularly the trumpets . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valour of the Franks , that even the supposed presence of a body of such troops , is sufficient to inspire a panic . The Greeks , aware of this , have frequently put their enemy in disorder by sounding these same despised bugles . The Greeks know this weak side of the Turks so well , that they sometimes consider a collection of old European hats a piece of anmiunition more effectual than much heavier artillery . The sight of a hat , if well-cocked , in the occidental fashion , espied among the Greek forces , is often as terrific as the sound of a trumpet . " The supplies of the committee are very useful , and all excellent in their kind , but occasionally hardly practical enough in the present state of Greece ; for instance , the mathematical instruments are thrown away ; none of the Greeks know a problem from a poker - we must conquer first , and plan afterwards .

" This determination never to desert the Greeks , as long as he could be of any service to tiiem , is repeatedly expressed in his correspondence . He concludes a letter to his banker , in Cephalonia , on business , with this sentence , " I hope things here will go well , some time or other -I will stick by the cause as long as a cause exists , first ' or second . ' ' ' ' Lord Byron had the more merit in the zeal and energy with which he espoused the interests of the Hellenic cause , for he had not suffered himself to be disgusted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by actual experience ; and he was too wise to be led away by a blind enthusiasm . He seems to have been actuated , /q/q/ the main , for we must not exjwct perfection either in Lord Byron or the Greeks , by a steady desire to benefit a people who deserved the assistance and sympathy of every lover of freedom and the improvement of mankind . He speaks to this point himself ; and liere we may remark , as in almost every line he ever wrote , the total absence of ( 7/q/q/q/ , - which unfortunately colours the writings and conversations of almost every man who imagines himself to live in the eye of the world . " I am happy to say that and myself are acting in perfect harmony together : he is likely to be of great service both to the cause and to the Committee , and is publicly as well as personally , a very valuable acquisition to our party , on every account .

He seems to have been chiefly delayed by the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety to procure supplies is a constant subject of his correspondence . " I have vritten/ ' he says , in a letter dated 13th Oct. 1823 , to our friend Douglas Kinnaird , on my own matter. , desiring him to send me out all the further credits he can command ( and I have a year 's income and the sale of a manor besides , he tells me , before me ) ; for till the Greeks get their loan , it is probable I shall have to stand partly paymaster , as far as I am ' good upon ' Change , ' that is to say . - I pray you to repeat as much to him ; and say that I must in the interim draw on Messrs .

" When the supphes were procured , and his other preparations made for departure , two Ionian vessels were hired , and embarking his horses and effects , his Lordship sailed from Argostoli on the 29th of December . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following day was occupied in making his pecuniary arrangements with Mr. , and after receiving a quantity of specie on board , he proceeded towards Mcssolonghi . Two accidents occurred on this short passage , which might have been attended with very serious consequences . Count Gamba , an intimate friend who had accompanied his Lordship from Leghorn , had been charged with the vessel in which the horses and part of the money were embarked ; when off Chiarenza , a point which lies between Zante and the place of their destination , they were surprised at day . light on finding themselves under the bows of a Turkish frigate . Owing , however , to the activity displayed on board Lord Byron 's vessel , and her superior sailing , she escaped , while the second was fired at , brought to , and carried into Patras . Gamba and his companions , being taken before YusufF /z/ Pasha , fully expected to share the fate of the unfortunate men whom tiiat sanguinary chief sacrificed last year at Prevesa , though also taken under the Ionian flag ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it not been for the presence of mind displayed by the Count . Aware that nothing but stratagem and effrontery could save him , he no sooner saw himself in the Pasha 's power , than assuming an air of hauteur and indifference , he accused the captain of the frigate of a scandalous broach of neutrality , in firing at and detaining a vessel under English colours , and concluded by informing Yusuff , that he might expect the vengeance of the British Government in thus interrupting a nobleman who was merely on his travels , and bound to Calamos ! * Whether the Turkish chief believed Gamba 's story , or being aware of the real state of the case , did not wish to proceed to extremities , he not only consented to the vessel 's release , but treated the whole party w ith the utmost attention , and even urged them to take a day 's shooting in the neighbourhood . Count Gamba gladly availed himself of these unexpected hospitalities , and sailing the next day , passed over to Messolonghi , where , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Owing to the wind 's becoming contrary , Lord Byron 's vessel took shelter at the Scrofes , a cluster of rocks within a few miles of Messolonghi ; but as this place afforded no means of defence in the event of an attack , it was thought advlseable to remove to Dagromestre , where every preparation in their power was made , should any of the enemy 's ships pursue them . Having remained three days at Dagromestre , the wind came round and allowed his Lordship once more to set sail . On hearing what had happened . * The treatment of Gamba and the crew , while on board the Turkish ship of war , was scarcely less courteous than that which they experienced on landing . This arose from a very singular coincidence . On their first mounting the frigate 's deck , the captain gave orders to put them all in irons , and might have proceeded to further extremities , when the master of the vessel went up to him , and asked " whether he did not recollect Spiro , who had saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Upon which the Turk , looking stedfastly at him for a few moments , exclaimed - " what ! can it be Spiro ? " and springing foi-ward , embraced his former deliverer with the greatest transport . This urdooked-for reception was followed by a promise that every effort would be made to obtain his speedy liberation on their arrival at Patras. /q/ Prince Mavrocordato despatched a gun-boat to accompany his Lordship 's vessel ; while a portion of the Greek squadron , stationed at Messolonghi , were also ordered to cruize in the offing , and prevent the Turkish vessels from approaching the coast . One of these coming up , the captain sent a boat on board , inviting his Lordship to make the remainder of his voyage on board of his ship ; this offer was , however , declined . As if the whole voyage was destined to be ominous of some future calamity , the vessel had not proceeded many miles before she grounded on a shoal near the Scrofes , and would probably have remained there , had it not been for the activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water and assisted to push the vessel off ; whilst their master urged the captain and crew to exert themselves , instead of invoking the Saints , as is customary with Greek sailors on such occasions. * As the wind continued to blow directly against their getting to Messolonghi , the vessel was again anchored between two of the numerous islets which line this part of the coast . Several gun-boats having arrived early the following morning , despatched from Messolonghi to accompany his Lordship , and assist him if required ; the vessel accordingly sailed , but was forced to anchor in the evening , nor did she reach the town before the following day . We can , however , give Lord Byron 's account of his situation on the Scrofes , which we find in a hasty letter written on board the Cephaloniote vessel in which he sailed from Argostoli . " We are just arrived here ( the letter is dated 31st Dec. 1823 ) , that is , part of my * His Lordship is described by his physician as conducting himself with admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words : " Ma nel di lui passaggio marittimo una fregata Turca insegui la di lui nave , obligandola di ricoverarsi dentro le Scrofen , dove per I'impeto dei venti fii gettata sopra i scogli : tutti i marinari e'l'equipaggio saharono a terra per salvare la loro vita : Milord solo col di lui Medico Dottr .

" " /z/ people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be as well not to specify in a letter ( which has a risk of being intercepted ) : but Gamba , and my horses , negro , steward , and the press and all the committee things - also some eight thousand dollars of mine ( but never mind , we have more left - do you understand ? ) * are taken by the Turkish frigate - and my party and myself in another boat , have had a narrow escape last night ( being close under their stern and hailed , but we would not answer and hove away ) as well as this morning . Here we are with snow and blowing weather , within a pretty little port enough ; but whether our Turkish friends may not send in their boats and take us out ( for we have no arms except two carbines and some pistols - and - I suspect - not more than four fighting people on board ) , is another question - especially if we remain long here - since we are blockaded out of Messolonghi by the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a body of Suliotes to escort us by land or by the canals , with all convenient speed .

I am uneasy at being here , not so much on my own account , as on that of the Greek boy with me - for you know what his fate would beand I would sooner cut him in pieces and myself , than have him taken out by those barbarians . " Lord Byron was received at Messolonghi with the most cntlmsiastic demonstrations of joy : no mark of honour or welcome which the Greeks could devise was omitted . The ships anchored off the fortress fired a salute as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the troops and the population collected together , met him on his landing , and accomj ) anied him to the house which had been prepared for him , amidst the shouts of the multitude and the discharge of cannon . Nothing could exceed the eagerness with which he had been expected , except the satisfaction which was displayed on his arrival . One of the first objects to which Lord Byron naturally turned his attention was to mitigate the ferocity with which the war had been carried on . This ferocity , not only excusable in the first instance , but absolutely necessary and /z/ unavoidable , had now in a great measure effected its object . The Greeks were by this time in a condition to be merciful ; and Lord liyron in the most judicious manner set about producing an improvement in the system of warfare on both sides . The very first day of his Lordship 's arrival was signalized by his rescuing a Turk , who had fallen into the hands of some Greek sailors . The individual thus saved , having been clothed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity occurred of sending him to Patras. * His Lordship had not been long at Messolonghi , before an opportunity presented itself for showing his sense of YusufF Pasha 's moderation in releasing Count Gamba . Hearing that there were four Turkish prisoners in the town , he requested that Prince Mavrbcordatos would place them in his hands ; this being immediately granted , they were sent to the castle of the Morea , near Patras , with the following letter addressed to the Turkish chief ; " Highness ! - A vessel in which a friend and some domestics of mine were embarked , was detained a few days ago , and released by order of your Highness . I have now to thank you , not for liberating the vessel , which , as carrying a neutral flag , Insepuendo un jjiorno un corsaro Greco , una nave carica di Turchi , uno di essi nell ' affrettarsi ad accomodare una vela per fuggire piu presto , cadde in mare , e gli riusci di portarsi a terra nuotando , ma due soldati Greci lo inseguivano per ammazzarlo ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nella casa d'abitazione di iMilord , il quale lo accolse subito , e lo nascose : giunti i due siiklati Greci , chiedono furiboudi coll ' armi alia mano e colle minaccie la restituzione deUa loro preda che volevano sacrificare ; Milord gli oflre qual somma volessero per riscattare 11 Turco ; ma i due soldati insistoho , colle armi in atto di ferire , a voler il prigimiicro per ammazzarlo ; allora IMilord rispose , giacche e cosi , me piuttosto annuazzerete clie quel povero iiifelice perisca !

" Messoloiighi , 23 January , 1824 . " " NOEL BYRON . " The above act was followed by another not less entitled to praise , while it proves how anxious his Lordship felt to give a new turn to the system of warfare hitherto pursued . A Greek cruizer having captured a Turkish boat , in which there were a number of passengers , cliiefly women and children , they were also placed in the hands of Lord Byron , at his particular request : upon which a vessel was immediately hired , and the whole of them , to the number of twenty-four , sent to Prevesa , provided with every requisite for their comfort during the passage . The letter which accompanied these poor people was answered by the Enghsh Consul Mr. Meyer , who thanked his Lordship in the name of Beker iga the Turkish Governor of that place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care equal attention should be in future siiown to the Greeks who became prisoners . Another grand object with Lord Byron , and one which he never ceased to forward with the most anxious solicitude , was to reconcile the quarrels of the native Chiefs , to make them friendly and confiding to one another , and submissive to the oi-ders of the Government . He had neither time nor much opportunity before his decease to carry this point to any great extent ; much good was however done ; and if we may judge from a few observations we find respecting the treatment of Sisseni , a fractious chief of Gastouni , we may be certain that it was done with a wise and licaling hand . " If Sisseni is sincere , he will be treated with , and ivcll treated : if lie is not , the sin and the shame may lie at his own door . One great object is , to heal these inter . /q/ nal dissensions for the future , without exacting a too rigorous account of the past . The Prince Mavrocordatos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act fairly will be fairly dealt vith . I haie heard a good deal of Sisseni , but not a deal of sood- However , I never judge by report , particularly in a revolution : personally I am rather obliged to him , for he has been very hospitable to all friends of mine who have passed through his district . You may therefore answer him , that any overtures for the advantao-e of Greece and its internal pacification will be readily and sincerely met here . I hardly think he would have ventured a deceitful proposition to me through you , because he must be sure that in such case it would be eventually exposed . At any rate , the healing of these dissensions is so important a point , that something must be risked to obtain it . " Sisseni is the Capitario of the rich and fertile plain of Gastouni , who at first paid but a very uncertain obedience to the Government ; but now , observing its increase in power and apparent security , had begun to make overtures for a regular submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Morea , like those of Sisseni , are Turkish : they live surrounded by a mixture of splendour and misery , with a sort of court like those of other petty monarchs , filled with soldiers , harlots , and buffoons . Mavrocordatos in his invitations to Lord Byron had dwelt on the importance of his Lordship 's presence at Messolonghi , and had no doubt fired his by the anticipations of success , and the scenes of brilliant achievement which he laid before him . " Soyez persuade , Milord , " he says , among much of the same kind , " qu'il ne dependra que de vous , d'assurer le sort de la Grece . Lepante et Patras , cern6s par terre et par mer , ne tarderont pas de capituler ; et maitres de ces deux places , nous pouvons former des projets de Toccupation de Thessahe f Accordingly , Lord Byron landed at Messolonghi , animated with mihtary ardour , and became , as one of the letters from the place , dated soon after his landing , expresses it , soldier-mad . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the expectation of receiving its arrears from the loan which he promised to make to the Provisional Government , he set about forming a brigade of Suliotes . Five hundred of these , the bravest and most resolute of the soldiers of Greece , were taken into his pay on the 1st Jan. 1824 , and an object worthy of them and their leader was not difficult to be found . The castle of Lepanto , which commands the gulf of that name , was the only fortress occupied by the Turks in Western Greece . Its position at the mouth /z/ of the gulf is one of great importance , and enables it to keep iij ) a constant communication with Patras ; and while this was the case , it was impossible to reduce it in the ordinary mode of starvation . The garrison consisted of 500 Turks , and a considerable number of Albanians ; the soldiers were clamorous for their pay , and much confusion was said to reign in the place . It was understood that the Albanians would surrender on the approach of Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to 23,000 dollars . In every point of view the ) lace was of the highest importance , and the most sanguine hopes were entertained that a vigorous attack upon it would prove successful . Lord Byron was raised to the highest pitch of enthusiasm , and spent his whole time in pre ) aring for the expedition . It was first intended that a body of 2500 men shoidd form the main body , and that Lord Byron should join them with his 500 Suliotes , and with a corps of artillery under Mr. Parry , which had been raised by the Greek Committee in London . At the latter end of January , however . Lord Byron was appointed by the Greek Government to the sole command of all the ( 3000 ) troops destined to act against Lepanto . He mentions this circumstance himself : " The expedition of about two thousand men is phinned for an attack on Lepanto ; and for reasons of policy with regard to the native Capitani , who would rather be ( nominally at least ) under the command of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , it is said , is to be given to me . There is also another reason , which is , that if a capitulation should take place , the Mussulmans might perhaps rather have Christian faith witii a F'rank than with a Greek , and so be inclined to concede a point or two . These appear to be the most obvious motives for such an appointment , as far as I can conjecture ; unless there be one reason more , viz. that under present circumstances , no one else ( not even Mavrocordatos himself ) seems disposed to accept such a nomination - and though my desires are as far as my deserts upon this occasion , I do not decline it , being willing to do as I am bidden ; and as I pay a considerable part of the clans , I may as well see what they are likely to do for their money ; besides , I am tired of hearing nothing but talk . " He adds in a note , that Parry , who had been delayed , and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not arrived ; and says , " I presume from the retardment that he is the same Parry who attempted the North Pole , and is ( it may be supposed ) now essaying the South . ' ' ' ' The expedition , however , had to experience delay and disappointment /q/ from much more important causes than the non-appearance of the engineer . Tlie Suhotes , who conceived tliat they had found a patron whose wealth was inexhaustible , and whose generosity was as boundless , determined to make the most of the occasion , and proceeded to make the most extravagant demands on their leader for arrears , and under other pretences . Suliotes , untameable in the field , and equally unmanageable m a town , were at this moment peculiarly disposed to be obstinate , riotous , and mercenary . They had been chiefly instrumental in preserving Messolonghi when besieged the previous autumn by the Turks , had been diiven from their abodes , and the whole of their families were at this time in the town destitute of either home or sufficient supplies . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe ; and Mavrocordatos having , unlike the other captains , no soldiers of his own , was glad to find a body of valiant mercenaries , especially if paid for out of the funds of another ; and , consequently , was not disposed to treat them with harshness . Within a fortnight after Lord Byron ' ' s arrival , a burgher refusing to quarter some Suliotes who rudely demanded entrance into his house , was killed , and a riot ensued in which some lives were lost . Lord Byron 's impatient spirit could ill brook the delay of a favourite scheme , and he saw , with the utmost chagrin , that the state of his favourite troops was such as to render any attempt to lead them out at present impracticable . The project of proceeding against Lepanto being thus suspended , at a moment when Lord Byron 's enthusiasm was at its height , and when he had fully calculated on striking a blow which could not fail to be of the utmost service to the Greek cause , it is no wonder that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a degree of irritability , which , if it was not the sole cause , contributed greatly to a severe fit of epilepsy , with which he was attacked on the l.Jth of February . His Lordship was sitting in the apartment of Colonel Stanhope , ( the active and enlightened representative of the Greek Connnittee in Greece , who had gone out to co-operate with Lord Byron , ) and was talking in a jocular manner with Mr. Parry the engineer , when it was observed , from occasional and rapid changes in his countenance , that he was suffering under some strong emotion . On a sudden he complained of a weakness in one of his legs , and rose ; but finding himself unable to walk , he cried out for assistance . He then fell into a state of nervous and convidsive agitation , and was placed on a bed . For some minutes /z/ his countenance was mucii distorted . He however quickly recovered his senses ; his speecli returned , and lie soon appeared perfectly well , although enfeebled and exhausted by the violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his usual remarkable firmness , and his efforts in contending with and attempting to master the disease are described as gigantic . In the course of the month the attack was repeated four times ; the violence of the disorder at length yielded to the remedies which his physicians advised ; such as bleeding , cold bathing , perfect relaxation of mind , &c.,; and he gradually recovered . An accident , however , happened a few days after his first illness , which was ill calculated to aid the efforts of his medical advisers . A Suliote , accompanied by the late Marco Botzaris ' little boy and another man , walked into the Seraglio - a place which before Lord Byron 's ari'ival had been used as a sort of fortress and barrack for the Sidiotes , and out of which they were ejected with great difficulty for the reception of the Committee stores , and for the occupation of the engineers , who required it for a laboratory . The sentinel on guard ordered the Suliotcs to retire ; which being a species of motion to which Suliotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the sergeant of the guard ( a German ) demanded his business , and receiving no satisfactory answer , pushed him back . These wild wmriors , who will dream for years of a blow if revenge is out of their power , are not slow to follow up a push . The Suliote struck again - the sergeant and he closed and struggled , when the Suliote drew a pistol froni his belt . The sergeant wrenched it out of his hand , and blew the powder out of the pan . At this moment Captain Sass , a Swede , seeing the fray , came uj ) and ordered the man to be taken to the guardroom . The Suliote was then disposed to depart ; and would have done so if the sergeant would have permitted him . Unfortunately , Captain Sass did not confine himself to merely giving the order for his arrest ; for when the Suliote struggled to get away , Captain Sass drew his sword and struck him with the flat part of it ; whereupon the enraged Greek flew upon him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ; ; uid at the same moment nearly cut oft ' the captain 's right arm , and shot him through the head with the pistol . Captain Sass , who was remarkable for his mild and courageous character , expired in a few minutes . The Suliote also was a man of distinguished bravery . This was a serious affair , and great apprehensions were entertained that it would not end here . The Suliotes refused to surrender the man to justice , alleging /q/ that liL- had been struck , which , in SuUote law , justifies all the consequences which may follow . In a letter dated a few days after Iord Byrons first attack , to a friend in Zante , he speaks of himself as rapidly recovering : " I am a good deal better , tho ' of course weakly ; the leeches took too much blood from my temples the day after , and there was . some difficulty in stopping it ; but I have been up daily , and out in boats or on horseback ; to-day I have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , without any liquid but water , and without any animal food . " He then adds , " besides the four Turks sent to Patras , I have obtained the release of four-and-twenty women and children , and sent them to Prevesa , that the English Consul-general may consign them to their relatives . I did this at their own desire . " After recurring to some other subjects , the letter concludes thus : - " Matters are here a little embroiled with the Suliotes , foreigners , &c.,; but I still hope better things , and will stand by the cause so long as my health and circumstances will permit me to be supposed useful . " Notwithstanding Lord Byron 's improvement in health , his friends felt from the first that he ought to try a change of air . Messolonghi is a flat , marshy , and pestilential place , and , except for purposes of utility , never would have been selected for his residence . A gentleman of Zante wrote to him early in March , to induce him to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following answer was received on the 1 Oth : " I am extremely obliged by your offer of your country-house , as for all other kindness , in case my health should require my removal ; but I can not quit Greece while there is a chance of my being of ( even supposed ) utility ; , - there is a stake worth millions such as I am , - and while I can stand at all , I must stand by the cause . While I say this , I am aware of the difficulties , and dissensions , and defects of the Greeks themselves ; but allowance must be made for them by all reasonable people . " It may well be supposed after so severe a fit of illness , and that in a great measure superinduced by the conduct of the troops he had taken into his pay and treated with the height of generosity , that he was in no humour to pursue his scheme against Lepanto - supposing that his state of health had been such as to bear the fatigue of a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repentance , and offered to place themselves at his Lord- /z/ ship 's disposal . They had , however , another objection to the nature of the service . In a letter which Colonel Stanhope wrote to Lord Byron on the 6th of March , from Athens , he tells his Lordshiji that he had bivouacked on the 21si of February in the hut of the Prefect of the Lepanto district , who had just had a conference with the garrison of that place . This man said , that if Lord Bvron would march there with a considerable force , and the arrears due to the troops , the fortress would be surrendered ; and Colonel S. adds a pressing entreaty that Lord Byron would jiroceed there immediately , and take advantage of this disposition on the part of the garrison . To this his Lordship has appended this note : - " The Suliotes have declined marching against Lepanto , saying , that ' they would not fight against . stone walls . ' Colonel S. also knows their conduct here , in other respects lately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thought of after this time . This same letter , which communicated to Lord Byron the facility with which Lepanto might be taken , also announced the intention of Ulysses ( Odysseus ) to summon a Congress of chiefs at Salona , to consider of a mode of uniting more closely the interests of Eastern and Western Greece , and ari-anging between them some method of strict co-operation . The whole of these two districts are subordinate to their respective governments , and as the Turkish army was expected to come down , it was supposed by Odysseus that some plan of acting in concert might be hit upon , which would not only enable them to resist the enemy with greater effect , but likewise rapidly advance the progress of civilization , and the authority of the government and constitution . Odysseus , who had the most influence in Eastern Greece , and was able to collect all the chiefs of his own district , was most desirous of prevailing upon Mavrocordatos and Lord Byron , who were all-powerful in the opposite territory , to be present at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town nearly on the confines of the two departments . Two agents were sent to persuade them to join in the design , and repair to Salona . Odysseus himself first despatched Mr. Finlay ; and after him Captain Humphries went over to Messolonghi with all haste , by desire of Colonel Stanhope . The latter succeeded . Lord Byron , as may be supposed , was well disposed to the measure ; but his consent was for some time held back by the Prince , who had reasons for not approving the Congress . Mavrocordatos was always averse to meeting /q/ Odysseus , a man of a very different character from himself : nor did he reUsh the idea of Lord Byron 's quitting the seat of his government . It was , however , apparently settled that both should attend at Salona , as we learn from a letter from his Lordship to Colonel Stanhope , at Athens , directly accepting the invitation on the part of both ; as well as from another , dated the 22nd March , to his agent , of which the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Mavrocordatos and myself with a considerable escort , intend to proceed to Salona at the request of Ulysses and the chiefs of Eastern Greece ; and to take measures offensive and defensive for the ensuing campaign . IMavrocordatos is almost recalled by the new Government to the Morea , ( to take the lead I rather think ) , and they have written to propose to me , to go either to the IMorea with him , or to take the general direction of affairs in this quarter with General LondoSj and any other I may choose to form a council . Andrea Londos is my old friend and acquaintance since we were in Greece together . It would be difficult to give a positive answer till the Salona meeting is over ; but I am willing to serve them in any capacity they please , either commanding or commanded - it is much the same to me as long as I can be of any presumed use to them . Excuse haste - it is late - and I have been several hours on horseback in a country so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to a brook or ditch , of whose depth , width , colour , and contents , both my horses and their riders have brought away many tokens . " They did not , however , set out in a few days , as it seems to have been intended . In the Government , which since Lord Byron 's arrival at Messolonghi had been changed , the civil and island interest now greatly preponderated ; and consequently by it a Congress of military chiefs was looked upon with some jealousy , and most unjustly styled an unconstitutional measure . Marrocordatos 's views were now those of the Government ; so that in addition to his private motives , he had also a public interest in withholding Lord Byron from Salona . Various pretexts were urged for delay ; among others , whether a true or a pretended one is not exactly ascertained , a design of delivering up Messolonghi to the Turks was alleged against the Suliotes . But at last came Lord Byron 's fatal illness , and all schemes of congresses and campaigns were for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the subsequent lamentations over his death : the meeting took place at Salona , on the 16th of April . Mavrocordatos was not there ; and Lord Byron was on his death-bed . /z/ Mr. FLETCHER 'S ACCOUNT op LORD BYRON 'S LAST MOMENTS . The last moments of great men have always been a subject of deep interest , and are thought to be pregnant with instruction . Surely , if the death-bed of any man will fix attention , it is that of one upon whose most trifling action the eyes of all Europe have been fixed for ten years with an anxious and minute curiosity , of which the annals of literature afford no previous example . We are enabled to present our readers with a very detailed report of Lord Byron 's last illness . It is collected from the mouth of Mr. Fletcher , who has been for more than twenty years his faithful and confidential attendant . It is very possible that the account may contain inaccuracies : the agitation of the scene may have created some confusion in the mind of an humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , in some trifling instances , have played him false : and some of the thoughts may have been changed either in the sense or in the expression , or by passing through the mind of an uneducated man . But we are convinced of the general accuracy of the whole , and consider ourselves very fortunate in being the means of preserving so affecting and interesting a history of the last days of the greatest and the truest poet that England has for some time produced . " &#9632; My master , ' " says Mr. Fletcher , " continued his usual custom of ridingdaily when the weather would permit , until the 9th of April . But on that illfated day he got very wet ; and on his return home his Lordship changed the whole of his dress ; but he had been too long in his wet clothes , and the cold , of which he had complained more or less ever since we left Cephalonia , made this attack be more severely felt . Though rather feverish during the night , his Lordshi ) slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in his bones and a head-ache : this did not , however , prevent him from taking a ride in the afternoon , which I grieve to say was his last . On his return , my master said that the saddle was not perfectly dry , from being so wet the day before , and observed that he thought it had made him worse . His Lordship was again visitetl by the same slow fever , and I was sorry to perceive , on the next morning , that his illness appeared to be increasing . He was very low , and complained of not having had any sleep during the night . His Lordsiiip 's appetite was also quite gone . I prepared a little arrow-root , of which he took three or four spoonfuls , saying it was very good , but coidd take no more . It /q/ was not till the third day , the 12th , that I began to be alarmed for my master . In all his former colds he always slept well , and was never affected by this slow fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two medical attendants , and inquired minutely into every circumstance connected with my master 's present illness : both replied that there was no danger , and I might make myself perfectly easy on the subject , for ail would be well in a few days . - This was on the 13th . On the following day I found my master in such a state , that I could not feel happy without supplicating that lie would send to Zante for Dr. Thomas . After expressing my fears lest his Lordship should get worse , he desired me to consult the doctors ; which I did , and was told there was no occasion for calling in any person , as they hoped all would be well in a few days . - Here I should remark , that his Lordship repeatedly said , in the course of the day , he was sure the doctors did not understand his disease ; to which I answered , ' Then , my Lord , have other advice by all means . ' - ' They tell me , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common cold , which , you know , I have had a thousand times . ' - ' I am sure , my Lord , ' said I , ' that you never had one of so serious a nature . ' - ' I think I never had , ' was his Lordship 's answer . I repeated my supplications that Dr. Thomas should be sent for , on the 1 5th , and was again assured that my master would be better in two or three days . After these confident assurances , I did not renew my entreaties until it was too late . With respect to the medicines that were given to my master , I could not persuade myself that those of a strong purgative nature were the best adapted for his complaint , concluding that , as he had nothing on his stomach , the only effect would be to create pain : indeed this must have been the case with a person in perfect health . The whole nourishment taken by my master , for the last eight days , consisted of a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two spoonfuls of arrowroot on the 18th , the day before his death . The first time I heard of there being any intention of bleeding his Lordship was on the 1 5th , when it was proposed by Dr. Bruno , but objected to at first by my master , who asked Mr. Millingen if there was any very great reason for taking blood . ? - The latter rephed that it might be of service , but added that it could be deferred till the next day ; - and accordingly my master was bled in the right arm , on the evening of the 16th , and a pound of blood was taken . I observed at the time , that it had a most inflamed appearance . Dr. Bruno now began to say he had /z/ frequently urged luy master to be bled , but that he always refused . A long dispute now arose about the time that had been lost , and the necessity of sending for medical assistance to Zante ; upon which I was informed , for the first time , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better , or no more , before the arrival of Dr. Thomas . His Lordship continued to get worse : but Dr. Bruno said , he thought letting blood again woukl save his life ; and I lost no time in telling my master how necessary it was to comply with the doctor 's wishes . To this he replied by saying , he feared they knew nothing about his disorder ; and then , sti'etching out his arm , said , ' Here , take my arm , and do whatever you like . ' His Lordship continued to get weaker ; and on the 17th he was bled twice in the morning , and at two o'clock in the afternoon . The bleeding at both times was followed by fainting fits , and he would have fallen down more than once , had I not caught him in my arms . In order to prevent such an accident , I took care not to let his Lordship stir without supporting him . On this day my master said to me twice , ' I can not sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep for more than a week : I know , ' added his Lordship , ' that a man can only bo a certain time without sleep , and then he must go mad , without any one being able to save him ; and I would len times sooner shoot myself than be mad , for I am not afraid of dying , - I am more fit to die than people think . ' I do not , however , believe that his Lordship had any apprehension of his fate till the day after , the 18th , when he said , ' I fear you and Tita will be ill by sitting up constantly night and day . ' I answered , ' We shall never leave your I-ordship till you are better . ' As my master had a slight fit of delirium on the 16th , I took care to remove the jjistols and stiletto , which had hitherto been kept at his bedside in the night . On the 18tli his Lordship addressed me freciuently , and seemed to be very much dissatisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow me to send for Dr. Thomas ; ' to which he answered , ' Do so , but be quick . I am sorry I did not let you do so before , as I am sure they have mistaken my disease . Write yourself , for I know they would not like to see other doctors here . ' I did not lose a moment in obeying my master 's orders ; and on informing Dr. Bruno and Mr. Millingen of it , they said it was very right , as they now began to be afraid themselves . On returning to my master 's room , his first words were , ' Have you sent ? ' - ' I have , my Iord , ' was my answer ; upon which he said , ' You have done right , for I should like to know what is the matter with me. /q/ Altliough his Lordship did not appear to think his dissolution was so near , I could perceive he was getting weaker every hour , and he even began to have occasional fits of delirium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I am seriously ill ; and , in case I shoukl be taken off suddenly , I wish to give you several directions , which I hope you will be particular in seeing executed . " I answered I would , in case such an event came to pass ; but expressed a hope that he would live many years to execute them much better himself than I could . To this my master replied , ' No , it is now nearly over ; ' and then added , ' I must tell you all without losing a moment ! ' I then said , ' Shall I go , my Lord , and fetch pen , ink , and paper . ? ' - ' Oh , my God ! no , j'ou will lose too much time , and I have it not to spare , for my time is now short , ' said his Lordship ; and inunediately after , ' Now , pay attention . ' His Lordship commenced by saying , ' You will be provided for . ' I begged him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then continued , ' Oh , my poor dear child f - my dear Ada ! My God ! could I but have seen lier . ' Give her my blessing - and my dear sister Augusta and her children ; - and you will go to Lady Byron , and say tell her every thing ; - you are friends with her . ' ' His Lordship appeared to be greatly affected at this moment . Here my master 's voice failed him , so that I could only catch a word at intervals ; but he kept muttering something very seriously for some time , and would often raise his voice and say , ' Fletcher , now if you do not execute every order which I have given you , I will torment you hereafter if possible . ' Here I told his Lordship , in a state of the greatest perplexity , that I had not understood a word of what lie said ; to which he replied , ' Oh , ray God ! then all is lost , for it is now too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' - ' No , my Lord , ' said I ; ' but I pray you to try and inform me once more . ' - ' How can I . ' ' ' ' rejoined my master ; ' it is now too late , and all is over ! ' I said , ' Not our will , but God 's be done ! ' - and he answered , ' Yes , not mine be done - but I will try ' His Lordship did indeed make several efforts to speak , but could only repeat two or three words at a time - such as , ' My wife ! my child ! my sister ! - you know all - you must say all - you know my wishes : ' the rest was juite unintelligible . A consultation was now held ( about noon ) , when it was determined to administer some Peruvian bark and wine . My master had now been nine days without any sustenance whatever , except what I have already mentioned . With the exception of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed , and which , if reijuired , I shall /z/ communicate to themselves , it was impossible to understand any thing his Lordship said after taking the bark . He expressed a wish to sleep . I at one time asked whether I should call Mr. Parry ; to which he replied , ' Yes , you may call him . ' Mr. Parry desired him to compose himself . He shed tears , and apparently sunk into a slumber . Mr. Parry went away , expecting to find him refreshed on his return - but it was the commencement of the lethargy preceding his death . The last words I heard my master utter were at six o'clock on the evening of the 18th , when he said , ' I must sleep now ; ' upon which he laid down never to rise again ! - for he did not move hand or foot during the following twenty-four hours . His Lordship appeared , however , to be in a state of suffocation at intervals , and had a frequent rattling in the throat : on these occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I thought he seemed to get quite stiff . The rattling and choaking in the throat took place every half-hour ; and we continued to raise his head whenever the fit came on , till six o'clock in the evening of the 19th , when I saw ni ' maf-.ter open his eyes and then shut them , but without showing any symptom of pain , or moving hand or foot . ' Oh ! my God ! ' I exclaimed , ' I fear his Lordship is gone ! ' The doctors then felt his pulse , and said , ' You are right - he is gone ! ' " The Editor thinks it right to add here , from " The Examiner , " Dr. Bruno 's Answer to Mr. Fletcher 's Statement . " Mr. Fletcher has omitted to state , that on the second day of Lord Byron 's illness , his physician . Dr. Bruno , seeing the sudorific medicines had no effect , proposed blood-letting , and that his Lordship refused to allow it , and caused Mr. Millingen to be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see if the rheumatic fever could not be cured without the loss of blood . " Mr. Millingen approved of the medicines previously prescribed by Dr. Bruno , and was not opposed to the opinion that bleeding was necessary ; but he said to his Lordship that it might be deferred till the next day . He held this language for three successive days , while the other physician ( Dr. Bruno ) every day threatened Lord Byron that he would die by his obstinacy in not allowing himself to be bled . His Lordship always answered , ' You wish to get the reputation of curing my disease , - that is why you tell me it is so serious ; but I will not permit you to bleed me. ' /z/ " After the first consultation with Mr. Millingen , the domestic Fletcher asked Dr. Bruno how his Lordship 's complaint was going on ' i The physician replied that , if he would allow the bleeding , he would be cured in a few days . But the surgeon , Mr. Millingen , assured Lord Byron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow ; and thus four days slipped away , during which the disease , for want of blood-letting , grew much worse . At length Mr. Milhngen , seeing that the prognostications which Dr. Bruno had made respecting Lord Byron 's malady were more and more confirmed , urged the necessity of bleeding , and of no longer delaying it a moment . This caused Lord Byron , disgusted at finding that he could not be cured without loss of blood , to say that it seemed to him that the doctors did not understand his malady . He then had a man sent to Zante to fetch Dr. Thomas . Mr. Fletcher having mentioned this to Dr. Bruno , the latter observed , that if his Lordship would consent to lose as much blood as was necessary , he would answer for his cure ; but that if he delayed any longer , or did not entirely follow his advice . Dr. Thomas would not arrive in time : - in fact , when Dr. Thomas was ready to set out from Zante , Lord Byron was dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , - not by Fletcher , but by the servant Tita , who was the only person that constantly waited on Lord Byron in his illness , and who had been advised to take this precaution by Dr. Bruno , the latter having perceived that my Lord had moments of delirium . " Two days before the death , a consultation was held with three other doctors , who appeared to think that his Lordship 's disease was changing from inflammatory diathesis to languid , and they ordered china* , opium , and ammonia . " Dr. Bruno opposed this with the greatest warmth , and pointed out to them that the symptoms were those , not of an alteration in the disease , but of a fever flying to the brain , which was violently attacked by it ; and that the wine , the china , and the stimulants would kill Lord Byron more speedily than the complaint itself could ; while , on the other hand , by copious bleedings and the medicmes that had been taken before , he might yet be saved . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was then that Dr. Bruno declared to his colleagues that he would have no further responsibility for the /z/ loss of Lord Byron , which he pronounced inevitable if the cliina were given him . In effect , after my Lord had taken the tincture , with some grains of carbonate of ammonia , lie was seized by convulsions . Soon afterwards they gave him a cup of very strong decoction of china , with some drops of laudanum : he instantly fell into a deep lethargic sleep , from which he never rose . " The opening of the body discovered the brain in a state of the highest inflammation ; and all the six ) hysicians who were present at that opening were convinced that my Lord would have been saved by the bleeding , which his physician Dr. Bruno had advised from the beginning with the most pressing urgency and the greatest firmness . " F. B. Of Lord Byron 's friends in Greece , those whom one should have wished to have been present during his last illness , were scattered about the country : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messolonghi very soon after the fatal event " With all my anxiety , " he says , in a letter written Immediately after , and dated Messolonghi , I could not get here before the third day . It was the second after having crossed the first great torrent , that I met some soldiers from Messolonghi : I then rode back and demanded of- a stranger the news from Messolonghi ; I heard nothing more than ' Lord Byron is dead , ' ' and I passed on in gloomy silence . " - It was at his desire that Dr. Bruno drew up his report of the examination of Lord Byron 's body . This I'eport we shall here insert , though it has been printed in the newspapers . But , partly owing to the vaguenes ' ? of the original , and partly to the translator 's ignorance of anatomy , it has been hitherto perfectly unintelligible. " 1 . On opening the body of Lord Byron , the bones of the head were found extremely hard , exhibiting no appearance of suture , like the cr.inium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of one uniform bone : there seemed to be no diploe , and the sinus frontalis was wanting . 2 . The dura maler was so firmly attached to the internal parietes of the cranium , that the reiterated attempts of two strong men were insufficient to detach it , and the vessels of that membrane were conijiletely injected with blood . It was united from point to point by membranous l ) ridles to the pia mater. 3 . Between the pia maler and the convolutions of the brain were found many globules of air , with exudation of lymph and numerous adliesions. 4 . The great falx of the dura mater was firmly attached to both hemispheres by membranous bridles ; and its vessels were turgid with blood . 5 . On dividing the medullary substance of the brain , the exudation of blood from /z/ the niimrte vessels produced specks of a bright red colour . An extravasation of about 2 oz. of bloody serum was found beneath the yjow* Varioli , at the base of the hemispheres ; and in the two superior or lateral ventricles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cerebcUuin , and the usual effects of inflammation were observable throughout the cerebrum. 6 . The medullary substance was in more than ordinary proportion to the corticle , and of the usual consistency . The cerchrum and the cerebellum , without the membranes , weighed 61bs. ( medicke ) . 7 . The channels or xiilci of the blood-vessels on the internal surface of the cranium , were more numerous than usual , but small . 8 . The lungs were perfectly healthy , but of much more than ordinary volume ( giga ? itiselle ) . 9 . Between the pericardium and the heart there was about an ounce of lymph , and the heart itself was of greater size than usual ; but its muscular substance was extremely flaccid . 10 . The liver was much smaller than usual , as was also the gall-bladder , which contained air instead of bile . The intestines were of a deep bilious hue , and distended with air . 11 . The kidneys were very large but healthy , and the vesica relatively small . Judging from the observations marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7 , 10 , and 11 , the physician who attended Lord Byron concludes , that he might probably have recovered from his illness , had he submitted to the loss of blood which was recommended at the commencement of the disease . He thinks , however , that he can declare with tolerable certainty , from the appearances 1 , 8 , and 9 , that his Lordship could not have survived many years , on account of his habitual exposure to the causes of disease , both from his habitual mental exertion , his excessive occupation , and a constant state of indigestion . " From this account of the examination of the body , it is plain that Lord Byron died in consequence of inflammation of the brain ; at least if the appearances really were as described . The cause of the attack was clearly his exposure to wet and cold on the ) th of April . By this exposure fever was excited . His brain was predisposed to disease , as is evident from the attack of convulsion from which he was scarcely yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brain the more readily on account of the predisposition to disease which had already been manifested in that organ . That he might have been saved by early and copious bleeding , and other appropriate remedies , is certain . That his medical attendants had not , until it was too late to do any thing , any suspicion of the true nature of his disease , we are fully /z/ satisfied . Nothing is known of any intention to bleed until the 15th , that is , the 6th day of the disease , and then one of the medical attendants expresses in a very vague manner his opinion of the remedy : " it might be of service , but it could be deferred till the next day . " Could any man , who was led by the symptoms to suspect such a state of the organ as was revealed by inspection , thus speak ? When Dr. Bruno , in his report , speaks of taking blood in the early stage " in grande abbondanza , ' he speaks instructed by dissection . Were we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lord Byron 's attendant , we should doubt , from all the circumstances , his having proposed , in an early stage , copious bleeding to his patient , and his Lordship 's refusal to submit to the treatment . He called his complaint a cold , and said the patient would be well in a few days , and no physician would propose copious bleeding under such circumstances . It seems to us that Lord Byron 's penetration discovered their hesitation , and suspected the ignorance by which it was caused , and that his suspicion was but too well founded . Without further evidence we should disbelieve in the total obliteration of the sutures ; and we may add , that all the inferences deduced from the alleged appearances in 1 , 8 , 9 , &c.; arc absurd ; they do not affbrd evidence enough to warrant the slightest conjecture relative to the length or the brevity of life . It is , however , but fair to add , that Lord Byron always had a very decided objection to being bled ; and Dr. Bruno 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have its due weight . That Lord Byron should have had an insurmountable objection to bleeding is extraordinary , and it in some measure confirms what he himself used to say , that he had no fear of death , but a perfect horror of pain . Lord Byron 's death was a severe blow to the people of Messolonghi , and they testified their sincere and deep sorrow by paying his remains all the honours their state could by any possibility invent and carry into execution . But a people , when really animated by the passion of grief , requires no teaching or marshalling into the expression of its feelings . The rude and military mode in which the inhabitants and soldiers of Messolonghi , and of other places , vented their lamentations over the body of their deceased patron and benefactor , touches the heart more deeply than the vain and empty pageantry of much more civihzed states . Immediately after the death of Lord Byron , and it was instantly known , for the whole town was watching the event . Prince Mavrocordatos published the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is turned into one of sorrow and mourning . The Lord Noel Byron departed this life at eleven o'clock last night , after an illness of ten days ; his death being caused by an inflammatory fever . Such was the effect of his Lordship 's illness on the public mind , that all classes had forgotten their usual recreations of Easter , even before the afflicting end was apprehended . The loss of this illustrious individud is undoubtedly to be deplored by all Greece ; but it must be more especially a subject of lamentation at Messolonghi , where his generosity has been so conspicuously disphiyed , and of which he had even become a citizen with the ulterior determination of participating in all the dangers of the war . Every body is acquainted with the beneficent acts of his Lordship , and none can cease to hail his name , as that of a real benefactor . Until , therefore , the final determination of the national Government be known , and by virtue of the powers with which it lias been pleased to invest me : I hereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute-guns sliall be fired from the grand battery , being the number which corresponds with the age of the illustrious deceased . 2nd . All the public offices , even to the tribunals , are to remain closed for three successive days . 3rd . AU the shops , except those in which provisions or medicines are sold , will also be shut : and it is strictly enjoined , that every species of public amusement , and other demonstrations of festivity at Easter , may be suspended . 4th . A general mourning will be observed for twenty-one days . 5th . Prayers and a funeral service are to be offered up in all the churches . ( Signed ) A. Mavrocordatos . Given at Messolonghi , Giorgius Praidis , this Qth day of ' April , 1824 . Serrctari/ . There appears to liave been considerable difficulty in fixing upon the place of interment . No directions had been left by Lord Byron - and no one could speak as to the wishes he might have entertained on the point . After the embalmment , the first step was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ were to decide as to its ultimate destination . Lord Sidney Osborne , a relation of Lord Byron by marriajie , the Seca-etary of the Senate at Corfu , repaired to Zante to meet it . It was his wish , and tliat of some others , that his Lordship should be interred in that island - a proposition which was received with indignation and most decidedly opposed by the majority of the English . By one it was proposed that his remains should have leen deposited in the temple of Theseus , or in the Parthenon , at Athens ; and as some importance might have been attached to the circumstance by the Greeks , and as there is something consolatory in the idea of Lord Byron reposing at last in so venerable a spot , thus re-consecrating , as it were , the sacred land of the Arts and the Muses , we can not but lament that the measure was not listened to . Ulysses sent an express to Messolonghi , to solicit that his ashes might be laid in Athens ; the body had then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost unanimous wish of the English that it should be sent to England , for public burial in Westminster Abbey or St. Paul 's , the Resident of the Island yielded ; the Florida was taken up for that purpose - and the whole English public know the result . It was not only at Messolonghi , but throughout the whole of Greece , that the death of Lord Byron was felt as a calamity in itself , and a bad omen for the future . Lord Byron went to the Greeks not under the same circumstances that any other man of equal genius might have done . He had Ijeen the poet of Greece - more than any other man he had turned the attention of Europe on modern Greece . By his eloquent and spirit-stirring strains , he had himself powerfully co-operated in raising the enthusiasm of regeneration which now reigns in Greece . All this gave to his arrival there , to use the phrase of a letter written while he was expected , something like the character " of the coming of a Messiah . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depression , when his mission ended before he had effected any thing of importance . - Fortunately the success of Greece depends not upon the efforts of any single man . Her fortune is sure , and must be made by the force of uncontrollable circumstances ; by the character of the country , by the present ignorance and the former brutality of its oppressors , by Greek ingenuity , dexterity , and perseverance , traits stamped upon them by ages of servitude , now turned with a spirit of stern revenge upon those who made such qualities necessary - by the fortunate accidents which kept a host of consummate generals in the u /z/ character of bandit robbers and shepherd chiefs , watcliing the moment when they might assume a more generous trade , and on a larger scale revenge the wrongs of a race of mountain-warriors. - By these and a multitude of other causes which might be enumerated , the fate of Greece is certain . We repeat with the most earnest assurance to th ( 5se who still doubt , and with the most intimate knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate independence of Greece is secure . The only question ft stake is the rapidity of the events which may lead to so desirable a consummation - so desirable to those who delight in the happiness and imjjrovcmcnt of mankind - so delightful to those who have the increased prosperity of England at heart . It is here that Lord Byron might have been useful ; by healing divisions , by exciting dormant energies , by ennobling and celebrating the cause , he might perhaps have accelerated the progress of Greece towards the wished-for goal . But even here , though his life was not to be spared , his death may be useful - the death-place of such a man must be in itself illustrious . The Greeks will not despair when they think how great a sacrifice has been made for them : the eyes of all Europe are turned to the spot in which he breathed his last . No man who knows that Lord Byron 's name and fame were more universal than those of any other then or now existing , can be indifferent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which he bent his last thoughts - the cause for which he died . /z/ C Printed by Order cf Government . J Messolotighi , Oth April , Thursday in Easter Week , 1824 . Unlooked-for event ! deplorable misfortune ! But a short time has elapsed since the people of this deeply suffering country welcomed , with unfeigned joy and open arms , this celebrated individual to their bosoms ; to-day , overwhelmed with grief and despair , they bathe his funeral couch with tears of bitterness , and mourn over it with inconsolable affliction . On Easter Sunday , the happy salutation of the day , " Christ is risen , " remained but half pronounced on the has of every Greek ; and as they met , before even congratulating one another on the return of that joyous day , the universal demand was , " How is Lord Byron ? " Thousands , assembleil in the spacious plain outside of the city to commemorate the sacred day , appeared as if they had assembled for the sole purpose of imploring the Saviour of the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our present struggle for the deliverance of our native land . And how is it possible that any heart should remain unmoved , any lip closed upon the present occasion ? Was ever Greece in greater want of assistance than when the ever-to-be-lamented Lord Byron , at the peril of his life , crossed over to Messolonghi ? Then , and ever since he has been with us , his liberal hand has been opened to our necessities - - necessities which our own poverty would have otherwise rendered irremediable . How many and much greater benefits did we not expect from him ! - and to-day , alas ! to-day , the unrelenting grave closes over him and our hopes ! Residing out of Greece , and enjoying all the pleasures and luxuries of Europe , he might have contributed materially to the success of our cause , without coming personally amongst us ; and this would have been sufficient for us , - for the well-proved ability and profound judgment of our Governor , the President of the Senate , would have ensured our safety with the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , it was not so for Lord Byron . Destined by nature to uphold the i-ights of man whenever he saw them trampled upon ; bom in a free and enlightened country ; early taught , by reading the works of our ancestors , ( wliieh indeed teach all who can read them , ) not only what man is , but what he ought to be , and what he may be - he saw the persecuted and enslaved Greek determine to break the heavy chains with which he was boimd , and to convert the iron into sharp-edged swords , that he might regain by force what force had torn from him ! He ( Lord B. ) saw , and leaving all the ) leasures of Europe , he came to share our sufferings and our liardships ; assi.sting us , not only with his wealth , of which he was profuse ; not only with his judgment , of which he has given us so many salutary examples ; - but with his sword , which he was preparing to unsheath against our barbarous and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the testimony of those who were intimate with liim , with the determination to die in Greece and for Greece ! How , therefore , can we do otherwise than lament with heartfelt sorrow the loss of such a man ! How can we do otherwise than bewail it as the loss of the whole Greek nation ! Thus far , my friends , you have seen him liberal , generous , courageous - a true Philhelenist ; and you have seen him as your benefactor . This is , indeed , i sufficient cause for your tears , but it is not sufficient for his honour ; it is not sufficient for the greatness of the undertaking in which he had engaged . He , whose death Ae are now so deeply deploring , was a man who , in one great branch of literature , gave his name to the age in which we live : the vastness of his genius and the richness of his fancy did not permit him to follow the splendid though beaten track of the literary fame of the ancients ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had endeavoured , and was still endea. vouring , to shut against the learned of Europe : but as long as his wri tings live , and they must live as long as the world exists , this road will remain always open ; for it is , as well as the other , a sure road to true knowledge . I will n ( jt detain you at the present time by expressing all the respect and enthusiasm with which the perusal of his writings has always inspired me , and which indeed I feel much more powerfully now than at any other period . The learned men of all Europe celebrate him , and liave celebrated him ; and all ages will celebrate the poet of our age , for he was b ( jrn for all Europe and fo-aU ages . /q/ One consideration occurs to me , as striking and true as it is applicable to the present state of our country : listen to it , my friends , witli attention , that you may make it your own , and that it may become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid nations in the world , but few have been the epochs of their true glory : one phenomenon , I am inclined to beheve , is wanting in the history of these nations , - and one , the possibility of the appearance of which the all-considering mind of the philosopher has much doubted . Almost all the nations of the world have fallen from the hands of one master into those of another ; some have been benefited , others have been injui-ed by the change ; but the eye of the historian has not yet seen a nation enslaved by barbarians , and more particularly by barbarians rooted for ages in their soil - has not yet seen , I say , such a people throw off " their slavery unassisted and alone . This is the phenomenon ; and now , for the first time in the history of the world , we witness it in Greece - yes , in Greece alone ! The philosopher beholds it from afar , and his doubts are dissipated ; the historian sees it , and prepares his citation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the statesman sees it , and becomes more observant and more on his guard . Such is the extraordinary time in which we live . My friends , the insurrection of Greece is not an epoch of oiu- nation alone ; it is an epoch of all nations : for , as I before observed , it is a phenomenon which stands alone in the political history of nations . The great mind of the highly gifted and much lamented Byron observed this phenomenon , and he wished to unite his name with oin- glory . Other revolutions have happened in his time , but lie did not enter into any of them - he did not assist any of them ; for their character and nature were totally different : the cause of Greece alone was a cause worthy of him whom all the learned men of Europe celebrate . Consider then , my friends , consider the time in which you live - in what a struggle you are engaged ; consider that the glory of past ages admits not of comparison with yours : the friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially of the enlightened and generous English nation , congratulate you , and from afar rejoice with you ; all animate you ; and the poet of our age , already crowned with innnortality , emulous of your glory , came personally to your shores , that he might , together with yourselves , wash out with his blood the marks of tyranny from our polluted soil . /z/ Born in the great capital of England , * his descent noble , on the side of both his father and his niotlier , what unfeigned joy did his piiilheilenick heart feel , when our poor city , in token of our gratitude , inscribed his name among the number of her citizens ! In the agonies of death ; yes , at the moment when eternity appeared before him ; as he was lingering on the brink of mortal and immortal life ; wiien all the material world appeared but as a speck in the great works of Divine Omnipotence ; in that awful hour , but two names dwelt upon the lips of this illustrious individual , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much beloved daughter , and of Greece : these two names , doe ) ly engraven on his heart , even the moment of death could not efface . " My daughter I " he said ; " Greece ! " he exclaimed ; and his spirit passed away . What Grecian heart will not be deeply affected as often as it recalls this moment ! Our tears , my friends , will be grateful , very grateful to his shade , for they are the tears of sincere affection ; but much more grateful will be our deeds in the cause of our country , which , though removed from us , he will observe from the heavens , of which his virtues have doubtless opened to him the gates . This return alone does he require from us for all his munificence ; tiiis reward for his love towards us : this consolation for his sufferings in our cause ; and this inheritance for the loss of his invaluable life . When your exertions , my friends , shall have liberated us from the hands which have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have torn from our arms , our property , our brothers , our children ; - then will his spirit rejoice , then will his shade be satisfied ! - Yes , in that blessed hour of our freedom , the Archbishop v/ill extend his sacred and free hand , and pronounce a blessing over his venerated tomb ; the young warrior sheathing his sword , red with the blood of his tyrannical oppressors , will strew it with laurel ; the statesman will consecrate it with his oratory ; and the poet , resting upon the marble , will become doubly inspired ; the virgins of Greece ( whose beauty our illustrious fellowcitizen Byron has celebrated in many of his poems , ) without any longer fearing contamniation from the rapacious hands of our oppressors , crowning their heads with garlands , will dance round it , and sing of the beauty of our land , which /q/ the yioet of our age has already commemorated witli such grace and truth . But what sorrowful thought now presses upon my mind ! My fancy has carried me away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have desired ; I had imagined the blessinoj of our Bishops , the hymns , and laurel crowns , and the dance of the virgins of Greece round the tomb of the benefactor of Greece ; - but this tomb will not contain his precious remains ; the tomb will remain void ; but a few days nice will his body remain on the face of our land - of his new chosen country ; it can not be given over to our arms ; it must be borne to his own native land , which is honoured by his birth . Oh Daughter ! most dearly beloved by him , your arms will receive him ; your tears will bathe the tomb which shall contain his body ; - and the trrs of the orphans of Greece will be shed over the urn containing his precious heart , and over all the land of Greece , for all the land of Greece is his tomb . As in the last moment of his life you and Greece were alone in his heart and upon his lips , it was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the precious remains . Messolonghi , his country , will ever watch over and protect with all her strength the urn containing his venerated heart , as a symbol of his love towards us . All Greece , clothed in mourning and inconsolable , accompanies the procession in which it is borne ; all ecclesiastical , civil and military honours attend it ; all his fellow-citizens of Messolonghi and fellow-countrymen of Greece follow it , crowning it with their gratitude and bedewing it with their tears ; it is blessed by the pious benedictions and prayers of our Archbishop , Bishop , and all our Clergy . Learn , noble Lady , learn that chieftains bore it on their shoulders , and carried it to the church ; thousands of Greek soldiers lined the way through which it passed , with the muzzles of their muskets , which had destroyed so many tyrants , pointed towards the ground , as though they would war against that earth which was to deprive them for ever of the sight of their benefactor ; - all this crowd of soldiers , ready at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man , surrounded the funeral couch , and swore never to forget the sacrifices made by your Father for us , and never to allow the spot whei-e his heart is placed to be trampled upon by barbarous and tyrannical feet . Thousands of Christian voices were in a moment heard , and the temple of the Almighty resounded with supplications and prayers that his venerated remains might be safely conveyed to his native land , and that his soul might rest where the righteous alone find rest .
