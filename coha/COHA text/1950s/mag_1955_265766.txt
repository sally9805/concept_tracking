Gathered in noisy convention amidst the moldering elegance of a onetime Dutch social club , the members of Indonesia 's ruling Nationalist Party cheered a handsome man in a black fez and specially designed presidential uniform , who bounced to the rostrum . He was angry . <P> " We may have been defeated by the United Nations , " cried Indonesia 's President Soekarno , " but we do not have to beg from them . If we are to get Irian , * we must have power , power , power and more power . " More significant than anything Soekarno had to say to the Nationalists last week was the eloquent fact of his presence . It was the first time in Indonesia 's five years as a republic that the President has appeared at any party convention . He has always told Indonesians wherever he went : " Brothers , I am above such things as party politics . I am your constitutional President . I am of you and with you . " Now he is publicly supporting the leftist , trouble-loaded government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends say that he was alarmed by the narrowness of Sastroa-midjojo 's majority on a parliamentary vote of confidence a fortnight ago ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) . Though a Moslem himself , Soekarno also fears that the opposition Masjumi ( Moslem ) Party , which is the largest political party in the predominantly ( 90% ) Moslem republic , would make Indonesia a theocratic state if it came to power . Others , less charitable , find an explanation for Soekarno 's behavior in his ambition to become the Nehru of Indonesia . During a recent visit to the island of Bali with Soekarno , Nehru 's sister , Madame Pandit , said to him : " You know , I think you 'd be very successful as a dictator . " Soekarno just laughed . <P> But whatever the explanation , the most powerful and most popular man in Indonesia is now openly and energetically siding with the Communist-supported Nationalist Party . <P> <P> * Indonesia 's name for Dutch New Guinea , which the Indonesians want to grab .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
