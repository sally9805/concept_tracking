Thrown into the war with as little warning as the G.I.s themselves , U.S. correspondents in Korea last week had their own tough job to do . Three correspondents had already been wounded , * another had been cut off behind Communist lines , and several had narrowly escaped ambush . Communications were meager and inadequate , the fighting chaotic and confusing . To the credit of most of the newsmen , they told the story straight , without phony heroics or false optimism ; to the credit of General MacArthur 's press officers , the story went back home to the U.S. the way it was written . <P> The press had swarmed into Japan and Korea like homing bees . The Tokyo Press Club was operating a hotbed dormitory , as press reinforcements poured in from the U.S. and the Far East , en route to Korea . In Korea itself , correspondents were doing business on a catch-as-catch-can basis . Three early arrivals-Tom Lambert of the Associated Press , Keyes Beech of the Chicago Daily News and Gordon Walker of the Christian Science Monitor-took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters . Their privacy was soon invaded by later arrivals who posted a sign : KOREAN KORRESPONDENTS CLUB . Before long , the club was equipped with iced beer , a poker game , and two grumbling Korean houseboys , and had begun to acquire the homey look of the pressroom in a police station . <P> Three-Minute Men . Every day an open-topped jeep , packed with correspondents , made the run from the club to the front . News was easy to find , but hard to get out . There was still only one telephone line to Japan . Since Army calls had priority over news , the dispatches were frequently well behind the actual fighting . When the phone was busiest , each reporter was rationed to three minutes . Anyone with a big story had to file it in " takes " ( some editors printed fragments of stories , ' with apologies to readers ) , or thumb a plane ride to Japan and file the story in one piece . <P> In such confusion , writing was understandably spotty . A.P . ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle : " An American stood up , the long bazooka at his shoulder . He blasted away , but the shells fell short . . . The tanks laughed at us with machine guns . " But he also wrote perhaps the most implausible battlefield quote of the war : " As the first rocket let go with a swishing hiss , a soldier with his face crushed in the dirt muttered , ' Judas , everyone 's getting up on these modern techniques . ' ! <P> Old Hands . Such seasoned war correspondents as the New York Herald Tribune 's Homer Bigart and the United Press 's Bob Miller , who arrived in the second wave , quickly proved that their hands had not lost their skill . <P> Bigart , who won a Pulitzer Prize for his World War II reporting ( TIME , Aug. 27 , 1945 ) pulled no punches : " I never saw anything like the bitterness and bewilderment displayed by the men at the front yesterday when they received their orders to withdraw from Chonan ... It was a galling humiliation ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat is difficult , even for troops highly trained . . . These troops were not highly trained . They had been living the comparatively soft life of occupation troops in Japan . Less than 10 percent of them had previous combat experience . . . "
