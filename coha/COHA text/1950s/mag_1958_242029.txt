In its classic form , the fall of a French Premier closely resembles a bullfight . First , the picadors and banderilleros harry the victim with light but painful barbs , until his chest is heaving and his flanks are blood-flecked . Then the matador steps forth in solitary grandeur , executes his breathtaking passes and finally plunges his sword in for the kill . <P> Last week , when it came his turn to face the corrida , Flix Gaillard got the full treatment . To his plaintive declaration that if France will not trust its allies " we are before a crisis of extreme gravity , " Conservative Deputy Raymond Triboulet jeeringly retorted : " You 're not before one , you 're in one . " At Gaillard 's protestations of U.S. solidarity with France , Jean-Marie Le Pen , a right-wing tough elected as a Poujadist , interrupted : " Of the two dangers that menace the independence of France-Bolshevik Russia and the United States-the latter is by far the worse . " Then the banderilleros retired , and Gaillard found himself face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchmen have come to call Jacques le tombeur-Jacques the Cabinet-wrecker . <P> Rattles &; Fairy Tales . With an assurance born of experience-it was he who only six months ago led the attack that toppled Gaillard 's predecessor , Maurice **25;18700;TOOLONG began by labeling Gaillard a " puppet " of the U.S. " If French policy is made in Washington , " said Soustelle , " did you call the Assembly back here to play with baby rattles ? A week ago you said the good offices mission was at an impasse . What caused you to change your mind ? Only one new fact : the letter from Eisenhower . " <P> " Pure fairy tale , " snapped Gaillard . <P> Mercilessly , Soustelle persisted : " You yielded to foreign pressure . " <P> Paling in rage , Gaillard smashed his fist down on his desk with a bang that sent papers flying : " I repeat . It is not true . I am overwhelmed that a man of your quality uses arguments of this nature . " <P> " Synthetic indignation will get you nowhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fatal thrust : " In voting for you today , we would place France in danger . That is why we refuse to follow you . " <P> The Aztec . A beetle-browed 200-pounder whose suits seem a size too small , 46-year-old Jacques Soustelle is well suited for his wrecker 's work ; he looks like an able-bodied warehouseman who has unaccountably wandered into the National Assembly from Les Halles markets . In reality , he is a coldly brilliant scholar who graduated from Paris ' famed Ecole Normale Suprieure at 20 , won fame as an anthropologist by a series of notable books on the Incas and Aztecs . Soustelle 's travels in Latin America with his Tunis-born wife-also an anthropologist-won him the youthful nickname of Jacques I'Aztec ; they also convinced him of the justice of South American outcries about U.S. " dollar imperialism , " gave birth to the anti-Americanism that has been the one consistent theme of his political career .
