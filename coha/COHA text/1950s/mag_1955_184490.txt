To Redmond O'Hanlon , 39 , New York City cop and Shakespeare scholar , $16,000 represents four years ' pay-or a new home for his family of five children . Last week O'Hanlon faced the decision of his life . Should he take the $16,000 he had won the two previous weeks on the CBS-TV show The $64,000 Question ? Or should he let the money ride on another question about Shakespeare for $32,000 ? Appearing on the show for the third consecutive week , the good-looking , gun-toting scholar disclosed that an overwhelming 90% of his big fan mail begged him to take the $16,000 . But fellow cops and newsmen , impressed with his knowledge of Shakespeare , urged him to risk four years ' pay for eight . His decision ? O'Hanlon admitted that " on one side is the egotism of a scholar ; on the other side is the conservatism of a father . " Then he heaved a sigh and added . " I have decided to take the $16,000 . " The studio audience exploded into wild applause . O'Hanlon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wife on his arm , and a $16,000 certified check in hand . <P> With O'Hanlon gone , a Camp Hill ( Pa. ) grandmother and Bible student , Mrs. Catherine E. Kreitzer , kept alive the suspense of The $64,000 Question . She got by the $8,000 question by naming in order the Aramaic words in the " handwriting on the wall " at Belshazzar 's feast ( " mene , mene , tekel , upharsin " ) . Mrs. Kreitzer will decide this week whether she will go for the $16,000 question .
