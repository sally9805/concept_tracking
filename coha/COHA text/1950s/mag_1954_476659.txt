THE No. 1 nightmare of the Eisenhower Administration is the threat of a depression . Right now it is probably causing more sleepless nights in Washington than the towering problems of foreign policy and defense . Indeed , it is tightly interlocked with these problems ? and with all the others , including the political ones ? which are harassing the President and the top members of his team . ' Even in Washington , however . few people know what Ike k Co. plan to do about it . The men around the White House are understandably close-mouthed ; too much talk about a depression might help to bring one on . Besides , some of the ideas they are playing with would give the extreme conservatives in Congress a had case of the shudders , if the news got around too soon . In fact , the Administration has set up a fairly elaborate apparatus to make plans for halting a depression . Some of the ablest men in Washington have been assigned to the job , and they are working on their blueprints with considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently is paying serious attention to what they tell him . As well he might . For a depression ? or even a middle-sized slump ? could wreck the Republican party . Abroad , the effects quite possibly would damage this country 's allies so badly that the whole United States foreign policy would collapse , and the Communist tide would start to rise again all over Asia and Western Europe . At home , such a slump would cost the Republicans not only the next election . It might also ruin their chances at the polls for a whole generation ; an Eisenhower Depression , following the Hoover Depression , would make the GOP virtually a synonym for hard times in the minds of millions of voters . Because all this is perfectly plain to the Administration , it is determined to spot any symptoms of economic trouble in the earliest possible stage , and to prepare a shelf full of remedies for instant application . Here is how it is tackling the job . The Trend-Watchers F ISENHOWER 'S first step was to build a sensitive machinery ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiver in the economic indicators . ? Part of this equipment was inherited from the Truman Administration . The Employmerit Act of 1946 had established the Council of Economic Advisers to provide the President with expert guidance . Ike has kept the structure , although lie has changed practically all of the staff and is using it in a very different way . ( Under Truman , the Council was frequently employed as a loudspeaker for the Administration 's politico-economic views , and for lobbying on The Hill . Under Eisenhower ? so far ? it has served as an almost invisible staff agency , speaking to the White House instead of to the public . ) To head his Council , Eisenhower chose an economist who has long been highly respected by his professional peers : Arthur Burns , former Director of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a professor at Columbia . He is a quiet man , with an alert mind and no visible political ambitions . In Washington it is generally believed that he has earned the President 's complete confidence . NDER Burns ' chairmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Interdepartmental Advisory Board on Growth and Stability . Although it carefully avoids the headlines , this Board has become one of the most important instruments of government , so far as domestic economic affairs are concerned . Its membership is imposing . It includes men drawn from all of the main agencies concerned with the nation 's economy ; and each of them carries enough power in his own department to speak with real authority . In addition to Burns , they arc Marion Folsom , Under Secretary of the Treasury and formerly a top-flight business executive ; True Morse , Under Secretary of Agriculture ; Walter Williams , Under Secretary of Commerce ; Rocco C. Siciliano , an Assistant Secretary of the Labor Department ; Abbot Mills of the Federal Reserve Board ; Paul Morrison of the Budget Bureau ; and Gabriel Hauge , one of Eisenhower 's closest campaign advisers and now his assistant for economic matters , serving as liaison between the White House and the agencies whose ordinary work affects the domestic economy . To draw a military parallel , this group can be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stave off a depression . S INCE the middle of last summer , this Board has been meeting regularly once a week , and frequently oftener . It has three main tasks : ( I ) It tries to provide a running assessment of the economic situation , as accurate and up-to-the-minute as possible . This is no simple undertaking . Because American industry is so big and varied ? and because it often takes a long time for the- significant figures to get sorted out in Washington ? there is always a chance that trouble in some part of the economy could mushroom dangerously before it was spotted . Consequently , Burns is trying hard to speed up the compiling of key statistics . Before long , he hopes , some of the government agencies which gather and weigh these statistics Will be able to give the Board at least preliminary figures ten days to two weeks earlier than they do now . In addition , where there are gaps in current information , Burns assigns members of his Council staff to make special studies and report back fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the prompt transmission of military intelligence sometimes can sway the course of a battle . ( 2 ) With such information before them , the members of the Board consider each week what action ought to be taken by both government and business ? particularly by business acting in local communities . The theory is that if you can spot a little fire in some waste basket and put it out quickly , you wo n't have to call the fire department . ( 3 ) Finally ? and maybe most important ? the Board tries to decide what measures ought to be taken if unemployment should reach a certain critical level ; and what additional steps might be needed if unemployment should rise beyond this level by half a million , by a million , and so on . What it regards as the critical level ? call it Figure X ? is something the Board is reluctant to discuss in public . For good reason . At this writing , fewer than one and a half million people are out of work . This is the lowest level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II . Some economists , inside of government and out , believe that it is abnormally low ? that it is a sign the economy is operating under forced draft . A number of these unemployed , they argue , are actually unemployables ? alcoholics , morons , and misfits ? while nearly all of the others are only temporarily out of work while moving from one job to another . According to this view , unemployment could rise considerably ? perhaps it could even double ? without giving cause for serious worry . Since more than 63 million people are now at work , a doubling of the present number of unemployed would still mean that less than 5 per cent of the nation 's labor force was out of jobs . Obviously , however , no economist in government dares to suggest , out loud , that unemployment would have to rise above , say , three million before it should be labeled as " critical . " Such a cool appraisal would strike every right-thinking Congressman as heartless , anti-labor , and bad politics . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the constant change that is one of the merits of private enterprise , employment will always be declining in some industries ? maybe to the vanishing point ? as tastes and products shift . The market can switch in relatively few years from horse-drawn buggies and high-buttoned shoes to TV sets and juvenile space suits . Unemployment may he severe in the disappearing industries ; but it is also likely to be temporary , as new enterprises grow up to take their place . The process may be disruptive for a while , but that is one of the prices of progress . S 0 IT clearly would be unhealthy for the government to take action to prop up employment in an industry that is on its way out . Even when it runs into fair-sized figures , therefore , this kind of unemployment will not alarm the Washington trend-watchers . At most , they might suggest government help to restrain the displaced labor and move it to new locations . On the other hand , if employment starts to edge downward in many different industries and localities at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A relatively small increase in unemployment of this kind might be a definite danger signal . Figure X , there-fare , can vary , depending on what kind of unemployment one is talking about . Then , too , it might be dangerous to publish Figure X , . even if it could be accurately predicted in advance . Suppose the government were to announce forinallythat four million unemployed ? to pick a yandom illustration ? would be regarded as the danger level . When that magic figure was reached , business men might well get panicky and run for the storm cellars ? thus bringing on the very depression which everybody wants to avoid . For all these reasons , the Board members do n't like to talk about Figure X. But it remains a key statistic in all their private deliberations . Three Kinds of Plans S o MUCH for the machinery of planning . To most informed observers , it looks pretty good . It is , in ironical fact . considerably more systematic than any planning apparatus ever set up by the New Deal . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans which come out of the hopper . That is a hard thing to measure , at this stage ; but we can get some useful clues by taking a close look at the way the machinery is now operating . In the light of their trend-charts , the Council of Economic Advisers and the Interdepartmental Board consider many proposals for action . Some of these ideas come from the Council 's staff , others from regular departments of government . They fall into three groups : ( 1 ) Mild incentives for the period just ahead , when defense spending will level off . ( 2 ) Longer-range measures designed to keep the economy growing at a steady , healthy pace . ( 3 ) Emergency schemes , for use if a downward spiral should start to pick up dangerous speed . Examples are available to illustrate all three types of planning now under way . Typical of the mild incentives which the Council is now exploring is a remodeling-andrenovation drive , to bring the country 's existing housing up to date . The construction industry is a big factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new houses has begun to slip off , and some people think that the market for new homes is at last beginning to soften . But the desire for better housing is never satisfied . Modernization of old homes , ranging from the decent-butdilapidated all the way down to the slums , might keep the- construction industry busy for a long time Such a campaign might he conducted largely by private enterprise , with the government 's role limited to encouragement , co-ordination , and perhaps some credit backing . Typical of the broader measures being studied by the Council is a thorough revamping of the tax structure . It would be intended mainly to promote long-term growth of the economy ; but it might also be helpful in meeting an economic emergency . Responsibility for drafting the new scheme rests primarily with Congress ' Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation , which has an expert staff serving both the House Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee . This staff also works closely with Folsom , whose Treasury duties include supervision of the Administration tax program . He brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there they come under the scrutiny of all the other agencies concerned with taxation . Details of the program which is being shaped in this fashion will not be known until the Administration sends its formal proposals to Congress , soon after it reassembles in January . But the philosophy behind them already is clear . T HE . Eisenhower Administration believes that the well-being of business is a main- spring of the economy . It holds , there-fore , that tax relief for business can stimulate expansion in output , jobs , and earning power ; and that for purposes of economic growth , it may make better sense to cut taxes on corporations than on individuals . Specific application of this reasoning includes a possible change in the tax law to permit industry to depreciate the cost of new plants and equipment at a faster rate . When such fast tax write-offs were granted to selected corporations after the start of the Korean war , they proved highly effective in getting new defense factories operating in a hurry . The same principle , applied more broadly . might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar favorable tax treatment , business might be encouraged to spend more money on researchand development ? thus fostering progress throughout the whole economy . A NOTHER special case which is getting lots of study is the encouragement of investment abroad . Lighter tax rates on corporation earnings from overseas developments might do the trick ; if so , the result could help America 's allies in need of capital , cut the demand for government aid , and expand private enterprise , all at one stroke . These are the chief tax changes that the Administration would like to make . Whether it can make them is another question , hinging largely on the Administration 's conflicting eagerness to balance the budget . Four types of emergency taxes , enacted under Truman to finance rearmament , are scheduled to expire this year ? under the law as it now stands , the excess profits tax and certain excise taxes will go off entirely , and both corporate and individual income taxes will be scaled down . As a result , the Treasury will lose $8 billion to $9 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an estimated $3.5 to $4 billion . With such a whopping deficit , further corporate tax cuts might well seem unreasonable and unpolitic . The problem would be simpler if substitute revenue could be obtained from some such measure as a sales tax ? preferably in the guise of a manufacturer 's excise ? but even that seems unrealistic just before an election . Probably the most that can be expected , therefore , is enough token relief for business to express the Administration 's philosophy . The planners also recognize that tax cuts for individuals can act like a shot of adrenalin on the economy , by increasing consumer spending . So they are studying three specific changes in the individual tax burden . One would raise the $600 exemption to which the taxpayer is entitled for each dependent . Since each $100 increase in exemption above the $600 level would cost the Treasury about $2.5 billion in revenue , the change wo n't be large ; but the level might be raised a little . A second possibility is an increase in the deduction allowed for medical expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wages paid to help that replaces . them in the home . But since the individual taxpayer will in any case start paying some $3 billion less in income tax on January 1 , not much additional relief can be hoped for . Three billion dollars , however ? in which fifty million taxpayers get a share ? can do a lot to shore up an economy that might be showing a tendency to sag . Aside from obvious election year tactics , the Republicans are willing to let at least some scheduled tax reductions go through at this time , for a carefully calculated economic reason . They reason that a tax cut should be made a little before armament spending begins to taper off . In that way , an increase in private consumption should balance off the declining government demand for goods , and so keep the economy on an even keel . ( Of course , if defense expenditures did n't taper off this year , but were forced up again by events abroad , the Administration would face another problem ? how to restrain private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy steady . But that is another story . ) Successors to the WPA I F REAL storm signals start to fly , much more drastic tax changes might be made . As the Eisenhower people sec it , many of the New Deal anti-depression measures would be virtually useless today ? simply because the economy has grown so much since 1930 . In those days , a WPA or public works project of a few millions loomed very large indeed . The total output of the economy was then valued at less than $100 billion , and peak government spending , in 1936 , was less than $9 billion . This year the national output will be somewhere around $367 billion , and the government will spend about $72 billion . It would take an awful lot of water to prime so big a pump . To brake a depression starting from today 's levels , therefore , some device would have to be found to get economic help very quickly to large numbers of people . The withholding tax is one of the few tentacles of government which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an act of Congress cutting income taxes and applied immediately to withholdings would distribute purchasing power over a wide area : it should have the same effect as a simultaneous salary increasefor millions of families . This possibility has not been lost on the government 's planners . In such a crisis , however , the Administration probably would rely most heavily on its power to lend , to guarantee , and to insure . The New Deal demonstrated how such techniques can build stout floors under various parts of the economy . The insurance of bank deposits and the guarantee of housing and agricultural credit are cases in point . The Eisenhower economists are now studying a new type of guarantee , more radical in some ways than any of the New Deal devices . It concerns consumer credit . The consumer debt on installment purchases , charge accounts , and loans is one of the most controversial subjects in the business picture . The outstanding credit on automobiles alone , for example , has risen from less than a half a billion at the end of World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives are wondering whether it may already be too high . Yet advertising executives , such as Arno H. Johnson of J. Walter Thompson , argue that consumer credit could rise another 75 per cent without becoming overextended . He notes that such debts outstanding are far smaller in relation to consumer income than they were in 1940 . Similarly , Arthur Dietz of the CIT finance company ? biggest in the consumer credit field ? reports that delinquencies in his firm 's accounts are at a postwar low N EVERTHELESS , many people high in government are worried by the fact that consumers ' debt rose 20 per cent last year , to a total of more than $27 billion ? or about a tenth as large as the national debt . They wonder if there might be a parallel between today 's heavy installment buying and the purchase of stock on margin which caused so much grief in 1929 . Certainty if the day should ever come when the installment collectors turn empty-banded from the doors of many customers who could n't quite make the monthly payment , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently the planners are now exploring ? strictly as a potential emergency measure ? the possibility of some kind of government insurance for installment credit , comparable to the existing guarantees of home mortgages . A related idea would call for a federal guarantee of state and local bond issues , if necessary in a time of ? slump , to finance highways , schools , hospitals , and other public works . This would fit in with the Republican theories of decentralization and local responsibility . It is assumed that local governments would spend the money more prudently than a big federal public works agency ; and they probably would be able to get the work under way faster . A main advantage of the Advisory Board is that it provides a place where proposals such as these can be checked against the experience of everyone concerned while they are still in the early blueprint stage ? thus ( it is hoped ) avoiding a lot of the inter-agency bickering and intrigue which characterized the New Deal . What Happens on D-Day A FINAL question about Ike 's planning machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board finally get their schemes hammered into acceptable shape ? The best program in the world is n't much good if it remains on paper . So far , the channels for moving a plan from blueprint into operation have not been fully worked out . But there . are a number of possibilities . Regularly on Mondays the President meets with Burns and Hauge . In addition , Burns has occasional talks of his own with Eisenhower , and from time to time he briefs the assembled White House staff . If Burns recommends a given course of action in one of these conferences , the President might then bring it before his Cabinet ; or he might call in a single agency chief andtell him to put the scheme into operation . When Congress is in session , the majority leaders could also be sounded out in their regular meetings at the White House . That 's about where the techniques for action stand today . Yet there seems to be little cause for concern . The economic weather prophets are now in remarkably unanimous agreement on two forecasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected in early 1954. ( 2 ) That it will range in depth somewhere between 5 and 8 per cent under the 1953 level of business activity . And there is a third point on which both Washington economists and most business men seem agreed : that the Administration will act ? fast and decisively ? to keep the recession from plunging any further . Recently a reporter asked a New York life insurance executive three questions : ( 1 ) What do you think is going to happen to the economy ? ( 2 ) What do you think the government should do about it ? ( 3 ) What do you think will he done ? He winced a little as he re-plied : " I 've been predicting a slight recession so long that I bore myself , but I still think there 's going to be a mild drop-off some time after New Year 's . The kind of recession I have in mind probably could be well handled merely by the wise use of monetary policy ? loosening up on credit , for example , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of Federal Reserve Board operation . " But what do I think the Administration actually will do ? I think they 'll throw the wad ! "
