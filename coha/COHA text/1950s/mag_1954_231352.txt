FREE LOVE AND HEAVENLY SINNERS ( 273 pp. ) - Robert Shaplen-Knopf ( $3.95 ) . <P> He was a national institution 80 years ago , widely acclaimed as the greatest preacher " since Paul preached on the Hill of Mars . " Member of a famous evangelical family ( Harriet Beecher Stowe , who wrote Uncle Tom 's Cabin , was his sister ) , he had packed in the parishioners at Brooklyn 's big Plymouth Church for 23 years . Then , at 57 , and at the peak of his influence , he was accused of practicing what he preached against . " On the night of July 3 , 1870 , ' ' writes Author Robert Shaplen . " Elizabeth Richards Tilton , a small , dark-haired woman of 35 , the mother of four children , confessed to her husband , Theodore , that she had committed adultery with her pastor , the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher . " <P> Shocking Medium . The confession was the outcome of a weird triangle . Tilton had long worshiped Preacher Beecher as " my man among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in 1855 , visited their home constantly , hinting freely at his own marital unhappiness . Tilton would say : " There is one little woman down at my house that loves you more than you have any idea of . " <P> After the little woman confessed that the love between her and Beecher was not merely spiritual , bushels of self-abasing letters were exchanged . The three met tearfully in Mrs. Tilton 's bedroom . " I kissed him and he kissed me , " Beecher later recalled , " and I kissed his wife and she kissed me , and I believe they kissed each other . " With that , all hoped to hush up the affair . <P> But it was too late . The Tiltons were great pals of the suffragettes , and Mrs. Tilton 's secret became known to the sharpest battle-ax of the women 's movement , Mrs. Victoria C. Woodhull . " The Woodhull , " as the papers called her , was a freeloving fortuneteller and spiritualist who , according to Commodore Vanderbilt , furnished him with valued market tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brevet husband , " a Civil War veteran named Colonel Blood , and yelp : " There stands my lover , but when I cease to love him , I shall leave him . " When The Woodhull was attacked for living a libertine life , she coldly countered by charging in print , naming all names , that the country 's No. 1 preacher was a bigger libertine than she and a hypocrite to boot . <P> Flowery Denials . A special investigating committee of the Plymouth Church , chosen by Beecher , pronounced the pastor innocent . But in the end , Husband Tilton 's forbearance gave out , and he sued Beecher for alienation of affections . <P> The trial lasted six months and the newspapers , Beecher complained , gave the case more space than the Civil War battles . Seated amid his six lawyers , Defendant Beecher , sniffing occasionally at a nosegay of violets , denied everything . <P> Q. Had you received any improper favors from her ? A.
