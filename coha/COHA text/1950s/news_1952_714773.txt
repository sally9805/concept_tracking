COMMITTEE SEATS TAFT GEORGIA BLOC BY 62-10-39 VOTE Eisenhower Backers Again Cry . ' Steal ' ? Ruling Increases Ohioan 's Delegates to 493 KANSAS TEST TO GENERAE Case Involves a Single Seat ? Governors Would Bar All Polls to Disputed Slates By W. IL LAWRENCE specie ' to Tao Nato YORK TIMES . CHICAGO , July ** a vote of 62 to 39 the Republican National Committee seated today an insurgent Georgia delegation pledged to cast seventeen votes for the nomination of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio and refused credentials to a " regular " delegation that had favored General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower by a 14-to-S margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far in the pre-convention maneuvering at Chicago , and it increased his lead over General Eisenhower in The Associated Press nation-wide delegate tabulation to 493 to 412 . A. total of 604 votes , or a majority of the 1,206 delegates , is required for nomination in the convention that opens Monday . Backers of General Eisenhower charged that the action in the Georgia case demonstrated anew that the Taft forces " are out to steal the nomination and they do n't want anybody to know how they did it . " The secrecy reference was to a decision of the Taft-dominated national committee , which was in effect today , barring television and radio broadcasting of its hearings on the delegate contests , the final outcome of which is vital to the political fortunes of both the Senator and General Eisenhower . News reporters were allowed at the hearings , but were barred from the room while the committee itself debated and voted upon each state . Taft Forces in Control ' Meanwhile the Eisenhower managers , after canvassing the Credentials Committee and the delegates , indicated they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee and on the convention floor . The Georgia ruling , reversing decisions made at both the 1944 and 1948 conventions to seat the " regular " delegation , demonstrated again the complete control Taft forces have of the party machinery in the making of major preliminary convention decisions . Today 's vote emphasized again that if General ' Eisenhower is to win the Presidential nomination his leaders will have to win on the convention floor appeals against Taft-approved arrangements , which the Eisenhower backers contend have " rigged " the convention against the general . ( In Houston , Tex. , at the Governors Conference , twenty-three Republican Governors signed a manifesto calling on the party 's national convention to deny votes to disputed delegates on all contests over seats . ) With neither candidate assured at this moment of a first-ballot nomination , the balance of power on the delegate contest issue will rest with the delegates now uncommitted or pledged to vote for favorite son . candidates , such fta Coy . Earl Warren of California , i former Gov . Harold E. Stassen of Minnesota , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And from this group there carne late today a stern warning to the Taft forces not to go too far in the exercise of their national committee power to seat delegates favorable to them and refuse credentials to backers of General Eisenhower , The spokesman was Senator . Richard M. ' Nixon of California ? / who is pledged to vote initially for ? Governor Warren but who thus-far. is not committed publicly in the . battle between General Eisens hower and Senator Taft . Declaring that the Georgia deci. sion raised an issue of whether the Republican convention would be conducted " with complete integrity , and fair play , " Senator Nixon said he . was convinced the pro-Eiseno hower delegation from Telakinuat be seated if the party was-to:01i. viva . " The issue of which *tlelegatio ! from Texas is ; seated IS. the Re . ' publican . National CenVenticin bigger than the Taft-Eisenhevi01 contest for the Presidential to iii ) ; ; nation , " said Senator Nixon e ? " The real issue . le ' whether the // // Republican party is to survree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be a closed corporation or open to all people who want a change of administration in Washington . It is whether the voice of . the people shall be heard . It is whether the selection of the Republican candidate for President is to be determined by the will of the people or by a small clique of politicians who happen to control the party machinery . " Cites " Corruption Issue " Senator Nixon said the Republicans have a potentially big issue I against the Democrats in the " corruption issue , " but that the party would lose this advantage " if our own hands are not clean . " He said his own investigation convinced him that the Eisenhower faction , which won majorities in ' Texas , had complied with state law , and that the pro-Taft faction " should not take the law into its own hands and disenfranchise thousands of Texas voters . " " If the Republican party approves the Texas grab , we will be announcing to the country that we believe ruthless machine politics is wrong only when the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is the future of the Republican party in the South at stake , but in the entire nation as well . The Republican party ca n't hope to win this November if it limits its membership to the minority which has not been large enough to win for national elections . " Davis S. Ingalls , Taft campaign manager , defended the Texas delegation favorable to his candidate , , and predicted that " the phony Texas ' steal ' charges of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , Eisenhower 's campaign manager , will blow up in his face * * * when the Republican National Committee hears proof that the Eisenhower managers were organizing Democrats to steal the Republican party in Texas . " The National Committee at its , sessions today disposed of only the Georgia case , involving seventeen delegates , and the Kansas case involving a single delegate at large from that state . After voting 62 to 39 to seat the Taft delegation from Georgia , the committee voted unanimously to recognize the election of an Eisenhower man from Kansas whose seat had been challenged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the long debate over television and radio broadcasting , the committee planned hearings tomorrow on the Louisiana case , involving six contested delegates ; the Mississippi case involving four delegates ; and Missouri , which involves a single delegate at large . It may or may . not hold hearings on a Puerto Rican dispute , which involves three delegates . This schedule put off until the Fourth of July , appropriately ' enough , the fireworks over the Texas delegation of thirty-eight members , which has commanded the greatest interest among delegates from all over the nation . The Georgia case was the first business before the national committee this morning . It involved two rival factions of the Republican party , one headed by W. R. Tucker , which had been seated at the 1944 and 1948 conventions , and the other led by Roy G. Foster Sr. , which had challenged the Tuckei group unsuccessfully at both previous conventions . The Tucker delegation was I divided 14 to 3 for General Eisenhower . and one of its members , was Harry Sommers , Georgia National Committeeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been that Mr. Sommer 's presence on the Tucker delegation would help it win votes from proTaft committee members , but this advantage was nullified when it was announced during the hearings that the Foster group was willing to re-elect him to the national committee . Originally , the National Committee took jurisdiction over only tour contested delegates from Georgia , and referred the cases of thirteen district delegates back to the state organization , controlled by the Tucker group , for decision . But the Foster group obtained a State Superior Court injunction restraining the Georgia Republican State Central Committee from acting , and Guy George Gabrielson , Republican National Chairman , ruled this morning that the national ? committee therefore would have to decide the contest involving the entire delegation of seventeen members . Monte Appel , Washington attorney and principal representative Of tile Taft orc-anizatioa in the delegate contest hearing , made the principal argument for the Taft forces in the Georgia case , and announced the willingness of the Foster group to re-elect Mr. Sommers , even thou ; ; ! : he was a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was made , Elbert P. Tuttle , representing - the . Tucker faction asked whether Mr. Sommers we , s repudiating the delegation of which he was a member . " In view of the controversy , I have no comment , " Mr. Sommers replied . This refusal by Mr. Sommers to ? remain loyal to the group that had elected him brought from Mr. Tuttle a statement to - reporters that it was " the most amazing double . cross that I have ever experienced . " The argument over the Georgia case by lawyers for both sides essentially was a legalistic one , and it involved the question of whether a state party convention in 1944 actually adjourned to reconvene at another place or remained in session . The Tucker group stayed in the convention hall in 1944 and wound up with control of the state party organization , the Foster group went to another meeting place and failed to win recognition until today . State Court Ruling The claim of the Foster group to credentials from this national committee was buttressed by a state court decision that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Georgia . The Tucker group lawyers argued that this was a decision by a single judge , given without a hearing , and that it had not yet been appealed to a higher court . While the committee debated and voted on the Georgia case in secret , copies of the roll-call were made available to reporters by National Committee members . That tally clearly indicated that mem ' bers of the national committee who are backing Senator Taft voted to seat the Foster pro-Taft group , and those who are for General Eisenhower or are uncommitted voted to seat the pro ' Eisenhower group . From the standpoint of future convention developments , and the possible shifting of blocs of votes from the pivotal uncommitted states to one candidate or another , there was the greatest interest in the voting of the committee members from Pennsylvania , Michigan and California on this Taft-Eisenhower test . Of the six votes involved in these three states , Senator Taft got only one  --  from G. Mason Owlett of Pennsylvania . who is a lieutenant of former Senator Joseph R. Grundy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unanimous decision was the result of a clear conviction on the part of committee members that the proTaft delegate candidate had no legal cause to press his appeal . The case involved whether William Horton Jr. , who is for General Eisenhower . or Rod Rentley , who is for Senator Taft , should be a delegate at large . The committee decision left the Kansas delegation undisturbed with a 20-to-2 margin for General Eisenhower .
