The court , in the fashion of the game , resembled a medieval courtyard ; shedlike roofs slanted down along three sides . A huge net drooped limply across the floor . The low walls were pierced by openings that looked like windows in ancient outbuildings from which spectators peered out like court nobles in an old print . At the exclusive Racquet and Tennis Club on Manhattan 's Park Avenue , devotees were watching Northrup R. Knox , 30 , challenge 41-year-old Albert ( " Jack " ) Johnson for the world open championship of the ancient game of court tennis . <P> Court tennis has changed little since it was played by monks in French monasteries some 700 years ago . and the court itself still reproduces many of the original hazards . The opening in the wall called the dedans might have been a water trough , and the player who can hit a ball into it wins the point . The serve is rolled along the side roof into the opponent 's court , comes off it with an erratic spin . The oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The game combines the strokes of lawn tennis with the problems of squash , compounded by the planned irregularities of the walls themselves . <P> Rich Man 's Game . Court tennis in the U.S. is restricted largely to the wealthy . There are just seven courts in the whole country , only one private one-built by Payne Whitney in 1915 on his Long Island estate at an estimated cost of $250,000 . But its adherents find court tennis endlessly fascinating , and in the last five years the game has experienced something of a revival , as Harvard , Yale and Princeton organized teams . <P> " Nordy " Knox comes from one of the U.S. 's most sports-minded families . Father Seymour Knox , board chairman of Buffalo 's Marine Trust Co. , was a ranking squash player , holds a seven-goal polo rating , combined with his two sons to form a powerful polo team .

For his teacher , he had the very best : tiny ( 5 ft. 6 in . ) Pierre Etchebaster , now 65 , a bouncy Basque who held the world open title from 1928 to 1954 , is still probably the world 's best for one set . <P> Unexpected Trouble . Johnson , an Englishman who is a teaching pro at the Racquet Club underrated his amateur opponent ( " I did n't think he 'd give me any trouble " ) . But in last week 's match Johnson found Knox 's " bloody bobbly little serve " difficult to return . Knox was deadly in putting the ball into the dedans and grille , often hitting the tambour , a jutting buttress off which the ball caroms almost parallel to the net . In three days ' play , he ran through Johnson seven sets to two , became the first amateur to win the world open title since Jay Gould ( grandson of the famed railroad tycoon ) held it in 1914 .
