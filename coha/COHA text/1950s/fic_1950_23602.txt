The Little World of Don Camillo Stories by Giovanni Guareschi Translation by Una Vincenzo Troubridge Drawings by Arthur Marokvia The Little World T ITE Little World is to be found somewhere in the valley of the Po River . It is almost any village on that stretch of plain in Northern Italy . There , between the Po and the Apennines , the climate is always the same . The landscape never changes and , in country like this , you can stop along any road for a moment and look at a farmhouse sitting in the midst of maize and hemp  --  and immediately a story is horn . Why do I tell you this instead of getting on with my story ? Because I want you to understand that , in the Little World between the river and the mountains , many things can happen that can not happen anywhere else . Here , the deep , eternal breathing of the river freshens the air , for both the living-and the dead , and even the dogs have souls . If you keep this in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Don Camillo , and hisadversary Peppone , the Communist Mayor . You will not be surprised that Christ watches the goings-on from a big cross in the village church and not infrequently talks , and that one man beats the other over the head , but fairly  --  that is , without hatred  --  and that in the end the two enemies find they agree about essentials . And one final word of explanation before I begin my story . If there is a priest anywhere who feels offended by my treatment of Don Camillo , he is welcome to break the biggest candle available over my head . And if there is a Communist who feels offended by Peppone , he is welcome to break a ham-mer and sickle on my back . But if there is anyone who is offended by the conversations of Christ , I ca n't help it ; for the one who speaks in this story is not Christ but my Christ  --  that is , the voice of my conscience . D ON Camillo had come into the world with a constitutional preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he Eound out about a local scandal involving young girls of the village with some landowners well along in years . On the Sunday following his discovery , Don Camillo had begun a simple , rather mild sermon , when he spotted one of the offenders in the front pew . Taking just enough time out to throw a cloth over the crucifix at the main altar so that Christ might not hear what was going to follow , he turned on the congregation with clenched fists and finished the sermon in a voice so loud and with words so strong that the roof of the little church trembled . Naturally , when the time of the elections drew near , Don Camillo was very explicit in his allusions to the local leftists . What happened was not surprising , therefore : one fine evening as the priest was on his way home , a fellow muffled in a cloak sprang out of a hedge , and , taking advantage of the fact that Don Camillo was handicapped by a bicycle with a basket of eggs on the handlebars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick and then disappeared , as if the earth had swallowed him . Don Camillo kept his own counsel . He continued to the rectory and , after putting the eggs in a safe place , went into the church to talk things over with Christ , as he always did in moments of perplexity . " What should I do ? " asked Don Camillo . " Anoint your back with a little oil beaten up in water and hold your tongue , " Christ answered from the main altar . " We must forgive those who offend us . " " Very true , Lord , but here we are discussing blows , not offenses . " " And what do you mean by that ? Surely , Don Camillo , you do n't mean that the injuries done to the body are more painful than those to the soul ? " " I see your point . Lord . But You should bear in mind that an attack on me , Your priest , is also an offense against You . I am really more concerned for You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater minister of God than you are ? And did n't I forgive those who nailed me to the cross ? " " There 's no use arguing with Youl " Don Camillo exclaimed . " You are always right . May Your will be done . I will forgive , but do n't forget that if these ruffians , encouraged by my silence , crack my skull open , it will be Your responsibility . I could quote You several passages from the Old Testament .. . " " Don Camillo , do you propose to teach me the Old Testament ! As for this business , assume full responsibility . And just between ourselves , that little beating this evening did you some good . It may teach you to let politics alone in My house . " Don Camillo forgave in his heart , but one thing stuck in his mind and needled him  --  curiosity as to the identity of his assailant . T IME passed . Then , late one evening as he was sitting in the confessional , Don Camillo recognized through the grille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the extreme left . That Peppone should come to confession at all was a sensational event , and Don Camillo was duly gratified . " God be with you , brother ; with you who , more than others , need his Holy blessing . When did you make your last confession ? " " In 1918 , " replied Peppone . " In all those years you must have committed a lot of sins with your head so crammed with crazy ideas . , . " " Quite a few , I 'm afraid , " sighed Peppone . " For example ? " " For example , two months ago I gave you a beating . " " That is very serious , " replied Don Camillo , " since , by assaulting one of God 's priests , you have offended God Himself . " " Oh , but I have repented , " Peppone exclaimed . " And anyway it was not as God 's priest that I beat you up but as my political adversary . Anyhow I did it in a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that devilish party , have you any other sins to con-fess ? " Peppone spilled them out , but all in all Don Camillo found nothing very serious and let him off with twenty Our Fathers and twenty Hail Marys . While Peppone was at the altar rail saying his penance , Don Camillo went and knelt before the crucifix . " Lord , " he said , " forgive me but I 'm going to beat him up for You . " " You 'll do nothing of the kind , " replied Christ . " I have forgiven him and you must do the same . After all , he 's not such a bad soul . " " Lord , you ca n't trust a Red ! They live by lies . just look at that face  --  Barabbas incar-nate ! " " One face is the same as another . It 's your heart , Don Camillo , that is venomous ! " " Lord , if I have been a worthy servant to You , grant me one small favor . Let me at least hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is a candle ? " " No , " replied Christ . " Your hands were made for blessing . " Don Camillo sighed wearily . He genuflected and left the altar . As he turned to make a final sign of the cross , he found himself exactly behind Peppone , who still kneltat the altar rail and appeared absorbed in prayer . " Lord , " groaned Don Camillo , clasping his hands and looking up at the crucifix , " my hands were made for blessing , but not my feet . " " There 's something in that , " replied Christ , " but , / warn you , just one . " The kick landed like a thunderbolt . Pep-pone did n't bat an eye . After a minute he got up and sighed . " I 've been expecting that for the past ten minutes , " he remarked casually . " I feel better now . " " So do I , " exclaimed Don Camillo , whose heart was now as light and serene as a May morning . Christ said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that he too was pleased . Rimfry A BIG shot from the city was going to visit the village and people were coming from all the surrounding cells . Therefore Peppone decreed that the ceremony was to be held in the big square . He had erected a large platform decorated with red , and got one of those trucks with four great loudspeakers and all the electric mechanism inside it for amplifying the voice . And so , on the afternoon of that Sunday , the public square was crammed with people and so also was the church square which happened to be next to it . Don Camillo shut all the doors and withdrew into the sacristy , so as to avoid seeing or hearing anything which would put him in a temper . He was actually dozing when a voice like the wrath of God roused him with a jerk as it bellowed : " COMRADES ! . . . " It was as though the walls had melted away . Don Camillo went to work off his indignation at the high altar . " They must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , " he exclaimed . " It is nothing short of violation of domicile . " " What can you do about it , Don Camillo ? It is progress , " replied Christ . After a few generalizations the voice got down to business and , since the speaker was an extremist , he made no bones about it . " We must remain within the law and we shall do so ! Even at the cost of taking up our weapons and using the firing squad on all the enemies of the people ! . . . " Don Camillo was pawing the ground like a restive horse . " Lord , only listen to him ! " " I hear him , Don Camillo . I hear him only too well . " " Lord , why do n't You drop a thunderbolt on all that rabble ? " " Don Camillo , let us remain within the law . If your method of driving the truth into the head of one who is in error is to shoot him down , what was the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right , of course . We can do nothing but wait for them to crucify us too . " Christ smiled . " If instead of speaking first and then thinking over what you have said , you thought first and did the speaking afterward , you might not have to regret the foolish things you say . " Don Camillo bowed his head . Ct . . . as for those who , hiding in the shadow of the crucifix , attempt with the poison of their ambiguous words to spread dissension among the masses of the workers . . . " The voice of the loudspeaker , borne on the wind , filled the church and shook the bright-colored glass in the Gothic windows . Don Camillo grabbed a heavy bronze candlestick and brandishing it like a club , made for the church door . " Don Camillo , stop ! You will not leave the church until everyone has gone away . " " Oh , very well , " replied Don Camillo , putting the candlestick back on the altar . " I obey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Christ . " But in here I can do as I please ? " " Naturally , Don Camillo . Here you are in your own house and free to do exactly as you wish . Short of climbing up to a window and firing at the people below . " T HREE minutes later , Don Camillo , leaping and bounding cheerfully in the bell chamber of the church tower , was performing the most infernal carillon that had ever been heard in the village . The orator was forced to interrupt his speech and turned to the local authorities who were standing with him on the platform . " He must be stopped ! " the big shot cried indignantly . Peppone agreed gravely , nodding his head . " He must indeed , " he replied , " and there are just two ways of stopping him . One is to explode a mine under the church tower and ' the other is to bombard it with heavy artil-lery . " The orator told him to stop talking nonsense . Surely it was easy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . " Well , " said Pepponc calmly , " you go up by ladders from landing to landing . Look , comrade , do you see those projections just by the big window of the belfry ? They are the steps that the bell-ringer has removed as he went up . By closing the trap door of the top landing he is cut off from the world . " " We might try firing at the windows of the tower ! " suggested Smilzo , Pcpponc 's deputy . " Certainly , " agreed Peppone , " but we would have to knock him out with the first shot , otherwise he 'd begin firing and then there might be trouble . " The bells stopped ringing for a moment and the orator resumed his speech ; all went well so long as he was careful to say nothing of which Don Camillo disapproved . Otherwise Don Camillo immediately began a counter-argument with his bells . In the end the speech was merely pathetic and patriotic and was therefore respected by the bells . HAT evening Peppone met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This baiting could bring you to a bad end . " " There is no baiting involved , " replied Don Camillo calmly . " You blow your trumpets and we ring our bells . That , comrade , is democracy . If on the other hand , only one person is allowed to perform , that is a dictatorship . " Peppone held his peace , but one morning Don Camillo got up to find a merry-go-round , a swing , three shooting galleries , a Ferris wheel , and an indefinite number of other booths set up , within exactly one foot of the line that divided the public square from the church square . The owners of the " amusement park " showed him their permits , duly signed by the Mayor , and Don Camillo retired without comment to the rectory . That evening all hell broke loose in the form of barrel organs , loudspeakers , gunfire , she iting and singing , bells , whistling , screaming and bellowing . Don Camillo went to protest to Christ . " This shows no respect for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is immoral or scandalous ? " asked Christ . " No  --  merry-go-rounds , swings , little motor cars , chiefly children 's amusements . " " Well then , it is simply democracy . " " But this infernal din ? " protested Don Camillo . " The din is democracy too , provided it remains within the law . Outside church territory the Mayor is in command , my son . " One side of the rectory adjoined the square , and exactly underneath one of its windows a strange apparatus had been erected . This immediately aroused Don Catnillo 's curiosity . It was a small column about three feet high , topped by a kind of stuffed mushroom covered with leather . Behind it was another column , taller and more slender , which had a large dial with numbers from one to a thousand . A blow was struck at the mushroom and the dial recorded its force . Don Camillo , squinting through the cracks of the shutters , began to enjoy himself hugely . By eleven o'clock in the evening the highest number recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit of Badile , the Grettis ' cowman , who had fists like sacks of potatoes . Then suddenly Comrade Pep-pone made his appearance , surrounded by his satellites . All the people came running to watch , crying , " Go on , Peppone , whack it ! " Peppone removed his jacket , rolled up his sleeves and took his stand opposite the machine , measuring the distance with his clenched fist . There was total silence and even Don Camillo felt his heart hammering . Peppone 's fist sailed through the air and struck the mushroom . " Nine hundred and fifty , " yelled the owner of the machine . " I 've seen only one other man get that score and he was a longshoreman in Genoa ! " The crowd howled joyously . Peppone put on his coat again , raised his head and looked up at the shuttered window where Don Camillo was hiding . " To whom it may concern , " he remarked loudly , " I might say that a blow that registers nine hundred and fifty is no joke ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed . Don Camillo went to bed with his legs shaking under him . The next evening he was there again , peeking from behind his window and waiting feverishly for the clock to strike eleven . Once again Peppone arrived with his staff , took off his coat , rolled up his sleeves , and aimed a mighty blow at the mushroom . " Nine hundred and fifty-one ! " howled the crowd . And once again they looked up at Don Camillo 's window and snickered . Pep-pone also looked up . " To whom it may concern , " he remarked loudly , " I might say that a blow that registers nine hundred and fifty-one is no joke ! " Don Camillo went to bed that night with a temperature . Next day he went and knelt before Christ . " Lord , " he sighed , " I am being dragged over the precipice ! " " Be strong and resist , Don Camillo ! " That evening Don Camillo went to his peephole in the window as though he were on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread like wildfire and the whole countryside had come to see theperformance . When Peppone appeared there was an audible whisper of " Here he is ! " Pep-pone looked up , jeering , took off his coat , raised his fist , and there was silence . " Nine hundred and fifty-two ! " Don Camillo , when he saw a million eyes fixed on his window , lost the light of reason and hurled himself out of the room . " To whom .. . " Peppone did not have time to finish ; Don Camillo already stood before him . The crowd bellowed , and then was suddenly silent . Don Camillo threw out his chest , took a firm stance , threw away his hat , and crossed himself . Then he raised his formidable fist and struck hard . " One thousand ! " yelled the crowd . " To whom it may concern , I might say that ? ? ? ? - MIIM10111 ? ? a blow that registers one thousand is no joke , " remarked Don Camillo . Peppone had grown rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitating between resentment and disappointment . Other bystanders were chuckling delightedly . Peppone looked Don Camillo straight in the eye and took off his coat again . He stepped in front of the machine and raised his fist . " Lord ! " whispered Don Camillo hastily . Peppone 's fist sailed through the air . " A thousand , " bawled the crowd and Peppone 's bodyguard rejoiced . " At one thousand all blows are formidable , " observed Smilzo . " I think we 'll leave it at that . " MAGAZINE Peppone went triumphantly in one direction while Don Camillo went triumphantly in the other . " Lord , " said Don Camillo when he knelt before the crucifix . " I thank you . I was scared to death . " " That you would n't make a thousand ? " " No , that that pig-headed fool would n't make it too . I would have had it on my conscience . " " I knew it , and it was lucky that I came to your help , " replied Christ , smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly died for fear you would n't reach nine hundred and fifty-two . " " Possibly ! " muttered Don Camillo , who now and then liked to appear skeptical . D orNr Camillo had let himself go a bit in the course of a little sermon . He had made some rather pointed allusions to " certain people " and so on the following evening when he seized the ropes of the church bells all hell broke loose . Some damned soul had tied firecrackers to the clappers of the bells . No harm done of course , but there was a din of explosions shattering enough to give the ringer heart failure . Don Camillo said nothing . He celebrated the evening service in perfect composure before a crowded congregation . Peppone was in the front row and every countenance was a picture of fervor . It was enough to infuriate a saint , but Don Camillo was no novice in self-control and his audience went home disappointed . As soon as the big doors of the church were closed , Don Camillo snatched up an overcoat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar . Tracking " Don Camillo , " said Christ , " put it down . " " I do n't understand , " he protested . " Put it down ! " Don Camillo drew a heavy stick out from under his coat and laid it in front of the altar . " Not a pleasant sight , Don Camillo . " " But Lord ! It is n't even oak ; it 's only poplar , light and supple , " Don Camillo pleaded . " Go to bed , Don Camillo , and forget about Peppone . " Don Camillo threw up his hands and went to bed with a temperature . But on the following evening when Pcppone 's wife came to the rectory , he leaped to his feet as though a firecracker had gone off under his chair . " Don Camillo , " began the woman , who was obviously upset . But Don Camillo interrupted her . " Get out of my sight , sacrilegious creature . " Don Camillo , never mind about that foolishness . At Castellino there is that poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of the village ! " Don Camillo counted to ten and lit a cigar . " Well , what of it , comrade ? Why should you bother about it ? " The woman started to shout . " I 'm bothering because they came to tell Peppone and he has gone rushing off to Castellino like a lunatic . And he has taken his Tommy gun ! " " I see . Then you have got concealed arms , have you ? " " Don Camillo , never mind about politics ! Ca n't you understand that Peppone is out to kill ? Unless you help me , my husband is done fort " Don Camillo laughed unpleasantly . " Which will teach him to tie firecrackers to my bells . I shall be pleased to watch him die in jaill You get out of my house ! " T EN minutes later , Don Camillo , with his skirts tucked up almost to his neck , was pedaling like a lunatic along the road to Castellino on a racing bike that belonged to the son of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was within a few miles of Castellino , Don Camillo saw by its light a man sitting on the wall of the little bridge that spans the river . He slowed down , since it is always best to be prudent when one travels by night , and stopped some ten yards from the bridge , holding in his hand a small object that he happened to have had in his pocket . " Have you seen a big man go by on a bicycle in the direction of Catellino ? " " No , Don Camillo , " replied the other quietly . Don Camillo drew nearer . " Have you already been to Castellino ? " " No . I thought it over . It was n't worthwhile . Was it my fool of a wife who put you to this trouble ? " " Trouble ? Nothing of the kind ... a little constitutional ! " " Have you any idea what a priest looks like on a racing bicycle ? " snickered Peppone . Don Camillo came and sat beside him on his wall . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things in this world . " Less than an hour later , Don Camillo was back at the rectory and went to report to Christ . " Everything went according to Your commandments . " " Well done , Don Camillo ; but would you mind telling me who commanded you to grab him by the feet and tumble him into the ditch ? " Don Camillo raised his arms . " To tell you the truth , I ca n't remember exactly . As a matter of fact he seemed to dislike the sight of a priest on a racing bike , so I thought it only kind to prevent him from seeing it any longer . " " I understand . Has he got back yet ? " " He 'll be here soon . It struck me that in his rather damp condition , he might find the bicycle in his way , so I thought it best to bring it along with me . " " Very kind of you , I 'm sure , Don Camillo , " said Christ with perfect gravity . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectory . He was soaked to the skin and Don Camillo asked if it was raining . " Fog , " replied Pepponc with chattering teeth . " May I have my bicycle ? " " Why , of course . There it is . " " Are you sure there was n't a Tommy gun tied to it ? " Don Camillo smiled . " A Tommy gun ? And what is that ? " As he turned from the door Peppone said , " I have made one mistake in my life . I tied firecrackers to your bells . It should have been half a ton of dynamite . " " Errare humanum est , " remarked Don Camillo.
