To Harold Stassen , who had chatted with Joe Stalin in the Kremlin back in 1947 , it seemed a good time for another talk . He sent the Soviet embassy in Washington a letter to be delivered to the Russian dictator . It began : " It is now three and one half years since I talked with you . . . I write to you . . . in the interest of world peace and the progress of mankind . " <P> With this , Stassen gave Stalin the back of his hand for several long paragraphs , making it clear that Stassen had been right and the Premier dead wrong on a variety of subjects which they had discussed in the Kremlin . He recalled that Stalin had announced that the U.S.S.R. wanted world peace . " I find it impossible , " he wrote , " to reconcile that statement with the North Korean aggression . . . " <P> He warned the Soviet Premier that the U.S. was not to be fooled with , that it could carry on a long rearmament program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its strength , and that U.S. youth-no matter how much they hated war-would not back out of a fight . <P> Having thus fortified himself against any charge that he was aiding a phony Russian peace offensive , Stassen softened his tone . Stalin , in effect , was urged to change his spots , lay down his gun , wipe the frown off his face , join the club and quit causing trouble in the U.N . Stassen guaranteed that the U.S. would not attack him without provocation . " If you doubt any of the things I say to you , " he added , " I believe I can prove each point through . . . further conferences . " <P> The State Department quickly announced that Stassen , president of the University of Pennsylvania and a private citizen , was acting strictly on his own . But if he wanted a passport , he might have one .
