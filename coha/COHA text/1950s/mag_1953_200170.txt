At the baseball park of the Ogden ( Utah ) Reds last week , some 2,000 spectators gazed on a strange sight : the diamond was overrun by flocks of sheep , darting dogs and excited men who whistled and yelled . It was the annual World Series of an unusual sport : the herding championship of the North American Sheep Dog Society . The crowd 's favorite was a black &; white border collie* named Rock , owned by Society President Arthur Allen . Rock , so small ( 32 Ibs. ) that he seems lost in the shadow of a ram , was imported from Scotland as a pup four years ago . On Allen 's 280-acre Illinois farm , he puts flocks of some 400 sheep through their proper paces year-round . <P> In last week 's contest , Rock was pitted against 14 other border collies . The assignment : to convoy a flock of five sheep around a set course and into a pen in twelve minutes or less . The Utah range sheep used in all the trials had never before seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen waited tensely at home plate , the dog 's unruly charges were let loose in far center field . Shouted Allen : " Go on wide away ! " In a furry blur , Rock shot off on his " outrun , " circling wide and closing in slowly for the " lift . " As the sheep testily pawed the turf , Rock calmly fixed them with a mesmeric eye . This nearly hypnotic power is the proud sheep dog 's most important quality , and sheepmen claim that a dog must be born with it ; if he does not have it , i.e. , is " loose-eyed , " he can never acquire it . <P> Without barking ( one yip would mean disqualification ) and guided only rarely by whistles , calls or hand signals from Allen , Rock outstared , outflanked and outsmarted the flock around the course . He drove them through null gates set up in right and left field , losing two points for failing to usher a stray ewe through one gate . Finally , Rock worked them all over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dog got four sheep to back slowly inside . However , a rebellious old ewe charged at Rock . Without even " popping his jaws " ( snapping with feigned ferocity ) or guiding her by the ear ( " gripping " is illegal ) , Rock stood fast and caught her eye with his Svengali gaze . The ewe turned and pushed her way into the pen . <P> By copping 48 points ( out of a possible 50 ) in 5 min. 39 sec. , Rock won $200 and his third straight North American championship . Allen , who frowns on overly bossy dog handlers , had some advice for last week 's losing owners : " Ranchers should just remember that their dogs know more about herding sheep than they do . " <P> <P> * Not to be confused with the plain collie , much larger and of little value as a working dog .
