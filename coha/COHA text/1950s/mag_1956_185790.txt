Italy 's gilded Communist press , which rode high and mighty a few years ago , was forced to bring out a beggar 's tin cup last week . At the start of the Reds ' annual Press Month , Party Chieftain Palmiro Togliatti and his lieutenants pleaded anxiously for every reader to contribute generously . Their purpose : " to save the party press . " But at the first rallies few Communists and even fewer readers seemed to be listening . The contribution boxes came back only half full . Complained L'Unita , Italy 's biggest ( est. circ. 390,000 ) Red daily : " Subscriptions began slowly in contrast with the rapid character of previous Press Month rallies . " <P> 45% Down . L'Unita understated the case . The Reds once ran an empire reaching nearly one-third of Italy 's 4,000,000 daily-newspaper readers ; now their press has shriveled to a handful of struggling newspapers with a combined circulation of barely 530,000-less than half of what L'Unita 's Sunday edition alone used to command . Since 1954 four papers have been forced to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up one month ago . Only L'Unita , Rome 's // Paese and Paese Sera and Sicily 's L'Ora di Palermo survive . Even they have lost from 30% to 45% of their circulation , and L'Unita is considering folding two of its four main regional editions , leaving those in Rome and Milan . <P> <P> For part of their woes the Reds can thank an increasingly tough campaign by the Italian government to curb their power . Starting less than three years ago under then-Premier Mario Scelba , the government forced Communists out of some newspaper plants illegally occupied during the last days of World War II , then ordered state-owned businesses to stop advertising in Red papers . When private businessmen also pulled out , advertising virtually vanished from the Communist press . Furthermore , where the Reds once got all the newsprint they wanted from Iron Curtain nations on unlimited credit terms , the Italian government refused import permits except for newsprint bought through normal channels , thus made the Communists pay out their cash for their supplies . As a result L'Unita alone loses more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has piled up a whopping $5,000,000 deficit over the last few years . <P> Sport &; Hearst . The Communists can also blame the Kremlin for much of the trouble.The recent downgrading of Stalin , with all its agonizing zigzags in Red doctrine has confused and disgruntled even the most faithful readers . Beyond that , as international tensions ease and Italy 's economy grows stronger . Communist rantings about the West are beginning to ring hollow to many Italians . Admits Giancarlo Pajetta . Italy 's No. 2 Communist and the Reds ' press boss : " Less international tension is bad for the party press . People lose interest . " <P> Recently Italy 's Communist press has been trying hard to woo back its lost readers by aping capitalist papers . L'Unita , once top-heavy with Marxist polemics , now goes easy on the politics , is substituting more news about the U.S. , more sports and entertainment , is even going in for sensational tabloid-type crime stories . It takes eight wire services , including Hearst 's International News Service , and plans to send a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
