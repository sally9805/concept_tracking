txt Certain climbers ( p. 17 ) are materially aided in clinging to their support by the possession of stiff hairs . Thus the ridges on the stem of the Goosegrass ( Galium aparine ) bear numerous reflexed unicellular hairs , shaped like a hook . In the Hop the ridges are similarly beset by stiff hairs , with two arms situated in the vertical plane , on a small elevation of the epidermis. / Extreme types of multicellular climbing hairs are furnished by the prickles of the Rose and Bramble . Whilst the walls of the ordinary cover-ing hairs are generally not appreciably thickened , both branched and unbranched hairs may possess thick walls which are frequently silicified or calcified ; when thus stiffened , they constitute a chevaux-de-frise against small animals ( e.g. slugs ) . Good examples are afforded by the unbranched bristle-hairs of many Boraginacem ( e.g. Borage , Comfrey , etc. ) and the branched types found on Stocks and other Cruciferar . Their effect is often accentuated by the presence of numerous minute teeth on their surface ( Fig. 95 , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting as a deterrent to animal attacks is , however , furnished by the unicellular stinging hairs of the Nettle ( Urtica ) ( Fig. 97 , D ) . Each is borne on a multicellular stalk in which is embedded the thin-walled swollen base of the actual stinging hair . The upper part of the latter is comparatively thick-walled and tapers gradually to near the apex , where it suddenly enlarges to form a tiny bead-like tip ( Fig. 97 , E ) . The lower part of the wall is calcified , the upper part silicified . The living protoplasmic contents often show distinct streaming movements , and include a large vacuole filled with acrid sap . When an animal brushes against one of these hairs , the little tip breaks off , leaving exposed a fine needle-like point formed by the upper tapering part of the hair . As a result of the pressure of contact , this fine tube penetrates the skin , and the compression of the bladder-like base injects the contained fluid into the wound . The hairs of many plants produce secretions 1 which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 90 ) . Such glandular hairs are // multicellular and generally consist of a basal cell , which is usually sunk in the epidermis , a projecting stalk , and a glandular head ( cf. Fig. 118 , g.h. ) , but are otherwise of very diverse form . In the Chinese Primrose ( Primula sinensis , Fig. 97 , A ? C ) and the Garden Geranium ( Pelargonium ) , the head is formed by a single cell and the stalk by a varying number of cells . In the Labiatx ( e.g. White Deadnettle ) the head is composed of four or more cells disposed in a plane parallel to the surface of the leaf . Extended division of the head leads to the peltate type of glandular hair , such as is seen in the Hop ( Fig. 95 , E ) and the Black Currant . All the cells of such glandular hairs are living , those of the head which are concerned in active secretion being specially characterised by dense protoplasmic contents and large nuclei . Small droplets of secretion can often be recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition the ethereal oil is found deposited between the cuticle and the cellulose-layer of the outer wall ( Fig. 97 , B ) , so that after solution of the oil by means of alcohol a space is evident beneath the cuticle . The volatile oils produced by these glands are the cause of the fragrant perfume of many herbs ( e.g. Lavender ) . II CHAPTER XV THE STRUCTURE OF THE LEAF THE detailed structure of dorsiventral leaves is most easily realised in a transverse section . Beneath the colourless epidermis ( Fig. 98 , Ep. ) of the upper side are one or more layers of vertically elongated cells constituting the palisade tissue ( Pa. ) , which is especially concerned with photosynthesis ; its cells are deep green owing to the numerous chloroplasts . Between the palisade layer and the lower epidermis lies the loose " spongy " tissue ( Sp. ) , which is composed of irregular cells separated by many and often conspicuous intercellular spaces ( In . ) . This tissue contains fewer chloroplasts and communicates with the external atmosphere by way of the stomata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mesophyll , of the leaf . Here and there the section will pass through veins , some cut transversely , others obliquely or longitudinally ; the veins include the vascular tissue with xylem towards the upper and phloem towards the lower side , and each is surrounded by a well-defined layer of cells , the bundle-sheath ( Sh . ) . Good material for a detailed study is furnished by the Fuchsia . The features of the epidermis have been fully described . The palisade cells are four to six times as long as broad and form a single layer ( Fig. 98 , Pa . ) . They are attached on the one hand to the upper epidermis , and on the other to the rounded cells constituting the uppermost layer of the spongy parenchyma . Narrow intercellular spaces , extending the whole depth of the palisade layer , occur at intervals between the cells , but these spaces are only apparent here and there in the transverse section ( cf. Fig. 98 , Pa . ) . In sections parallel to the surface of the leaf the palisade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A ) , so that they have the form of a number of closely packed cylinders placed side by side and interspersed with regularly disposed vertical spaces ( i.p. ) , where the curved surfaces are not in contact . The numerous lenticular chloroplasts form an almost continuous 162 // layer in the cytoplasm lining the vertical walls , a feature well seen in both transverse and surface sections ( Fig. 98 , Pa. ; Fig. 99 , A ; see also Fig. 89 ) . This peripheral position is clearly favourable to the rapid absorption of carbon dioxide from the adjacent inter-cellular spaces . Moreover , the chloroplasts , as a result , present their edges to the light so that the chlorophyll is less exposed to the injurious effects of excessive illumination . Owing to the considerable length of the palisade cells , there is accommodation for a large number of chloroplasts in each . In some plants , moreover , the chloroplast-bearing surface is increased by the development of special infoldings of the wall arm-palisade , e.g. in the leaves of the Elder ( Fig. too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf of the Fuchsia two or three palisade cells frequently join by their lower ends on to one and the same cell of the spongy parenchyma ( Fig. 98 ; see also Fig. too , c.c. ; Fig. 346 ) . The cells in question are usually broadened at their upper ends , so that they are more or less funnel-shaped . Presumably the photosynthetic products ( carbohydrates , etc. ) formed in the palisade cells pass into these collecting cells and from them diffuse , via other spongy elements , to the veins . The spongy parenchyma , in its most typical form ( e.g. in Euphorbia amygdaloides ) , consists of irregularly lobed cells attached to one another by their projecting arms ( cf. Fig. 346 ) , so that wide intercellular spaces occur between them . In the Fuchsia and in many leaves , however , the cells are more rounded and the inter- // spaces consequently smaller ( Fig. 98 , In. ; Fig. 99 , B ) . The rather few chloroplasts in the spongy , as compared with the palisade , parenchyma may be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . The layer in contact with the lower epidermis is not uncommonly continuous ( except for the gaps constituted by the respiratory cavities , Fig. 98 , R. ) , and its cells may even show a palisade-like form when they generally . contain rather numerous chloroplasts ( e.g. Corn Cockle ) , and serve to utilise the light reaching the under side of the leaf . The spongy tissue creates an extensive intercellular system nmmunicating on the one hand with the external atmosphere by t-y of the stomata , and on the other hand with the entire aerating stem of the rest of the plant . The spongy cells also serve to con-uct elaborated food-materials in various directions to the adjacent ins , whilst their cell-sap provides a reserve supply of water which uy be partially surrendered to the palisade cells , with their higher ction pressure . The structure of the mesophyll just described is characteristic dorsiventral leaves generally , the following being the chief idifications . The palisade tissue not uncommonly consists of oral layers ( e.g. Holly , Fig. 89 , A ) , a feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves eloped in dull light may have little or no palisade tissue . In c plants ( e.g. the House-leek ) the photosynthetic cells are gated parallel to the midrib , whilst in transverse section they ar more or less rounded . // Variegated leaves usually exhibit a similar structure to that of the normal foliage of the same species , except that the pale areas lack chlorophyll and may have smaller epidermal cells . It need hardly be said that the structure of reduced foliage-leaves ( e.g. scale-leaves of rhizomes , bud-scales , etc. ) is of a much simpler character . Such are usually colourless with a homogeneous mesophyll , and often possess no veins . Movement of chloroplasts in conformity with the intensity of illumination is seen in a few plants ( e.g. Duckweed , Lemna ; Moss-leaves , etc . ) . In these the chloroplasts occupy a profile position on the vertical walls when the light is intense , whilst when weak the chloroplasts pass to the horizontal walls , so that their full surface is presented towards the source of illumination . The vascular tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dicotyledons and a parallel system in most Monocotyledons . ' The repeated branching facilitates not only the delivery of water and mineral salts to all parts of the leaf , but also the rapid removal of elaborated food-substances . The vascular system , however , also constitutes a supporting skeleton for the lamina , in which it is often aided by accompanying mechanical tissues ; the latter are found especially in the larger veins , and consist of strands of collenchyma ( Fig. 98 , M. ) or sclerenchyma , which run both above and below the vascular bundles or sometimes on the lower side only . A transverse section through one of the larger veins of the leaf shows a single bundle enveloped in a sheath of one or more layers of large transparent thin-walled parenchyma-cells ( Fig. 98 , Sh. ; cf. also Fig. 346 , V. ) ; the accompanying collenchyma ( M. ) is developed especially on the lower side . The xylem , which is adjacent to the palisade tissue , consists of rows of vessels alternating with wood-parenchyma , the protoxylem being directed towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies on both sides of the xylem , although in most leaves it is found only on the lower side . Between xylem and phloem a cambium can often be recognised ( Fig. 98 ) , especially in evergreen leaves ( e.g. Holly ) which remain on the plant for more than one year . In passing to the finer and finer ramifications of the vascular system a gradual simplification in structure is apparent . The differentiation of the phloem becomes less and less distinct , its place being taken by a more or less uniform tissue of thin-walled elong-ated cells , whilst at the ultimate terminations of the bundles it often disappears completely . Similarly the xylem-vessels gradually give place to relatively short spiral or reticulate tracheids ( Fig. 41A // p. 69 ) , the amount of wood-parenchyma diminishing till it dies out . Thus the bundle-ends usually consist only of tracheids surrounded by the single-layered parenchyma-sheath . In larger leaves ( e.g. Sunflower ) the midrib often contains several bundles , and in the Docks ( Rumex ) and the Rhubarb ( Rheum rhaponticum ) quite a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply is proportional to the size of the leaf , and this is ruc also of the petiole . Small leaves ( e.g. Cerastium , Fig. 102 ) requcntly possess but a single petiolar strand orientated as in the mina , whilst larger ones usually have several bundles grouped in n arc , with its opening towards the concave or flattened upper urlace ( Fig. lot , A , B , D ) and the protoxylems directed inwards . such petioles the strands commonly vary appreciably in size and mbcr at different levels owing to frequent anastomoses , while ' cssory strands may traverse the pith or the often widened upper files ( Fig . Io1 , C ) . Sometimes ( e.g. Pelargonium ) the bundles form ring , while the vertically flattened petioles of the Aspen ( Populus ) ula ) are traversed by three superposed concentric strands . The bundles of the petiole can be traced backwards some little time into the cortex of the stem , following a slightly oblique rsc , so that , in sections cut transversely just below the nodes , the // one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf into the stem appear cut obliquely in the cortex . After penetrating some little way into the latter the bundles turn abruptly downwards and run vertically through one or more internodes , ultimately , with ( Fig. 102 ) or without previous branching , fusing laterally with strands derived from other leaves . The bundles traversing the stem are therefore merely downward continuations of those found in the leaves . In the region of the nodes the vascular system may be very complex and not uncommonly forms a more or less continuous network of vessels or tracheids with diverse orientation . The vascular supply of the axillary bud often arises from the central cylinder as two separate strands which soon unite to form a ring . These strands usually pass off horizontally and at a higher level than those entering the subtending leaf . In Monocotyledons the sheathing leaf-bases completely encircle the axis , numerous strands passing from each leaf into the stem . The median vascular bundles often pass almost to the centre of the stem before they bend down-wards ; subsequently they pursue a longitudinal direction , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more laterally strands follow a similar course , but do placed ' not penetrate to the same depth . As a result the vascular bundles from the successive leaves usually appear irregularly scattered through the cross-section ( cf. p. 140 ) , but tend to be more densely crowded near the outside ( Fig. 87 , D , p. 145 ) . The mechanics of the leaf differ in several respects from that of the stem . The petioles of most leaves , when at rest , have to withstand a one-sided stress acting mainly from above and due to the weight of the blade , which may be much increased during rain . The arrangement of the mechanical tissue in the form of an inverted arch , open on the upper side ( see Fig. 101 , B , D ) , gives considerable strength to meet the usual bending stresses from above , but is not so rigid as the closed tube found in stems . It therefore allows of a certain flexibility , so that the leaf readily assumes a streamline position during gusts of wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wood-sorrel ( Fig. 173 ) , and Garden Nasturtium ( Fig. 117 , B ) , in which the petiole is attached // more or less centrally and at right angles to the blade , the stress is almost equally distributed over the leaf-stalk and the arrangement of the vascular strands is more like that of a stem ( cf. Fig. lot , C ) . I n radical leaves ( e.g. Daisy ) which rest on the ground , the open arch arrangement is greatly flattened out . The tearing action of wind and hail is to a large extent obviated by the strengthening network formed by the veins , and especially by the occurrence of marginal mechanical elements . The latter are either vascular strands , linking the finer veins and running parallel to the margin ( Red Currant ) or consist of bundles of fibres ( e.g. Iris ) occupying the same position . Moreover , the epidermal cells at the edge of the leaf are usually especially thickened and have a pronounced cuticle . The leaves so far considered exhibit a marked difference of structure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which is probably related to the horizontal position . In the Iris and other Monocotyledons , where the leafblades stand vertically and both surfaces receive an equal amount of light , the structure is identical on the two sides ( isobilateral type ) . The structure of most Monocotyledon leaves is in fact more comparable to that of the Dicotyledon petiole than to that of the leaf blade . In still other instances ( e.g. Onion , White Stonecrop , Sedum album ) , the leaves are more or less cylindrical , and , apart from the dorsiventral arrangement of the vascular bundles , exhibit radial organisation , with a palisade layer extending uniformly round the periphery ( centric type ) . CHAPTER XVI SECONDARY THICKENING IT was pointed out in the preceding chapter that the vascular ' supply of the leaf is roughly proportional to its size ( p. 167 ) , and in the same way the vascular system of the stem is correlated with the area of leaf-surface which it bears . With the annual increase of foliage exhibited by all woody perennials , a need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied through the activity of a meristem ( the cambium , p. 136 ) situated between the xylem and phloem of the bundles . Cambium is found in this position in all Dicotyledons and Conifers ( see p. 412 ) , but in Monocotyledons is present only occasionally as a vestige ( e.g. in the leaf-sheaths of the Maize and in the leaves of many other Grasses ) . The division of the cells of the cambium leads to the formation of additional conducting elements , accompanied by a gradual increase in the size of the stem , spoken of as secondary thickening . Enlargement does not , however , always imply celldivision , since in some Palms , where no active cambium occurs , there is increase in girth mainly due to enlargement of the cells already present . The cambium may be regarded as arising from an unaltered portion of the procambium ( cf. p. 147 ) , which has retained its powers of division , but until it becomes active it is difficult to recognise . The actual cambium is established by the appearance of two parallel tangential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out . a single layer of radially flattened cells ( Fig. 103 , A , C. ) which have dense protoplasmic contents and prominent nuclei and , as seen in longitudinal section ( Fig. 84 , Ca. ; 103 , B ) , have an elongated form and tapering ends . Subsequent division of these cells takes place parallel to the two tangential faces whereby files of segments are produced , both on the outer and inner side , those adjacent to the phloem becoming differentiated as additional ( secondary ) phloem , those adjacent to the xylem as additional ( secondary ) xylem . In certain sectors , however , the cambial cells divide transversely to form groups of isodiametric cells I70 // which appear spindle-shaped in tangential section and from which the rays ( p. 173 ) are produced ( Fig. 103 , B , r ) . According to the character of the procambial tissue ( cf. pp. 146 , 147 ) , the cambium at first consists either of separate strips which subsequently join laterally , or it appears as a complete cylinder from its inception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cambium within the bundles , division by two tangential walls takes place progressively in certain cells of the rays , and , where a starch-sheath is present , these occur in the pericycle ( e.g. hypocotyl of the Castor Oil plant , Fig. 103 , I.c . ) . The cam bium between the bundles ( interfascicular , Fig. 103 , I.e. ) links up Vvith that within the bundles ( intrafascicular , Fig. 103 , C. ) to form a omplete meristematic ring . In woody perennials the cambium sumes its function each year , although division is arrested during c winter months . The secondary wood thus added on the inside forms a larger d larger core each year ( Fig. 104 ) . Since it is composed of hard I72 FEATURES OF SECONDARY THICKENING persistent tissue , there is practically no compression of the wood , which progressively augments , so that the increase in girth of the stem serves as a rough measure of the amount of tissue added . To this enlargement the secondary phloem contributes but little , since this tissue is mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more , as a consequence of the increasing pressure resulting from the growth of the wood and the annual formation of intercalated phloem . The cambium keeps pace with the enlarging circumference of the secondary wood , mainly by radial division and growth of its cells or by transverse divisions and gliding growth ( p. 6o ) . The pressure on the outer tissues , due to the interpolation of secondary vascular elements between the primary xylem and phloem , becomes more and more marked as the years go by and its effects are most pronounced in the cortex . Moreover , the steady increase in size of the woody core results in a gradual en largement of its circumference , so that the softer tissues beyond become tangentially stretched . This tension can be readily // demonstrated by making an extended vertical incision through the cortex of a three-year-old twig of the Ash . The edges of the cut are seen to separate immediately owing to transverse contraction of the thin-walled tissues . In nature the tangential tension is exemplified by the irregular longitudinal fissures which are so marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In regions where the cambium consists of groups of isodiametric cells ( p. 170 ) , the segments cut off are parenchymatous , and differ from the other elements of the wood and phloem in being radially and not longitudinally elongated ( Fig . Io6 , A , m.r . ) . In transverse sections of a secondarily thickened stem these parenchyma rays appear as a number of radiating streaks , one or more cells in width ( Fig. 104 , pr . and Sr. ) . Some of these rays extend from cortex to pith ( pr. ) and , since they correspond in position to the original rays between the vascular bundles , are called primary rays ; others ( the secondary parenchyma rays , Sr. ) , however , though tra-versing the greater part of the secondary phloem , penetrate onl to a varying depth towards the centre . In some plants ( e.g. Aristolochia ) the primary rays are very wide , and practically the whole of the interfascicular cambial strips participate in their formation . The secondary wood is composed of four main types of elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-parenchyma , but tran-sitions between the different types Are not infrequent . The corn-ponent elements often exhibit a distinct radial arrangement ( e.g. Horse Chestnut ) , though this may be somewhat obscured when the vessels are large and numerous ( e.g. Lime , Elm ) . The vessels of the secondary wood usually bear densely crowded bordered pits ( Fig. 1o6 , V ; Fig. 40 , E , b , p. 68 ) , often arranged in distinct vertical series , and not uncommonly show additional reticulate or spiral thickenings deposited on the inner surface of the wall . The perforated septa are frequently oblique ( Fig. io6 , C , V ) with reference to the radial plane , a // feature which can be related to the peculiar form of the cambial segments from which the vessels are derived . The perforations are varied ( cf. p. 61 and Fig. 40 , D ? F ) , but the type in which a number of cross-bars remain is commoner than in the primary wood . Tracheids ( cf. p. 70 ) differ from vessels in being derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open perforations in the end-walls ; they are usually much shorter than the vessels , but of about the same width . The vessels and tracheids are the water-conducting elements of the secondary wood , and the former are generally much more numerous than the latter ; in fact , tracheids may be almost absent ( e.g. Willow ) . The typical wood-fibres closely resemble those described on p. 66 , having pointed ends and more or less thickened walls , which bear occasional oblique slit-shaped simple pits ( Fig. 106 , f . ) . As the pit-apertures on the two sides of the wall are often inclined in opposite directions , a X-like appearance is commonly presented . Fibres of this type are connected by transitions with others which hear bordered pits with oblique slits ( e.g. Beech ) , and differ but little from the fibrous tracheids of the Conifers ( see p. 412 ) . In the typical wood-fibres the walls are lignified and the contents dead ; but fibre-like cells with living protoplasts occur in the secondary wood of the Sycamore and of many herbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute transitions to wood-parenchyma . Where vessels are in contact with the ordinary mechanical fibres , pits are not developed on the walls . The wood-parenchyma cells of the secondary xylem resemble those of the primary xylem , in form and in the possession of a living protoplast ; the walls are , however , commonly thicker and often lignified , the horizontal ones showing prominent pitting ( Fig. t o6 , p . ) . Wood-parenchyma cells may be generally distributed throughout the wood ( e.g. Birch , Beech ) , or more especially confined to the summer-formed wood and the immediate vicinity of the vessels , sometimes completely ensheathing them ( e.g. Ash ) . The parenchyma in contact with the vessels bears simple pits corresponding in position to pits of the vessel wall , which latter are here either simple ( e.g. Oak ) or bordered ( one-sided bordered pits ) , like the remaining pits of the vessel wall . The structure of the parenchyma rays can only be fully appreciated by a study of their appearance in transverse and in longitudinal sections , both radial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that their long axis is placed radially and not vertically , are very similar to those of the woodparenchyma , though not uncommonly having somewhat thinner Walls . The latter bear simple pits which are often particularly // numerous on the tangential walls ( Fig. io6 , B ; Fig. io8 , m . ) . The simple pits of the radial walls and the bordered pits of the vessels combine to form one-sided bordered pits like those described above . Attention has already been drawn to the variable width of the rays . In general the secondary parenchyma rays are narrow and often only one cell wide ; the primary ones in most trees do not greatly exceed the secondary in width , but in many herbs the contrast is extremely marked . Each ray is a plate of cells of which the full vertical extent is seen in tangential longitudinal sections ( Fig. io6 , C , m.r . ) . The secondary parenchyma rays are very limited in this direction , rarely exceeding ten or twelve cells in height , whilst the primary rays usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in tangential section , is somewhat spindle-shaped as a result of the tapering of the cells at the upper and lower margins ( Fig. io6 , C , m.r . ) . In radial longitudinal sections the secondary rays are cut parallel to their flat faces , and appear as so many narrow parenchymatous strips passing at right angles across the longitudinal grain of the wood ( Fig. io6 , B ) . The detailed structure of the ray here somewhat resembles that of a brick wall , the alternation of the cells simulating the " bond " of the bricks . The component cells show plainly the radial elongation referred to above , but sometimes those at the upper and lower margins are short and not markedly lengthened ( e.g. Willows ) . The radial , like the vertical , extent of the secondary rays is seen to be limited ( cf. p. 173 ) . Should the radial section pass through one of the primary rays , the latter will be seen to show a far greater development , both in the vertical and radial directions . Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood-parenchyma and the parenchyma rays are the only living constituents of the secondary wood . The living cylinder constituted by the phloem and cortex is thus connected with numerous inwardly directed plates of living tissue , the parenchyma rays . Of these , however , only the primary ones extend to the pith , where they are linked up by a second cylinder of living cells , the medullary sheath ( p. 137 ) , which invests the inner margins of the primary xylem tissue . The radiating plates formed by the secondary rays are , however , not isolated , even where they pass between the dead elements of the secondary wood , since they are connected both vertically and horizontally by bands of woodparenchyma cells . The mass of vessels and fibres is thus permeated by a continuous system of living elements connected with the food-conductANNUAL // ing tissues and seemingly fulfilling at least two functions : firstly , to conduct elaborated food-substances to the cambial region , the living cells of the wood , and the medullary sheath ; secondly , at certain times of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. starch , as can be shown by the application of iodine to a section of a twig in autumn . When this starch is utilised during the sprouting of the buds in spring , it is changed into sugar , and is then transferred in the water ascending the vessels to the growing regions , hence the sweet character of the sap which exudes in bleeding . ' The aeration of the secondary tissues is effected by narrow intercellular spaces which are more particularly associated with the living elements . The major part of each annual addition to the secondary wood usually consists of vessels and fibres , but the proportion of these latter varies with the kind of plant and during each season 's growth . The wood formed in spring ( early wood , Fig. 1o6 , A , S. ) mostly contains a much larger percentage of vessels than that formed in summer ( late wood , A. ) ; its vessels , moreover , are often larger and have thinner walls , and the same may be true of the fibres . This difference may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring on the part of the newly-expanding leaves , whilst later in the season provision is possible for the growing mechanical requirements 2 of the plant by an increased proportion of ' fibres . As a consequence there is often a sharp boundary between the dense small-celled late wood of one season and the wide-celled early wood of the next ( Fig . Io6 ) , and this leads to the marking out of the secondary wood into a succession of growth rings ( Fig. 104 ) , by means of which the approximate age of a trunk can be estimated . In Evergreens and some other trees in which the seasonal leaf-production is not so marked , the vessels tend to be more evenly distributed . Such wood is termed diffuse-porous , in contrast to the ring-porous type previously described . Occasionally , when a new set of leaves is produced to replace a first crop killed by frost or devoured by caterpillars , their expansion is accompanied by the formation of a second zone of early wood , so that two " annual rings " are formed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly determined by nutrition , often influenced by climate , though the variations in thickness in one and the same ring are probably the result of mechanical stresses . 12 // Such asymmetrical growth rings , with a maximum development on the upper or lower side , are commonly found in horizontal branches . Extreme asymmetry is seen in the " buttress-roots " observed in many tropical trees ( e.g. species of Ficus ) . The constant addition of new wood is perhaps mainly necessi-tated by changes in the central earlier-formed xylem , as a result of which it becomes useless for purposes of conduction , although such changes often increase its value as a mechanical support ; it is then spoken of as heart-wood in contrast to the active sap-wood beyond . The elements of the heart-wood often become impregnated with tannins , resins , etc. , which are frequently accompanied by dark-coloured pigments ; in some trees the latter are extracted and afford useful dyes , e.g. the logwood ( hamatoxylin ) obtained from Hcenaa-toxylon campechianum ( Tropical America ) . The employment of mahogany , walnut , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart-wood and the high polish which its hard character enables it to take . In the Ebony-tree ( Diospyros ) the sap-wood is white and not especially hard , the ebony of commerce being the mature , very hard , and almost black heart-wood . In some plants ( e.g. Beech ) little heart-wood is formed , much of the xylem remaining functional . The impregnating substances are often antiseptic , and prevent decay by inhibiting the development of Fungi and Bacteria , thus increasing the durability of the wood . Teak ( Tectona grandis ) owes its value as a tropical timber to the presence of a substance which renders it immune from the depredations of wood-boring insects ; it is also the cause of its peculiar scent . The liability of many Willows to develop hollow trunks at an early stage may be attributed to the absence of antiseptic substances from the older wood . The cavities of the water-conducting elements in the heart-wood are frequently blocked in various ways , most commonly by the ingrowth of structures known as tyloses ( Fig. 107 ) . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells , into the vessels , and are sometimes so numerous as to fill the latter completely with a false tissue resembling parenchyma . They are bounded by the extended thin-walled pit-membrane , which undergoes a certain amount of surface growth , and occasionally becomes thickened and lignified ( e.g. Robinia pseudacacia ) . Each of the young tyloses is living , containing cytoplasm , cell-sap , and sometimes also a nucleus ; but when they have reached their full size both the tyloses and the wood-parenchyma cells 1 of the heart- // wood die , so that the whole of the latter consists of dead elements . Tyloses are also produced in herbaceous stems ( e.g. Vegetable Marrow , Fig. 107 ) , but here their function is obscure . The plugging of the vessels of the heart-wood is , however , not always effected in this way , since in other plants mineral deposits ( lime in the Elm ) may take their place . In tree-trunks , which have been cut across , the vessels look like small pin-pricks on the smooth surface of the wood and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the spokes of a wheel are the rays ( cf. Fig. 104 ) . In a block of wood , which has been cut radially , we can recognise the long tubes firmed by the vessels and irregularly shaped silvery bands passing across them ( the silver grain of the Oak ) , which are the rays . When the wood is cut tangentially , the same features may be made out , the rays now , however , appearing as short vertical streaks . The mechanical properties of timbers 1 depend largely on the proportion oC fibres , on the number and size of the vessels , and on the thickness of the 18o TIMBER fibre walls . Thus , close-textured ( close-grained ) woods ( e.g. Box , Holly ) are characterised by having abundant fibres and small vessels , whilst the coarse or open texture of wood ( seen in Oak , Ash , etc. ) is due to the large number of wide vessels and often to the thin character of the fibres as well . The " soft-woods " of commerce are obtained from Conifers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cf. p. 412 ) , usually having thinner walls than the fibres of hardwood trees . The employment of timber for commercial purposes is determined by such qualities as closeness of texture , ease of working , elasticity , toughness , durability , colour , figure , etc . Thus the resilience of the wood of certain types of Willow is responsible for their use in the manufacture of cricket-bats , whilst the ancient esteem of Yew ( Taxus baccata ) for bows , and the use of Ash where bending is required , are the outcome of the elasticity and toughness of these woods . The elastic limit of Ash is only reached under a stress of about 5000 lb. per square inch as compared with 3500 lb. for Douglas Fir . Such qualities are probably not only the result of length of fibre , but also one of physical or chemical constitution of the xylem walls . Liability to splitting is often due to straightness of the constituent elements , while it is their small size that renders the timber of the Hornbeam ( Carpinus ) so suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which many woods are chiefly prized , is largely dependent on the direction of the fibres and the prominence of the parenchyma rays when cut in certain planes . To render timber suitable for use , the cut log needs to undergo a process of seasoning , which involves the drying out of the sap and water , a process that in the open occupies from six months to a year or even longer in hardwoods , and about half the time for Coniferous timber . Artificial means ( e.g. heating // in special sheds or by electricity ) are now frequently employed in order to shorten this period . The greatest care is necessary in seasoning to avoid undue stresses and strains , which bring about warping and splitting of the timber , defects that commonly develop if the process be unduly hastened . This is partly due to the fact that the tangential shrinkage is often nearly double that of the radial . For this reason radial cracks , that open wider and wider as the trunk dries , are not uncommon . Other common defects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vascular tissues of lateral branches that have become embedded in the wood of the trunk ; in forestry their development is checked by dense planting . In the following list are enumerated some of the more important timbers , their principal uses , and the trees from which they are derived : Table The secondary phloem ( Fig. io5 ) , like the primary , consists of renchyma , sieve-tubes , and companion cells , but these last are mmonly larger and fibres are often present . The septa in the eve-tubes are not uncommonly oblique and provided with several // perforated areas separated by bar-like thickenings ( compound sieve-plates ) . In some plants the phloem-parenchyma and sievetubes , with their companion cells , are produced in such regular sequence as to form alternating tangential bands . The fibres are likewise often disposed in layers separating the zones of thin-walled elements ( e.g. Lime , Mallow , etc . ) . Vertical series of phloemparenchyma cells , occupied by crystals of oxalate of lime , and elongated secretory elements ( e.g. tannin-sacs , cf. p. 92 ) are not uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed out of use , is not infrequently shed with the bark ( p. 190 ) . The parenchyma rays of the secondary phloem are continuous with those of the xylem and exhibit the same general structure , except that the component cells remain thin-walled . In certain Flowering Plants ( e.g. Lime , etc. ) the outer ends of the primary parenchyma rays exhibit a marked V-shaped enlargement , whereby the secondary phloem becomes divided up into a number of wedgelike groups . A transverse section of any unthickened Dicotyledonous root will show a narrow band of two or three layers of parenchymatous cells between each phloem-group and the adjacent xylem . Prior to the commencement of secondary growth tangential divisionwalls arise in these cells , leading to the production of a cambium ( Fig. 56 , ca. , p. rot ) like that of the stem . In this way there originate as many cambial strips ( Fig. 109 , A , B , C. ) as there are groups of phloem , and , by the active division of the former , secondary xylem is produced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cambium is at first confined to the inner surface of each phloem-group , but by slow degrees it extends along the sides of the xylem-arms till finally , by the development of tangential division-walls in the cells of the pericycle opposite the protoxylems , a complete lobed cylinder of cambium is established . Owing to the late development of the cambium opposite the protoxylem-groups , secondary thickening is at first more extensive in the bays , so that the outline of the cambium , at first lobed , gradually becomes circular . The root soon comes to possess a broad ring of secondary wood and phloem ( Fig. 109 , C ) , similar to that of the stem , and , as in the latter , traversed by primary ( P.r. ) and secondary rays . The former , which , especially in herbs , often attain a considerable width , are situated along the same radii as , and are equal in number to , the primary xylem-groups ( P.xy . ) . When these primary rays are broad and consist only of parenchyma , the secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parenchymatous rays is not so marked as that of the wood , so that // certain diarch roots , after secondary thickening , sometimes exhibit a band-like structure ( e.g. Nettle ) . The secondary rays , like those of the stem , are generally narrow . The vessels and wood-parenchyma of the secondary wood of the root are relatively more numerous and more evenly distributed than in the stem , so that the growth rings are usually less con spicuous . In its detailed structure the secondary phloem is similar to that of the stem , and , except for the points already mentioned , the same is true of the secondary wood . In the root , as in the aerial axis , the production of secondary tissues forces the primary phloem progressively farther from the centre . Old , secondarily thickened roots resemble stems very closely , but , when the central tissues are preserved , the original root-structure can be traced by lullowing down the primary rays and locating the protoxylem groups at the periphery of the metaxylem . The storage of food in fleshy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often copiously developed both in the secondary phloem and in the secondary xylem . The vessels of the latter then form isolated groups , which are either scattered or arranged in radial files ( e.g. Salsify , Tragopogon , Fig. 52 , A ) in the storage tissues , a distribution facilitating rapid transference from the storage cells when growth is resumed . In such roots the limits of secondary xylem and phloem are often difficult to distinguish , unless the cambium be first located ; moreover , the primary xylem is often indistinguishable . The process of secondary thickening so far described is that normally found in the vast majority of Dicotyledons and Conifers , but a few so-called anomalous types merit a brief consideration . In many members of the Spinach- family ( Chenopodiacex ) the normal cambium functions only for a short time and , after forming a narrow strip of secondary xylem and phloem , ceases to divide . Thereupon another cambium arises in the inner part of the cortex , and anew strip of xylem and phloem is produced till this cambium in its turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again , each successive cambium forming xylem on the inner and phloem on on the outer side . In the root of the Beet ( Beta ) the successive cambia form continuous rings of xylem and phloem , its fleshy character being mainly due to the extensive development of the latter tissue . In most stems showing this kind of abnormal thickening , however , xylem and phloem are produced only in certain sectors , and appear as secondary bundles separated by the thick-walled ground-tissue , developed from the remaining parts of each cambium ( e.g. Halimione portulacoides ) . Another uncommon method , shown by certain Monocotyledons // which exhibit marked secondary increase in girth , is well illustrated by the Dragon-tree ( Draccena ) , the stems of which may attain a diameter of ten feet or more . The bundles of the young stem here exhibit the usual scattered arrangement ; but in the cortex , immediately beyond the vascular region , there arises a cambium ( Fig. to , Ca. ) which cuts off segments mainly towards the inside , the small number cut off on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( C. ) . Some of the inner segments divide and undergo gradual differentiation to form secondary bundles ( S.b. ) , whilst the remainder , retaining a somewhat radial arrangement , become thickened and lignified . The secondary bundles embedded in this thick-walled tissue are concentric with centrally placed phloem ( P. ) , which is often very scanty in amount ; the xylem contains no vessels , consisting of fibrous tracheids only . Very complicated types of anomalous thickening are exhibited by the woody climbers ( lianes ) of tropical forests . In many of these the old trunks develop cambial rings about several centres , each such cambium producing a separate xylem-core , so that a rope-like structure composed of several intertwined woody strands results . Most of these woody climbers are characterised by the large size of the vessels , as is well seen in the wild Clematis . The activity of the cambium , which is responsible for the normal processes of secondary thickening , is always seasonal in the shoots of plants living in temperate latitudes , being completely arrested during the winter and restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cambium can only be distinguished with difficulty as a somewhat shrunken layer just outside the wood , but with the resumption of activity in spring the cells become turgid and translucent . Division of the cambial cells commences just below the expanding buds and from there gradually spreads basipetally down the internodes . It is recognisable in the shoot some time before it becomes evident in the root , and here is seen in the main root before spreading to the branches . Cessation of cambial activity follows the same sequence . There is evidence that small traces of chemical substances ( auxins , see p. 253 ) , diffusing in a downward direction , are responsible for the initiation and apparent downward extension of cambial activity in the various parts of the axis . CHAPTER XVII CORK-FORMATION AND THE BARK ONE result of secondary thickening is a marked enlargement of the periphery of stem or root , in consequence of which the outer tissues are subjected to increasing tension ( cf. p. 172 ) . These , the epidermis and cortex , ordinarily have but a limited power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , they rupture and no longer form an effective covering for the underlying tissues . This function is henceforth fulfilled by a protective tissue , the cork , formed by the active division of a secondary meristem , the phellogen or cork-cambium , which arises in the cortex . In a few plants ( e.g. Acer striatum ) the epidermal and cortical cells are capable of limited growth and division , and here the formation of a cork-cambium is correspondingly delayed . Cork-formation takes place in essentially the same way in both stem and root . The phellogen invariably arises by the formation of two successive tangential walls , in the stem most commonly in the cells of the subepidermal layer ( Fig . III ) . The cells are thus each divided into three segments , of which the central constitute the actual cork-cambium ( c.c. ) , whilst the outer form the first layer of cork and the inner the first , and often the only , layer of a tissue known as phelloderm ( Ph . ) . Whilst the outer and inner segments undergo no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , one of the two products of each division becoming differentiated as cork or phelloderm , while the other remains as the cell of the cork-cambium . Usually , however , these divisions of the phellogen lead to the cutting-off of cells on the outside only , so that no further formation of phelloderm takes place . The activity of the phellogen results in the development of a continuous cylinder of tissue consisting of numerous radial files of cells , each file ( Fig . III , 1 ? 6 ) representing the product of one cork-cambium cell . This tissue is the cork and , apart from the absence of intercellular spaces between its cells , it is especially characterised by a chemical modification of the cell-walls spoken of as suberisation . This latter renders them practically impervious 186 // alike to gases and to liquids , features to which cork owes its utilisation in closing bottles . Suberisation is due to the deposition of a layer of fatty mompounds on the inner surface of the wall , and hence cork is coloured by the same reagents ( Scharlach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colouration is assumed with chlor-zinc-iodide , and a yellow one with strong potash . On boiling with concentrated potash , large yellow globules often escape from the walls . Suberised membranes , moreover , are highly resistant , being insoluble both in cuprammonia and concentrated sulphuric acid . Suberisation of the walls ensues soon after the cork-cells are cut off from the phellogen , and it is almost unnecessary to add that , as a result , the cells die , their contents ultimately consisting of air or more rarely of pigmented bodies ( often tannins and their derivatives ) . The characteristic white appearance of the surface of the Birch ( Betula ) is due to the presence in the cells of the cork of solid granules of a substance known as betulin . The cells of the cork vary considerably in shape , although very commonly flattened . The walls are often relatively thin . The radial walls are frequently thrown into folds , whilst the tangential ones are often almost straight ( cf. Fig . III ) . These features of // the cork-cells can be related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing girth of the enclosed axis . In a few plants ( e.g. Currant , Fig. 112 , Laburnum , etc. ) a more or less extensive phelloderm ( Ph. ) is formed . The cells of this tissue also are arranged in radial files , but the walls remain un suberised . The phelloderm consists of living cells , and thus merely serves to augment the primary cortex , although where the walls are thickened it has an additional mechanical value . Whilst the cork-cambium most commonly develops in the subepidermal layer of cells , it not infrequently arises in deeper-seated cortical layers ( Fig. 112 ) or even in the pericycle . A good instance is furnished by the Barberry ( Fig. 113 ) , where the phellogen ( C.C. ) develops just inside the ring of mechanical tissue ( Sc. ) occupying the inner part of the cortex . In roots , too , it almost // invariably arises in cortical cells in the immediate neighbourhood of the pericycle ( Fig . Io9 , C , Co . ) . The origin of a cork-cambium from the epidermis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose , Apple , Hawthorn , and other members of the Rosacea . The cork not only prevents the excessive transpiration which would ensue after rupture of the epidermis consequent upon secondary thickening , but also takes over other protective functions of that tissue . Suberised walls possess considerable strength , though their elas-ticity is slight , and the cork consequently forms a mechanical envelope whose efficiency is heightened by the close connection between its cells . The frequent presence presence of air in the latter retards excessive heating by day or excessive cooling by night . Moreover , the waste countered substances commonly en-in the walls or cavities of the cork-cells are antiseptic , excluding access of various parasites to the living tissues within . As soon as cork-development commences , therefore , the parts concerned become ensheathed in an almost impermeable protective layer which would practi-tally sever all direct communication between the internal tissues and the atmosphere , but for the formation of localised patches of loose tissue , the lenticels , whose development often commences slightly before that of the cork ( see Fig. 67 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem , where strips of cambium are formed in the sub-epidermal layer by the customary tangential divisions . These cambial strips divide very actively , cutting off segments on both sides . Those on the inner give rise to radial rows of phelloderm , // whilst those on the outer remain thin-walled and unsuberised , but sooner or later round off and frequently lose all connection with one another ( Fig. 114 , 1 . ) . This loose tissue 1 is formed in con siderable bulk , so that it leads to a gradual elevation and ultimate rupture of the overlying epidermis . The tissue of the lenticel is thus exposed , and air from the external atmosphere can freely circulate between its cells and , by way of the narrow air-spaces between the cells of the phellogen and phelloderm , into the inter-cellular spaces of the cortex . The rounding-off of the constituent cells and consequent development of the intercellular spaces vary considerably , so that the lenticel may be spongy ( e.g. Elm , Birch ) or relatively compact ( e.g. Willow , Spindle-tree ) . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strips of cambium giving rise to the lenticels subsequently become continuous with the cork-cambium ( Fig. 114 ) . Where the cork is deep-seated , the tissues external to it are practically cut off from all sources of food and all connection with the interior , and therefore die away . These dead tissues , on the outside of the cork , are shed sooner or later , leaving the latter exposed as bark . In some plants ( e.g. Beech , Oak ) the same cork-cambium continues to divide year after year , although inactive during the winter , so that a thick mass of cork is formed . This is also true of the Cork Oak ( Quercus suber ) , which is the main source of the commercial article . In this tree the first cork , which here arises subepidermally , is of no value , being removed when the tree is ten to fifteen years old . The cortex thus exposed forms a Forming the so-called " complementary tissue . " BARK 191 , new phellogen which gives rise to the thin-walled cork of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The corks for bottles are cut in such a way that the long dark lenticels traverse them transversely . In most woody plants the first-formed phellogen ceases to divide , and indeed itself becomes changed into a layer of cork , at a comparatively early stage . A new cambium then arises at a deeper level in the cortex , produces a fresh zone of cork , and then in its turn passes out of action , to be succeeded by another situated still deeper . The bark formed in this way consists of alternating layers of cork and dead cortex , and comprises all the tissues beyond the most recently established phellogen . When the original cork-cambium is deep-seated , the subsequent cambia are continuous cylinders ; whilst when the first is superficial , the later ones are often merely curved vertical plates whose margins are in contact with one another . As the bark gets thicker and thicker the outer portions are subjected to a growing tension , so that , being dead tissue , fissures appear at the surface as irregular longi-tudinal furrows well seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oldest bark is shed , and this takes place either as rings ( ring-bark , e.g. Birch , Cherry ) or as scales ( scale-bark , e.g. Plane , Scot 's Fir ) , according as the successive cork-cambia are continuous cylinders or separate plates . ' After the shedding of the first-formed cork , lenticels may develop from any part of an active phellogen . As a result of subsequent stretching they assume various orms , which are often characteristic of individual species . Thus , on the bark of the Birch and Cherry they appear as slightly raised horizontal lines , whilst in the Poplar they are usually lozenge-shaped . The cork-wings developed in many varieties of woody plants ( e.g. Cork Elm , Cork Maple , etc. ) are due to the copious formation of cork which , consisting as it does of dead cells , necessarily splits at the surface ; the regularity of the fissures may , // however , depend in part on excessive local activity of the corkcambium . It will have become apparent that cork serves to protect surfaces which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering wounds and the scars left by the shedding of leaves , flowers , branches , etc . The fall of leaves is preceded by the differentiation of a definite separating layer ( abscission layer ) which is produced , with or without division , from the cells at the base of the leaf-stalk ( Fig. 115 , S. ) . The layer in question is generally recognisable by the smaller size of its cells , and its position is often indicated externally by a slight constriction of the petiole . Subsequently the middle lamellae between its cells break down , sometimes becoming mucilaginous , and for a time the leaf is connected with the stem solely by the epidermis and the vascular bundles . Beneath the abscission layer a protective layer is formed by lignification and suberisation of the underlying cells ( Lime , Sweet Chestnut ) or of cells formed by a number of cambial divisions ( Goat Willow , Populus balsamifera ) . After leaf-fall the scar ( Fig. 67 ) becomes covered by a smooth layer of cork , which subsequently becomes continuous with that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are broken across and here the vessels are usually plugged by tyloses ( p. 178 ) . The detachment of flowers and the phenomenon of self-pruning , by which small branches of certain trees ( e.g. Poplar ) are regularly shed , is due to a similar development of a definite abscission-layer . Prior to their detachment there is considerable transport of inorganic and organic materials from the leaves into the stem . This often commences with the removal of carbohydrates and a temporary accumulation of sugars , during which red colouring matters ( anthocyanins , p. 91 ) tend to be formed . Later the green pigments disappear and the accompanying yellow ones ( p. 209 ) become conspicuous , often associated with the anthocyanins . Changes of these kinds are responsible for the brilliant autumn-colours displayed by the foliage of many trees . The fallen leaves often contain large quantities of calcium oxalate crystals and other by-products . CHAPTER XVIII THE PLANT IN RELATION TO ITS // IT has been emphasised that the root subserves several functions , of which the most important are anchorage and absorption . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only considerably increase the absorbing surface , but are juvenile , constantly renewed , cells and therefore very actively metabolising . Since transpiration under most conditions takes place from all the exposed surfaces of the shoot , a gradient is maintained throughout the plant so that water travels from the absorbing surface of the root towards the leaves . Further water from around the contiguous soil-particles therefore passes into the root-hairs and is replaced from the surrounding soil . So long as a gradient of suction pressure ( p. 45 ) exists across the root-cortex , water will pass inwards from the diluted sap of the root-hair in the direction of the arrows in Fig. 116 . When plentiful water is available , all the cortical cells in the absorbing zone may be more or less fully turgid . Even then , provided the xylem-vessels contain a higher concentration of solutes than the soil-solution , movement of water from the soil into the xylem can occur from osmotic causes , although this involves a passage of water into the vessels from the cortex against an osmotic gradient . There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ osmotic potential . Absorption of water and mineral salts is known to depend on active root-respiration , which probably provides the energy for forcing salts to move against their diffusion gradients and so establishing the osmotic gradients necessary to move the water . The forcing of water into the xylem may actually he mainly due to hydrostatic pressure . The rate of absorption of water is greatly affected by the tem-perature of the soil , diminishing rapidly as it becomes colder , // although plants differ markedly as regards their capacity to absorb at lower temperatures . A phenomenon known as root-pressure manifests itself at times of active root-metabolism and respiration . It can be demonstrated in the following way : The stem of a Fuchsia or Vegetable Marrow growing in a pot is cut off about 2 inches above the soil . To the cut stump one of the horizontal arms of a T-tube is firmly connected by pressure tubing , both joints being wired on . To the other horizontal arm is attached about 3 inches of similar tubingthe free end of which can be closed by a clipAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined on to the third arm , taking care to exclude all air-bubbles . The clip is then closed . The soil is well watered and the apparatus is kept in a warm place . Very soon the mercury in the manometer will register an increasing pressure and , in a sturdy plant , this may reach nearly an atmosphere . It will be obvious that , when such root-pressure exists , it must help in forcing water up the stem , particularly when the latter is of no considerable height ; an effective root-pressure is , however , in nature not often realised except in spring . At such times liquid may exude , and even overflow , from cut stems , as may be well seen in the Cress , the Vine and in trees felled in spring . The sap exuded in bleeding is often rich in sugars ( p. 177 ) , formed from the rapid conversion of reserve-starch , and also contains mineral salts , facts which again suggest that there may be an active passage from living cells into the dead vessels . On damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transpiration is at a minimum , a considerable positive pressure results . The excess of moisture , in many plants , then escapes through special organs called hydathodes , over which it frequently collects as small drops of liquid . The hydathodes are usually situated on the margins of the leaves , e.g. at the ends of the principal veins of the peltate blade of the Garden Nasturtium ( Fig. 117 , B ) , at the tip of the leaf in Grasses ( Fig. 117 , A ) , or upon the leaf-teeth in the Marsh Marigold and Fuchsia . If any one of these plants , in a well-watered condition , is placed beneath a bell-jar in a warm moist atmosphere , the drops of liquid marking the positions of the hydathodes soon appear . They can be demonstrated more rapidly by the application of a negative pressure in the surrounding atmosphere ( cf. p. 200 , Fig. 122 , C ) . In some plants the hydathodes take the form of glandular hairs , their cells possessing dense protoplasmic contents and large nuclei . ( food examples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 118 , A ) , where they are bent , club-shaped structures situated near the veins and consisting of a row of thin-walled cells , the terminal cell often being divided into two by a vertical wall . A hydathode , exhibiting quite a different mechanism , is much commoner among British plants . These hydathodes occur gener ally above the bundle-endings , being especially located at the leaf-apex ( Grasses ) or on the tips of the leaf-teeth ( Lesser Celandine ) . In these the water escapes from so-called water-pores , which // are situated in the epidermis of the hydathode ( Fig. 120 , St. ) and resemble ordinary stomata , except that they are often larger and that their pore remains permanently open in correspondence with the absence of the characteristic thickenings in the guard-cells ; in surface sections they chiefly differ form ( Fig. 119 ) . In some in their more rounded plants but a single water-pore is associated with each hydathode ( e.g. En-chanter 's Nightshade , Fuchsia ) , but in others they are numerous ( e.g. Wild Strawberry ) , and occasion-ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaided eye ( e.g. Marsh Marigold ) . In a longitudinal section through an entire hydathode of this type ( Fig. 120 ) the end of the vascular bundle , which is here seen // to consist of tracheids only , usually enlarges somewhat , often in a cup-shaped manner . Between the tracheids and the overlying water-pores there is commonly a small-celled tissue , the epithem ( ep. ) , composed of cells with prominent nuclei and dense cyto plasmic contents ; there is often , however , a space immediately beneath the epidermis . The epithem is traversed by a system of fine intercellular spaces through which , under sufficient pressure , the water passes from the tracheids to the water-pores . Hydathodes can often be recognised at a very early stage , and are probably most active in the young leaf , which develops in an almost saturated atmosphere within the expanding bud . Active exudation of water takes place when the hydrostatic pressure within the plant becomes excessive . The hydathodes can therefore be regarded as safety-valves which avert damage to the immature cells . The liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains a very small percentage of dissolved salts . In some plants , however , the amount of the latter may be so consider-able that they remain behind as an incrustation when the water evaporates . Thus in the Saxifrages ( Saxifraga ) and the Sea-I.avender ( Limonium ) a little white scale consisting of carbonate of lime is often found in dry weather on the leaf-teeth over each of the hydathodes . The ' exudation of water from hair-like hydathodes is due to active secretion on the part of the protoplasts of the constituent cells . As a consequence secretion of water ceases , if the cells be killed by painting the surface of the leaf with a solution of corrosive sublimate or other poison . Hydathodes possessing water-pores are , however , mainly passive in their action , the water being forced out by hydrostatic pressure through the intercellular spaces of the epithem , and not by active secretion on the part of the living protoplasm. // Nectaries of flowers ( cf. p. 451 ) represent a form of secretory organ comparable to the hydathodes just considered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to the modified epidermis ( usually palisade- or papilla-like , e.g. Anemone nemorosa ) or to the underlying tissue . The nectary of the Hogweed or other common member of Umbellifera , forming the disc on the top of the ovary ( Fig. 428 , B , n ) , consists in cross-section of a mass of small glandular cells having the customary thin walls , abundant protoplasm , and large nuclei , and covered by an epidermis containing numerous stomata . The prominent cuticular ridges often exhibited by the epi-dermis of these nectaries may serve to retain the secreted fluid in situ . In the Buttercup the secreting tissue at the base of the petal is similarly composed of small cells , but there are no stomata , so that the nectar only escapes by filtration through the outer membrane . Nectaries always produce a sweet sugary fluid which at first is very concentrated ( being thick and syrupy ) , but subsequently becomes more and more diluted by absorption of liquid from beneath . We can imitate this mechanism in a simple way by scooping out two hollows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdered sugar . After about an hour the latter cavity will be found full of syrup which may even overflow , whilst the other is dry and empty . In this way nectaries may serve to withdraw excess of water from the plant . Extrafloral nectaries on the vegetative organs occur in quite a number of plants , e.g. on the under-surfaces of the stipules of the Broad Bean ( Vida faba ) , on the leaf-bases of the Black Bindweed ( Polygonum convolvulus ) , at the forks of the fronds of the Bracken ( Pteridium aquilinum , Fig. 121 , A ) , and on the upper part of the petioles of the Cherry and Guelder Rose ( Viburnum opulus , Fig. 315 , F , p. 452 ) . In the first-named plant the nectary appears as a dark depression , which when cut across is found to be composed of a palisade-like layer of secreting hairs , each consisting of an // oblong head of several cells , borne on a short stalk . Those of the Guelder Rose are supplied with vascular tissue , the secreting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The structure of the Bracken-nectary is shown in Fig. 121 , C. The osmotic substances secreted by extrafloral nectaries tend to cause water to pass out from a turgid plant and these organs , which are most active in moist air , may well serve primarily as hydathodes . Floral nectaries , however , have the additional important function of attracting insects . The experiment described on p. 7 demonstrates that the xylem is the channel for the conduction of water , which is also proved by the fact that a branch , from which all the tissues outside the wood have been removed for a short stretch ( so-called ringing ) , remains healthy for weeks , no matter whether it is left on the tree or kept in water . Conduction through the pith can not be assumed , since this tissue often disappears in older stems ( p. 138 ) ; moreover , removal of a length of pith does not interfere with water-conduction . A further experiment shows that the water travels mainly through the cavities of the conducting elements . The ends of two similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into melted paraffin-wax and into water kept at the same temperature , respectively . After cooling , the extreme end is shaved off each , whereby all the plugged parenchyma-cells are removed , although the vessels and tracheids will remain blocked . If the shoots are then placed in water , the plugged branch fades after a few hours , while the control remains fresh . The rate of flow of the water through the wood varies greatly from plant to plant and , for instance , with the same driving force is appreciably less through a Coniferous than through most Dicotyledonous stems , a fact which can be shown in the following way ( Fig. 122 , A ) : A round-bottomed flask is provided with a two-holed rubber cork , through each hole of which a piece of glass tubing twice bent at right angles is inserted ( as in the figure ) . The one arm of each glass tube should project only for a short distance below the cork , while the other free arm should be considerably longer . To the open end of the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Conifer ( g ) , in the other of an Elm ( d ) , both being of equal length ) is fitted by rubber tubing , so as to make an air-tight connection . Each piece of stem should be previously coated , all except its two ends , with a layer of melted paraffin-wax , so as to close up all apertures and scars . The rubber cork with attached tubing is now taken out of the flask and the latter is half filled with water which is heated until it has boiled for a minute or two . Whilst vapour still fills the flask , the rubber stopper is fitted into it , after which the flask is placed in a vessel of cold water , the unattached ends of the two stems being allowed to dip into beakers of water ( Fig. 122 , A ) . The reduced pressure within the flask , resulting from the condensation of the contained aqueous vapour , leads to a strong suction , and as a result columns of water which have traversed the two stems will form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each being proportional to the rate of flow ( Fig. 122 , A ) . // A great part of the water reaching the leaves escapes in transpiration . Comparative transpiration-rates are often estimated by the cobalt-method ( p. 7 ) , rendered more exact by using standard colour-strips 1 representing the initial ( dry ) and final ( moist ) conditions . The much greater rapidity of transpiration from the lower surface of many leaves ( e.g. Lilac ) can be shown by this method , as well as in the following way : Choosing two healthy leaves , the ends of the petioles , and in one the lower surface of the blade , in the other the upper surface , are covered with vaseline , after which the two are hung up in a warm room . A few hours later the blade vaselined on the upper side will be more or less withered , whilst the other will have remained almost fresh . Comparison in the same way of thin and leathery leaves with the lower surfaces vaselined demonstrates the importance of a thick cuticle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot can be obtained with the help of an instrument known as a potoneter . As absorption under normal conditions is closely parallel to the rate of transpiration , it can be regarded as an indirect measure of the latter . The shoots employed in experiments with the potometer should be removed from the plant some hours previously and kept in water ; before use 1 For details as to their preparation , sec Henderson , Annals of Botany , 1 , 1936 , pp. 321-324 . TRANSPIRATION 20I the lower 3 inches of the stem should be cut off . The potometer ( Fig. 123 ) consists in general of a three-way glass tube ; to one arm the plant is attached , to the second a funnel serving as a reservoir and capable of being closed by a stopcock , while the third arm is connected to a piece of capillary glass tubing bent downwards at the end and resting on a graduated scale . To prepare the instrument for use the stopcock is opened and water is poured into the funnel until it fills the apparatus and flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopcock is closed . A perforated rubber stopper is carefully passed over the end of a leafy shoot ( see Appendix XIV ) and fitted into the arm designed to take the plant so that the end of the stem is in water . The open end of the capillary tube dips into a reservoir a . If this be removed for a short interval , a small air-bubble is introduced which will be seen to creep along it ; this is due to the fact that the moisture lost in transpiration from the leaves is replaced by absorption . By opening the stopcock , until the column of air has been driven back , and again closing it , the potometer is prepared for a fresh observa tion ; and , if we record ( with the help of a stop-watch ) the time taken for the end of the air-column to pass over a measured distance on the scale , the average of several readings will give an estimate of the rate of absorption from the shoot employed . In this way we can indirectly determine and compare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast afforded by evergreen and deciduous types being specially instructive . If half the leaves of a shoot are removed or vaselined , it will be found that , as a result of the reduced transpiring surface , the rate of absorption is much decreased . We may also compare shoots exposed to different conditions , such as a hot and a cold room , dry and moist air , moving and still air , and in each instance we shall find // that the first alternative induces more active absorption , implying that transpiration is accelerated by heat , dry air and wind . The approximate amount of transpiration can be found by determining the loss of weight of a plant after a given interval and making a correction for the gain due to photosynthesis and the loss due to respiration ( cf. p. 240 ) . The method is only applicable to a plant grown in a pot , which like the soil must be covered with water-proof material . Alternatively , the transpired moisture can be absorbed by a weighed amount of dry calcium chloride , contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bell-jar , whose lower edge is greased to make an air-tight connection ; the control is similar , but without a plant . If the two lots of chloride are reweighed after some time , the difference between the weights indicates the amount of water-vapour lost by the plant . Most of the water-vapour given off in transpiration is that which has evaporated from the walls of the mesophyll-cells bordering on the intercellular spaces of the leaf . As the walls lose water , more passes into them from the cytoplasm which in its turn is supplied from the vacuole . This increases the suction pressure of the cell as compared with that of the next cell in the path , from which therefore water diffuses into the evaporating cell . This process is repeated in all the cells extending up to the xylem of a vascular bundle . The water passes down the gradient in its own diffusion potential , which is lowered by evaporation from the walls of mesophyll-cells and maintained by the supply in the xylem . If the supply can not keep up with the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sap of the mesophyll-cells . The lowering of vapour pressure due to this is , however , far from sufficient to account for the resulting reduction in evaporation . Perhaps quite slight shrinkages of the cells considerably increase the resistance to movement of water from the cell-interiors to their surfaces and thus reduce the transpiration rate . The most important external factors affecting transpiration are wind and the saturation-deficit of the air , the latter mainly influenced by the amount of water in the air and by temperature . Water-loss can , however , take place even into a saturated atmosphere , if the temperature of the interior of the leaf be above that of its surroundings . Hence a hairy covering may reduce transpiration by checking rise of temperature of the leaf-cells through insolation . Cuticular transpiration is very slight in the mature shoot , and most of the water-vapour passes out through the stomata . Since diffusion through such minute apertures is greater at the margins , the rate tends to be proportional to the diameters and not to the areas of the pores . If stomata are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . Mostly , however , the pores are so distributed as to afford a maximum number of epidermal apertures with minimum interference , so that , when the pores are wide open , diffusion takes place as readily as though the intercellular spaces were fully exposed . It remains doubtful whether in most plants stomatal closure normally plays any great part in restricting transpiration ( cf. p. 157 ) . Considerable reduction in the width of the pores may occur before loss of water-vapour is appreciably reduced . The risk of exces- sive loss of moisture and consequent wilting is inevitable with a large area of leaf-surface suited to the needs of photosynthesis . The manner in which water is raised in plants is still debated . Since any theory must explain the rise in tall trees , such phenomena as root-pressure ( p. 194 ) and capillarity can only play a very small part . Participation of the living cells , everywhere associated with the wood , has often been urged , but , ' since trees placed with their severed trunks in coloured poisonous solutions , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cells must have been killed , this view finds little support . Much evidence points to water-conduction being a purely physical process , depending on suction of the transpiring shoots and the co hesive strength of water , an hypothesis known as the cohesion theory ) . The experiment shown in Fig. 124 , A , demonstrates that a transpiring shoot may bring about upward water-movement . A leafy shoot , cut under water and with the surface of the stem vasclined , is fixed by pressure tubing into a long narrow glass tube which is filled with water ( Appendix XIII ) and dips into mercury . As the shoot transpires , the mercury slowly rises and replaces the absorbed water . That this is a purely physical phenomenon can he shown by substituting for the shoot some porous mass like Plaster of Paris ( Fig. 124 , B ) , which is loosely packed into the bulb of a thistle funnel ( p ) and , in setting , expands sufficiently to fill it completely . In experiments of either kind the mercury may rise to a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must play an important part in the upward passage of water . The osmotic potentials of transpiring leaf-cells are always Footnote // considerable and in tall trees may attain to high levels , especially on the higher branches . As a consequence water diffuses into them from the xylem and passes continuously from the latter to the leafsurfaces . Removal of water from the xylem reduces the pressure in the tracts and , in tall plants , creates an actual pull amounting to many atmospheres . Owing to the cohesion of water this pull is transmitted to the water-column in the stem and is thought to suffice to lift it to the tops of the highest trees . Above about 34 feet from the ground the transpiration stream in the xylem must always be in a state of tension increasing with height . Even in small plants a reduced pressure or even a tension ( negative pressure ) may arise when transpiration exceeds absorption . If a stem is then cut open beneath a solution of light green , the solution penetrates to a considerable distance into the vessels . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water with a well-watered one . Plants gathered on a hot summer 's day , when such a reduced pressure is almost invariably realised , often wither even though soon placed in water . This is due to the taking up of air into the vessels and their consequent loss of conducting power . If two shoots are cut , one under water and the other in the air , from a plant in which a reduced pressure has been demonstrated , the former will remain fresh , while the latter may soon fade when placed in water . Hence the necessity of cutting shoots for transpiration experiments under water . The concept that the water in the conducting tracts of stems and leaves forms a continuous moving column ( the transpiration stream ) , pulled up the plant by the transpiring leaves , requires a system with considerable tensile strength . The cohesion between the molecules of a mass of water is stated to exceed 500 atmospheres , although there is some difference of opinion about this ; strong forces of adhesion also exist between the water and the watersaturated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doubt whether these forces suffice to prevent rupture of the water-columns at times of excess transpiration and great tension . Even in wilted plants , however , the conducting elements may contain unbroken columns of water . When transpiration diminishes , as at night , or water is absorbed in excess of that lost , the tension in the water columns gradually decreases and may even be replaced by a positive root-pressure . Plants absorb far more water than is directly needed and the excess is lost in transpiration . By maintaining the transpirationstream , this process provides a current of water serving to carry the mineral salts absorbed from the soil . It also has an effect in lowering the temperature of the leaves . CHAPTER XIX PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION THE water and the mineral salts dissolved in it help in one way or another to build up the body of the plant . The water retained is employed for diverse purposes , viz. ( i ) in combination with the carbon dioxide of the air to form the starting-point of the organic substance of the plant , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cf. pp. 44 and 143 ) , ( iii ) to serve as a medium for transference of soluble materials from one part to another , and ( iv ) as imbibition water permeating the cell-walls and protoplasm . Uncombined water thus constitutes a great part of the plant , as can be readily seen by comparing the weight of a fresh and a dried plant . To ensure a more accurate comparison a considerable quantity ( e.g. about Too grams ) of fresh material is cut up into small pieces , put into an evaporating dish of known weight , and the two weighed together . The dish is now placed over a water-bath and heated until the weight is constant . The final weight of the material is far less than the original one . Since the temperature of the waterbath would be only sufficient to drive off the uncombined water , the loss of weight recorded corresponds to the amount of the latter ; the weight of the remaining substance is consequently known as the dry weight and is usually expressed in percentages of the fresh weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plant or the portion of it used ; thus , in a woody plant it amounts to about 50 per cent. , in an herbaceous plant to about 30 per cent. , and in a water-plant ( as well as in many edible fruits ) to little more than 5 per cent . In all but woody plants , therefore , the major part of the plant 's substance consists of water . This does not , however , apply to dormant seeds in which the dry weight usually represents about seven-eighths of the total , and we can consequently understand why , as a preliminary to germination , so large an amount of moisture has to be absorbed ( cf. p. 21 ) . In order to study further the composition of the plant we 205 // p. 9 ) , must therefore be supplied in appreciable amounts for adequate nourishment . All are absorbed from the soil as simple soluble inorganic compounds like those in culture-solutions . The salts used in preparing the latter , however , unless specially purified , always contain minute traces of other chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main nutrients . The absence of such trace elements 1 may cause serious deficiency diseases . Thus , boron and manganese are essential for the proper development of many , and perhaps all , plants . Zinc-deficiency causes certain patho-logical symptoms in trees , traces of copper are necessary for healthy growth of Sunflower and Flax , and minute amounts of molybdenum for Tomatoes . The cobalt present in plants is necessary for higher animals whose intestinal flora derives its supply from the plant-food . Only minute quantities of trace elements are necessary , in fact several ( e.g. copper ) are toxic in larger amounts . The increased surface provided by the root-hairs may be of importance for the absorption by base-exchange of the trace elements in the soil . Continued absorption of mineral salts probably depends on the maintenance of a high state of metabolic activity in the root-cells , as well as transference of the absorbed substances to other parts or their utilisation in metabolism ( cf. p. 48 ) . Salts may , however , be accumulated against a considerable concentration gradient without change , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen-supply admitting of active root-respiration is , indeed , known to be a necessity for salt-absorption . Other in-fluencing factors are the temperature , water-content and acidity of the soil , and the composition of the soil-solution . Neighbouring plants take up substances in very different amounts from a soil . Thus , the ash of Grasses is rich in silica , which produces the hard surface , whilst other meadow-plants contain but little . On the other hand , the same species from different soils may show appreci-able variation in the proportions of the elements present in the ash . The ordinary green plant derives its carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide , of which there are about three parts in ro , 000 of air . In aquatics this is provided by the carbon dioxide or carbonates in the water . If a land-plant is deprived of carbon dioxide in the surrounding air , the leaves form no starch . This is shown by keeping it , together with a quantity of soda-lime , beneath a bell-jar to which air obtains access through a U-tube filled with the same substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the process of photosynthesis in green leaves the carbon // dioxide obtains access almost entirely through the stomata ( p. 152 ) . If Lilac-shoots placed in water are kept in the dark until all starch has disappeared , none will be formed on exposure to light in those in which the under sides of the leaves are vaselined . The continued inward diffusion of carbon dioxide depends on a gradient being maintained between the outer air and the walls of the photosynthetic cells , where the carbon dioxide becomes dissolved in imbibitionwater . So long as the stomatal pores remain appreciably open , absorption of carbon dioxide probably takes place almost as rapidly as if there were no epidermal covering ( cf. transpiration , p. 203 ) . The rate may increase in moving air . That photosynthesis takes place only in the presence of chlorophyll is shown by the absence of starch in the non-green parts of variegated leaves ( e.g. variegated Privet , p. 166 ; cf. also p. 8 ) . The chloroplasts contain two green pigments ( chlorophylls a and b ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the former , except in gold-leaved varieties , being present in considerably greater quantity than the latter . The chlorophylls differ but slightly and are probably the pigments mainly concerned in photosynthesis . They are complex compounds of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , and magnesium , the last forming the central atom of the molecule . The yellow pigments are simpler ( carotin C40H56 , xanthophyll C40HJ000 ) . The green and yellow pigments can be roughly separated by shaking up an alcoholic ext ract with benzene and allowing the liquids to settle ; the alcohol then contains the yellow , the benzene floating above it the green pigments . A solution of chlorophyll in alcohol or acetone exhibits marked red fluorescence , appearing green in transmitted and reddish-green in reflected light ; moreover , it decomposes in strong light unless access of air is rigorously excluded , assuming a brownish colour , which contrasts sharply with the green of a solution kept in the dark . The chlorophyll in the leaf , however , shows only faint fluorescence and is not readily broken down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption band in the red , a number of narrower and less distinct bands in the yellow and green , whilst much of the blue and violet is obliterated ( Fig. 126 ) ; if the light is allowed to pass through leaves , the position of the absorption bands is somewhat shifted towards the violet end of the spectrum . The contrasts suggest that the chlorophyll is in a different state in the living plant and in the extracts . On the basis of other observations , it has been suggested that , in association with lipoids and carotenoids , the chlorophylls are linked with proteins , as chromo-proteins , in the chloroplasts . Carotin and xanthophyll only have absorption bands in the blue end of the spectrum . 14 2I0 PHOTOSYNTHESIS It has already been noted that in the dark ( p. 8 ) , as well as in the absence of iron and magnesium ( p. 207 ) , no chlorophyll is formed . Cultivated Sea Kale and Celery clearly show the effect of growth in darkness . A suitable temperature is also necessary for chlorophyll-formation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spring being a result of its imperfect production . The wave-lengths of light absorbed by chlorophyll are mainly used to provide the energy for the manufacture of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water . All are utilised , although there is evidence that the longer ones may play a bigger role . The building up of complicated compounds like carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water is an endothermic reaction , which requires a large quantity of energy and , since the only source of this is light , it is compreFIG. 12.7 . Starch-print . The hensible that photosynthesis can not proleaf has been covered with a stencil-plate , exposed to ceed unless the plant is illuminated . sunlight , decolourised and Only a small percentage of the total lightplaced in iodine solution . energy falling upon a leaf is used in photosynthesis ; most is reflected or passes through the leaf . The necessity for light is readily demonstrated in a plant that forms starch and has previously been kept in darkness , until a leaf gives no starch-reaction . If half a leaf of such a plant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in the exposed half . Or , if a similar leaf be covered with a stencil plate ( Appendix XVI ) and illuminated for some time , treatment with iodine will give a dark letter on a light background ( Fig. 127 ) . Starch is , however , not formed in photosynthesis , ) but after it PHOTOSYNTHESIS 2II and independently of light . It is probably produced from a preexisting simpler polysaccharide and a phosphoric sugar ester , both formed originally from sucrose . In many Monocotyledonous plants starch is rarely found in the leaves ( except in the guard-cells of the stomata ) , sugars being here the temporary storage products . Thus , while starch-formation may often be taken as evidence of photosynthesis , its absence does not necessarily prove the contrary . Various sugars ( p. 77 ) can always be detected in assimilating leaves and in most Dicotyledons the products of photosynthesis become converted into starch as they accumulate . Detached starch-free leaves of the Canadian Pondweed , placed in a 5 per cent . solution of grape sugar in the dark , form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been mentioned ( p. 77 ) that the first free sugar produced in photosynthesis is the disaccharide sucrose and not a hexose as formerly supposed . A precursor of this is fructose di-phosphate , from which free fructose and , indirectly , glucose may be formed . Sucrose arises from fructose di-phosphate and glucose by a process known as transphosphatisation . It will be evident that the relatively complex sucrose can only be the end product of a series of reactions , not all of which are yet fully understood ; it is clear , however , that only some depend on a supply of light-energy ( cf. below ) . The over-all process might be summarised by the equation : 12CO2 +48H20 =C12H22011 +37H20 + 1202 . The energy necessary to raise carbon dioxide to the carbohydrate level is 112 calories per mole of that gas . The equation shows that , during the formation of carbohydrates , a volume of oxygen equal to that of the carbon dioxide absorbed is liberated . The fact that this ratio ( the assimilatory quotient ) is unity affords evidence that carbohydrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimating the carbon dioxide absorbed or the oxygen evolved that photosynthesis is usually measured . The liberation of oxygen is readily demonstrated in water-plants ( Fig. 128 ) . If a bunch of Canadian Pondweed is exposed to bright light , with the cut ends beneath a completely submerged inverted funnel ( f ) covered by a test-tube ( t ) full of water , gas-bubbles will rise from the cut ends and collect in the test-tube . After some hours , when sufficient gas has accumulated , the glowing splinter test proves it to consist mainly of oxygen . It is instructive to perform a further experiment , using boiled water through which a stream of air deprived of its carbon dioxide by sling it over soda-lime , has subsequently been bubbled . In this // experiment no gas is liberated , even in strong light . Aquatics thus depend on the dissolved carbon dioxide , as can likewise be shown by applying the iodine-test to leaves from the two experiments . This method of experimentation is not applicable to terrestrial plants , whose gaseous exchange in photosynthesis is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described here . The above experiment can , however , be modified to give useful comparative data , helping to assess the influence of various factors on the rate of photosynthesis . For this purpose the cut end of the stem of a suitable water-plant , loosely tied to a long glass rod in an inverted position , is covered with a small hood , made of narrow-bore glass tubing drawn out into a fine point . Alternatively , the cut end can merely be covered with shellac varnish in which , after it has set , a small hole is pricked . With such an arrangement a stream of bubbles of equal size will escape from the aperture in sun-light , the number in a given time affording some measure of the rate at which photo-synthesis is proceeding . In such experi-ments the rate of bubbling is allowed to become uniform , before counts are made . In this way it is easily established that , up to certain limits , the rate increases with p the light-intensity , the temperature of the water , and the concentration of available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small quantities of potassium bicarbonate , the carbon dioxide concentration being roughly proportional to the amount of dissolved bicarbonate . When any factor is at a minimum ( e.g. semi-darkness , a temperature little above o ? C. ) , the rate of oxygen-evolution is very slow , no matter how suitable the other conditions may be . The minimal factor thus tends to limit the rate of photosynthesis , and its gradual increase , when others remain constant , will result in progressive acceleration of oxygen-evolution . At temperatures above 25 ? ? 30 ? C. some internal factor is affected , and the rate of evolution may decrease in successive observations . High light-intensities may also exert a retarding influence . In nature the rate of photo-synthesis on a bright summer 's day may be limited by the carbon dioxide supply and other circumstances , and the light-intensity // could then be appreciably diminished without decreasing the rate of carbohydrate-formation . Investigations of the course of photosynthesis in diverse plants by more exact methods ( Fig. 128 * ) show that , at higher light intensities ( III , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing carbon dioxide concentration , but , above a certain value , the curve becomes progressively flatter as some other factor limits the rate ; at no stage , however , will increase in amount of carbon dioxide fail to cause some further increase in the rate . In weakly il-Iuminated plants the rate is approximately proportional to the light-intensity , and in-crease of temperature has comparatively little effect . On the other hand , when neither light nor car-bon dioxide is mini-mal , the rate is affected by increase of tern-perature in the same way as an enzyme-reaction , being doubled or trebled or d more for every 1o ? C. rise . Since respiration is markedly accelerated by rise of temperature ( p. 240 ) , a correction for it is necessary in all investigations of the effects of the latter on photosynthesis . The experimental results referred to in the last two paragraphs have furnished some of the evidence for the conclusion that photo-synthesis occurs in a number of stages and comprises a photo-chemical one , as well as steps which are not dependent on light and constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the first leaves of Runner Bean seedlings turn green some time before oxygen-evolution commences can be attributed to the slower development of such protoplasmic factors . Recent experiments with isotopes have revealed that all the oxygen evolved comes from the water ( containing 018 ) used and none from the carbon dioxide . Absorption of carbon dioxide and oxygen-evolution are , therefore , distinct processes . It is now 213A CHEMOSYNTHESIS recognised that an essential step in photosynthesis is the reduction of carbon dioxide by the hydrogen of the water , although other substances may serve as hydrogen-donors . Thus , certain Sulphur Bacteria , which contain a green pigment ( bacteriochlorophyll ) very similar to chlorophyll , form carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide ( H2S ) and effect the reduction of a carbon dioxide complex by the transference of hydrogen from the sulphide , the sulphur accumulating as granules in the cells . The first step in photosynthesis has been shown to be a combination of carbon dioxide with some substance in the cytoplasm . The carbon dioxide derivative thus produced is reduced by hydrogen liberated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The product undergoes a long series of changes effected by enzymes , an early intermediate product being seemingly phospho-glyceric acid ; later phospho-pyruvic acid and phosphoric sugar esters are produced and finally sucrose . Formation of the toxic formaldehyde ( CH2O ) during the process was formerly assumed , but it is never found in significant amount in assimilating leaves . The Sulphur Bacteria above mentioned , like all green plants , depend on the absorption of solar energy for the synthesis of carbohydrates . Diverse other , relatively simple , organisms , however , bring about synthesis of organic compounds with the help of energy liberated in internal exothermic chemical reactions , although the majority of colourless organisms do not possess this faculty . Good examples of such chemosynthesis are provided by the nitrifying Bacteria of soil ( see p. 349 ) . The thread-forming Iron Bacteria , living in ferrugineous waters , furnish other instances . These absorb ferrous salts from the water and oxidise them to the ferric state , the process often being accompanied by the precipitation of abundant reddish ferric hydroxide . In this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inorganic substance only . Similarly , Beggiatoa , abundant in waters containing hydrogen sulphide , obtains energy for the synthesis of carbohydrates by the absorption and oxidation of this gas , sulphur , later oxidised to sulphate , being deposited within the cells of its colourless threads . The production of soluble carbohydrates is only the first step in the formation of the organic substance of the green plant . Although a considerable fraction is built up into proteins and some may undergo conversion into fats , much usually remains in the form of carbohydrates , which are conducted away from the seat of formation to other parts . On bright days , however , leaves often exhibit an accumulation of transitory starch ( p. 72 ) , which disappears overnight , the transference being readily recognised by comparing the amounts of starch in a leaf removed at nightfall and in one PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS 213B picked early next morning . Detached leaves with their petioles in water do not lose their starch . The carbohydrates pass to storage organs or to centres of meristematic activity , where they form cellulose-walls and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respiratory substrate ( see Chapter XXI ) . In the synthesis of proteins complex processes are involved , still incompletely understood . A first step is no doubt the reduction of nitrates to ammonium compounds , followed by incorporation of ammonia into keto- and other organic acids , with the formation of amino-acids ( e.g. glycine , alanine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid ) , which are widespread in plants . Their molecules include both acid ( COOH ) and basic ( NH2 ) groups and some ( e.g. cystine ) contain sulphur . There is evidence that both nitrates and sulphates undergo reduction , the former to nitrites and then to ammonium salts From these and forerunners or derivatives of the sugars formed in photosynthesis the amino-acids are produced . The huge protein-molecules consist of chains of innumerable aminoacids . Polypeptides have been artificially synthesised from amino-acids . Most protein-synthesis probably takes place in leaves where the raw materials are available , but it is not always directly dependent on a supply of light-energy , since , given a good supply of carbohydrates , it can also take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elaborated food-materials are conveyed from one part of a plant to another as soluble and readily diffusible substances , carbohydrates evidently mainly as sucrose , nitrogenous substances as aminoacids and amides ( asparagine , glutamine ) , which are always produced when protein-reserves are utilised . Translocation takes place mainly through the phloem , although there may be slow diffusion of carbohydrates through elongated parenchymatous elements . When branches are ringed ( p. 199 ) , both carbohydrates and nitrogenous compounds accumulate in the intact tissues above the interruption . Sugars often occur in some quantity in the sieves ubes , where also proteinaceous materials accumulate ( p. 146 ) ; marked gradients in sugar concentration may exist between different parts of the stem . While the importance of sieve-tubes in the conduction of elaborated substances seems established , the mechanism remains uncertain , for translocation can occur at a much more rapid rate than can be accounted for by normal diffusion . Since its speed is affected by the vigour of respiration , it may depend on vital processes . Green plants , as well as the colourless forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they elaborate organic food from inorganic materials . Animals can not do this and obtain // their nutriment second-hand , either directly from the Vegetable Kingdom or indirectly ( as in Carnivores ) from other herbivorous animals ; so that , if green plants were to disappear from the surface of the earth , almost the whole living universe would shortly perish . There are plants , however , which are more or less dependent on elaborated food-substances and can only thrive when living or dead organic matter is available . Such plants , termed heterotrophic , comprise most of the Fungi and Bacteria , but also in-clude a certain number of Flowering Plants in which the leaves are always of small size and usually devoid of chlorophyll . When part or all of the food is obtained from some other living organism the plant is known as a parasite and the organ-ism on which it feeds as the host , whilst when the source of a plant 's nourishment is non-living organic matter we speak of it as a sapro phyte . Among British Flowering Plants there are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very common ; they include the Dodder , the Toothwort ( see Fig. 131 ) , and the Broomrapes . As a typical instance we may select the Dodder , a close ally of Convolvulus , which is an annual parasitic on many different hosts ( e.g. Clover , Furze , Heather , etc . ) . The thread-like stem of this plant entwines the host ( Fig. 129 , A ) . Some of the coils are distant and unattached , whilst others are close together and bear the suckers ( haustoria , s ) through which nourishment is absorbed . There would appear to be no leaves , but careful examination discloses a number of minute scales ( 1 ) separated by long internodes and , as in all true parasites , completely devoid of chlorophyll . The stems vary in colour between bright yellow and red , and thus the plant becomes conspicuous , even before the rosette-like bunches of pink flowers ( Figs. 129 , A , fi. , and 130 ) are formed . By the pro duction of plentiful small seeds the risk of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other seed is very likely to germinate near a suitable plant . The seedling is a simple thread containing a trace of chlorophyll , but showing no marked distinction into radicle , plumule , and cotyledons , i.e. the extreme reduction of the vegetative parts seen in the mature plant appears already in the seedling . The latter is , however , capable of a brief independent existence , and during this period the tip of the stem swings round in a circular manner and may thus happen to meet with a support ; thereupon the root withers , so that the mature Dodder has no connection with the soil whatever . Failing the presence of a host the seedling soon dies away . A striking feature of the anatomy of the Dodder is the feeble development of xylem , no doubt in relation to the reduction of the leaves . The haustoria arise from the stem ( Fig. 129 , B ) as outgrowths ( h. ) , which flatten out in contact with the surface of the host . The centre of the sucker grows out as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vascular tissue of the host , where it often expands considerably ( Fig. 129 , B , h . ) . At first this process consists of undifferentiated cells , but later those adjacent to the xylem become tracheids , whilst those in contact with the phloem develop as phloem-like elements . By the connection thus established between the conducting elements of host and parasite , the photosynthetic products and absorptive system of the former become available for the parasite . The parasite , being relieved of those functions which necessitate elaboration of the vegetative structure , is enabled to utilise almost its entire energies for the purpose of reproduction . Simplification of structure , in every other direction but that which tends towards an increase in the output of seeds , is a marked characteristic of parasites . Even the ovules ( cf. p. 445 ) and embryos are simpler in construction than those of most green plants , the material economised in this way presumably making possible a quantitative increase . The Dodder is exceptional among British parasites , not only in being a climber and in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being attached to the stem of its host . Nearly all other British plants of this kind are so-called root-parasites . They fix themselves by means of suckers to the roots of the attacked plant , as in the Toothwort ( Lathrcea ) and the Broomrapes ( Orobanche ) . The yellowish-white shoots of the former ( Fig. 131 ) are usually found beneath the Hazel or the Wych Elm ; they appear above ground in the early spring and flower about April . The overground part consists of an inflorescence of numerous purplish flowers , with // membranous leaves intermingled . At a varying depth beneath the surface of the soil one finds in the Toothwort a perennial stem which is extensively branched , the upturned tips constituting the annual aerial shoots . The whole underground system bears numerous decussate fleshy scales of a pink colour and richly branched adventitious roots which attach themselves to those of the host by flat suckers . Owing to the connection of the Toothwort with the extensive root-systems of its woody hosts and to the absence of the usual transpiring surface , an excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exuded from hydathodes ( p. 195 ) lining the inner surfaces of the hollow fleshy scales borne on the under-ground stem , and at times the soil around the Toothwort appears quite wet . The hydathodes ( Fig. 118 , C , h ) have the form of small domes consisting of living cells , viz. a large basal cell ( cf. Fig. 118 , B , b.c. ) embedded in the epidermis , a short stalk-cell ( s.c. ) , and a head composed of two to four cells lying side by side ( Fig. 118 , B , left-hand figure ) ; in the middle of the head there is a small space between the cells , and above this the overlying cuticle is // pierced by a minute hole ( p. ) through which the water is secreted . Glandular hairs ( Fig. 118 , C , g.h. ) of another type are present , which may take part in the secretion of water . The species of Broomrape , the commonest of which is found on the roots of Clover , are close allies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds apparently germinate only when in contact with the roots of a suitable host . In common with all other parasites , the Broomrapes exhibit a much reduced leaf-surface and numerous minute seeds dispersed by wind , but even so these plants are by no means frequent . The reduction of the vegetative as compared with the seed-producing part has gone much farther in some tropical parasites , in which the vegetative organs are represented by one much-branched haustorium traversing the tissues of the host ( e.g. Rafflesia ) . The Mistletoe is a somewhat exceptional type of parasite found growing on the branches of Apple , Hawthorn , etc . It possesses green leaves and is thus a semi-parasite . It sends peg-like suckers ( whose growth in length keeps pace with the secondary thickening of the branch ) deep down into the wood of the host . It differs from most other British plants , not only in its parasitic qualities , // but also in growing aloft on the branches of trees . This kind of situation is , however , frequented by many non-parasitic plants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonest saprophyte amongst British Flowering Plants is the Bird's-nest Orchid ( Neottia ) found growing in Beechwoods . This saprophyte ( Fig. 132 ) blooms in late May , the plant emerging from the humus as an unbranched stem bearing a few scaly leaves ( 1 ) of moderate size and numerous flowers ( fl ) , all of a brown colour , little or no chlorophyll being present . The erect shoots are borne on a subterranean mycorrhizal portion ( n ) ( cf. p. h o ) , the numerous branches of which are interwoven so as to form a structure somewhat resembling a bird 's nest ; hence the common name . The saprophyte thus obtains its nourishment from the organic matter in the humus with the aid of the contained Fungus ( Fig. 63 , m ) . Although parasites and saprophytes are rare amongst Flowering Plants , all Fungi and most Bacteria depend on these methods of nutrition and are often responsible for processes of decay ( p. 335 ) . An association with Fungi is , however , not confined to saprophytes like Neottia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conifers , the Beech , and most members of Ericace ) , all of which grow where humus is plentiful . In the trees the threads of the ectotrophic mycorrhiza ( p. i lo ) completely invest many of the rootless , although only penetrating into their surface-layers . They replace the root-hair sand , like other soil-inhabiting Fungi , break down the organic matter of the humus into soluble compounds which become available to the host . In Neottia , where the mycorrhiza is endotrophic ( Fig. 63 , m ) and undergoes digestion in the inner cortex , it is claimed that it can fix nitrogen ( p. 350 ) . Here , as in the Heather , the relation is obligatory , but in other instances the absence of fungal threads does not seem to impair the vigour of the plant . The Fungus no doubt obtains some nourishment from the host . The association seems to be one of // controlled parasitism and under certain conditions the balance may be disturbed and the Fungus become harmful . ' An association between roots and Bacteria is met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bird's-foot Trefoil or a Vetch the roots are found to bear small swellings ( Fig. 133 , t ) , the so-called root-nodules , in which the Bacteria occur . Even in the time of the Romans the inclusion of Leguminous plants in a rota-tion of crops was recognised as beneficial . Experience has shown that cultivation of Clovers , Sainfoin , Lucerne , etc. , materially increases the nitrogen-content of the soil , especially if the crop is subse quently ploughed into the field ( so-called green manuring ) . This phenomenon remained unexplained until it was discovered that the nodules contain certain nitrogen-fixing Bacteria ( Rhizobium ) , which are present in every soil . Infection is brought about probably by means of the motile phase of the Bacteria penetrating into some of the root-hairs , from which they pass into adjoining cells . These are stimulated to divide , so that an enlarging gall-like structure arises , which later becomes connected by a vascular strand to the central cylinder of the root . Within the nodule the Bacteria multiply rapidly , probably at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume swollen and deformed shapes ( Fig. 227 , p. 347 ) and simultaneously the cells harbouring them hypertrophy and show other symptoms of degeneration . Ultimately the nodules disintegrate from within outwards , but a few of the Bacteria persist unaltered and return to the soil . Part of the nitrogenous material ( amino-acids , probably aspartic acid ) , formed during nitrogen-fixation , becomes available to the Leguminous plant , its removal being in fact necessary for the continued activity of the Bacteria .
