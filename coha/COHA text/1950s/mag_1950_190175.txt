( See Cover ) <P> In a Manhattan living room one day last week , an eight-year-old boy , his eye on the clock , said : " Mummy , I want to see Howdy Doody . " Obediently his mother went to the television set . As the screen flickered to life , the face that appeared was not the familiar , freckled countenance of the famous TV puppet , but the cold , clean-cut face of a man talking Russian . Said the little boy , in a voice foreboding tears : " I want to see Howdy Doody . " <P> " Hush , dear , " said his mother . " This is U.N . " <P> " Oh , pooey , " said the child . <P> A great many other Americans felt the same way . For the past fortnight that Russian face on the nation 's television screens blocked not only Howdy Doody , but such other favorites as Lucky Pup , and Life with Snarky Parker . But the show that replaced them-a curious mixture of boredom and excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights &; wrongs-was definitely worth America 's while . To millions of Americans it brought the unique experience of seeing the enemy right in their living room . <P> The name that went with the face was Jacob Malik . He appeared as a broad-shouldered , blond figure , slimmer on television than he actually is , with a hard-set jaw , impassive and unsmiling . Often he stared balefully at his unseen audience ; sometimes he scribbled notes or leaned back to catch the whispers of three Russian aides sitting behind him . Hour after hour , in a dry voice that rarely rose in audible anger , meticulously using the same phrases and arguments , meticulously carrying out his orders , he lied . <P> To Hamstring &; Delay . As the second week of Security Council meetings opened , under Malik 's presidency , the first business should have been a discussion of North Korean aggression , with South Korean representatives taking part . But not with Malik presiding . That was why the Kremlin had sent him back to the U.N.-to hamstring , delay , obstruct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking up the agenda item , he read a " most urgent " telegram from the North Korean authorities , a denunciation , conveniently in Russian , of " American interventionists . . . barbarous attacks . . . cannibalistic cynicism . . . " It was cut from the same cloth of distortion and falsehood that the Russian delegate had unrolled in all his previous harangues ( e.g. , the real aggressors in Korea were " American imperialists " ; only the Soviet Union desired a " peaceful settlement , " etc . ) . <P> While Malik droned on , the other ten delegates sat patiently around the horseshoe table . From the ceiling , television lights glared down on the high-domed head of Britain 's Sir Gladwyn Jebb , the pince-nez of the U.S. 's Warren Austin , the long nose of France 's Jean Chauvel , the doodling hand of China 's Tingfu F. Tsiang . <P> When Malik had finished reading , the Council 's majority moved hard , for the first time , to trip him up .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
