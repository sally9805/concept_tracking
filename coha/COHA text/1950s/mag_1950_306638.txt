Three years ago , when Kraft Television Theater ( Wed . 9 p.m. , NBCTV ) first went on the air , the audience numbered in the thousands , most of them in bars . Last week , as Kraft celebrated its 150th performance , the hour-long show was telecast to an audience of millions , but with little change in the original beer-and-skittles diet that had won friends and fans among the bar watchers . <P> " The best show for us is the kind that , on the stage , is a great matinee piece , " says Producer-Director Stanley Quinn , 35 , who came to TV by way of Princeton and radio work in Australia . " Of course , " he adds , " we give it tone every now &; then with a little Wilde , a little Shakespeare . " Working efficiently with his alternate producerdirector , ex-Vaudevillian Maury Holland , 43 , Quinn has set up a well-oiled assembly line that uses low-salaried actors ( maximum : $250 ) , low-cost scripts ( maximum : $500 ) , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Theater , Philco Playhouse and Lucky Strike Theater average $20,000 a week ) . Says Holland proudly : " We spend less time fooling around than any other show on the air . " <P> The finished product is probably as good as most summer stock productions . Quinn and Holland aim at leaving their viewers satisfied , if not stimulated . Ideally , says Quinn , " we try to find a story of fairly simple people in an extraordinarily emotional situation . " But the ideal specifications can not always be met . Last week 's show , The Queen 's Husband , written by Robert Emmet Sherwood in 1928 , told how a constitutional monarch outwitted a domineering wife and a dictatorial prime minister by uniting with a Communist-Labor coalition . Kraft 's version emerged as pure Graustark , with not a Communist in sight . <P> Without splurging on big stars or elaborate productions , Kraft intends to keep plugging away at its adaptations of old plays , movies and short stories . Says Holland : " We really believe the play 's the thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writers , production people and all that . Forty seconds after we 're on the air , you 're into the play . Except for the commercials , you stay there . "
