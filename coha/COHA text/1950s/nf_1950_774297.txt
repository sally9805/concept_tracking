txt  | yarns ; and the denier system , which is used for all continuousfilament yarns . These two systems are opposites , one being the converse of the other . In the count system a unit of weight is fixed , and in the denier system a unit of length is fixed . The count of a spun yarn in the United States and Great Britain is the number of standard-length hanks or skeins in 1 lb . The length of the hank depends on what the fiber is ; e.g. , for cotton the length is 840 yd . If 10 such hanks are required to weigh 1 lb , the count of the yarn is 10 ; if 1 lb of cotton yarn contains 46 hanks of 840 yd each , its count is 46 . The confusing figure thing about it is that if we are dealing with worsted yarns the standard length is 560 yd , and to complicate it still further woolen yarns are numbered on two systems , the cut system , in which the standard length is 300 yd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yd . In the metric system the standard weight is 1 kg , and the length of the standard hank is 1000 m . In France the length is still 1000 m , but the standard weight is 500 gm . These standard figures will be found in Table 10 . The count of a yarn is determined by winding a definite number of turns of yarn onto a reel , the ordinary circumference of which is 1.5 yd . Sixty turns of yarn on such a reel would measure 90 yd . If 90 yd of a certain cotton yarn weighs 0.00357 lb , what is the count of the yarn ? Such a weighing would not be made in terms of pounds , but of some smaller unit of weight , such as grams or grains . In most testing labo ; . atories yarn is weighed in grains because the conversion of grains to pounds is simple ( 1 lb = 7000  | grains ) . In the present example , 90 yd of cotton yarn weighs 25 grains . How shall we calculate the count ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure The general equation by which these counts were calculated can be used for determining either C , L , or TV for any yarn if two of them are known and if the standard hank length is known . That is , you can calculate how many pounds of 40 's cotton you would have to buy in order to get 3,000,000 yd of it . It is customary to express these counts with the symbol ( ' s ) following the number , together with a designation of the fiber or system . Thus the count in the first problem is 30 's cotton , and in the second it is 30 's worsted . Such numbers refer to single-ply yarns . When considering two- or three-ply yarns , the number of plies must be shown in the count . If two 60 's single yarns are twisted together the result will be approximately size 30 . This is not exactly true because some shrinkage occurs when two yarns are twisted , and the amount of shrinkage depends on how much twist is put in . It is customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singles rather than the twisted yarn . The above yarn would be labeled 2/60 's cotton , meaning that two 60 's have been twisted together to make the yarn . Perhaps the reader is impressed with the rather chaotic state of yarn numbering . There are too many systems and standards . In an effort to simplify the matter , the American Society for  | Testing Materials has suggested a universal system called the typp system . The word typp is composed of the first letters of " thousand yards per pound . " According to this system , the count of a yarn , regardless of what fibers it is made of , would be simply the number of thousands of yards of the yarn required to weigh 1 lb . Let us go back to the two yarns for which we calculated counts , both of which turned out to be 30 's , and calculate the typp counts . Ninety yards of the cotton yarn weighed 25 grains . All we need to calculate is how many thousands of yards of this yarn would weigh 7000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old count to the new typp count , multiply the standard hank length by the old count and divide by 1000 . The denier system for numbering yarns is based on the weight of a standard length of 9000 m ( 9842 yd ) of a yarn , the weight being expressed in grams . Thus the denier of a filament or yarn is the weight ( in grams ) of 9000 m of the yarn . This is the same as the weight in grains of 638 yd of the yarn . Thus , if 9000 m of a silk yarn weighs 150 gm , it is a 150-denier ( 150-d ) yarn ; or if 638 yd of a rayon yarn weighs 75 grains , it is a 75-denier yarn . This is the system used for numbering silk , rayon , and nylon yarns , that is , all yarns made from continuous filaments . Spun silk and spun rayon yarns are designated by the count system . The denier of a yarn is a rough measure of its size . Recall that as wool or cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn becomes smaller . That is , a #50 cotton yarn is heavier than a #80 . With silk , rayon , and nylon , the opposite is true ; i.e. , the higher the denier , the heavier the yarn , so that an 80-denier rayon yarn is heavier than a 50-denier yarn .  | It may be necessary at times to change from one system to the other , that is , to calculate the denier of a cotton yarn from its count or number . This can be done easily by means of the equation on page 101 . The known count is substituted for C , the number 638 for L , and W becomes the unknown value ( the denier ) , which will be the weight in grains of 638 yd of the yarn . The denier of a #60 cotton can be calculated as follows : figure We have said that the denier of yarns is a rough measure of their relative size , but we must understand that this is only approximately correct . It is true that the lower-denier yarns are finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of exact direct proportionality . In other words , a 60-denier yarn is not twice as fine ( or half as coarse ) as a 120-denier yarn . The latter yarn weighs twice as much , but its diameter is not twice as great and hence its size is not twice as large . If one yarn is twice as heavy as another , its volume must be twice as great ( assuming their densities are the same ) but the radius will not be twice as great . However , the cross-section area will be twice as great , but this is proportional to the square of the radius and not to the simple radius or diameter . If we assume that the two yarns are perfect cylinders , the facts are that doubling the weight , or doubling the denier , will not double the radius but will increase it only about 43% . The grex system for numbering yarns was tentatively proposed in 1945 by the American Society for Testing Materials , revised in 1946 , and adopted by ASTM in 1947 . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarns used in the textile industry . It is very much like the denier system , and the grex number of a yarn is almost the same as its denier , but the grex system is somewhat more logical because it is a direct decimalized system using metric units . In the cgs ( centimeter-gram-second ) system , the unit of linear density is grams per centimeter , gm/cm . The grex unit is onemillionth of this . Therefore , the grex number ( gx ) of a yarn is the weight in grams of 10,000 m of yarn ( 10,936 yd ) . Note that the denier of a yarn is the weight in grams of 9000 m of yarn , and therefore the grex number is 1.1111 times as large as the denier.  | It is seen that the grex of a yarn will increase with its weight per unit of length , and thus it is a measure of relative coarseness , or fineness , of various yarns made from the same fibers , or fibers of equal density . Density must be taken into consideration when using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of fibers . For example , a 100-gx cotton yarn is not coarser than a 75-gx nylon yarn , because the density of cotton is 1.55 , whereas the density of nylon is 1.14 . A number that is the weight in grams of 10,000 m of yarn is the same thing as the weight in grains of 708.6 yd of yarn . Thus the relation between the count of a yarn and its grex number is similar to that shown on page 102 except that the number 638 must be changed to 708.6 . The tenacity of fibers , filaments , and yarns can be expressed in terms of grex as well as in denier . For example , a tenacity of 4 gm/denier is the same as 3.6 gm/gx . Properties of Textile Fibers Of the natural fibers listed in the classification on page 97 , only a few have been used over wide areas of the world by mankind for a period of many , many years . They are flax ( linen ) , wool , cotton , hemp , and silk . Linen dates farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are records of its cultivation and use in the Stone Age in Europe . The Swiss Lake Dwellers are known to have grown flax 4000 years before the Egyptians started cultivating it . The early Babylonians had a very highly developed textile industry in which flax , wool , and cotton were utilized . The early Greeks made wide use of wool . The Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru knew about cotton and hemp , and the use of cotton in India dates back to 1500 H.C . Silk was unknown to the early Europeans , but it had been used in China before history started in Europe . Certainly over all these thousands of years men must have experimented with other natural fibers for textile purposes , and yet only five fibers have withstood the test and have continued to be used . True , other fibers have been employed for clothing in some parts of the world , but only because of the restrictions imposed by availability and transportation . As far as large-volume use is concerned , only five fibers have survived . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there must be  | something more or less common among them to which can be attributed their survival . What did these five fibers have that the others did not have ? If we can discover that , then we shall have what might be called the essential properties of fibers suitable for textile purposes . As far as this book is concerned , the only interest is in fibers for making yarns that can be woven or knitted into fabrics , that is , goods which are generally used for clothing or household cloths such as tablecloths and draperies . We shall not be concerned with those fibers used for stuffing or packing or the makings of mats . We can divide the properties of textile fibers into two groups : ( a ) the primary properties , which may be considered the essential properties responsible for the popularity of the five fibers for so many years ; ( b ) the secondary properties , which are desirable , though not essential . There are five primary or essential properties : staple , strength , elasticity , uniformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail in the following sections . STAPLE The word staple is used in connection with the dimensions of a fiber , such as length and diameter , and we speak of a long- or a short-staple fiber , or a fine-staple fiber . When we say that staple is an essential requirement , we mean that a fiber must be long enough and fine enough to be satisfactory . A fiber might satisfy all the other requirements , but if it is not long enough it is not good enough . As we know , silk is a very long fiber , whereas cotton and wool are much shorter , but their spinning quality compensates for their short length . The length of fibers varies greatly . For example , the length of cotton runs from 0.3 in. to about 2 in. , fine wools from 1.5 to 5 in. , and coarse wools from 5 to 12 in . Rayon and nylon manufacturers follow the system used by the silkworm and spin a filament that is almost endless . And yet , when rayon is to be spun with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( staple rayon ) , about the same as the other fiber . Only one generalization can be made about length of fiber , and in making it we must confine ourselves to the same fiber . The longer the fiber , other things being equal , the stronger the yarn . That is , a long-staple sea island cotton will make a stronger yarn than ordinary upland cotton .  | Similar remarks may be made about the fineness of staple of textile fibers . In general , the small-diameter fibers are the ones most prized . It is true that coarse fibers like jute and sisal can be spun into yarns and woven into cloth , but such cloths are coarse , rough , crude , and of low grade . On the other hand , fine filaments like silk and nylon can be converted into yarns and made into cloth which is prized for its fine , smooth , uniform , and draping quality . Fine fibers make fabrics that are more flexible and there-figure fore drape better . Also they provide a larger fiber surface , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the untrained eye and touch almost all textile fibers are about the same size . It is easy to tell the difference between a 1-in. cotton fiber and a 1.7-in. fiber ; but it is difficult to visualize the difference between a fine wool with a mean diameter of 0.00035 in. and a coarse wool with a diameter of 0.0018 in. , and yet one of them is about six times as thick as the other one . There is much variation in the width of fibers ( the word diameter is not so good because very few fibers are round ) . Not only do various kinds of fibers have different widths , but there is a variation in width along the length of one individual fiber . There is a wider variation in the width of natural fibers than in the man-made fibers , because the process of manufacture of synthetic fibers produces fibers of more uniform width . For example , the width of silk and wool may vary from 18 to 30% , but the manufacture  | of nylon is so carefully controlled that the variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter of silk filaments varies from 0.0004 in. to 0.0005 in. , and in cotton the variation is from 0.00063 in. for American sea island to 0.00083 for some East Indian cottons . Even though we can not appreciate the small differences in fineness of textile fibers we can get the impression that they must be very fine in order to be acceptable for making the types of cloth that we demand . Some high-polymer plastic fibers being manufactured have diameters of about 0.05 in . Even though this seems like a very small diameter , we can see that such a filament could not compete with silk or cotton . Table 11 shows the mean width of several common fibers . STRENGTH It is essential that a fiber be strong enough to be converted into yarns and then into fabrics that will be durable enough to satisfy the purpose for which they are intended . Some cloths must have great strength , whereas in others , such as those for decorative purposes , this quality is not so important . Part of the strength of a fabric is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no yarn can be stronger than the sum of the strengths of the individual fibers in the yarn , and thus we must consider the strength of the fibers themselves . The strength of textile materials is expressed in various ways , depending on whether it refers to cloth , yarns , or fibers , or whether it means the kind of strength ( bursting or longitudinal stretching strength ) . When the word strength is applied to fibers or yarns it is always used as a measure of the amount of tension required to break the fiber or yarn ; applied to fabrics , it may mean the amount of tension required to break a strip 1 in. wide , or it may indicate the resistance of the cloth to a force that is like poking a hole in the cloth . This last is a test made on special-purpose fabrics and on all knitted fabrics . By the word strength we shall mean the resistance of fiber , yarn , or cloth to a longitudinal pulling force that breaks the material . With this meaning there are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually stated in terms of the pounds of force required to break a strip of the cloth 1 in. wide . The two terms applied to the breaking of a fiber or yarn are tenacity and tensile strength ; they must be very carefully distinguished .  | The terms tenacity and tensile strength describe the strength of filaments or yarns of any or all fibers on a common basis . The basis selected may be either area or weight . For example , it is customary to express tenacity in terms of grams per denier ( gm/denier ) , that is , the weight required to break the yarn divided by the denier . If a filament is broken by a weight of 10 gm and the denier of the filament is 4 , the grams per denier is 2.5 , and this will be called the tenacity of the filament . This is a fair standard for all fibers because it puts the strength on a common basis , that is , the number of grams pull that would be required to break the yarn or filament if its weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or grams per denier , is dependent on the density of the filament or yarn , a weight factor . On the other hand , tensile strength is usually expressed in terms of pounds per square inch ( psi ) , that is , the number of pounds pull required to break the yarn if it were 1 sq in. in cross-section area . This puts it on a different common basis , and the strength of yarns of various fibers may be compared by calculating them to the common basis of a cross-section area of 1 sq in . With a little imagination it can be seen that two fibers of different densities might have the same tenacity but different tensile strengths . It is often necessary to change tenacity into tensile strength ; that is , the grams per denier is known , but one wishes to express it in terms of pounds per square inch . Knowing the fundamental equation , denier  - -  900,000 X A X D , and the values of A and D , such changes can be calculated . ' To change tenacity , gm/denier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall want to compare various fibers with respect to their strength or tenacity , and since textile fibers have different densities we must make some sort of calculation to put them on a common basis . Such a calculation is found in the following simple equation figure  | where A equals the cross-sectional area of the filament expressed in square centimeters , and D equals the density expressed in grams per cubic centimeter . This equation takes into consideration both weight and size . figure The strength of textile fibers is influenced by the moisture in the atmosphere where the strength test is made . In general , the natural vegetable fibers are stronger when they are wet , but other fibers are weaker when wet . Thus we must not compare the strength of cotton measured at a relative humidity ( R.H. ) of 85% with the strength of rayon measured at an R.H. of 30% . Whenever specific strength figures are given it is assumed that the determinations have been made at approximately 65% R.H. and ordinary temperature . Table 12 shows the relative strength of several fibers expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from The Man-Made Textile Fibers , by Jules Labarthe , Mellon Institute of Industrial Research , 1945 , and from other reliable sources . Note how the fibers fall into five groups on the basis of how well they retain their strength when wet . Cotton is in a class by itself , being the only one that gains strength when it is wet . The vinylite and vinylidene resin fibers lose no strength when wet . Silk , wool , nylon , and Orlon fall into a group in which there is only a slight loss . All the rayons are considerably weaker in the wet state , and fibers like the casein and soybean fibers are extremely weak when wet , retaining only about onethird of their strength . ELASTICITY The third essential property for textile fibers is elasticity , included with which are such properties as elongation , elastic recovery , pliability , and bending strength . All these properties are interrelated so that the whole picture is rather complicated . Much of the quality of elasticity depends on the orientation ( arrangement ) of the molecules that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber that has crystalline characteristics as contrasted with amorphous characteristics . If excessive orientation is produced by mechanical means the fiber loses much of its pliability and stretchability , but if the orientation is poor the fiber has less strength . Fibers must be pliable enough to wrap around each other to produce a yarn , which in turn must be flexible enough to pass over and under other yarns when a cloth is woven . Many cloths must be able to resist repeated crushing or folding . Others must be able to withstand impacts ; they must stretch enough to take care of such impacts and then spring back to their original shape or size , which means an elastic recovery . The elastic elongation of a fiber is definitely connected with its bending strength and its draping quality . In fact , most of the desirable features of smart clothing are dependent on this essential property of elasticity together with its associated properties . All fibers can be stretched if enough tension is applied . This property of being stretchable is inherent in the individual fibers , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to have what might be called different  | stretchabilities . It is well known that wool is easily stretched , that silk is less so , and that ramie is stretched with difficulty . The stretching property of fibers is defined in terms of per cent elongation . If sufficient tension is applied to fibers they will stretch until they are broken . The percentage of increase in length at the time of rupture is known as the elongation of the fiber . Elongation is another property inherent in the individual fibers , and in natural fibers it is restricted to a fairly small range . It can be changed very little except by tricks of plant and animal breeding . However , the elongation of man-made fibers can be modified considerably by variations in manufacturing techniques . If a manufacturing process is changed to increase the tenacity of a fiber , the elongation is decreased . The accepted theory of the physical structure of textile fibers and filaments is that long-chain molecules are oriented in a more or less orderly fashion and held together by intermolecular forces , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , the more perfect the alignment of molecular chains , the higher the tenacity and the lower the elongation ( or the greater the brittleness ) . Among the naturally occurring substances , proteins and cellulose seem to be the only ones suitable for good fiber formation ? hence the use of cellulose for rayon manufacture and the use of vegetable and animal proteins for making artificial fibers . However , it is found that certain high polymers of the amide type ( nylon ) , vinylite type ( Vinyon ) , vinylidene type ( Saran ) , and acrylic type ( Orlon ) are also suitable . These are truly synthetic fibers , the manufacture of which has nothing to do with the modification of naturally produced long-chain molecules . The per cent elongation of several fibers is shown in Table 13 . These figures were determined at a relative humidity of 60% . They have been compiled from information given in the Handbook of Plastics by Simonds and Ellis , D. Van Nostrand Company , 1943 , and in Textile Fibers , by Matthews and Mauersberger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One would think that a fiber could not be stretched unless it had some elasticity , and , therefore , that the per cent elongation should be a measure of elasticity . However , this would not be true because elasticity is not the property of being stretchable , but the property of being able to regain original length or shape after being stretched . It is not a question of how far a fiber can  | be stretched , but how much it will snap back afterwards . Actually , elasticity opposes elongation . If any material is truly elastic it will obey the law of physics which says that the ratio of the tension ( applied to such material ) to the strain produced by such a tension is a constant . This con- figure stant is known as Young 's modulus of elasticity . It can be reduced to a common basis of either strain or tension . For example , the tension required to stretch various fibers 1% would be the modulus for each fiber . Or , conversely , one might apply the same tension to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elongation . It is customary to express the modulus in two ways : ( a ) as pounds per square inch cross-section required to stretch a fiber 1% , or ( b ) as grams per denier required to elongate 1% . If some fibers are more easily stretched than others , less tension will  | be required to stretch them 1% , and consequently their moduli of elasticity will be smaller . Hence , the modulus of elasticity is inversely proportional to the elastic properties of fibers . Since most fibers will stretch more easily when wet , and hence exhibit a smaller modulus , it is necessary that the relative humidity of the atmosphere in which the determination is made be stated . A du Pont bulletin ( 1943 ) 2 gives the results of tests made in their laboratories . These tests were performed at 72% R.H. , and the results were calculated to a basis of grams per denier . The figures are shown in Table 14. figure It has been pointed out that the elasticity of a fiber is its ability to recover or snap back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as elastic recovery and is expressed in percentage . That is , if a fiber or yarn is stretched a certain amount by applying some load to it , and then the load is removed , the fiber or yarn is said to have an elastic recovery of 100% if it goes back to its original length . If it shrinks only 0.6 of its extra length ( as the result of stretching ) , its elastic recovery is 60% . Elastic recovery is an effort to oppose dimensional distortion . That is , if the shape or size of a material is altered by pulling or stretching , the material will try to overcome such an effect and regain its original size and shape . If its dimensions are temporarily distorted , it will attempt to regain them . This may take place slowly over a period of time , or it may occur rapidly . Rubber is a material that recovers very rapidly after stretching , snapping back to its original length or shape ; but most of the textile fibers recover much more slowly .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . When a pulling force is applied to it , a spring can be extended or stretched and held in such an elongated state , but as soon as it is released it will return to its original contracted form . Some metals make good springs and others do not . So it is with fibers . Some of them have a good ability to recover and others do not . This individuality among fibers must have some connection with their internal chemical structure . The modern ideas regarding the structure of wool ( see page 260 ) are based on the fact that wool can be stretched , and unless it is set in this stretched form it will return to its original length when released from the distorting force . The property of elastic recovery is the opposite of setting . In setting , a fiber or fabric is distorted , and while in such a condition may be treated so that it will retain its new form , but if such a treatment is not applied the fabric will not retain the new form but will seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic recovery is inherent in each type of fiber , and that its force or extent is different for each type . The animal and protein-like fibers seem to have the best recovery . This may be because nature orients and disposes the constituent molecules in the proper way so that intermolecular recovering forces can be operative . In the field of synthetic fibers it is left to man 's ingenuity to imitate nature . Elastic recovery of fibers is a very important property , and it is essential that fibers and fabrics have a good recovery if they are to maintain their shape and to fit enclosed contours properly . Much of our wearing apparel is constantly being subjected to stretch and strain , and it is highly desirable that it repeatedly recover from such distortion . Fabrics or knit goods made from fibers with good elastic recovery will do so , but if they do not have good recovery the well-known bagginess will result . The superior clinging property of silk and nylon is due to their high elastic recovery . Four factors affect the extent of elastic recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when used to compare two or more materials , these factors must be understood and rigidly controlled when the experimental determination of recovery is carried out . The factors are as follows . The first is , the amount or extent of stretch . If fibers are stretched too much , that is too far , they will be so internally disorganized and strained that their normal recovery ability is decreased . Each type of  | fiber has a limiting elongation beyond which its ability to recover is sharply changed . This elongation is known as the true elasticity of the fiber or the elastic limit and is expressed in percentage . It designates the maximum percentage that a filament or yarn can be stretched and still have an elastic recovery of 100% . For example , nylon can be stretched about 8% and still recover corn- figure pletely after the stretching load is removed , but if it is stretched more than 8% it will not recover completely . The time during which the material is held in its stretched form is the second factor . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , some of the strained bonds in the material may be ruptured and cause the molecules to rearrange themselves in such a way as to change the power of recovery . The third factor is another one involving time ; it is the time interval between the release of tension and the measurement of the recovered length . Some of the fibers may recover more slowly than others and exhibit what is called delayed recovery . The fourth factor involves the conditions under which the recovery is allowed to proceed . There are two ways in which this is done in the testing laboratory : ( 1 ) by allowing the fiber to  | recover without any opposing force ( against no load ) , or ( 2 ) by giving it a load of some sort to support while it is recovering ( against a load ) . Table 15 shows the elastic recovery of a few fibers after the given amount of elongation . More should be said about delayed recovery . If a stretching load is applied to a fiber or yarn smaller than the load required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immediate and rapid elongation followed by a much slower extension of the material . The rapid elongation is due to the true elastic property of the fibers , but the slower extension is probably due to plastic properties . Now observe what happens when the stretching load is removed . There is an immediate and rapid shrinkage which is approximately equal to the rapid elongation observed when the load was first applied . Then a much slower contraction occurs ; in fact , it is so slow that the word creep is applied to it . The yarn or fiber will continue to creep until it has recovered practically all its original length . This property of creep is very important for many reasons . If too much tension is put on yarns during winding or warping or weaving , the slow shrinkage may be very undesirable . Creep is probably due to the plasticity of the fiber rather than true elasticity , and , since plastic flow is enhanced by moisture , excessive shrinkage of certain fabrics may be expected during humid weather . UNIFORMITY OF STAPLE Uniformity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that a woolen cloth can be made from fibers that vary in length and diameter , but such a cloth would not be acceptable to the discriminating consumer . If fibers have the same dimensions they will spin better and make a much more uniform and smoother yarn . This is one reason for sorting wool fleeces and separating the fibers into various qualities . For the some reason wool fibers are combed so as to yield a more uniform staple for spinning . SPINNING QUALITY The fifth essential property is spinning quality , which means that the individual fibers must be capable of being spun into a yarn that will have sufficient strength to withstand loom punishment and to make a cloth that is strong enough . In order to have good  | spinning quality , fibers must have some cohesiveness ; that is , they must be able to cling together in a mass and therefore stick together when spun . This prevents fiber slippage along the length of a yarn . The only way in which the property of cohesiveness can be made operative is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , the greater the number of such points in a yarn , the less slippage there will be and the stronger the yarn will be . Microscopic examination of spun yarns shows that there is not much contact between fibers along the length of the fiber but that it occurs at isolated points . Four main factors contribute to cohesiveness between fibers in a yarn : fineness of staple , nature of surface , pressure , and length . A mass of fine fibers will have a much greater total surface area than coarse fibers , and therefore the chances for contact are greater . The nature of the fiber surface is a very important factor in spinning quality because it may increase fiber-to-fiber contact . The serrated surface of wool , the spiral twist in cotton , the striations in certain staple rayons , and the rough knotlike surface of linen are examples of fibers with splended spinning quality . If fibers are pressed closely together we should expect more cohesiveness . This pressure is obtained by putting sufficient twist into a yarn . When long fibers are twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contributes to the general strength of the yarn . Many other fiber properties are desirable or play a definite part in the formation of fabrics for special purposes . Among desirable but not necessarily essential properties we might mention density , or specific gravity ; luster ; moisture regain ; flammability ; felting quality ; resistance to heat , etc . DENSITY OR SPECIFIC GRAVITY The relative weights of textile fibers are expressed in terms of density or specific gravity . Density is usually expressed as grams per cubic centimeter , whereas the specific gravity of a solid or liquid is a ratio of the mass of the substance to the mass of an equal volume of water ( at 4 ? C ) . For all practical purposes the weight per cubic centimeter is the same as specific gravity . The density of fibers is , of course , the determining factor in the weight of cloths that may be made from them . The heavier figure fibers might be assumed to be the strongest , but there are many applications for which a strong , but lightweight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one with a low density but high tenacity . Density figures may serve for a rough determination of the percentage composition of a yarn composed of two different fibers by means of the formula figure where X is the percentage of fiber 1 . d is the density of the mixture . d1 is the density of fiber 1 . d2 is the density of fiber 2 . Table 16 shows the densities of a number of textile fibers . MOISTURE ABSORPTION BY TEXTILE FIBERS Most fibers will absorb moisture from the air , but the amount of moisture varies with the kind of fiber , its condition ( loose , in  | yarn , or in cloth ) , and the humidity of the atmosphere . Outstanding exceptions to this are Saran and Vinyon , which absorb practically no water at all . Fibers have the property of taking on water and also of losing water , and the humidity of the air determines which of these phenomena will take place . If a dry cloth is placed in a damp atmosphere it will take on water , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose water . These reactions will proceed until a condition of equilibrium is established , and the amount of moisture in the textile material will remain constant as long as its environment retains a constant humidity . The absorption and retention of water must be considered from two points of view , based on the ease of absorption as contrasted with the ability to retain water at the point of moisture equilibrium . For example , cellulosic materials , such as blotting paper , filter paper , and cotton or linen dish towels , will absorb large amounts of water quickly , whereas wool will not . However , the condition of dish towels after such rapid absorption is not an equilibrium condition , and most of the water will be given up to the air until equilibrium is established , at which time it will be found that wool has retained more than twice as much water as cotton . A discussion of the moisture relations of textile fibers is usually confined to water retention , and any figures quoted refer to moisture equilibrium conditions . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , in both of which it is a percentage , but the percentages are based on two different things . We have learned that percentage is the part divided by the whole . The part in this instance is a weight of water in a cloth or loose fiber , but the whole can be taken in two different ways . For example , suppose a 5-gm sample of raw wool is analyzed and found to contain 0.5 gm water , which is the part . If the whole is 5 gm , which is the weight of air-dry wool , then ( 0.5 = 5 ) X 100 = 10% moisture in the wool . When calculated in this way , it is known as the per cent moisture , or the per cent moisture on an air-dry basis . However , the 0.5 gm of water in the sample may be considered in an imaginary way as having been regained or taken up by a certain amount of bone-dry or oven-dry wool . The 5-gm sample of wool contains 0.5 gm water and 4.5 gm bone-dry fiber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained 0.5 gm water , and the percentage gained would be ( 0.5 = 4.5 ) X 100 , which i$  | 11.11% . This is known as the per cent moisture regain ( usually called regain ) . Here the percentage is based on bone-dry wool instead of air-dry wool . It is better to think in terms of regain rather than moisture , because regain will be constant . If the 5-gm sample of wool were transferred to an atmosphere where the figure relative humidity is higher , it would absorb more water and weigh more than 5 gm , and its per cent moisture would be different , but the weight of bone-dry wool in it would remain the same . Manufacturers , buyers , and sellers of textile materials have set up certain standards for commercial purposes . The American Society for Testing Materials has established such a set of standards , shown in Table 17 . The figures in the second column are the standard regains for the materials listed ; they approximate the per cent of water that each material would absorb if exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a relative humidity of 65% at a temperature of 70 ? F. The third column in the table shows the per cent moisture ( not regain ) under these conditions . This table shows that wool has the highest  | regain and the synthetic fibers the lowest , and that other natural fibers are intermediate . It has been pointed out that a change of environment brings about a different moisture content . Table 18 shows the per cent moisture in textile fibers when they are at equilibrium in atmospheres of different relative humidity . These figures were determined at a constant temperature of 75 ? F. Changes in moisture content of textile materials have a profound effect on the practical uses of such materials . For example , figure all the ordinary fibers except cotton have a lower tensile strength when they are wet . This decrease in strength is not a sudden phenomenon but becomes apparent as the humidity of the air increases . Not only do fibers lose strength when they are wet , but also they stretch more easily . This is important because , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be applied . When this tension is released the material will recover part of the extra length at once , but further shrinkage , due to creep , is sure to occur . The water-absorbing property of fibers is closely connected with heat insulation or heat transfer . Cotton is used so extensively in the tropics because of its large capacity for absorbing moisture , which evaporates and causes a lowering of temperature . If cotton cloth is treated to make it waterrepellent , it will not absorb water and hence will be uncomfortable to wear next to the skin in hot weather . One fiber property that is important in the use and maintenance  | figure of fabrics is resistance to heat . Some fibers lose considerable strength when subjected to a little too much heat . This , of course , must be taken into consideration when ironing fabrics . Table 19 shows the temperatures at which a measurable loss in strength may be expected .

In plants like flax and hemp , the cellulose is combined with noncellulose constituents to form what are known as compound celluloses . Of these there are two main types : ( a ) the lignocelluloses , in which cellulose is combined with lignin ( flax , hemp , jute , wood ; and the lignified tissues of perennial plants ) , and ( b ) the pectocelluloses , in which the noncellulosic constituents are related to pectic acid ( ramie , hemp , and flax ) . Cotton contains about 91% cellulose ; and hemp , ramie , and flax contain similarly large amounts of cellulose . Wood and cereal straws contain lower proportions of cellulose ? about 60% for coniferous woods and 30 to 40%o for straws . In this book the word cellulose will be assumed to mean cotton cellulose , and the words cellulose and cotton will be used interchangeably many times . If we can learn a few facts about the chemistry of cellulose , then we shall have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brief study of cellulose in this chapter has been organized in the following way : 1 . The structure of cellulose , with emphasis on its use in textile chemistry and technology . 2 . The viscosity of cuprammonium solutions of cellulose and its reducing property . These two properties are widely used in studying the degrading effect of many reagents on cellulose. 3 . The dispersion of cellulose in liquids .  | 4 . Chemical reactions that degrade cellulose and change both its physical and chemical properties . 5 . Chemical reactions that are not primarily degradation reactions . After a hundred years of research on the behavior of cellulose , it has been accepted that it is a high-polymeric long-chain compound , the repeated unit of which is anhydro- ( 3-cellobiose , these units being joined together by glycosidic linkages and each cellobiose unit being composed of two anhydroglucose pyranose rings . The structural formula is shown here . figure The portion of the formula for cellulose enclosed in brackets is the anhydrocellobiose unit . If this unit is split as shown by the dotted line , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple sugar with the molecular formula 06H12O6 . Anhydroglucose would be this formula minus water , or C6H1005 . Glucose is an equilibrium mixture of two structures , the pyranose ring structure and the aldehyde form . These are shown below : figure Note how the carbons are numbered . This is important because these rings are found in cellulose , and we shall use this same system for numbering them . The aldehyde form of glucose is the one responsible for the fact that glucose is a reducing sugar and will reduce Fehling 's solution . Note that the aldehyde  | structure is formed from the pyranose ring by the migration of a hydrogen atom from carbon 1 to the oxygen of the ring , thus opening the ring and leaving carbon 1 in an aldehyde group . It is important to remember that any glucose ring structure in which there is a secondary alcohol group in position 1 is a potential reducing agent , because of the possibility of opening the ring with the formation of an aldehyde group . Now look at the structural formula for cellulose on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellobiose units ( in brackets ) , together with two terminal rings . Note that the terminal ring at the left end can not open up to form an aldehyde group ( because carbon 1 is not a CHOH group ) , but the terminal ring at the right end can form an aldehyde group . Thus cellulose has one potential reducing group at one end of each very long chain , but this one reducing group is such a small proportion of the total chain that pure cellulose does not show any reducing property ( within the limits of the sensitivity of the methods used for such determinations ) . Let us condense the formula for cellulose . If we disregard the spatial arrangement of the molecule , and if anhydrocellobiose is equal to two anhydroglucose fragments , we may say that the cellulose molecule is a long chain of repeated anhydroglucose units with two terminal groups , and a condensed formula would then be C6H1106 ? ( C6H1006 ) n C6H1106 A still further condensation can be made if we forget the two terminal groups and say that cellulose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-polymeric chain of anhydroglucose units . We shall therefore write the molecular formula for cellulose ( C6H1006 ) n . The structural formula for cellulose on page 125 shows a solid figure existing in space . The members of the rings lie in one plane with H and OH groups above and below it . The use of heavy and thin lines emphasizes this , because the heavy lines represent valence bonds which can be seen when the model is held level with the eyes . Note that the CH2OH group and the 0 which joins the rings are always on the same side of the plane of the ring , either above or below it . The chemist is not so much interested in spatial arrangements as he is in functional groups and cleavage products . It is seen that the functional groups in cellulose are all alcohol groups ,  | three in each glucose unit , one primary and two secondary . These are the points at which cellulose is oxidizable ( bleaching of cotton is an oxidation reaction ) . As far as cleavage is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cellulose chain is split into shorter chains , at one end of which a new reducing group will be formed . By " splitting the chains " we mean the rupture of glycosidic linkages . The vertical dotted line in the formula on page 125 illustrates such a point of cleavage . If the chain is hydrolyzed at this point so as to put an H on the left side of the line and an OH on the right side , thus breaking the chain , the result will be the formation of two new terminal groups . We now have two chains instead of one . The new terminal group of the left chain has a CHOH group in the 1 position , and we have just learned that this is the potential aldehyde group of glucose . The new terminal group of the right chain has a new OH group , but it is not in the 1 position and so has no reducing possibilities . However , the other terminal of the right chain is still a reducing group . Thus we see that the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of an additional reducing group . If we multiply this by several hundred , we can see that hydrolyzed cellulose should be a fairly good reducing agent . If we extend it still further and let the splitting continue , we can see that the final product will be glucose . It is found that a practically 100% yield of glucose can be obtained by the acid hydrolysis of cellulose . The present-day idea of a model for native cellulose is one of long parallel chains of anhydroglucose units arranged in bundles called micelles . The strength of cellulosic fibers is dependent on the forces existing within these bundles . It is evident that along the length of the chains the cellobiose and anhydroglucose units are bound together by primary ( ordinary ) valences that are as strong as steel . The separate chains are held together laterally by secondary valences connecting oxygen atoms in adjacent chains , or by hydrogen bonds . There are other ways in which cross-links between chains may be formed . Heuser ' shows that such links might be produced by a condensation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water to yield an ether linkage ) , or by a glycosidic linkage between the fourth OH of a terminal group with the reducing end group of an adjacent ' Paper Trade J. , 122 ( TAPP ) , 21 ( Jan. 1946 ) .  | chain , or by the introduction of new atoms between adjacent chains . Man-made cross-links can be formed in various ways . For example , nitrocellulose can be dissolved and treated with lime to form a product with much different properties . It is presumed that this new material has calcium atoms between some of the adjacent chains . Methylene groups , CH2 , can also be introduced between chains by means of formaldehyde , CH2O . Such celluloseformaldehyde derivatives can be made with greatly different properties . Some of them resist the action of alkali and swell much less with NaOH , and have a reduced solubility in Schweitzer 's reagent . On the other hand , U.S. Patent 2,397,437 ( 1946 ) treats alkali cellulose with formaldehyde to yield a fibrous product that is much more soluble in dilute NaOH . The secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the micelles themselves are held together by tertiary forces known as van der Waals ' forces , and when a fiber breaks it is due to the rupture of these forces , permitting the micelles to slip past each other . For further reading on this subject , the following outstanding papers may be consulted : Meyer and Mark , Ber. , 61 , 593 ? 614 ( 1928 ) . Sponsler and Dore , Ann . Rev.

The textile chemist must be able to deal with problems connected with all sorts of processes and operations through which textile materials must pass during preparation for consumer use . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may accompany certain treatments given the material ; he should be able to set certain limits above which or below which , as the case may be , damage may occur . If he is dealing with cellulosic fibers ( cotton , linen , rayon ) he has two important tools that he may use . These are the measurement of the viscosity of solutions of cellulose in cuprammonium hydroxide , and determination of the reducing power of cellulose in terms of copper number . Cellulose and its derivatives , along with some other high-  | polymer substances , has the distinction of increasing the viscosity of cuprammonium hydroxide to a large extent , even in solutions as dilute as 0.5% . This high viscosity is directly connected with the length of the chains in the polymer . That is , if cellulose is degraded by any chain-shortening treatment , the viscosity of its solution will be lower and it will flow more rapidly . There are three ways in which the flow quality of a liquid or solution can be expressed . The time of flow of a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , Clibbens and Geake2 ( in a very fine comprehensive discussion of the technique of viscosity determinations and their significance ) compare the time of flow of 0.5% cuprammonium solutions of cotton with a mixture of glycerin and water having a specific gravity of 1.1681 . The ratio time for cotton solution = specific viscosity time for glycerin The particular glycerin-water mixture was selected because its time of flow is about the same as that of a cuprammonium solution of cotton that has been damaged to the maximum limit during bleaching . Another way to express the flow of a liquid is in terms of absolute viscosity . The absolute viscosity of a liquid is expressed in poises , or more frequently in centipoises ( 0.01 poise ) . A poise is a value involving force , time and area . figure The fluidity of a liquid is the reciprocal of the absolute viscosity , that is , the viscosity when it is expressed in poises . This method has been adopted by British cotton research workers . In a qualitative way , the more viscous a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know that the cuprammonium viscosity of cellulose decreases as the average chain length is shortened by some modifying treatment , and so such chain shortening should be evidenced by an increase in fluidity . The copper number of cellulose is a measure of its reducing power . It is the number of grams of reduced copper obtained from 100 gm cellulose by the action of Fehling 's solution ( or a modified Fehling 's solution ) . When cellulose is degraded by acid hydrolysis or oxidation , aldehyde groups or potential aldehyde groups are formed . Fehling 's solution is essentially an alkaline solution of cupric oxide , CuO , which yields cuprous oxide , Cu2O , a reddish brown solid , when reduced . The more aldehyde groups there are in a particular sample of cellulose , the more cuprous oxide will be formed , so that a quantitative determination of the Cu20 formed when the sample is boiled with Fehling 's solution is a direct measure of the extent of any aldehyde-forming degradation . If cotton has been overbleached , a light reddish brown stain will be deposited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The copper number of raw cotton varies with its source , e.g. , American cotton , 0.68 ? 1.09 , Egyptian cotton , 0.93 ? 1.16 ; and Indian cotton , 1.54 ? 2.97 . However , if raw cotton is very carefully purified , the copper number is 0.05 ? 0.08 . This indicates that the impurities in raw cotton have some reducing power . Ordinary commercial cotton has a value of about 0.3 . Values for oxidized cotton ( where the consumption of oxygen is as high as 0.32% ) run from 0.4 to 6.0 . Directions for the laboratory determination of the copper number will be found in Textile Chemistry in the Laboratory . The textile chemist is interested in the very first stages of degradation reactions , such as hydrolysis and oxidation . It is obvious that if cellulose chains are broken during such reactions , a loss in strength will occur . Our methods for measuring tensile strength of yarns and fabrics are not very sensitive , and often chemical damage has been done to cloth before its strength is decreased enough to be measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive , and they may be used to predict approaching damage before it really occurs . SOLVENTS FOR CELLULOSE Cellulose is noted for its great insolubility . It resists the action of all common solvents even at high temperatures for a long time .  | You may read that cotton will dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid , but this is a wrong use of the word dissolve , because cotton is not soluble in H2SO4 . It disappears , but it is completely destroyed , and cellulose can never be precipitated or recovered from the solution . If we dissolve sugar in water we can always get the sugar back , but if cellulose is " dissolved " in concentrated acid we can never get the cellulose back . Strong solutions of zinc chloride are also said to dissolve cellulose , but actually the effect of zinc chloride is to cause swelling , peptizing , and finally hydrolysis . However , there are a few solvents which will dissolve cellulose , and the cellulose can be regenerated from these solutions . These solvents are the copper amino hydroxides , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydroxide , cuprammonium hydroxide , and cuprammonium or Schweitzer 's reagent . Its formula is Cu(NH3)4(OH)2 , and it is essentially the result of dissolving cupric hydroxide in ammonium hydroxide and contains the characteristic deep blue copper ammonia ion . A similar compound has been made by the reaction of molecular equivalent amounts of ethylenediamine and copper sulfate . The solution is probably a complex with the formula Cu ( H2N ? CH2 ? CH2 ? NH2 ) ( CuS O4 ) 2 Either of these nitrogen compounds will dissolve cellulose , even though it is very highly polymerized , as it is in native cotton . The word dissolve is still not precisely correct , because the reaction is more a matter of dispersion than solution . We had better say that cellulose is dispersed in cuprammonium hydroxide . However , the two terms are used interchangeably . Ordinary Schweitzer 's reagent will dissolve up to 6% cotton in a few hours at 5 ? C , and it is possible to get as much as 8% dispersed . The solvent action of Schweitzer 's reagent on cellulose is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than academic interest . We shall discuss some of the factors that govern the reaction and show the probable chemical reactions that occur . When cotton is immersed in cuprammonium hydroxide , the first thing that is noticed is a definite swelling of the fibers , which causes a radical disintegration of the fiber structure . However , these separated structural fragments are still visible . The next thing that happens is a dispersion of these visible fragments into  | microscopic , invisible particles . These particles may possibly be the micelles ( bundles of cellulose chains ) . It is possible that the disintegration may go even farther , to the individual chain molecules . Note that what has happened has been disintegration and not degradation . The amount of cellulose that can be dissolved is related to the concentration of copper in the Schweitzer 's reagent , in the sense that the higher the copper concentration , the more cellulose will be dissolved , up to a certain limit . For example , if concentrations of copper as low as 0.25% are used no cellulose will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will occur ) , but as the concentration of copper is increased , the extent of swelling and dispersion of cellulose increases . The age of the Schweitzer 's reagent is an important factor . It tends to decompose into Cu(OH)2 and NH3 , and this will decrease its solvent property , for even though the concentration of copper is still the same , it will have no solvent action unless it is in the copper tetramine ion . Anything that decreases the concentration of copper or converts it into any form other than the tetramine hydroxide will decrease the solvent power of cuprammonium . If this change in copper progresses far enough , cellulose will be coagulated and precipitated from solution . The condition of the cotton when it is added to cuprammonium should be taken into consideration . Any treatment which will activate the surface of the cotton will cause it to be dispersed more easily and quickly . Any action that will open up the surface , such as mercerization with alkali or vigorous beating with water , will do this . In either of these treatments the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immersed in the cuprammonium . It is reasonable to expect dispersed cellulose to be much more active toward all reagents than a piece of cotton cloth would be . This is because the solid aggregate is broken into micelles or even farther , and the separate chains are much more accessible to the action of various reagents . Cellulose dissolved in cuprammonium is very susceptible to oxidation ; even small amounts of air will cause enough degradation in a few minutes to be evidenced by a decrease in viscosity . If the cellulose is to be regenerated as rayon , such oxidation must be prevented or at least held to a minimum , or the rayon will have a low tensile strength . When making viscosity determinations , one must take all precautions to  | see that air is excluded , because if air gets into the system the dissolved cellulose will be degraded and the viscosity of the solution will be lowered proportionately . One way in which oxidation can be prevented is by the addition of substances which are more easily oxidized than cellulose , such as glucose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of light , even in an atmosphere of hydrogen . For this reason such solutions and the solvent itself should be protected from light by keeping them in dark brown bottles . ACID IIYDROLYSIS OF CELLULOSE : HYDROCELLULOSE We have already discussed the hydrolysis of cellulose in a brief way ( page 127 ) and have learned that long chains are broken at the glycosidic linkages . As a result of chain cleavage , reducing groups are formed , and the viscosity of cellulose solutions is decreased . For practical purposes the important thing is that the cellulose suffers a loss of tensile strength , which is of prime interest to the textile technologist . We are now ready to study in more detail the effect of strong ( even though dilute ) mineral acids on cellulose ( acid hydrolysis ) , together with the physical and chemical properties of the product resulting from such hydrolysis . When cellulose is allowed to stand with a strong mineral acid such as H2SO4 or HC1 , a series of reactions takes place . The point of initial attack is certainly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chains occurs , and we may imagine the surface of the solid becoming covered with a layer or film of partially hydrolyzed cellulose . Let us call this first product of hydrolysis a surface hydrolysate . Now assume that the reaction progresses inward from the surface , attacking the next layer of cellulose . This second layer will suffer its initial attack , but at the same time the first layer will be hydrolyzed further , and the proportion of split chains in it will increase . As hydrolysis progresses it is seen that a very complex mixture of products will result , but always that portion of the cellulose which is on the surface will have been hydrolyzed to the greatest extent . Names have been applied to substances obtained during the hydrolysis of cellulose . The substances are not pure chemical compounds , but they have some average properties by which they can be identified . We have already called the first product a surface hydrolysate . The second product is cellulose dextrin ,  | which still retains some cellulosic nature . The next product is dextrin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the colloidal properties are retained . Dextrin is soluble in water to form somewhat mucilagenous solutions . Further hydrolysis yields a group of polysaccharides which are crystalline and so simple , as compared with cellulose , that they are easily soluble in water . The final product is glucose . It is to be understood that cellulose is not hydrolyzed in definite complete steps ; that is , it is not all converted into cellulose dextrin and then all of it still farther to dextrin . On the contrary , it is possible for some portions of solid cellulose to be hydrolyzed to a water-soluble form , and other portions to be unchanged . Remember that the attack progresses from the surface inward . We might express the course of hydrolysis by the following equation figure As students of textile chemistry , we are interested only in the first stages of hydrolysis , during which time cotton cloth or yarn is attacked and weakened . When a point is reached beyond which the material loses its fibrous structure , it is no longer a textile problem . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack was a homogeneous substance , and it was called hydrocellulose . Now we know that there is no such homogeneous product , but the name hydrocellulose is still retained . It is the name applied to cellulose that has been only partially hydrolyzed and has  | not lost its fibrous structure . It is a complex mixture of unchanged cellulose and shortened chain molecules , together with more degraded substances which have no cellulosic properties whatever . Some of these may even be soluble in water , so that the material ( cotton cloth ) may retain its fibrous form but yet have lost some weight , due to partial solubility . It would seem that if acid hydrolysis of cellulose causes such disintegration it would be very undesirable and should be avoided as much as possible . And yet sometimes it is very desirable . For example , when wool is " carbonized " to remove small particles of vegetable matter clinging to it , it is heated with sulfuric acid , for the purpose of destroying the vegetable matter , and one method for making wool shoddy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF IIYDROCELLULOSE Since hydrocellulose is a mixture the composition of which depends upon the extent of hydrolysis and varies with several factors , its properties should vary considerably . However , the products of hydrolysis have certain properties in common , and a mixture of them will have the same property , but its magnitude will vary . One thing common to all of the products of hydrolysis is aldehyde groups , the relative number of which depends on the extent of hydrolysis . Therefore , hydrocellulose will reduce Fehling 's solution and have a copper number ( page 130 ) ; it will react with phenylhydrazine , an aldehyde reagent ; it will turn yellow when heated with dilute alkali ( a property of simple sugars having a potential aldehyde group ) . The size of the copper number of hydrocellulose is a fairly good measure of the extent of acid degradation . Using the copper number as such a measure , Birtwell , Clibbens , and Geake3 arrived at some conclusions about the rate of hydrolysis of cellulose by strong mineral acids . When a certain acid is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copper number ) is 50% larger when the time is doubled . For example , if a cotton has a copper number of 1.6 after a 1-hour treatment , the value will be 2.4 after a 2-hour treatment . The effect of temperature ( with constant time ) shows that the copper number be3 J. Textile Inst. , 17 , T161 ( 1926 ) .  | comes 2.3 times as large for each 10 ? rise in temperature between 20 ? C and 100 ? C. Another common property of hydrolytic products is that they have shortened chain molecules , and therefore the viscosity of hydrocellulose solutions in cuprammonium hydroxide will be lower than cellulose solutions . Hydrocellulose is more sensitive to heat than cellulose , and it will start to scorch at about 110 ? C. A simple test which will show that cotton cloth has been damaged by acids is to iron it with a hot iron . Hydrolyzed areas will scorch sooner than unhydrolyzed areas . Another important property of hydrocellulose is its partial solubility in hot dilute alkali . As cellulose chains are shortened , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilute NaOH . Therefore , that portion of hydrocellulose which dissolves in hot alkali has been hydrolyzed beyond this point , and the alkali solubility must be a quite accurate qualitative measure of degradation . OXIDATION OF CELLULOSE : OXYCELLULOSE The problems arising from the oxidation of cellulose must be met and understood by the textile chemist whenever it is necessary to bleach cellulosic materials , because bleaching is an oxidation reaction . All reagents that might be used for the bleaching of cotton , linen , wood pulp , paper , etc. , are oxidizing agents . It appears that the small amount of coloring matter associated with native cellulose can be converted into colorless substances by oxidation . One of the major control problems in the cellulose and allied fields comes from the fact that , when bleach liquor is used for whitening cellulose , it is almost impossible to stop the reaction at the point of sufficient bleaching , because cellulose itself is easily oxidized . The structural formula for cellulose on page 125 shows that each anhydroglucose unit of cellulose contains three alcohol groups , one primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohols are oxidizable , the primary alcohols to aldehydes and acids , and the secondary alcohols to ketones . So it is seen that cellulose should react with oxidizing agents , and that the products of such oxidation should function in different ways because of the various functional groups which may result from oxidation . The  | oxidation of cellulose is not a simple matter , but rather it is very complex , and the product of the oxidation is a heterogeneous , complex mixture . This product has been called oxycellulose , but it must be clearly understood that oxycellulose is not a pure chemical compound with a definite structure or molecular weight , nor does it have strictly reproducible properties . Because of the importance of the oxidation of cellulose , a great amount of research work from the purely scientific standpoint has been done in this field . All types of cellulose have been used , together with all sorts of oxidizing agents under all sorts of conditions , and the products examined in various ways . These experimental oxidations have been carried to different extents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textiles to a point where the fibrous nature of the material has been entirely lost . At such a point oxycellulose is a nonfibrous , amorphous , powdery , friable white solid . Of course when oxidation goes this far it is no longer a textile problem , and we are really interested only in the earliest stages of oxidation , which would be encountered in the bleaching of cotton . Most oxidizing agents will oxidize any or all of the alcohol groups of cellulose with which they come into contact . Unruh and Kenyon4 point out that there are six points of oxidative attack : 1 . Attack at carbons 2 or 3 , or both , oxidizing these secondary alcohol groups to ketones , without breaking the ring . 2 . Oxidation at both carbons 2 and 3 to form aldehydes , with a simultaneous rupture of the ring . 3 . Oxidation of the primary alcohol group at carbon 6 to an aldehyde . Any of these three oxidations will yield an oxycellulose , known as the reducing type , with almost no carboxyl groups in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Further oxidation of aldehyde groups at carbons 2 and 3 to carboxyl groups . 5 . Oxidation of the carbon 6 alcohol group to a carboxyl group . These two oxidations will yield a carboxyl type of oxycellulose with very few , if any , reducing groups in it . It will have a high COOH content , as measured by methylene blue absorption . 6 . The oxidation may result in oxidation of alcohol groups at 4 Textile Research J. , 16 , 1 ? 12 ( 1946 ) .  | #2 and 3 to aldehyde groups , followed by further oxidation of one of them to COOH , leaving the other one as CHO . Such an oxycellulose will have a high COOH content and also a high reducing property . A nonspecific oxidizing agent might act in any of the preceding ways so that we may expect oxycellulose to show the properties of a carbonyl compound ( especially aldehydic ) , a carboxylic compound , and very probably a compound with a lower degree of polymerization due to chain rupture ; hence oxycellulose will have lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents that seem to be specific in their action . These are periodic acid and nitrogen dioxide . Since Jackson and Hudson ' discovered that the oxidative attack on polysaccharides by periodic acid is specifically confined to a-0 glycol arrangements , a large amount of research has been done in the field of periodic acid oxidation . Some of the more important contributions have been made in England by Davidson , ' and in the United States by Michell and Purves , ' Rutherford , Miner , Martin , and Harris , ' and in unpublished work from the laboratory of Michigan State College . When cotton cellulose is treated with dilute solutions of periodic acid , the 2 and 3 secondary alcohol groups are oxidized to two aldehydes ( together with an opening figure of the ring ) , but the 6 primary alcohol is not affected . The amount of glycosidic cleavage during periodic acid oxidation is small , but note that the ring structure is ruined and the tensile strength of cellulose fibers is reduced by a fraction equivalent to the proportion of such strength contributed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen dioxide gas is being studied in the Eastman Kodak laboratories by Kenyon and associates . They have found that this oxidizing agent specifically attacks the 6 primary alcohol groups of cellulose , converting them into carboxyl groups . The product appears to be a new type of oxycellulose , the chief difference being that the cotton retains its soft fibrous character and does not become friable , even after extensive oxidation . These facts indicate that there is very little cleavage of glycosidic linkages and very little rupture of the cross-links between chains . It is logical to assume that the mechanism of the oxidation of cellulose consists of an attack on the surface , followed by an inward progressing attack on succeeding layers . If the oxidation is accompanied by chain splitting , the outer layers will have shorter chains than the inner layers . The outer layers will also have more aldehyde and carboxyl groups than the inner layers . This mechanism is analogous to the acid hydrolysis of cellulose ( page 133 ) , and we must then conclude that oxycellulose is a heterogeneous , complex mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unoxidized cellulose , the highest oxidation products being on the surface . REACTIONS OF OXYCELLULOSE On the basis of the structure of cellulose , oxycellulose should contain the carbonyl groups of aldehydes and ketones , carboxyl groups , and shorter chains . The aldehyde portion should make it a reducing agent ; both aldehyde and ketone groups should give to oxycellulose the usual carbonyl reactions ; the carboxyl groups should make it behave like an acid ; and the presence of shorter chains should result in cuprammonium solutions with lower viscosities . . There are four reactions of oxycellulose which show the presence of aldehyde group . First and most important is the reaction with Fehling 's solution , in which oxycellulose reduces Fehling 's solution and precipitates cuprous oxide ( page 38 ) . The determination of copper numbers is based on this reaction . One might think that the size of the copper number would be a measure of the amount of oxygen consumed during oxidation , but this is not always true . Some oxycelluloses give copper numbers that are much lower than would be expected . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ketone sugars in which the ketone group is adjacent to a secondary  | alcohol group will reduce Fehling 's solution , and so part of the reducing property of oxycellulose may be due to the oxidation of either 2 or 3 secondary alcohol groups in the anhydroglucose ring . We may use the Fehling 's solution reaction for detecting the presence of overbleached areas on cotton goods . The reaction of oxycellulose with alkali is a complex one , and there has been some confusion regarding the alkali stability of oxidized cellulose . Unruh and Kenyon9 divide oxycelluloses into three types : 1 . Those that have the same glucosidic structure as the original cellulose and yet are soluble in NaOH , owing to their short chain length . These are the alkali-susceptible type . 2 . The alkali-soluble type , in which the degree of polymerization is comparable with the original cellulose but the COOH content is high . 3 . Those that dissolve in NaOH by fragmentation caused by alkaline decomposition of glucose units and the changed structure ( during oxidation ) . These are the alkali-sensitive type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3% ) NaOH , it is colored a golden yellow . This reaction is characteristic of the simple reducing sugars and therefore is evidence of the existence of aldehyde groups in oxycellulose . On longer boiling with NaOH , part of the oxycellulose dissolves , and the solution has reducing properties . This seems to mean that the alkali solubility of slightly oxidized cellulose may be due to aldehyde groups . This has been proved true at least in periodic acid oxycellulose , by Davidson , " Rutherford , Miner , Martin and Harris , " and Goldfinger , Mark , and Siggia . " In the early stages of periodic acid oxidation , it appears that all of the alkali sensitivity can be attributed to the dialdehyde , and , in fact , when these aldehyde groups are converted into carboxyl groups , the alkali sensitivity disappears . This periodic acid oxycellulose has been stabilized by Reeves " by treating the material with sodium chlorite at a pH of 4 . On the other hand , the alkali solubility of nitrogen dioxide oxycellulose seems to be a function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these oxycelluloses are oxidized far beyond the early stages . When cotton is oxidized with hypochlorites , the alkali solubility runs parallel to the oxygen consumption expressed in grams oxygen used per gram of cotton.14 The presence of aldehyde groups in oxycellulose can be demonstrated by means of Schiff 's reagent if the oxidation is sufficient . This is not a very sensitive test , but if cotton is badly overbleached it will form a pink color with Schiff 's reagent . If oxycellulose contains carboxyl groups it should behave like a weak organic acid . This has been demonstrated in various ways , most of which can be used for determining the number or percentage of COOH groups in oxycellulose . These methods can be divided into four groups : direct titration , indirect titration , decarboxylation , and basic dye absorption . The carboxyl groups in oxycellulose can be determined by titrating an aqueous suspension of the solid with 0.01 N NaOH , using phenolphthalein as an indicator . As hydrocellulose has a reducing property just like oxycellulose , one can not distinguish between these two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper number . However , direct titration seems to offer such a possibility . The percentage of COOH groups in hydrocellulose has been found to be much smaller ( about the same as unmodified cellulose ) than in oxycellulose . A modification of direct titration can be used with oxycelluloses having a high COOH content , such as some of the nitrogen dioxide oxycelluloses . Since they are completely soluble in NaOH , they may be dissolved in a measured excess of standard NaOH , and the excess alkali titrated with standard acid . These high COOH oxycelluloses may also be dissolved in pyridine and the solution titrated directly with standard NaOH . Neale and Stringfellow , " from theoretical considerations , claim that direct titration in the presence of a large excess of NaCl gives more exact results . An indirect titration method has been suggested by Ludtke in which oxycellulose is treated with an excess of calcium acetate . The presence of a large concentration of acetate ions forces the liberation of acetic acid in an amount equivalent to the amount 14 Hartsuch and Alvord , unpublished . 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .  | of carboxyl in the oxycellulose , according to the following equation : 2RCOOH + Ca(OAc)2 ? - ( RCOO ) 2Ca + 2HOAc The acetic acid can then be titrated with standard NaOH . This method has been modified and improved by Yackel and Kenyon . " Oxycellulose can be decarboxylated by boiling with a 12% solution of HC1 , liberating CO2 in an amount equivalent to the carboxyl content . Simultaneously with the liberation of CO2 a certain amount of furfural is obtained , but it is not formed in stoichiometric amounts and can not be used for determining the carboxyl content of oxycellulose . However , the yield of CO2 is quantitative and is a direct measure of COOH groups . Because of this we have another method for distinguishing between hydrocellulose and oxycellulose . Heuser and Stockigt17 found that cotton and hydrocellulose contain from 0.03 to 0.04% COOH groups , whereas various oxycelluloses which they investigated ran from 0.6 to 1.3% COOH groups . More extensive oxidation would of course give larger yields of CO2 . When oxycellulose is treated with dilute solutions of basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The basic dyes are in solution as salts of very weak acids and hence will react with carboxyl groups in oxycellulose , so that an amount of dye equivalent to the carboxyl content is absorbed . The dyestuff most used for this purpose is methylene blue , and the methylene blue number of oxidized cellulose is important for evaluating the extent of oxidation to the carboxyl stage . Hydrocellulose will not absorb as much methylene blue as oxycellulose . Shorter average chain length in oxycellulose can be shown by the lower viscosities of cuprammonium solutions , and by the complete solubility of highly oxidized cellulose in alkali . There is no straight-line relation between viscosity and alkali solubility , but in general those oxycelluloses with low viscosities have high ( or complete ) alkali solubilities . Another property of oxycellulose that is of practical use is its behavior when heated . Like hydrocellulose , it scorches more easily than unmodified cotton . Hydrocellulose shows scorch at about 110 ? C , oxycellulose at about 140 ? C , and cotton at 170 ? C.  | TYPES OF OXYCELLULOSE The work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ othersl8 working in the laboratories of the British Cotton Industry Research Association established the fact that there are two definite types of oxycellulose , the characteristics of which depend upon the pH of the oxidizing solution . In their extensive investigation they worked under controlled conditions of concentration , pH , time , and temperature . They studied various oxidizing agents , e.g. , chlorine water , potassium permanganate , and alkaline hypobromite , using five different concentrations but the same amount of total available oxygen for each oxidizing agent . The weight of cotton used and the volume and concentrations of solutions were adjusted so that , when the entire oxidizing power of each reagent was used up , it would correspond to an oxygen consumption of 0.032 , 0.064 , 0.096 , 0.16 , and 0.32 per cent , based on the weight of dry cotton . This would result in considerably overbleached cotton , as the usual consumption of oxygen in commercial bleaching is about 0.02% . After the oxidations were completed , the properties of the oxycelluloses were studied , the ones in which we are interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solubility . It was found in general that the chlorine water oxycelluloses had high copper numbers and high alkali solubility with a large amount of yellow color , but the methylene blue absorption was relatively low . On the other hand , the oxycelluloses prepared by oxidation with alkaline hypobromite had high methylene blue numbers but low copper numbers , low alkali solubility , and only a small amount of yellow color . The properties of the permanganate oxycelluloses were intermediate . Some actual results obtained after an oxygen consumption of 0.32% are given herewith . Copper Methylene figure  | boiled with alkali is determined by the copper number . Thus , those with high copper numbers lose much more weight than those with high methylene blue numbers . It is interesting to note the effect of alkali boiling on the copper numbers and methylene blue numbers of the okycelluloses produced in alkaline medium ( those with high methylene blue numbers and low copper numbers ) . A particular one Which had a copper number of 0.5 and a methylene blue numbet of 2.95 was refluxed for eight hours with 2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the figure methylene blue nutnber was 2.67 . This shows that the methylene blue number is affected very little by alkali boiling , but the copper number is very greatly diminished , so much so that one could not distinguish the residue from alkali boiling from the original unoxidized cellulose . In the study of the effect of hydrogen ion concentration on the properties of oxye llulose , Birtwell et al . used a solution of sodium hypochlorite of Stich strength that its complete reduction was equivalent to 0.32 ' 4 oxygen consumption based on the dry weight of cotton used in the experiment . The solutions of sodium hypochlorite were suitably buffered so that a wide range of pH was obtained , running from 1.0 to 13 . The proper amount of cotton and oxidizing solution was put into jars and kept at 25 ? C until the entire amount of oxygen ( 0.32% ) had been consumed . The time required varied from 2 to 14 days . The copper number and methylene blue number of the oxycelluloses prepared in this way are given in ' Iable 20. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the pH , and the shape of the two curves shows the oppositeness of the two types of oxycellulose . Note that the maximum of one is on the acid side and the maximum of the other is on the alkaline side . For example , the maximum in the copper number curve is at pH 2-4 , whereas the maximum on the methylene blue number curve is at pH 9-11 . On the copper curve , the value at pII of 12 is decidedly out of line . Aside from this one discrepancy , each curve has a maximum on each side of which the values decrease . figure Note that in both types of oxycellulose the greatest change in the two numbers , that is , the change from maximum to minimum , occurs in the narrow range of pH between 5 and 9 . Note also that the two curves cross at approximately the neutral point ( pH 7 ) . Suppose cotton has consumed more than 0.32% oxygen . Both numbers would then be larger , and if the oxidation were carried out at a pH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxidation . But if the pH of the oxidizing solution were off the neutral point only a small amount , the determination of one number would not be sufficient to indicate the extent of oxidation , and both values would have to be determined . When the analyst is required to investigate cloth damage that may have been due to oxidation , he should always determine both copper number and methylene blue number . In their investigation of the rate of hypochlorite oxidation of  | cotton , Clibbens and Ridge19 made valuable contributions to the chemistry of bleaching . They treated cotton with solutions of sodium hypochlorite suitably buffered so as to have a range of pH values from 1 to 13 . They determined the time required for the consumption of one-half of the available chlorine and took that as a measure of the rate of oxidation . The results are shown in Table 21 and the accompanying diagram . figure Let us see what this diagram tells us . We see that hypochlorite oxidation in a very strongly alkaline solution ( pH 13 ) is very slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alkalinity is decreased from pH 13 to pH 11 . Then the rate remains about the same until a pH of 9 is reached , after which the rate increases until it reaches its maximum at the neutral point ( pH 7 ) . If we start with the strongly acid hypochlorite ( pH 2 ) , the same type of change is seen to occur . The slowest rate is at a pH of 4 , and then , as the acidity decreases , the rate increases until it again reaches a maximum at the neutral point . The range of pH in technical liquors used for bleaching cotton is from 5 to 9.5 . Table 21 and the diagrammatic curve tell us that in this range one encounters the fastest rates of reaction , and thus the possibility of damage by overbleaching is great . Any proper control of  | hypochlorite bleaching should rigidly avoid allowing the bath to become neutral . That is , commercial bleachers must keep away from the neutral point , and the control of the pH of bleach liquors is becoming more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing discussion on types of oxycellulose . There are two types : ( a ) the reducing type , which is formed by oxidation in acid medium and is characterized by high copper numbers , great alkali solubility , large amount of yellow color , and figure low methylene blue absorptions ; and ( b ) the nonreducing or carboxyl type , which is formed by hypochlorite oxidation in alkaline medium and is characterized by high methylene blue absorption , low copper numbers , and low alkali solubility with small amounts of yellow color formation . Further conclusions are that , for the same oxygen consumption , different oxidizing agents yield oxycelluloses with different properties , and that the rate of oxidation is a function of the pH of the oxidizing liquor . ESTERS OF CELLULOSE We shall discuss the nitrates ( formerly important in rayon manufacture and still important in the field of explosives ) , the acetates ( important in the manufacture of acetate rayon , such as Celanese ) , and the xanthates ( used for making viscose rayon , which is produced in far greater amount than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as derivatives of acids , either mineral or organic , in which the acid hydrogen has been replaced by some  | figure In our study of the hydrolysis and oxidation of cellulose , we emphasized the topochemical nature of the reaction . The same thing is true of the esterification of cellulose with acids or acid anhydrides . In order for esterification to take place , it is necessary for the reagent to come into contact with alcohol groups . This is complicated in the esterification of cellulose because of its micellular , chain-bundle structure . Alcohol groups on the surface of micelles or in the outer layer of cotton fibers may be reacted easily because they are exposed , but it is conceivable that further esterification may be slowed up or even prevented because of the inability of the reagent to reach interior alcohol groups . If an extensive reaction is desired , something must be done to open up the interior and make the interior alcohol groups more accessible . This can be accomplished by the use of swelling agents , such as strong sulfuric acid or salts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , the esterification may take place almost simultaneously at all points . All efficient methods for the preparation of cellulose esters make use of so-called starters or activators , which are usually good swelling agents . THE NITRATES OF CELLULOSE At the top of this page is shown the esterification of nitric acid with a simple monohydric alcohol , but if the alcohol were to have three OH groups , a similar reaction would take place , the only difference being that three molecules of HNO3 would take part in the reaction . This can be shown in the reaction between nitric acid and glycerol : C31I5(OH)3 + 3HONO2 ( C3H5(ONO2)3 + 3HOH  | Note two things about this reaction : ( 1 ) it is reversible , so that the formation of ester will cease when sufficient water has been formed , and ( 2 ) one molecule of water is formed for each OH group reacting . In the actual preparation of esters of nitric acid , some dehydrating agent is always used to remove the water formed during the reaction . As cellulose contains three OH groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we do glycerol . If we write the anhydroglucose unit C6H1005 , so as to show the three OH groups , it will be C611702(OH)3 , and the equation will be // Correctly speaking , the product should be called cellulose trinitrate , and the reaction , esterification . However , the common name for the product is nitrocellulose , and the reaction is called nitration . This is not correct because nitration is a reaction by which nitro groups , NO2 , are introduced . The group introduced into the cellulose molecule is the nitrate group ( ONO2 ) , and the product should be thought of as a nitrate of cellulose or cellulose trinitrate . However , the incorrect names are so widely used that they will appear frequently in this book . Let us look at the situation that exists in a reaction mixture in which cellulose is being nitrated with concentrated nitric acid , with concentrated sulfuric acid as a dehydrating agent . In the first place , the reaction is a slow one , and it is inconceivable that all three of the cellulose OH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must consider that the first product is a mononitrate in which only one OH group has been acted upon . As the reaction progresses a dinitrate will be formed , and finally a trinitrate . These reactions are shown below . C6H7O2(OH) 3 + HONO2 C6H702(OH)2(ONO2) + HOH ( the mononitrate ) C6H7O2(OH)2(ONO2) + HONO2 Ems ? CsH7O2(OH) ( ONO2 ) 2 + 1101I ( the dinitrate ) C6H702(OH) ( ONO2 ) 2 + HONO2 C6H702(ONO2) 3 + HOH ( the trinitrate ) The reaction is carried out in the presence of a large excess of acids that may hydrolyze the esters , thus converting trinitrates into dinitrates , etc . This would occur if the reaction mixture  | were too hot or if it were allowed to stand for too long a time . There is also a chance that oxidation might take place , because nitric acid is an oxidizing agent . It is seen that the product of the nitration of cellulose will be a complex mixture . The extent of nitration of cellulose is expressed in terms of the percentage of nitrogen in the product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecular weight of 297 , of which 42 grams is nitrogen ( 3 X 14 ) . Then 42 = 297 is 14.1% . The three nitrates are mono- = 6.8% N , di- = 11.1% N , and trinitrate =-14.1% N. These are the nitrogen contents of the pure nitrates , but it should be clear that no cellulose nitrate is a pure compound . They are all mixtures of mono- , di- , and trinitrates , but they all have certain percentages of nitrogen . The different cellulose nitrates are used for various purposes , and manufacturers of these commercial products have found that a specific , fairly narrow range of nitrogen content is necessary for each particular product . Therefore , controls are imposed on the manufacturing operations so that the product is reproducible ; that is , it will always have about the same nitrogen content . For example , nitrocellulose ( guncotton ) , used in explosives , contains 12.5 to 13.7% N ; that used for making lacquers , 11.5 to 12.2% N ; and that used in various plastics , from 10.5 to 11.5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1865 , but was put to no commercial use until 1903 , when the Miles patents were granted ( page 154 ) . After that time it began to take a small place in the industrial field , but very little development was made until World War I , when it was found that " dopes " of cellulose acetate applied to the wings of airplanes left a very good protective coating . Large acetylating plants were built to produce this material . At the close of the war it was necessary to find new uses and new markets for cellulose acetate . So successful were these efforts that today we find this cellulose derivative being manufactured in huge amounts for use in various fields such as rayon , plastics , films , adhesives , lacquers , shatterproof glass , etc . Of these fields , rayon is by far the most important , and about 75% of the supply of cellulose acetate is used in the manufacture of rayon . Cellulose acetate is an ester of cellulose and acetic acid in which  | the three OH groups of cellulose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogens of cellulose have been substituted by acetyl groups ) . The esters of cellulose and organic acids are prepared by a general reaction known as acylation , and the reagent used is called an acylating agent . When we go from the general to the particular , to make acetyl cellulose ( cellulose acetate ) , the reaction is called acetylation and the reagent an acetylating agent . Acetic anhydride is the only acetylating agent to be used in the manufacture of cellulose acetate . The reaction is shown below : C6H702(OH)3 + 3(CH3CO)20 = C6H702(OCOCH3)3 + 3CH3COOH We immediately see a difference between this reaction and the one by which cellulose nitrate is formed . In the present reaction , water is not a product , so that the reaction does not reverse . Furthermore , there is no strong acid present which will hydrolyze either cellulose acetate or cellulose . For these reasons the system is not sensitive to small differences in the concentration of reactants , and the reaction should go straight through to the formation of the triacetate , with very little of the mono- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to obtain a uniform acetate of low acetyl content which is either the mono- or diacetate . The acetylation of cotton with acetic anhydride is even more of a topochemical reaction than nitration . The attack starts with the exposed OH groups on the surface of the cotton fiber , and must then progress inward . However , this progress is very slow unless the cotton has been pretreated with some swelling agent to open it up and make it more pervious , and permit the acylating agent to make contact with interior OH groups . Sometimes such an agent is incorporated in the acylating bath , but cellulose acetate can be made in a shorter time and more uniformly if the cotton is swollen before being acetylated . The convention for expressing the extent of acetylation , or the analysis of a commercial acetate , is in terms of the percentage of acetic acid , or the percentage of acetyl . For example , the triacetate is C6H702(OCOCH3)3 , with a molecular weight of 288 , and even though there is no acetic acid in it , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acetic acid ( wt 3 X 60 = 180 ) . One hundred eighty is 62.5% of 288 , and so we say that  | the triacetate contains 62.5% CH3COOH . In a similar way we can calculate the acetic acid content of the diacetate to be 48% , and of the monoacetate 29% . Let us write the formula for the triacetate C6H7O5(COCH3)3 to show three acetyl groups with a total weight of 129 , which is 44.8% of 288 . Thus the acetyl content of completely acetylated cellulose is 44.8% , of the diacetate 35% , and of the monoacetate 21.1% . There are two general methods for determining the acetic acid content of cellulose acetate , each of which has its modifications for special purposes . The distillation method of Ost and Katayama , 20 modified by Hess , 21 consists of adding an excess of H2SO4 to the acetate , allowing it to stand , and then distilling off the acetic acid which is liberated . The distillate is titrated with standard alkali to determine the amount of acetic acid . The saponification or alkaline method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , after the saponification is complete , the unused alkali is titrated . The alkali disappearing in the saponification is equivalent to the acetic acid in the acetate . The more recent modifications of this method are due to Genung and Mallatt22 and to Howlett and Martin.23 Three materials are necessary for the preparation of cellulose acetate : an acetylating agent ( always acetic anhydride ) , a starter ( catalyst ) , and a diluent ( a liquid reaction medium ) . The purpose of the acetylating agent is obvious ; the starter must be a swelling and peptizing agent that will activate the cellulose ; the diluent may be a liquid which will dissolve cellulose acetate , or it may be a liquid in which the acetate is insoluble . As we have a choice , we can prepare two types of cellulose acetate . If cotton is acetylated in a diluent such as benzene , the cellulose acetate will be insoluble . The product will retain the same fibrous form as the original cotton , and we shall have a fibrous acetate . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve the cellulose acetate as fast as it is formed . If this solution is diluted with water , the solvent property of acetic acid will be destroyed , and the acetate will precipitate in an amorphous flake form . The fibrous acetate may be used in the academic study of cellulose  | acetate , but the amorphous acetate is the only one that is manufactured industrially . When cotton is acetylated under any conditions it is more or less degraded . This can be shown by the decrease in the viscosity degradation and produce shorter chains . When sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst , the degree of polymerization of the acetate is only about 15 ? 20% of the original cotton . A few statements should be made about the rate of acylation of cotton with acetic anhydride , and the factors that govern it . One of these is the moisture content of the cotton to be acetylated . Experiments carried out by Elod and Schmidt-Beilenberg24 with dry cotton , air-dry cotton , and moist cotton in the presence of benzene showed that the time required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the other periods . After about twelve hours , cellulose acetates with the following acetic acid contents were obtained from cotton with the designated moisture contents : 62.5% acetic acid from cotton with 24.4% H2O 22% acetic acid from cotton with 6.7% H2O 10% acetic acid from cotton with 0.1% H2O It is thought that water in excess of the normal moisture content of cotton opens up the micellar structure of the cotton and permits the acylating liquid to penetrate more easily and thus react more rapidly . On this assumption , any swelling agent should bring about the same increase in rate of reaction . Acetic acid is a fairly good preswelling agent ; it will increase the rate of acetylation about tenfold . Other agents are sulfuric acid and zinc chloride . Commercial cellulose triacetate is known as primary acetate . It is an amorphous white solid insoluble in water , in dilute acetic acid , in acetone , and in most of the common organic solvents . It will dissolve in chloroform , glacial acetic acid , tetrachloroethane , nitrobenzene , aniline , and pyridine . Chloroform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filaments , but they are weak and brittle and unsuitable for technical purposes . HIowever , the primary acetate can be converted into a form that is entirely suitable for a great many uses . The process for such  | conversion was discovered and patented by Miles25 in 1903-1904 . Miles prepared the triacetate in the usual way in glacial acetic acid , but after acetylation was complete , instead of precipitating the acetate from the glacial acetic acid solution , he added a 50% solution of acetic acid containing some sulfuric acid ( this is not dilute enough to precipitate the acetate ) and allowed it to stand at 50 ? C for 12 to 14 hours , after which cellulose acetate was precipitated by diluting the solution with water . Miles called this product a secondary acetate . Secondary cellulose acetate has different properties from the primary acetate , most important of which is the fact that it will dissolve in acetone . Miles ' secondary acetate has a great advantage over the primary acetate . In the first place , it is soluble in a cheap solvent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acetone solution in filament form , it is soft , flexible , and strong enough to be used as a textile fiber . It was the first really synthetic fiber to be used in textiles . Cellulose acetates suitable for different purposes contain different amounts of acetyl groups . As a group , the acetone-soluble acetates contain 35.8 to 41.5% acetyl . Those used for making films contain 39.4% to 41.6% acetyl , those for rayon contain 38 to 39.4% acetyl , and those used for plastics 36.5 to 38% acetyl . When these acetates for special purposes are manufactured , no effort is made to acetylate cellulose to any special extent . For example , if acetate is being made for rayon manufacture , the process is not controlled to put just 38.5% acetyl into the product . All efforts to do this have proved unsuccessful . Instead , cellulose is acetylated completely and then deacetylated to the desired acetyl content . It is this deacetylation that is brought about by the Miles reaction . Formerly it was thought that the acetone solubility of the secondary acetate was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a process of chain shortening , but these ideas have been discarded . The question has never been definitely settled , but it is probable that the new solubility properties of the secondary acetate are due to deacetylation , with the accompanying liberation of primary alcohol groups in the carbon 6 position.2fi They demonstrated that deacetylation processes remove acetyl groups from the 6 and the 2 and 3 positions in about equal amounts , and concluded that the acetone solubility  | depends upon the average numerical amount of acetyl groups per glucose unit and their distribution . It is probable that direct acetylation to 38% acetyl group blocks too many primary alcohol groups , so that the product , even though it has the proper percentage of acetyl groups , does not have enough unacetylated primary alcohol groups . The necessity for free primary alcohol groups in acetone-soluble secondary acetates seems to be confirmed by the fact that this solubility is very much decreased by heating the secondary acetate with glacial acetic acid . The supposition is that primary alcohol groups are re-esterified by this treatment . CELLULOSE XANTIIATE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not more so , as the two cellulose esters just discussed . This is especially true from the textile chemist 's point of view , because about 65% of the world 's supply of rayon is made by the regeneration of cellulose from cellulose xanthate ( see page 221 ) . It is used to a much smaller extent for other purposes , such as films , artificial sponges , bottle caps , and casings for packing ground meat , but by far the most important use is in the field of rayon manufacture . Cellulose xanthate was discovered by Cross and Bevan in 1892 . They found that it could be dissolved in dilute NaOH to form a thick viscous solution to which they gave the name viscose . Later it was found that filaments of regenerated cellulose could be made by passing streams of viscose into acid coagulating baths . Eventually such filaments were put on the market as artificial silk under the name viscose silk . Today we know that the production of viscose rayon exceeds the combined production of all other rayons . Before starting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nomenclature of the subject . In the first place , we are considering it as an ester of cellulose . In textile chemistry literature , it is often designated as the cellulose ester of xanthogenic acid ( or xanthic acid ) , but if we look at the structure of xanthogenic acid we shall find that such a designation is incorrect . figure  | The accompanying formula is the general one for xanthogenic acid , in which R may be any simple alkyl group , such as C2115 . Thus the name xanthogenic acid is applied to any acid having this general formula . Note that the acid hydrogen of xanthogenic acid is attached to sulfur . Therefore , an ester of xanthogenic acid would be a compound in which this hydrogen has been replaced by an alcohol radical , such as ethyl , C2H5 ; butyl , C4H9 ; or cellulose , C6H904 . But in viscose we find the C6H904 group attached to oxygen instead of sulfur , and we note that it exists as a sodium salt in which a sodium atom is attached to sulfur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dithiocarbonic acid instead of xanthogenic acid . Let us look at the relations among carbonic acid , dithiocarbonic acid , and viscose . The syllable thio means sulfur in place of oxygen , and the first two of the following formulas show the two acids : figure ( ester of dithiocarbonic acid ) ( sodium salt of cellulose ester of dithiocarbonic acid , or sodium cellulose dithiocarbonate viscose ) The last formula shows viscose to be the sodium salt of an ester of dithiocarbonic acid , but it is also seen that it is the sodium salt of one of the xanthogenic acids ( cellulose xanthogenic acid ) . Since xanthogenic acid is also called xanthic acid , viscose is the sodium salt of xanthic acid , or a xanthate . Therefore a shorter name , and one most commonly used , is cellulose xanthate , but when considered as an ester it is the cellulose ester of dithiocarbonic acid . When cellulose is converted into viscose it functions as an alcohol . Let us see how the xanthate of a simple alcohol is made ; then it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol is treated with solid NaOH or a strong solution of NaOH , an alcoholate is formed as shown : figure Even though C2H5ONa is easily hydrolyzed there may be a small amount in the equilibrium mixture ; at least we shall assume this , and add CS2 to the mixture . The double bonds of CS2 remind us of the carbonyl groups of aldehyde and ketones , one important property of which is the formation of addition compounds ( with alcohols to form hemiacetals ) . Let sodium ethylate add to CS2 , the sodium going to S and OC2H5 going to C : figure This product is a xanthate of ethyl alcohol . Now let us extend this to cellulose . There is evidence that only one of the three OH groups known to be present in each glucose unit of cellulose is xanthated , and so we shall write the formula for cellulose as C6H9040H . In the Cross and Bevan method for making cellulose xanthate , loose cellulose ( or sheet form cellulose ) is steeped in 18% NaOH until thoroughly saturated . " The material is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of cellulose . We can assume that we now have alkali cellulose ( analogous to sodium ethylate ) , C6H9O4ONa . Next , it is aged until it has the consistency of crumbs and is then treated with carbon disulfide , to form cellulose xanthate : figure At this point the solid mass looks like deep orange-colored crumbs . This color change can be used for determining the completion of the xanthation reaction . If crumbs are broken open and the  | interior portions have the same deep orange color as the exterior surface , the xanthation is complete . Cellulose xanthate made in this way is soluble in water and more soluble in dilute NaOH . If it is dissolved in dilute NaOH a thick , viscous , deep orange-colored solution called viscose is obtained . In the manufacture of rayon this solution is allowed to ripen for several days , after which it is extruded into an acid coagulating bath , which regenerates cellulose in the form of a filament . The difference between viscose and viscose rayon should be made clear . Viscose is a thick viscous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rayon is regenerated cellulose made by the viscose process , or cellulose regenerated from viscose by acid coagulation . The chemistry of the xanthation of cellulose , as described on the preceding pages , appears to be quite simple , but the facts are that it is far from simple , and the most rigid controls must be maintained if an acceptable product is to be made . The over-all equilibrium in the system is quite sensitive and susceptible to small changes of conditions . In addition , side reactions can take place , which not only disturb the equilibrium in the main reaction but also decompose the xanthate . Three such reactions are shown here . figure We have discussed the reaction between cellulose , NaOH , and CS2 to make cellulose xanthate , and have seen that xanthate radicals are substituted in place of one OH group of anhydro-  | glucose units , but nothing has been said about how general or how uniform this substitution is . Much work has been done in an effort to arrive at some conclusion about this , but some of the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the following conclusion : the cellulosic substance in viscose solutions shortly after its preparation ( before it is aged ) has the formula shown here . figure This indicates that there is one xanthate group for every two glucose units . Furthermore , they are uniformly distributed over the chains of glucose units in cellulose . The only point that has not been proved is whether every second glucose unit throughout the system is xanthated or whether every unit of alternate chains is xanthated . If cellulose xanthate is an ester , it should be possible to hydrolyze it , for this is a characteristic property of any ester . We know that such hydrolyses with water alone are very slow , but in the presence of either acid or alkali the hydrolysis is greatly accelerated . We also know that the hydrolysis of an ester ( page 42 ) results in the formation of an acid and an alcohol . That is , during hydrolysis of an ester , OH groups which had been blocked ( or substituted ) with acid groups are liberated , and the acid group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected to any hydrolytic conditions , xanthate groups should be split off and cellulosic OH groups regenerated . A simple equation for this is figure The monosodium dithiocarbonic acid immediately decomposes into CS2 and NaOH . It would seem that if viscose solutions were allowed to stand ( especially in the presence of air containing carbonic acid ) , hy-  | drolysis would take place and cellulose would be regenerated . However , let us think about the problem in the converse way , i.e. , during such hydrolysis of viscose , xanthate groups would be split off . This is the way in which we shall want to discuss the chemical reactions that take place during the ripening of viscose . When cellulose xanthate is being manufactured for commercial use , the ripening procedure or step is perhaps the most important one , because the characteristics of the cellulose which will be regenerated after ripening are dependent upon the reactions that take place during ripening . The changes that take place during ripening are rather complicated , but we can divide them into two types , changes in the colloidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Viewed from the chemical standpoint , ripening is a hydrolytic reaction that is the reverse of xanthation . During xanthation xanthate groups are put on , and during ripening they are taken off . Thus the ripening period is a time during which cellulose xanthate gradually loses its xanthate groups and approaches the composition of the original cellulose . ACTION OF ALKALI ON CELLULOSE Whereas cellulose is very sensitive to the action of mineral acids ( even very dilute acids ) and oxidizing agents , it is quite resistant to alkalies , even strong caustic alkalies at high temperature and pressure . And yet we can not say that nothing happens when cellulose is treated with caustic alkali , because something very definite does happen . Based on such a reaction is one of the most important processes used in the textile industry , the mercerization of cotton . It is well known that cotton fibers swell to a small extent when they are immersed in water . This is the beginning of the process of dispersion in which the structural units of cellulose are forced farther and farther apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with cuprammonium hydroxide , we say it dissolves ( so completely is it dispersed that it appears to be in solution ) . When cellulose is treated with a 2% solution of NaOH , the swelling is slightly greater than when it is immersed in water , but not much more . The amount of swelling increases slowly as the concentration of NaOH is increased , until , when 14 to 18% NaOH solutions are used , the swelling becomes very significant and reaches a  | maximum value in about 23% NaOH . If the action of 18% NaOH on a single cotton fiber is observed under a microscope , a series of astonishing physical changes are seen to take place . The spiral twists of the cotton fiber uncoil until all of the convolutions disappear . At the same time , the fiber shrinks and becomes thicker . A cross-section microphotograph of the fiber would show that the lumen ( central canal ) has contracted until it is almost a point . When these changes are extended to the behavior of cotton yarn or cloth , we encounter results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has been a great amount of speculation , resulting from a large number of studies , as to whether a real chemical compound is formed when NaOH acts upon cellulose . There is no doubt that cellulose takes NaOH out of solution and absorbs it preferentially , and there are three possible types of product that might result from such removal of NaOH . The product may be ( a ) a real chemical compound formed by a chemical reaction , with definite proportions of cellulose and NaOH ; ( b ) an addition compound , in which NaOH molecules are added to cellulose in definite amounts ; ( c ) a substance in which NaOH is merely absorbed by cellulose . It is beyond the scope of this book to go into all the pros and cons of this argument , but a few brief statements may be made , about it . The first possibility can probably be ruled out because an alcoholate is almost 100% hydrolyzed by water , and so a compound such as C6H702(ONa)3 could not exist in the presence of water . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when cellulose is added to sodium dissolved in liquid ammonia . This is like the action of sodium on alcohol which evolves hydrogen and forms an alcoholate . ) As to the second and third possibilities , opinions differ greatly . One group of workers thinks that a definite addition compound is formed , and the consensus of opinion is that this compound has the formula ( C6H1005 ) 2NaOH . That is , cellulose in 16 to 18% NaOH adds on 1 NaOH for each 2 glucose units . The other group of investigators , using different experimental techniques , claims that the product is only an absorption compound with no definite molar proportions . 28  | If alkali cellulose or soda cellulose , produced by the action of strong alkali on cellulose , is washed with large amounts of water , a product is obtained that is the same as native cellulose chemically , but is quite different physically . These new properties are ( 1 ) increased strength , ( 2 ) increased luster under certain conditions , ( 3 ) increased absorption of water , ( 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iodine , and ( 5 ) increased solubility in cuprammonium hydroxide .

Wool was used in cold northern countries in almost prehistoric times , but in the tropical countries cotton was the important textile fiber . From about 1500 r3.c. to 1500 A.D. , India was the center of the world 's cotton industry , and the writings of early explorers are filled with exaggerated descriptions of the fine cotton fabrics made in India . Cotton was introduced into Japan and China from India as early as 800 A.D. , but extensive cultivation and use of cotton in these countries did not begin until about the thirteenth century . Cotton manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been imported much earlier than that . Cotton was being cultivated and used for clothing in America at the time of its discovery by Columbus , but the first organized cultivation by whites was begun by Virginia colonists in 1621 . For the next 150 years cotton cloth in this country was homespun , but in 1787 a mill was built in Beverly , Mass. , where cotton cloth was manufactured . Although cotton is cultivated in almost every country in the world having a mild climate , the production in the United States is so large that American cotton dominates the world market , and the cotton exchanges in this country set the price of cotton . Other countries that are large producers of cotton are Egypt , India , and China . The cotton plant ( or shrub ) belongs to the family Gossypium , and the varieties of cotton are different species of this family , e.g. , ordinary American upland cotton is Gossypium hirsutunn ; Indian cotton is G. herbaceum ; and sea island , Egyptian , and Peruvian cottons are G. barbadense . The cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with flowers which develop into capsules about the 164  | size of a walnut . These capsules contain four to eight seeds , from the epidermis of which two kinds of fibers are appended.l The two kinds of fibers are known as lint fiber ( the longer type used for spinning ) and linters ( the shorter type used for stuffing and for commercial manufacture into products such as rayon and explosives ) . Lint fibers begin to grow on the day of flowering , and linters about 10 days later . Incipient growth is recognized by a slight swelling or bulging of the cells in the seed coat . After this , a slow elongation begins which lasts for 15 to 20 days after flowering . During the elongation period , the cotton fiber consists of a hollow tube with a thin shell or wall of primary cellulose ; this tube is enclosed in a protective sack or cuticle that contains the natural fats and waxes . At the end of the elongation period , the tube closes at the tip , after which lint fibers begin to deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner wall is thickened by layer after layer of cellulose , one layer each day for about 25 days . This decreases the size of the lumen ( central canal running lengthwise of the fiber ) until it becomes very small . During growth the fibers are cylindrical , but when they reach maturity ( ripen ) they collapse and form a flat , ribbon-like fiber with a spiral twist ( convolutions ) in it . These twists constitute an important factor in the spinning quality of the cotton . If the interior layers of cotton do not develop properly and are incompletely formed during growth , the fiber will appear as a thin-walled ribbon with no twist . This so-called dead cotton is undesirable because of its poor spinning quality and its resistance to dyes . Cotton linters is often thought of as very short staple fibers formed by the breaking of lint fibers during ginning , but this is not correct . It is true that much of the fiber in commercial linters has been formed in this way , but the true linters is the fuzz on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers are darker , coarser , and shorter than lint fibers . They are rarely longer than % inch and are about 20 microns in diameter . They are more cylindrical than lint fibers and have thinner walls . After the cotton has ripened , the seeds , with their covering of fibers , are put through a cotton gin , which separates the longer lint fibers and leaves the seed covered with linters ; the linters is removed by a different procedure . The lint fibers are pressed into bales for sale and transportation to mills . Production of  | cotton in the United States runs into millions of such bales each year . An American bale weighs 500 lb , whereas the Egyptian bale weighs 750 lb and the East Indian bale weighs 400 lb . The fine structure of cotton fiber shows that the inner layers of cellulose consist of fibrils highly oriented ( arranged ) in a spiral fashion around the axis of the fiber , and the micelles of cellulose are arranged parallel to the fibrils . The fibrils are cemented together by an amorphous substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton , on which its use as a textile fiber are based , are due to this fine structure . The high orientation of molecules in the fibrils leads to a good longitudinal strength ; the spiral arrangement permits some elastic elongation ; the amorphous cement allows the fibrils to move slightly in relation to each other during bending and , therefore , leads to a good reversible bending strength . We have already named a botanical classification by which cotton is divided into three varieties . There are others , but they are of minor importance compared with these three . Each of these botanical varieties can be subdivided into commercial varieties based on various factors . For example , the G. barbadense is cultivated in Egypt , Peru , the West Indies , and islands off the southern Atlantic coast . It is reasonable to think that the qualities and properties of cottons grown in such widely separated parts of the world might vary somewhat , even though they belong to the same botanical specie . Differences in soil , climate , elevation of land , method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If cotton is to be used for making yarn and cloth or knit goods , the dimensional characteristics of the fiber are perhaps the most important property to be considered . There are long , medium , and short staple cottons , and fine , medium , and coarse cottons . If yarns are to be spun and used for some particular purpose , a careful selection of fiber must be made . If smooth , uniform yarns are wanted , fine and coarse fibers must not be mixed . If the tensile strength of yarns is to be especially important , short fibers must not be mixed with long fibers . Such things are so important that cotton is often graded as to length in increments of s inch . Tables 22 and 23 contain figures selected from various sources to show the dimensional characteristics of several of the better-known cottons . In Table  | order of their mean lengths . The second column shows the usual minimum and maximum lengths . The third column shows the mean width of the fibers , and the last column gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these fibers . All dimen-figure sional figures are in inches . Table 23 shows the mean total crosssection areas of a few cotton varieties . These figures probably emphasize the difference between fine and coarse cottons better than the figures for mean width . When one kind of cotton has a figure cross-section area two or three times greater than another kind , the difference between yarns made from two such types can be visualized . Another physical characteristic of cotton fibers which has much  | to do with their spinning quality is the amount of spiral twist in the fibers . Cotton fibers are quite short compared with other textile fibers , and yet they can be spun into yarns which have sufficient strength to make fabrics that wear well and give long service . The twist in the individual fibers is responsible for much of this , because it helps the fibers to cling together when they are spun . The number of twists per inch in cotton fibers reported in the literature is quite confusing . However , we can make some general statements about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 , and the arrangement of cottons in order of the decreasing number of twists is Pima , sea island , Egyptian , Brazilian , American , and Indian . PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF COTTON The cotton fiber is a long single cell closed at one end . It resembles a collapsed tube which was twisted as it collapsed , so that it has the appearance of a narrow flat ribbon with spiral twists . A central canal , the lumen , runs through the fiber , and in the cross-section of ripe cotton it looks like a thin irregular loop . In dead cotton , the lumen is practically absent . Such fibers are of low quality because they are weak and brittle , have poor spinning quality , and resist dyes so that they show up as undyed specks in colored goods . Cotton is affected by heat at about 150 ? C , but the effect is not noticeable unless the heat is maintained for a long time . In such instances the copper number increases and the viscosity decreases . At about 170 ? C cotton begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distilled out of contact with air , it chars and decomposes to yield small amounts of gaseous products , alcohol , and acetic acid . At high temperatures in air , cotton burns freely , leaving no bead . It is well known that cotton will absorb moisture from the air and still feel dry . This is characteristic of all substances having large surfaces . If cotton is dried at 110 ? C , it loses weight because of the loss of moisture , but when exposed to air the moisture will be regained . The amount of moisture in cotton depends on two things , the relative humidity and temperature of the air to which it is exposed . The relative humidity is more important than the temperature ; that is , cotton will retain a constant moisture content over narrow ranges of temperature , but small changes in  | humidity affect the moisture content significantly . The moisture content of cotton conditioned at 70 ? F but at different humidities is shown in Table 24 . The variation in moisture content of cotton conditioned at a constant humidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absorption of water by cotton affects some of its physical properties , the most important of which are strength and elongation . Peirce and Stephenson2 worked with single yarns of various counts and determined the strength ( grams required to break the yarns ) and elongation at the break , in atmospheres of different . figure relative humidities . The figures shown in Table 26 are averages of 100 tests after conditioning the yarns at the specified humidities . The original length of each yarn was 20 in . Two additional columns have been included to show the percentage increase in the values as compared with the dry yarns . The figures in Table 26 show that cotton yarns become increas2 J. Textile Inst. , 17 , T645 ( 1926 ) .  | ingly stronger as the moisture content increases , until they are more than one-third stronger . At the same time the elongation increases even more rapidly , so that in atmospheres above about 80% R.H. it has increased 60% . It must be understood that these relationships hold true only for native undegraded cotton . If cotton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than its dry strength . When cotton absorbs large amounts of water or is in contact with water , it shows a decided swelling , and we shall find later in figure this chapter that this is one of the most important factors in the shrinkage of cotton goods . It is thought that water absorption may be both physical and chemical . Physically absorbed water ( moisture ) can be removed by heating cotton for a period of time , but there is still water in the yarn or cloth which requires more radical treatment for its removal . Even a high vacuum and temperature may be necessary . This leads us to think that this tightly held water may be chemically bound to the OH groups of cellulose by some sort of hydrogen bond type of linkage . This idea is supported by the fact that cellulose nitrates or acetates ( in which part of the OH groups are blocked by substitution ) absorb considerably less water than native cotton . On the other hand , mercerized cotton absorbs more moisture . This is probably due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure . Other observations support this conclusion . If cotton is exposed to high humidities at increasing temperatures , there is a rapid increase in the amount of water absorbed when 60 ? C is ruched .  | This is probably due to the swelling of cotton under these conditions , thereby exposing more surface which will absorb more water . When moisture determinations are made in the laboratory , samples of cotton are heated in an oven at 105 ? C for 24 hours . This accomplishes the same thing as drying in a desiccator over   for several days . CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF COTTON Native cotton is the purest form of natural cellulose and is not combined with lignins or pectins , as is the cellulose of flax , jute , hemp , wood , etc . Like all vegetable tissues , it contains a certain small amount of mineral matter which is left as an ash after cotton is burned . The amount of ash is about 1 ? 1.5% , and if it is found to be much greater than that , it is considered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of ash drops to about 0.1% . The mineral matter in cotton consists of chlorides , carbonates , and phosphates of potassium , calcium , and magnesium . Coloring matter in cotton varies so much that no general statement can be made about it . American cotton is quite white , but some Egyptian and Peruvian cottons are brown and brownish red . A small amount of vegetable protein is found in cotton , a little over 1% . The impurity found in the largest amount consists of pectinous materials . These are removed by boiling alkali when cotton is prepared for bleaching . A small amount of fatty material , which is mostly cottonseed oil , is found in raw cotton . It probably comes from cotton seeds which are slightly damaged during ginning . Raw cotton contains about 0.5% of a waxy substance which seems to serve as a protective coating on the surface of the fiber . Cotton wax is insoluble in water , and because of this , raw cotton is very hard to wet . It is well known that unbleached cotton will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax is another impurity that is removed by the alkali boil which precedes bleaching . After cotton is purified , all of these impurities are reduced to a total of about 1% . There are several factors that influence the chemical analysis of raw cotton , but the following figures give a general idea of a sort of average analysis . If the impurities are calculated on an oven-dry basis , the percentage of fiber would be 89.76% , and after careful purification it would run close to 99%. figure Cotton is quite sensitive to the action of dilute mineral acids , but is very little affected by organic acids ( some of which are used with little danger as sours in laundering operations ) . The chemical reaction that takes place is one of hydrolysis , with the formation of a series of hydrocelluloses ( page 134 ) in which cotton is increasingly modified . When cotton is treated with dilute mineral acids , it loses some weight and some strength , gradually becomes brittle , and finally breaks up into a fine powder . We are interested only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or yarn still retains its fibrous form . After this is lost , it is no longer a textile problem . The point of attack on cotton cloth is at the surface , where glycosidic linkages are broken and reducing groups are formed simultaneously . The action of acid progresses inward from the surface , but at a slower rate because the points of attack are less accessible . Part of these products are soluble in hot alkali , and a partially hydrolyzed cloth will lose weight if it is boiled with NaOH . We may use this alkali solubility to follow the progress of the reaction . Since reducing groups are formed by the action of acid on cotton , the course of the reaction may also be followed by means of copper number determinations ( page 135 ) . Another criterion of the course of hydrolysis is the viscosity of cuprammonium solutions of the cotton . The viscosity of such solutions is a measure of the average chain length of the high-polymeric cellulose molecules , and so , if chains are ruptured by acid attack , the average length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we are to study the effect of acids on cotton and be impressed by the necessity for extra care in all operations in which cotton may come into contact with acids , we must first find out how sensitive cotton is to acids . We must answer the question , How small an amount of acid will cause a modification of cotton ?  | After that we shall want to know how the extent of acid attack varies with such factors as time and temperature . Cohen3 determined the smallest concentration of HC1 and H2SO4 which would show a measurable effect when cotton is boiled in the acids for one hour and then dried at different temperatures . Copper numbers and tensile strength were used to test the yarn . Some of the results are shown in the following list . The concentration of the two acids are expressed in grams per liter . These concentrations are the smallest that will show a change in copper number and a reduction in tensile strength . HC1 0.08 gm/1 ( 0.002 N ) dried at 25 ? C 112SO4 0.30 gm/1 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gm/1 ( 0.0007 N ) dried at 100 ? C H2SO4 0.08 gm/1 ( 0.0016 N ) dried at 100 ? C The surprising thing about these results is that HC1 attacks cotton more easily than does H2SO4 , and therefore would damage cotton more readily . This will also be found true in some other work to be quoted later . These two acids in solutions stronger than those listed will always hydrolyze cotton . If the effect of the action of dilute mineral acids on cotton is a cumulative one , the products obtained by longer action should be more degraded and modified . A brilliant and thorough investigation of this whole subject was made by Birtwell , Clibbens , and Geake , 4 in which the acid treatments were such that only a small amount of hydrolysis took place and the visible appearance of the cloth was unchanged . The work is too extensive to review in this book , but it is recommended to any reader who wants a complete discussion of the subject of the mild acid hydrolysis of cotton . More recently Davidson ' extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using stronger solutions of acids . The course of the hydrolysis was followed by determining the loss in weight suffered by the cotton , and the cuprammonium viscosity and alkali solubility of the hydrocellulose formed when cotton was immersed in acids of different strengths at different temperatures . In each instance there was a rapid increase in fluidity in the first few hours of acid treatment , after which the change was much slower and the fluidity leveled off to a constant value . The figure  | solubility in alkali showed the same behavior . One of the most interesting things brought out by the investigation was the fact that HC1 affects cotton much more than H2SO4 . This is shown in Table 27 , where some of Davidson 's results are given . Both acids reach about the same maximum effect as measured by fluidity and alkali solubility , but the HC1 reaches it much sooner than H2SO4 . The fluidity of HC1 hydrocellulose reaches its maximum after about 40 hours acid treatment , whereas H2SO4 hydrocellulose requires about 300 hours . The maximum solubility of HC1 hydrocellulose is reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 500 hours are required . figure Supposing that a cotton cloth has been damaged by acid hydrolysis over a particular area and begins to break and split in this area , what is the chemical picture of the cloth and what are its properties ( some of which may be used to test for hydrocellulose ) ? If the cloth has been damaged that amount , there will be a considerable accumulation of hydrolysis products on the surface , and hydrolysis will have progressed inward to quite an extent . If the cloth is boiled in NaOH , some of the surface layer will dissolve and the cloth will lose weight . If the cloth ( before  | boiling with alkali ) is boiled with Fehling 's solution or a modified Fehling 's solution , it will be found to have a large copper number ( 5 or higher ) , but after boiling with NaOH the copper number will be about the same as for ordinary clean cotton . If this test is made in a qualitative way , the hydrolyzed area will be colored reddish brown ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb methylene blue to a small extent if the damage has been caused by submerging the cloth in acid solution . However , if the cloth has been in an acid solution and then removed and ironed while acid is still present , the methylene blue absorption will be high , and the hydrolyzed area will be more sensitive to heat and will scorch with a hot iron sooner than undamaged areas . What has been said up to this point refers to the action of dilute mineral acids on cotton , but what about the effect of stronger acids ? One might think that , if it is possible to damage cotton with dilute acids , concentrated acids would damage it beyond repair . However , we shall find that strong H2SO4 and HNO3 can be employed for making useful products from cotton cellulose . In the well-known method for parchmentizing paper , strong H2SO4 is used . Paper is passed through a solution of H2SO4 of about 78% ( sp gr = 1.71 ) at 10 ? C at such a rate that it is in contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large amount of water , then washed thoroughly , and dried . The surface of the paper seems to be peptized by the strong acid , and when the paper is passed into water the cellulose is regenerated on the surface . This fills up the pores of the paper and gives to it the well-known parchment appearance and handle . It is then quite water- and oil-repellent and is much stronger and semitransparent . Paper to be parchmentized by this method must be very free from lignin in order to avoid the formation of a pronounced brown discoloration . Sulfuric acid solution of 70% may also be used , in which case the reaction is not quite so rapid but is more easily controlled . ACTION OF CO11'ON WITH OXIDIZING AGENTS : BLEACIIING The student of textile chemistry should be interested in the oxidation of cellulose because it is one of the principal causes of trouble , dissatisfaction , and complaint in the use , wear , and life of cotton and linen fabrics . A great amount of research has been done on cellulose oxidation from the purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under various conditions and examining the products in different ways . In a large proportion of this research , the oxidation has been carried to the extreme by completely decomposing the cellulose . We discussed much of this work in Chapter 6 . Although such results are of academic interest to the textile chemist , he is much more interested in the very earliest stages of oxidation that occur during the bleaching of cotton , as it is to this that he can trace many of the faults which later develop in the goods . Obviously , cotton is bleached to make it whiter , but this must be accomplished with a minimum of damage to the cotton itself . This is not easy , because the coloring matter is destroyed by means of oxidation , and as cotton is also attacked by the same reaction , it is difficult to bleach the coloring matter and at the same time to avoid oxidizing some of the cotton . The textile chemist is , therefore , very much interested in the oxidation of cellulose and in the properties of the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vitally associated with the important operation of the bleaching of cotton , we shall make a brief study of bleaching before taking up the oxidation itself . The bleaching agent almost universally used on cotton is a hypochlorite of some sort , and of these only two are of any commercial importance , namely calcium and sodium hypochlorites . Bleaching powder , chloride of lime , is made by passing chlorine gas over wet lime : Ca(OH)2 + C12 ? - Ca(OC1)Cl + 11011 It is quite hygroscopic , and deteriorates if exposed to air . When it takes up atmospheric moisture or is treated with water , a molecular change takes place as follows : 2Ca(OCl)Cl ? Ca(OCl)2 + CaCl2 In order to stabilize bleaching powder for shipment , an excess of lime is left in it . Slaked lime is not very soluble in water , so that when bleaching powder is stirred with water , part of it dissolves and a sludge of lime is left on the bottom . Thus the clear solution will contain a mixture of calcium chloride and calcium hypochlorite , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this clear liquor is drawn off and diluted the proper amount . The alkalinity of the solution ( due to the  | hydroxide ) is an important factor in the stability of the bleach liquor . Sodium hypochlorite may be used in place of calcium hypochlorite . This bleach can be made in three general ways : ( 1 ) The addition of Na2CO3 to Ca(OCl)2 solutions Ca(OCl)2 + Na2CO3 ? * CaCO3 + 2NaOCl will precipitate CaCO3 , and the supernatant solution of NaOC1 may be drawn off and diluted to the proper strength . ( 2 ) Chlorine gas may be passed into NaOH 2NaOH + C12  --  - ) - NaOC1 + NaCl + 11011 ( 3 ) In the preparation of electrolytic bleach , an electric current is passed through a solution of ordinary salt . At the negative electrode , sodium ions are changed to sodium atoms , which immediately react with water to form NaOH . At the positive electrode , C12 is liberated . The mixture of NaOH and Cl2 produces NaOC1 . Since bleaching is an oxidation reaction , we must consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca(OC1)2 are hydrolyzed to a small extent in solution to form small amounts of hypochlorous acid , HOC1 . Chlorine water is also a bleaching agent , although a weak one , and it is known that it is in an equilibrium mixture , as shown by the following equation : C12 + I101I HOC1 + H+ + ClIt has been demonstrated that bleaching action is not due to undissociated molecules of sodium or calcium hypochlorite , nor to the hypochlorite ion . Since all the previously mentioned bleaching agents yield hypochlorous acid in solution , it might seem that HOC1 does the bleaching , but the real oxidizing agent is the oxygen from the HOCl . HOC1  --  - 0 + HC1 Since this oxygen comes from the undissociated molecules of HOC1 , it is apparent that HOC1 is the potential source of bleaching action , and any condition that favors the formation of HOC1 molecules will increase bleaching efficiency . The stability of bleach liquor is the converse of its bleaching efficiency . If it is to function as a bleaching agent , it must de-  | compose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more stable a bleach liquor is , the less readily it will decompose and hence the less bleaching it can do . During the time that bleaching powder or a stock solution of it is stored , it is desirable that the amount of decomposition be kept at a minimum , but when a dilute solution is being used for bleaching , we want its stability decreased so that it will bleach in a short time . In other words , we should like some way to control the rate of bleaching . Alkali will react with HOC1 and convert it into a hypochlorite . Remember that the hypochlorite ion is not responsible for bleaching action ; the hypochlorous acid itself is the agent . Therefore if the acid is neutralized , it can not decompose . Bleach liquor may also be stabilized by storing it as a strong solution . Dilute solutions will decompose much faster than strong solutions . The rate of bleaching may be controlled in various ways . We have found that high alkalinity stabilizes the bleach and lowers the rate of bleaching . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleaching , unless the acidity is too great ( excess of HCl will form chlorine water and not IIOCI ) . If acidity and alkalinity are so closely connected with rate of bleaching , some control of the pH of the bleach bath should regulate the rate of bleaching . Commercial bleaching is done in baths where the pH range is from 5 to 9 , and within this range maximum bleaching efficiency is obtained . But reference to page 146 will show that this is also the range in which the cotton itself will be most easily oxidized and damaged . Most damage is done to cotton in a neutral hypochlorite bath ( pH = 7 ) , so that the bleacher sees to it that his bath has a pH either above or below 7 . Both heat and sunlight will increase the rate of bleaching . If the pH of bleach liquor seems to be so important , it is interesting to get some mathematical expression that will show the relation between the concentration of H+ ion , OCl ion , and HOC1 molecules in a bleach liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | and also that the equilibrium is quite sensitive to small changes in H+ . If bleach baths are acidified with HC1 , some chlorine will be formed according to the chlorine water equilibrium shown on page 177 . The equilibrium constant for this system is shown here . figure Viviani7 found this value to be 3.5 X 10-4 . Davidson8 studied the hypochlorite bleaching of cotton under controlled conditions and found that below a pH of 6 chlorination is probably taking place ; that above a pH of 8 oxidation is taking place ; and that between the two both reactions are going on . Control of pH has been mentioned . This means not only starting with a liquor of proper pH but also controlling it during the time of bleaching . Soon after bleaching begins , the strength of the bleach liquor decreases rapidly , and the pH starts to go down ( it may start at 11 , drop to the neutral point , and go on into the acid range of 6 or 5 ) . Davidson ' showed in one instance that the grams per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 minutes , and the pH changed from 11.0 to 8.4 in the same time . Davidson , in his paper , shows the types and amounts of various buffers that can be used to maintain a constant pH during bleaching . Recall that cotton is sensitive to dilute mineral acids as well as oxidizing agents , and then note that when HOC1 furnishes oxygen for bleaching , the other product is HC ! . It is true that HC1 is formed in only small amounts in this way , but it will be in contact with cotton for several hours , and , in local areas where circulation is poor , acid hydrolysis may occur . Some bleachers will remove cotton goods from the bath before the bleaching is completed , and hang them in air . Let us see what is gained by such a procedure . Air contains CO2 , which in the presence of water behaves like a weak acid , H2CO3 . Carbonic acid will slowly react with calcium hypochlorite left in the goods : figure  | Calcium carbonate , because of its insolubility , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small volume of liquor distributed through the goods . Now suppose that the HOC ! decomposes and furnishes oxygen to complete the bleaching . At the same time HCl will be formed , but it will react with CaCO3 and , therefore , have no chance for hydrolyzing the cotton . The completion of a bleaching operation by exposure to air seems to be a safe and sensible thing to do . The strength of hypochlorite bleach liquors is expressed in terms of available chlorine . This is rather confusing when it is oxygen , and not chlorine , that does the bleaching . However , if we know the available chlorine , we know that a certain amount of oxygen is equivalent to it . If NaOC1 solution is treated with RI and acidified , the reaction is NaOC1 + 2111  --  NaCl + H2O + I2 The liberation of two iodine atoms by one molecule of NaOC1 is the equivalent of one atom of oxygen . However , note that there is only one chlorine atom in NaOC1 . We know one oxygen is equivalent to two chlorines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to two chlorines , even though it contains only one chlorine . Therefore , when bleaching powder is analyzed and the result is expressed in terms of percentage of available chlorine , it means that the oxidizing power is equivalent to that much chlorine , but only half that amount of chlorine is actually present as hypochlorite . Look at it in a different way . When chlorine is passed into NaOH , 2NaOH + C12  --  #@# NaOC1 + NaCl + H2O only half the chlorine is in the hypochlorite , but the oxidizing power of the hypochlorite is equal to the entire amount of chlorine . In commercial practice the strength of bleach liquors may be checked by specific gravity . They are made up to be from 1 ? Tw to 2.5 ? Tw , which corresponds to 2.7 to 7.0 gm Cl per liter . The amount of ordinary bleaching powder required for one gallon of such bleach runs from 1.2 oz to 3.2 oz . BOILING OUT COTTON Raw unbleached cotton contains very few impurities , but those few are nuisances . The thin coating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be removed before good bleaching can be done . The pectinous impurities tend to form gels under certain circumstances , and they must also be removed . The small amount of fatty impurity must also be eliminated . All of this is accomplished by the so-called boiling out of unbleached cotton . There are two general methods for boiling out , the lime method and the soda method . The lime boil consists of three steps : the lime boil , the gray sour , and the soda ash boil . In the first and last steps , a kier is used . This is similar to an autoclave with a cylindrical inner chamber with perforated walls . Means for heating must be provided , as well as some sort of efficient circulating system by which liquid can be pumped through the goods that are packed in the inner chamber . The cloth is saturated with milk of lime so that it takes up about 5% of its weight of lime . It is then packed into the kier very carefully , so that no air pockets are present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lime should be 8 to 12% of the weight of the goods . The lid is clamped on and the cotton is boiled , or rather , boiling limewater is circulated through it , for 8 to 12 hours . During this operation , nitrogenous impurities are converted into ammonium salts , and fats and waxes are saponified . As the alkali used for this saponification is Ca(OH)2 , the resulting soap will be a calcium soap . At the end of this boiling period , the limewater is drawn off and cold water is run in at the same time . Care must be used to prevent the goods from coming into contact with hot iron while still saturated with lime . This would cause what is known as lime burns and would weaken the cloth . The goods , after this washing , are transferred to a solution of HCl or H2SO4 ( sp gr =1.005 to 1.01 ) . This is known as the gray sour , because the goods at this time are really darker in color than they were at the beginning . The acid treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important function is to change calcium soaps to free fatty acids . The gray sour should be cold , because cotton is sensitive to dilute mineral acids . For the same reason the goods should not be left in the acid too long , but should be washed well and passed to the next operation . For the soda ash boil the goods , packed in a kier , are boiled for 8 to 12 hours with a solution of soda ash . This converts the insoluble fatty acids ( liberated in the gray sour ) into sodium soaps .  | The goods are then thoroughly washed . The cotton is now free from all impurities except the coloring matter , which will be destroyed during bleaching . The soda boil is a much shorter and simpler method for preparing cotton for bleaching , and it is being more generally used than the older lime boil . When cotton is prepared by this method , it is packed in a kier and boiled with NaOH ( 2 to 5% on the weight of goods ) for 2 to 10 hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Care must be taken that goods saturated with caustic do not touch hot iron . Residual alkali may be neutralized with a dilute acid , followed by thorough washing with water . LAUNDRY AND HOME BLEACHING The preceding discussion of the preparation and bleaching of cotton has been confined to the commercial production of a market bleach , that is , white cotton yarn or cloth that is to be made up into some form of white goods or to be dyed in light shades or used for making cotton prints . However , an enormous amount of bleaching is done in laundries and in the home , and we shall now consider the bleaching of cotton from these points of view . One of the first things we discover is that calcium hypochlorite can not be used . In the laundry or home , bleaching is done at a time when the wash has a great deal of soap in it , and if calcium hypochlorite were to be added , insoluble calcium soap would be precipitated on the goods . Therefore laundry bleaching is always done with sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundrymen ) do not realize is that bleaching is not a cleaning operation ; bleaching will not remove dirt . Bleaching is only a decolorizing or whitening reaction dependent on oxidation . When shirts with dirty cuffs are washed , it does no good whatever to add some extra bleach liquor . That will not remove the dirt from the cuffs . This rule does not apply to certain stains which can be decolorized by oxidation . Many consumers have mistaken ideas about the chemicals that are used in laundries , and we hear vague references made to " strong acids , " " corrosive alkalies , " etc. , which are entirely without foundation . The only chemical used in any laundry which can harm shirts , sheets , or tablecloths is the bleach , but it can do much harm unless it is intelligently used . Some laundries are very careful about alkali and builders , but careless with bleach . This can be attributed only to a lack of knowledge of bleach and  | the harm it can do . It is overbleaching in the laundry or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the accompanying shortness of life . It is to be understood that , after bleach has oxidized coloring matter ( and some stains ) , it will begin to attack cotton itself , forming oxycellulose and weakening the cotton . Bleach for the power laundry can be purchased in the form of bleaching power ( chloride of lime ) or liquid bleach in carboys . Some laundries make their own electrolytic bleach . A convenient strength for a dilute bleach liquor for laundry use is 1% . This really means a solution containing 10 gm available chlorine per liter . Such a solution can be obtained by making a paste of 10 lb of bleaching powder , working it up with 20 gal water , and then stirring in 10 gal of water containing 20 lb of modified soda ( a mixture of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate ) or 10 lb of soda ash . Let the CaCO3 settle and then draw off the supernatant liquid . Liquid carboy bleaches are simply diluted to 1% . The housewife must depend on bottled bleach liquor such as Clorox , Roman Cleanser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hypochlorite strength and should be used in proper amounts . In power laundries the amount of bleach used is based on the dry weight of goods to be bleached , rather than on a solution of a certain strength . This is done because , after the consumption of bleach by coloring matter , the cotton is attacked . This is what we want to prevent . If a certain strength solution is used for a full load of goods and a similar solution for a small load , the cotton in the small load will be much more oxidized than that in the full load . The amount of bleach recommended is 2 qt of 1% bleach for each 100 lb of wash . A 1% bleach contains 10 gm available chlorine per liter , and as a quart is approximately equal to a liter , we may say that 20 gm chlorine should be used for each 100 lb of wash . These are much smaller amounts than would be used in the commercial bleaching where cotton is first bleached . Cotton that goes to the laundry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it white . It is probably not practical to weigh the home wash , and yet some approximation should be possible . Washing machines for home use are built to accommodate an average of about 8 lb ( dry weight ) of wash . This is about the equivalent of 4 sheets . The volume of water varies with types of machines , but usually runs from 12 to 15 gal . Let us assume that a load for home laundering is 8 lb and that the volume of water is 12 gal .  | Suppose the housewife wants to use one of the popular brands of bleach sold in grocery stores . She buys a bottle , reads the directions carefully , and follows them accurately . How does her bleaching compare with that done in a commercial laundry ? One brand containing 5.25% NaOC1 recommends the use of 1 tablespoon of bleach for each gallon of water , which would be 12 tablespoons for one load of wash . This is equal to 6 oz or % cup . Bleach containing 5.25% NaOC1 is the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorine per ounce , and 6 oz would contain 9 gm available chlorine . If the bleaching were done in a power laundry , how large a wash could be done with this amount of bleach ? We found that good laundry bleaching practice uses 20 gm chlorine for 100 lb dry wash . Therefore 9 gm chlorine would be enough to bleach a load of 45 lb . If the home bleach directions are followed , 9 gm chlorine will be used for only 8 lb . The only logical conclusion is that the laundry uses only about one-fifth as much bleach as the housewife , and , therefore , it is just as logical to assume that there will be only one-fifth as much chance for damage and loss of strength due to oxidation of cotton . It would seem that the housewife might use much less bleach . One brand of grocery store bleach recommends that if the wash is extra dirty it may be soaked overnight in soap with bleach added ( 1 cup for 10 gal of water ) . This means 12 gm available chlorine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 30 minutes . Overnight bleaching with such an amount of chlorine is not only foolish but dangerous . It must be remembered that bleach is not a cleanser . It is only a whitener . Extra dirty clothes can not be cleaned by using more bleach or soaking for a long time . The only way to remove dirt is to wash the clothes with a real detergent . Bleaching should follow this washing . Another thing to be considered is the manner of adding the bleach . The laundryman adds it as a 1% solution , the total amount of chlorine being only one-fifth as much as is added in the home laundry . It is bad practice to add the bleach directly to the load in the machine and then to start the machine , because bleach begins to react very quickly , and local overbleaching is almost certain to occur before the bleach can be distributed through the entire volume . The laundryman has special ways for taking care of this , but it would be much better in the home to lift the  | load , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drop the load into the water . Another factor involved in home bleaching is rinsing . In commercial laundries , the goods are rinsed several times after bleaching to remove unused bleach as completely as possible . It is common knowledge that rinsing in the home laundry is much less efficient . It must be remembered that the oxidizing effect of hypochlorite is a cumulative one that continues as time goes on . If some bleach is left in cotton goods because of poor rinsing , the bleach will continue to oxidize the cotton , and the chance for loss of strength will increase . Power laundries treat the goods with a sour after bleaching , which serves three purposes . ( 1 ) All sours are weakly acidic compounds and therefore will neutralize any alkalinity that may have been retained by the wash . This is desirable because residual alkali might cause damage when the goods are ironed , and because the tendency for starch to turn yellow is accentuated by alkali . ( 2 ) Most sours will destroy excess or unused bleach , and for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important functions of a sour . ( 3 ) Some sours act as stain removers . Some typical sours and anti-chlors are acetic acid , which is perfectly safe ; sodium bisulfite , NaHSO3 , which is a safe antichlor but may leave a bad odor ; and sodium acid fluoride and sodium silicofluoride , which are also used , the former being an efficient iron rust remover . If these fluorides are not completely removed by rinsing , sharp irritating odors will be produced when the goods are ironed . Oxalic acid is a sour that is very widely used . The Laundryowners National Association recommends the following sours and procedure as being satisfactory and safe for laundry use : 1 lb oxalic acid in 1 gal hot water . Add 1 gal half glacial acetic acid and half water to the oxalic acid solution when cool . Use % pt of this mixture for 100 lb of wash . Rinse well . Another bleaching agent coming into use is sodium chlorite , NaC1O2 . White , Taylor , and Vincent10 state that chlorine is not formed when solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C1O2 . They also claim that , when NaC1O2 is used as a bleach at a pH of 4 , it is probably the chlorite ion that accom-  | plishes the oxidation of coloring matter . The main advantage in the use of chlorite for bleaching cotton is that it will oxidize the coloring matter but will not attack the cellulose . There appears to be no chain-shortening action , because there is no loss in strength of the cotton , nor is there any decrease in cuprammonium viscosity . Jeanes and Isbell11 found that chlorites can oxidize reducing sugars , but if the terminal oxygen is linked to two carbons , as it is in the anhydroglucose unit of cellulose , no oxidation takes place . When hypochlorites are used for bleaching there is danger of chain rupture , and care must be taken to protect the cellulose . However , when sodium chlorite is used , only the coloring matter is destroyed , and the cellulose is not affected . For general bleaching purposes , sodium chlorite should be used at a pH of 3 to 4 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? C. TESTS FOR OXYCELLULOSE The bleaching of cotton , either during the preparation of white goods for the market or in repeated launderings over a period of time , always results in the formation of some oxycellulose . In these oxycelluloses there appears to be no structural disintegration of cotton fibers , and yet there is always a small but significant rise in the copper number . It would therefore appear that the copper number could be used as a measure of the extent of oxidation ; that is , by determining the copper number , one might tell whether the damage to cotton was caused by oxidative attack . However , we must remember two things , ( 1 ) the effect of boiling with alkali on the copper number , and ( 2 ) the effect of the pH of the oxidizing bath ( page 144 ) . When oxycellulose is boiled with alkali , the reducing property is decreased to practically the same as unoxidized cotton . Thus there is the possibility that serious oxidation may have taken place , but previous to the copper number determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot alkali . In such a situation , conclusions drawn from the size of the copper number would be misleading . On the other hand , we know that oxycellulose has an increased affinity for basic dyes such as methylene blue , and it happens that the methylene blue absorption is changed very little by alkali boiling . The use of these quantitative values as criteria for extent of oxidation is complicated by the fact that they are dependent on the  | pH of the oxidizing bath ( page 144 ) . Two samples of cotton may have consumed the same amount of oxygen , and yet one may have a high copper number and a low methylene blue number , and the other sample have a small copper number . Furthermore , the methylene blue test is not so sensitive as the copper number test . This sounds quite complicated , but we can still learn much about the past history of cotton goods by means of these two values , if they turn out to be what we might call positive values . Let us discuss some examples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low methylene blue number . This does not tell us much , as the cloth may have been oxidized considerably in an acid bath ( low methylene blue number ) and then heated with alkali before being analyzed . Cloth B has a high copper number . That settles the matter . In such circumstances the methylene blue number will not even be determined . Cloth C has a low copper number . The methylene blue number must then be determined . If it is high , there are two possibilities : ( 1 ) that the cloth has been treated with hot alkali ( decreasing the copper number ) or ( 2 ) that it has been oxidized in a bath of the alkaline type . The summary of these examples tells us that positive results can be interpreted logically , but negative results can not . Copper number is the better test for acid-oxycelluloses ( unless they have previously been treated with hot alkali ) , and the methylene blue number is the better test for alkaline oxycelluloses . Both copper number and methylene blue number are criteria of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with increased number of reducing groups , and the methylene blue with increased number of carboxyl groups . There are other tests which show increased reducing groups . Among these are ( 1 ) dyeing with Indanthrene Yellow ( Ermen12 ) ; ( 2 ) staining with Nessler 's solution ( Ditz13 ) ; ( 3 ) staining with AgNO3 ( Harrison " ) ; and ( 4 ) the effects of heat and hot 1% NaOH solution . These are definitely associated with high reducing power and , therefore , high copper number . Such oxycellulose will scorch at a lower temperature than unoxidized cotton , and will turn yellow when boiled with 1% NaOH solution . However , a cotton cloth may have suffered a considerable tendering and yet not give positive  | results with these tests . Such an oxycellulose would be one that had been oxidized in alkaline medium . It would have a high methylene blue number . All the preceding tests are based on the existence of oxidized surfaces in which cotton has been chemically modified and the properties of which are changed by alkali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton is a physical test free from the preceding limitations . It is a sensitive indication of oxidative attack , regardless of the presence or absence of a chemically changed surface , or the type of oxidation ( acid or alkaline ) , or of subsequent treatment of the material . It has been shown that the decrease in viscosity is a function of the oxygen consumed , and that subsequent boiling with alkali does not restore the high viscosity . Viscosity is a sensitive test for the early stages of oxidation , as is the copper number . All technically bleached cotton has a lower viscosity and higher copper number than unoxidized cotton . However , a difference must be noted in what can be learned from the two tests . Suppose a cloth consumes 0.2% oxygen during bleaching . It will have a certain copper number and viscosity . Then suppose it is treated with hot alkali and bleached again so as to absorb 0.2% oxygen . It will now have about the same copper number as before , but its viscosity will be much lower . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffered considerable loss of strength , which could be demonstrated by a viscosity determination , but not by copper number . Viscosity of cuprammonium solutions of cotton is the most useful test for injury caused by oxidative attack during bleaching . However , it is not discriminating , because it is a measure of average chain length , and chains may be shortened by acid hydrolysis as well as by oxidation . Clibbens and Geake15 recommend a rapid method for testing bleached goods . It consists of determining the specific viscosity of a 0.5% cuprammonium solution of the cotton with a mixture of glycerin and water having a specific gravity of 1.1681 ( time of flow of cotton solution ? time of flow of glycerin ) . The time of flow of this particular glycerin solution is the same as that of a cuprammonium solution of a cotton that has suffered the maximum amount of damage due to bleaching . Therefore , if the specific viscosity of the cotton is greater than 1 , the cloth has been over-  | bleached , but if the specific viscosity is less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , the better . Clibbens and Geake also express results in terms of fluidity ( see page 129 ) and find that a fluidity of 10 corresponds to about 10% loss in tensile strength , and a fluidity of 20 to about a 20% loss in strength . The fluidity of normally bleached cotton varies between 2 and 7 . Values higher than 7 indicate bad overbleaching . A study of these tests for oxycellulose makes it apparent that they are quite similar to the tests for hydrocellulose ( page 135 ) . We are therefore faced with the problem of distinguishing between hydrocellulose and oxycellulose . That is , how can we demonstrate the difference between cotton that has been modified by acid hydrolysis and cotton that has been damaged by oxidation ? It appears that the best methods must be based on the fact that very few carboxyl groups are formed during acid hydrolysis of cotton . We have already found ( page 142 ) that the carboxyl groups of oxycellulose can be converted into CO2 by decarboxylation . Krajcinovicte describes a reaction that can be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that COOH groups will react with aromatic diamines , and the product can then be diazotized and coupled . For example , cotton may be moistened with an alcoholic solution of benzidine , let stand a few minutes , and then rinsed well . It is then diazotized by treating with hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite . After the sample has stood for a few minutes , it is rinsed and spotted with a few drops of an alkaline solution of 0-naphthol . Oxycellulose will give a bright red color , whereas hydrocellulose will not . Negative results obtained by this test are not conclusive , because oxycelluloses of the reducing type have only a few carboxyl groups . However , positive results are definitely indicative of oxycellulose . The Action of Cotton with Alkalies . Mercerization In Chapter 6 ( page 161 ) we discussed the chemical aspects of the action of alkalies on cellulose , and in this chapter we shall study the physical changes that occur when cotton is mercerized . In April 1851 , John Mercer was granted British Patent 13,296 , in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the subjection of cotton , linen and other vegetable fibrous materials , either in fibre form or any other stage of its manufacture , 16 J. Textile Inst. , 38 , T11 ( 1947 ) .  | either alone or mixed with silk , woolen or other animal fibrous material , to the action of caustic soda or caustic potash , dilute sulfuric acid , or solution of chloride of zinc of a temperature and strength sufficient to produce the new effects , and give to them the new properties above described , either by padding , printing or steeping , immersion or any other mode of application . " This was the beginning of one of the most important advances that have ever taken place in the textile field , the birth of mercerized cotton . An enormous amount of research has been done since that time on the action of alkalies on cotton , but not much has been added to the original list of observations made and patented by John Mercer . The main points in his alkali treatment of cotton are : 1 . Shrinkage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Increase in tensile strength . 3 . Increase in absorption of dyestuffs . 4 . Increase in physical compactness of yarn and cloth . 5 . Increased water absorption . 6 . Increased reaction at lower temperatures . 7 . Preferential absorption of NaOH during the process . 8 . Possible compound formation . Mercer 's alkali-treated cotton had all these properties , and yet it was never a commercial success . Apparently the cotton trade was not interested in these new effects , and forty years passed before any modification of Mercer 's process was made which enjoyed commercial success . In 1890 Horace Lowe was granted British Patent 4452 , in which he claimed the production of luster on cotton cloth or yarn by holding it under tension during the process of alkali treatment , with subsequent washing , or stretching it after alkali treatment . This luster-producing process for treating cotton was so successful that today the mercerization of cotton is a huge business . Luster is purely a surface property , the reflection of light from a smooth surface ; the smoother the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under tension , its surface must be rendered smoother . Not only does surface smoothness enter into luster but , when fine filaments are to be twisted together , the cross-section area is an important factor . So let us compare individual cotton fibers according to physical appearance , surface , and cross-section . Table 28 shows this comparision.  | figure It is interesting to know what physical change takes place during the treatment of cotton fibers with NaOH of different concentration . Pope and Hubner ' ? give the following : figure It is found that 17.5% NaOH is the lowest concentration that will show a substantial increase in luster . If the preceding behavior of cotton is considered along with this , we might conclude that the production of luster is dependent upon swelling and untwisting occurring simultaneously or upon swelling preceding untwisting , but that the swelling of an untwisted fiber will not produce luster . The amount of shrinkage in yarn when it is subjected to the action of NaOH of various strengths is considered to be important . It is not very reliable as a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the yarn , changes in fiber diameter , slippage of fibers , etc. , enter in . Nevertheless , the concentration at which maximum shrinkage takes place is of great importance . Therefore we can use shrinkage as a good measure of mercerizing efficiency , and study the five factors that control mercerization . These factors are concentration of NaOH , time ,  | temperature , tension , and type of cotton goods . Table 29 shows the relations of the first three factors . All figures are in per cent shrinkage . The figures show clearly that mercerizing effects decrease with rise in temperature , and that ordinary room temperature is the most practical . The figures also show that nothing is gained by prolonging the treatment beyond 10 minutes . The one-minute shrinkage is entitled to some comment . It shows that shrinkage in alkali takes place very rapidly . This is important to remember , because , in any processing of cotton where alkali is used , any local increase in strength of alkali may cause considerable shrinkage at that point . So far as concentration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23% NaOH is the best . There is no practical advantage to be gained by using a 29% solution . figure The tension factor in mercerizing can he summarized as follows : mercerizing without tension causes a good increase in strength ( 25 to 30% ) but no increase in luster . Mercerizing with tension great enough to prevent shrinkage produces the same increase in strength , and the luster is increased very much . The type of cotton material to be mercerized is so varied that it is impossible to make any quantitative statements about it . Nevertheless , a few generalizations are of interest . Perhaps the most important facts to remember are that the object of merceri-  | zation is the production of luster ; that this is obtained by the use of tension ; that the larger the proportion of fibers lying lengthwise of the yarn , the better the luster will be . The cotton fiber itself is the fundamental unit in yarn or cloth , and so it should be considered first . The long , fine-staple cottons are best for mercerizing because they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist , and the individual fibers lie fairly parallel lengthwise of the yarn . Therefore , Egyptian , sea island , and Pima cottons are quite suitable for mercerizing . After a yarn is spun , numerous loose ends of fibers protrude from its sides . If the yarn is gassed ( run rapidly through a flame ) , these will be burned off and will leave a smooth surface . It would be impossible to subject these loose ends to tension during alkali treatment . Spinning twist is another factor . In a tightly twisted yarn , the length of individual fibers is disposed more crosswise of the yarn than lengthwise , and therefore will not mercerize as well . The more loosely a yarn is twisted , the better it is . The best results will be obtained with yarns that have the lowest amount of twist and still retain enough adhesion to give them practical strength . This emphasizes the desirability of long staple cotton , because the extra length makes possible the spinning of such a yarn . Two-ply yarns are better than singles , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singles . That is , if a yarn is spun with a right-hand twist , and two of these are folded with a left-hand twist , the folding will untwist some of the singles . The result is that a larger proportion of the fibers lie lengthwise of the yarn . If cloth is to be mercerized , a faced cloth such as sateen will show the greatest increase in luster . This is because the long floats will lend themselves to the effect of tension more readily than shorter crossings of yarns . Various attempts have been made to modify and improve the Mercer-Lowe process for mercerizing cotton . One such is described in U.S. Patent 2,390,032 ( 1945 ) , assigned to Itohm and Haas , by which cotton cloth is treated with acrylonitrile first , and then with NaOH ( 10 ? 20% solutions ) for one hour . The cloth is then subjected to tension while it is washed and dried . It is claimed that the tensile strength of cloth so treated is increased 57% , whereas without the acrylonitrile the increase is only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product that , so far as modification is concerned , is about the same as unmercerized cotton . That is , the average chain length , reducing property , carboxyl content , etc. , are the same . This is shown by the accompanying figures for Egyptian cotton ( Sakellarides ) . However , the activity figure of cotton in all treatments is increased by mercerization . Mercerized cotton can be hydrolyzed and oxidized more easily , and is more soluble in Schweitzer 's reagent . Its absorptive properties have been increased so that it will absorb more direct dyes and more water and iodine ( the latter can be used as a qualitative test ) . figure Schwalbe18 proposed a hydrolysis number to express the increased ease of hydrolysis of mercerized cotton . Birtwell , Clibbens , and Geake19 proposed a reactivity ratio to express the increased susceptibility to oxidation . Mercerized cotton is more hygroscopic than unmercerized cotton ; that is , it will absorb more water , and its normal moisture content is higher . This property is related to the strength of I9 Z. angew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Textile Inst. , 21 , T85 ( 1930 ) .  | NaOH used in the treatment . Many investigations of this behavior have been made . Table 30 gives results obtained by Hubner and Wooton.2o Mercerized cotton has an increased affinity for direct dyes , which is governed by the strength of NaOH used in the process . Knecht21 made quantitative determinations of the absorption of Benzopurpurin 4B from boiling solutions of the dye . He found that there is a steady increase in dye absorption , with increasing figure NaOH concentration until 25% is reached , after which the increase is much less . Some of these figures are given in Table 31 . Knecht suggests that absorptions of Benzopurpurin 4B may be used as a qualitative test for mercerized cotton in which depths of color may be compared . The test can be made more sensitive if the dyed samples are carefully treated with dilute acid . The red color on unmercerized cotton will turn blue , but mercerized yarns will retain their red color . Excess acid must be avoided . Increased absorption of iodine by mercerized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed by mercerized and unmercerized cotton , but his most important observation was that the absorbed iodine could be rinsed out of unmercerized cotton much faster than from mercerized cotton , and he suggested this as a test for mercerized cotton . Hubner  | also found that the sensitivity of the iodine test could be improved by using iodine solutions with zinc chloride . NEW FINISIIES ON COTTONS Since 1933 the cotton textile industry has been revolutionized by the development and use of new finishes . We are all acquainted with lacquer or surface coating finishes which have been in use for many years , but these new finishes are not of that type . They are applied from water solutions or dispersions and penetrate to the interior of yarns , or perhaps even into the cotton fibers . Thus all the desirable properties of a cloth are retained . Its porosity , absorbency , feel , and flexibility are usually not affected , and it has all the characteristics of the untreated cloth . However , it may have new and improved properties such as strength , luster , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , entirely new effects can be obtained . The available finishing materials include a wide variety of compounds , which may be applied by a number of methods . Thus , by the proper selection of finishing substances , used in certain concentrations and applied by the proper methods , a wide variety of effects can be obtained . In fact , the same compound can be used to produce different effects by merely changing such factors as concentration , temperature , solvent , etc . The new finishing substances are being used today to produce millions of yards of cotton and rayon cloths which have increased tensile strength and wearing qualities . The luster , elasticity , and elongation of yarns can be increased or decreased , whichever is more desirable . Cotton cloths can be given the luster of silk , the absorbency and coolness of linen , or the stability of high-grade worsteds . Spun rayons may be given the quality , character , and resiliency of good woolens . A large number of these finishing materials have been put on the market and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amounts of them are necessary , and yet their total commercial consumption is much greater than the old coating or lacquer types of finishes which went into such things as oilcloth , tarpaulins , artificial leather , table covers , etc . We shall divide these finishing compounds into three main groups : the cellulose ethers , quaternary ammonium compounds , and formaldehyde resins . The cellulose ethers were discovered by Lillienfeld , a Polish  | chemist , who patented their use for finishing cottons . These compounds can be made from cellulose by the use of four different reagents , all of the reactions taking place in the presence of NaOH . Alkyl chlorides can be made to react with cellulose , C6H904 OH + RC1 ? C611904 0 R + IICI A hydroxy ethyl ether of cellulose can be made in two ways , ( a ) by the use of ethylene oxide , C6H904 ? OH + CH2 CH2 ? C6H904 ? O ? CH2 ? CH2OH 0/ and ( b ) by treating cellulose with chlorohydrin . C6H904 OH + Cl CH2 CH2OH  --  C6H904 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a carboxylic ether can be made by the action of sodium chloroacetate on cellulose . C6H904 ? OH + Cl ? CH2 ? COONa ? ' CJH904 0 CH2 COONa + HCl The amount of substitution in cellulose can be regulated by the proper control of the reactions , so that ethers of different solubilities can be made . For example , if one OH group of every two glucose units is etherified , the product will be insoluble in water but soluble in NaOH . If one OH group of each glucose unit is etherified , the substance will be water-soluble , and upon higher etherification the ethers will be soluble in many organic solvents . The cellulose ethers are white fluffy substances similar to cotton linters . When they are applied to cotton they are usually dissolved in 6 to 10% NaOH solutions so as to make about a 6% solution of the ether . Cotton cloth is passed through the solution at temperatures below 15 ? C until the proper amount of impregnation has taken place , and then the ether is coagulated by passing the cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be obtained in this way , from soft and silky to stiff , firm , and crisp . This stiffness is durable and permanent , as contrasted with the temporary effects obtained with starch . One of the main advantages to be gained by finishing with cellulose ethers is the resistance to repeated launderings . Goldthwaite , Smith , and Barnes23 have treated cotton goods with a solution of cellulose 23 U.S. Patent 2,417,869 ( 1947 ) .  | ether in cuprammonium instead of NaOH . They use cellulose hydroxy ethyl ether , immerse the goods in a cold solution , squeeze out , and dry without rinsing at 180 ? F. Cloth treated in this way has the usual properties and in addition is found to be rotand mildew-proof . British Patent 477,029 describes a waterrepellent finish that is obtained by treating cloth with high molecular weight aldehydes , such as stearyl aldehyde ( C17H35CHO ) . The cloth is immersed in a 0.5% solution of the aldehyde in a lowboiling hydrocarbon , dried , and heated for 5 minutes at 150 ? C. The cellulose ethers in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth lustrous finish and a large reduction in linting during use . These finishes require no starch after laundering . There is some confusion among the terms used in discussing fabrics that have been treated to protect them and the wearer from water . A waterproofed fabric is one which is impervious to both water and air , which means that all interstitial openings in the cloth have been closed by some treatment or other . Garments made from such fabrics are very uncomfortable because they lack ventilation . On the other hand , water-repellent fabrics are resistant to water but pervious to air . The yardage of cloth treated to give water-repellency is enormously greater than the yardage of waterproofed fabrics , so that we shall confine our discussion to the water-repellent treatments . Some of the best water-repellent finishes are produced on cotton and rayon fabrics by the use of nitrogen compounds which are cation-active agents . A cation-active compound is one which may be very complex , but somewhere in the molecule there is a polar arrangement ( like a salt ) , the cation ( positive ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecule . For example , one of the important classes of such compounds is the quaternary ammonium salts of pyridine , C5H5N , or ( ( N. It will be seen that pyridine is a tertiary amine ( page 49 ) and therefore will form salts with acids , e.g. , pyridinium chloride . These compounds behave like ordinary inorganic salts . Zerner and Pollak24 studied the chemical reaction that takes place when cellulose is treated with a quaternary salt , such as a pyridinium salt , and then baked or cured at a high temperature . All of these quaternary salts suitable for water-repellent treatments must have two distinctly different parts in the molecule . The real water-repellent ( or hydrophobic ) part of the molecule is a long-chain fatty acid derivative containing 15 or more carbons . This chain may be saturated or unsaturated . The other part of the molecule is the polar cation-active part which can react with - the OH group of cellulose . The reaction given below shows what happens during the curing ( heating ) of a cotton cloth that , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyridinium chloride . Compounds of this general type are applied to cotton goods from water solutions or dispersions , after which the cloth is dried  | on a tenter . The material is then baked or cured in order to complete the chemical reaction and leave the fabric impregnated with an insoluble water-repellent substance . Finishes so obtained are usually durable to laundering and dry cleaning . The Imperial Chemical Industries of England25 proposes the use of a new type of quaternary ammonium salt which is a sort of double pyridinium salt made from esters of chloroformic acid , such as Cl COOC18H37 , octadecyl chloroformate . Such an ester is treated with p-phenylenediamine , then with formaldehyde and HC1 , and finally with pyridine . The final product would have the structure , figure Another group of quaternary salts that has been found satisfactory for producing water-repellent finishes is known as the sapamines . They are derivatives of oleic acid ( an unsaturated acid , C17H33COOH ) . They are substituted amides of oleic acid , but differ from the first group discussed in that they are substituted ethyl amides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen are aliphatic rather than aromatic . The sapamines are manufactured in the form of acetates , chlorides , and sulfates . Examples are figure Another class of nitrogen compounds suitable for making cotton goods water-repellent is disclosed by Zerner , Davies , and Pollak.26 This is a group of Schiff 's bases . A Schiff 's base is obtained by the well-known reaction between aldehydes or ketones with primary amines . Ketones when used for this purpose must have 8 to 20 carbons on each side of the carbonyl group , and the amine must have at least 8 carbons or be an aromatic primary amine . An example of a Schiff 's base made from 13-naphthylamine and diheptadecyl ketone is figure These compounds are applied from solutions in an organic solvent in the cold , dried , and heated for 5 minutes at 120 ? 160 ? C. Since about 1940 the use of synthetic resins for finishing cotton goods has been developed to a point where millions of yards of cloth are going onto the market with resin-impregnated finishes . The characteristics of cloth can be changed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% resin will leave the cloth with the same appearance and feel as it would have without the resin . However , the properties which determine its durability and serviceability will be improved by the resin . One novel feature of resin finishing is that the same resin may be used to obtain different effects , depending on the method of application . If it is dissolved in a solvent and applied to the surface of cloth , the result is a coating which may be varied by the use of different concentrations of resin . If it is applied as a dispersion in water it will impart a lustrous finish , and if applied from water solutions , it makes fabrics more resilient . In addition to the preceding modifying effects , other , and perhaps more desirable , results can be attained by resin treatments . It is possible to make fabrics water-repellent so that they require 2s U.S. Patent 2,413,024 ( 1946 ) .  | less frequent and easier laundering . Some of the most important creaseproofing methods are based on the use of such resins . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its felting property , is very much decreased . Such finishes will eliminate much of the wrinkling of spun rayon dress goods and reduce the tendency of knit goods to bag and get out of shape . No one resin can accomplish all these results , but it is very seldom that all of them would be required in the same fabric . The manufacturer has a wide variety of resins from which to select the one best suited for the particular cloth he is producing . Four main classes of resins can be used in finishing textile fabrics . They are all sold in the form of formaldehyde condensation products , which are either monomers or polymers of low molecular weight . In every instance , after these condensation products are deposited on the fabric , they are polymerized or resinified by heat . The four types of condensation products are made from formaldehyde with phenol , urea , melamine , or acetone . The first of these is rather undesirable because of its inherent tendency to discolor . If we are to study the use of resins in finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though they may not have achieved much commercial importance . A very good review of this subject27 divides them into two main classes , based on their solubility and the effect of heat on them . These two divisions are the thermosetting and thermoplastic resins . Thermosetting resins are those that harden when sufficient heat is applied and thereafter are practically infusible and insoluble . Thermoplastic resins are those that are softened by heat and dissolved by certain organic solvents . The four types of resins previously mentioned are subdivisions of the thermosetting class . In addition to these are the alkyd or glyptal resins . They are the products of the condensation of dibasic acids with dihydric alcohols ( page 34 ) . The thermoplastic resins can be subdivided into the polyvinyl resins , the acrylates ( and methacrylates ) , and the polythenes and polyamides . The polyvinyls include the chlorides , acetates , butyrates , and alcohols , or mixtures of them . They vary from hard , firm resins to soft , pliable ones , and therefore a wide range of finishes will run from crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able , full-hand effects . The polythenes are produced by the polymerization of ethylene at high pressures . Tape made of polythene can be used for binding fabrics without sewing . The tape can be laid on between two cloths and heated . This fuses the tape and holds the two cloths together . The acrylates are applied from dispersions in water to give full , soft finishes . The methacrylates , dissolved in trichloroethylene , are used by dry cleaners as stiffening agents to overcome the limpness shown by some fabrics after dry cleaning . The formation of the urea-formaldehyde resins is based on the reaction between formaldehyde , II2C ? O , and amino groups , NH2 , as shown by the following equation . R ? NH2 + H2C=O = R ? NH CH2OH Urea , H2N ? CO NH2 , has two NH2 groups , which may react with formaldehyde one at a time . For example , one molecule of each will react to form H2N ? CO ? NH ? CH2OH , known as monomethylol urea . As this compound still contains an NH2 group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form HO-CH2-NH-CO-NH-CH2OH , dimethylol urea . Further heating of the reaction mixture forms high molecular weight thermosetting resins . Thus the unpolymerized condensation products can be applied to textiles from water solution , followed by a baking operation , which will form the insoluble resin . This polymerization can be controlled so that polymers of low , medium , or high molecular weight can be produced , thus permitting finishes of different properties to be obtained . The word melamines is used in the plural to indicate that melamine itself or derivatives of it are used for finishing textile materials . Johnstone28 shows how melamine and its formaldehyde derivatives are made by the American Cyanamide Company . There are essentially four steps in the process : ( 1 ) Calcium carbide and nitrogen are heated to 2200 C to form calcium cyanamide CaC2 + N2 = CaNCN + C ( 2 ) The free cyanamide is liberated by treating this calcium salt with a weak acid such as carbonic acid //  | figure Derivatives of melamine can be prepared by condensing it with formaldehyde to form various methylolmelamines , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that melamine can resonate in many ways , so that the formaldehyde condensation products are even more obscure as far as their structures are concerned . However , theoretically speaking , each of the hydrogens of melamine may be substituted by a CH2OH group , so that we have the possibility of mono- , di- , tri- , etc. , up to hexamethylolmelamines . Two such formulas are shown here . figure When melamine resins are baked ( cured ) , it appears that two types of linkages are formed , the methylene linkage ( through a CH2 group ) and the ether linkage ( through an oxygen ) . It is claimed that the melamine resins have properties that can not be attained by the urea-formaldehyde resins due to the triazine ring , 29 Society of Dyers and Colourists , Fibrous Proteins Symposium , 215-220 , May 1946.  | that is , the six-membered ring with alternate carbons and nitrogens shown in the structural formula for melamine . Methylolmelamines are much less soluble in water than the methylolureas , and therefore their use is more limited where a water-soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resins for fiber modification in the United States was in 1933 , at which time the firm of TootalBroadhurst Lee ( Manchester , England ) introduced an anticrease process . This firm was the outstanding pioneer in this field . They showed that cotton could be impregnated with ureaformaldehyde resins of low molecular weight , the resin pressed in and then polymerized by a short baking at high temperature . This treatment resulted in such improved resilience that the goods did not crease easily . We have mentioned the great variety of effects that can be obtained by the use of resins in the finishing of cotton . This is possible because of several variables . In order to understand this , let us look at the method of application and treatment , having in mind the factors which may be varied . When cotton or rayon cloth is impregnated with resin , ( a ) the resin may be of such a low degree of polymerization that it is completely soluble in water ; ( 6 ) it may have an intermediate degree of polymerization , but may still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be in a colloidal solution ; and ( d ) with still higher polymers it may be in colloidal dispersion . All these types of resins can be still further polymerized by heat . Thus we see that the degree of polymerization of the resin and its manner of distribution in the impregnating liquid can be varied , and each variation will give its special effect on cloth . Another variable is the concentration of resin in the liquid ; for some finishes 1% is used , and for others , 20 or 25% . The method of application can be varied . That is , a cloth may be impregnated with an 8% dispersion of resin and then run through squeeze rollers with only a light pressure ; another cloth may be impregnated with a 16% dispersion of resin , followed by a tight squeeze which would press out some resin . It is possible for these two cloths to come out with equal amounts of resin , but in the end they will differ with respect to crush resistance , abrasion resistance , elongation , tensile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left on the surface of the cloth may be removed before baking ;  | in another method it may not be removed , giving a much stiffer finish . Statements have been made that resin finishes will reduce shrinkage without loss of tensile strength . Powers30 tested several types of fabrics to show the difference between urea-formaldehyde resins and the melamines . He reports in general that both resins will reduce shrinkage in cotton , rayon , and wool cloths from 50 to 85% , but the melamines are somewhat more effective . It was found that the methylolmelamines increased the strength of spun rayon and wool considerably , but the strength of cotton was not changed . When urea-formaldehyde resins were used , the strength of spun rayon increased a little , but cotton lost about 15% of its strength . Some of his results are shown in Tables 32 and 33. figure Sheeting impregnated , dried rapidly , and cured at 300 ? F for 15 minutes . Shrinkage determined after 1 hour washing at 180 ? F. Let us summarize the production of resin finishes on cotton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , and the cloth is impregnated with this liquid and then passed between squeeze rollers , after which it is baked at high temperature . This final heat treatment polymerizes the resin to a high degree , rendering it insoluble and permanently fixed within the cloth . Since 1940 the use of spun rayon in ladies ' dress goods has increased enormously ; one reason for this is the development of resin finishes for such materials .  | QUESTIONS 1 .

What is meant by methylolmelamine ?  | Rayon fabrics and knit goods have become so widely used that the world 's consumption of rayon filament and staple fiber is second only to that of cotton . Rayon is by far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this enviable position among textile fibers , it has been designated by various names , such as artificial silk , wood silk , fiber silk , and art silk . The implication in these names is that it is a substitute for silk ( as it was originally intended to be ) . The silk manufacturers frowned on the use of these names , and a point was reached when the rayon manufacturers felt that they had a product that could stand on its own merits without the help of the word silk . The result was that , in 1924 , in the United States , groups of retailers and manufacturers sought a different and standardized name for this product , and the word rayon was proposed . In 1937 , the Federal Trade Commission published its Rayon Trade Practice Rules , which became law in the same year . We are especially interested in two of these rules , ( 1 ) the definition of rayon , and ( 2 ) the matter of brand names attached to goods made from rayon . The official definition of rayon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rayon is a generic term for manufactured fibers or yarns produced chemically from cellulose , or with a cellulose base , and for threads , strands , or fabrics made therefrom , regardless of the process used in the manufacture of such fibers , yarns , or goods . Furthermore , in order to promote fair practice and competition and protect the buying public , brand names must have the word rayon attached , as , for example , Acele rayon , Crown rayon , Bemberg rayon , Celanese rayon , etc. 210  | The British have proposed a definition for rayon which causes some confusion . This definition ' says that rayon is a generic term applied to all fibers for textile use which are not of natural occurrence . It is seen that the American plan confines the use of the word rayon to fibers made from cellulosic materials , whereas the British plan would include all man-made textile fibers such as nylon , Vinyon , Velon , and Lanital . The development of rayon since the start of the century has been a hard struggle . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so inferior to silk that no one thought it would ever be taken very seriously . It was much too weak , and when wet it lost most of its strength and would not withstand laundering . It was too bright and lustrous , and had an undesirable glare . It was so stiff that fabrics made from it would not drape . The fabrics would shrink badly and unevenly , and it was almost impossible to dye them uniformly in light colors . And yet , in spite of all these defects , the many men back of rayon persisted and struggled against all sorts of prejudices and physical and mechanical difficulties . They knew their product had to be improved , so they set about improving it . Chemical researches were instituted ; new machinery was developed ; new and better controls were established ; every effort was made to standardize all the operations in the manufacture of rayon ; time , temperature , speed of machinery , pressure , humidity , and many other conditions were put under rigid control . What have been the results ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filaments in the textile industry . It dyes more uniformly than natural fibers ; it shrinks evenly and very little ; the luster can be controlled at will , and the decrease in strength when wet is not too great . Today rayons can be laundered satisfactorily , and we find that fabrics made from rayon have draping qualities excelled by none of the other textiles . Furthermore , we have high-tenacity rayons , with a tensile strength greater than steel , which are used in cord fabrics for heavy-duty truck tires and are superior to any previously used fibers . Not only is rayon being made in the long continuous filament form , but it is being furnished in a staple form ( from 1.5 to 6 in. long ) which can be blended with cotton and wool . In other words , rayon has arrived . The figures speak for themselves . In 1946 about 950,000,000 lb of rayon were  | produced in the United States . This means that the production and use of rayon in this country is exceeded only by cotton . That is , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textile fiber . The earliest patent for the manufacture of fine threads was granted to a Swiss chemist , George Audemars , in 1855 . Twentytwo years later Sir Joseph Swan in England produced fine filaments by forcing nitrocellulose solutions through small orifices . However , the man who is recognized as the father of rayon is Count Hilaire de Chardonnet , who was the first one to produce artificial silk on a commercial scale . Chardonnet nitrated cotton with a mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 and then dissolved the cellulose nitrate in a mixture of alcohol and ether . This solution was forced through a spinneret into a chamber through which warm air was passed . The warm air evaporated the solvent so that fine filaments of cellulose nitrate were left . They were later denitrated with ammonium sulfide . Chardonnet took out his first patents in France in 1884 , and in 1891 started the manufacture of artificial silk at Besancon at the rate of 100 lb per day . ( Compare this with the production of a single plant in this country which makes 100,000,000 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years , and then in 1900 Chardonnet silk was exhibited at the Paris Exhibition . Dividends increased immediately , and in 1905 a 60% dividend was declared . Meanwhile Cross and Bevan had discovered viscose , which could be made at a lower cost , and the doom of Chardonnet 's rayon was sealed . This particular rayon was sold under such names as Chardonnet silk , Tubize silk , nitro silk , and chardonize . It was manufactured in the United States at Hopewell , Va. , but never became a very important factor in the American rayon industry and is no longer being made . In 1910 , Courtaulds of England came to the United States and organized what is now the American Viscose Corporation , which makes almost one-half the total rayon manufactured in this country . In 1921 the du Pont Company entered the field , and in 1925 Industrial Rayon Corporation started production . At that time all these companies were making rayon by the viscose process . In 1921 another British company built a plant in this country and started to manufacture an acetate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Celanese Corporation of  | America and is one of the recognized leaders in the field of acetate rayon . At the present time only three kinds of rayon are being manufactured , cuprammonium , viscose , and acetate . That is , there are three fundamentally different processes by which rayon is made . All manufacturers of viscose rayon , for example , use the same general procedures , but each has his own specialized controls , which he feels make possible the reproducing of his product day after day . Perhaps rayon 's outstanding feature is its reproducibility . It is impossible for a cotton spinner to turn out exactly the same yarn each day , because his raw material is not constant . But in the rayon industry filaments of identical fineness , luster , and strength can be produced continuously . This is the difference between man and nature . Man 's processes , tests , and machinery are not subject to weather , heat , cold , humidity , soil , rain , etc. , but natural fibers are affected by these things . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the place of silk for some purposes . It did not replace silk , nor did it cause the consumption of silk to decrease . In fact , it probably stimulated the use of silk . At any rate , the consumption of silk in the United States was doubled during the 20 years preceding 1940 . Thus we see that rayon is not a substitute for , nor a competitor of , silk . It is simply a new textile fiber which has been developed to fill a unique place in the field of textiles . Its acceptance has been so widespread that , during the same 20 years in which the consumption of silk was doubled , the production of rayon increased almost 40 times . Most of the product is the continuous filament , but within recent years there has been an increasing demand for rayon staple fiber . Regular rayon is twisted like silk to make yarns with the desired denier , but staple fiber is spun like cotton and wool to make spun rayon fabrics . Staple fiber can also be blended with wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the rayon made by the three processes and in filament or staple fiber form , it is also classified according to various factors connected with its use . For example , some are bright and others dull ; some have regular strength , whereas others have a high tenacity ; still others have a high impact resistance , crimped fiber , etc . The American manufacturers of rayon are not very numerous . figure  | Tables 34 , 35 , and 36 list these manufacturers , with the type of rayon they make , together with the special brand names for their products .

For example , 65/45 means that 45 individual filaments have been twisted to make a yarn that is 65 denier. figure To make such a yarn , the denier of each filament would have to be about 1.5 , but in 35/60 rayon yarn the single filament would be about 0.5 denier . Single filaments of rayon can be produced over a wide range of denier , from 0.5 , which is much finer than natural silk , to 5.5 , which is coarser than horsehair . The Cuprammonium Process From the standpoint of volume of production , the cuprammonium process is the least important one used for making rayon because it accounts for only about 5% of the rayon made in the
