In Melbourne , Australia , above the clutter of Flinders Street Railroad Station where 10 years ago many American soldiers met the Australian girls they married , today a 30-foot neon sign flashes warning of another invasion in 1956 . " Stop , " the sign asks , " are you an Olympic host ? Look , " the sign pleads , " 20,000 beds are still needed . " // For six years before this flashing reminder was put up , Olympic officials and devotees inside and outside Australia had been boiling with doubts whether anyone in Melbourne really wanted to play host to the 1956 Games . This summer , a mile and a half from the center of Melbourne the girders and tiers of three stadiums are rising . On the north edge of town boom cranes are swinging the prefabricated slabs of a 780-unit Olympic village into place . The doubts finally are being answered by the sweet clatter of construction as Melbourne gets ready . // Melbourne was first proposed for the job of Olympic host by some of its sports-minded civic leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia had sent competitors at least 7,000 miles to every modern Olympiad in North America and Europe , Melbourne 's supporters pointed out . Largely because of this fair argument , the international committeemen  --  most of them , anyway  --  were glad to pass the Olympic torch to Melbourne . The Aussies soon found that the big Olympic affair can be a harrowing experience for the host . // In five years Melbourne was forced to change the site of the main stadium five times , finally settling on the 80,000-seat Melbourne Cricket Ground , despite the protests of some cricket fathers that the sacred turf should not be torn up for track and field doings . The rowing site shifted from Lake Wendouree to Lake Learmonth and back to Wendouree and back again to Learmonth . The swimming pool site was changed three times and , despairing of this vacillation , the head of Melbourne 's Olympic control committee , Arthur Coles , resigned . The International Cycling Union approved a 250-meter track , then insisted on a 333-meter track . The boxing arena burned down . Quarantine officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an impracticable 6-month quarantine , so these events were broken off the agenda and consigned to Stockholm , Sweden . In the face of Australia 's housing shortage , the state of Victoria balked at the idea of wasting materials on a village for the athletes . The federal government refused to turn over military barracks since there would be no place to put the displaced military and civil servants . There were insinuations by the Victoria state government that the federal government were spoilers , and counter insinuations by the federals , and though politics never played the worst part , at times the city , state and federal governments were like Balkan states in a period of unrest . // Melbourne 's harrowing times , actually , were not much worse than other Olympic hosts experienced , but Melbourne without doubt broke all records for getting off to a bad early start in a distinctive Australian way . As the grade school books say , Australia is a far and different land , where birds laugh , fish walk on water , and outsized frogs bark like motorcycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very American . As Australia 's present Interior Minister Wilfred Kent Hughes puts it  --  and he was educated in England , competed in the 1920 Games , married a New Jersey lady , served a hitch as a Japanese war prisoner and has suffered most of the past six years as Chairman of Melbourne 's Olympic Organizing Committee : " We are the loving daughter of the Queen , married to Uncle Sam . We speak the Queen 's English , the President 's English and the ' Fair Dinkum ' English . " But in a pinch it is blunt , **26;94;TOOLONG Fair Dinkum that prevails , and an Australian pounces with equal vigor on politicians , Davis Cup players and himself . // HOWLS FROM DOWN UNDER // When Melbourne got the Games , the first howls came , Fair Dinkum , from local critics . Thinking of what Americans and Continental tourists would expect , the Melbourne Daily Sun fired away : " A luxury hotel according to present Australian definition is one which gives the same level of service as a 60-year-old coffee palace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 8,000 top hotel rooms have connecting baths , and the harshest critics believed ( judging Americans in part by American movies ) no American would put up with darting down a hotel corridor swaddled in a towel . Helsinki , the 1952 host , has far less accommodations , but that point was seldom raised in all the clamor . // The Daily Telegraph of the rival city of Sydney said about Melbourne : " The horror of Sunday in Melbourne  --  an awesome study in suspended animation . Life does not stand still in Melbourne , it falls down in a torpor . " Melbourne has no paid entertainment on Sunday . Bars close all Sunday and early on week nights . Indeed , compared to Melbourne , present-day Boston and Philadelphia are as wide open as Sodom and Gomorrah . The desperation of a Texas American in Melbourne might be such , the Daily Telegraph further speculated , that a waiter who removed a bottle at the hour when Melbourne bars turn into hollow pumpkins might well lose an arm . // At the peak of the flagrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was busy as commander of the Commonwealth Forces in Korea . Jumping into the job of executive director of Melbourne 's Olympics after Korea , the General , who is something of a Fair Dinkum talker himself , blasted back in defense of Melbourne : " A lot of bloody nonsense . Anybody who comes to Melbourne will have such a good time , he wo n't know whether it 's Sunday or Monday . " The General was mindful that in Melbourne , where there is a range of aquatic sports and more golf and tennis than in any American city of equal size , Americans manage to have a good time outside of bars . The General may also have had in mind that , though bars close , the law allows hotel guests to buy and drink anything at any hour . // The local knocking subsided , but not before leaving the outside world with the exaggerated impression that Melbourne was wallowing like a teak raft . Much of the foreign reaction was quite uncharitable . Australia 's stringent horse quarantine could have been explained by almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not the insect vectors that might ruin Australia 's livestock economy ) , but all the equestrian world got from Colonel Harry Llewellyn , leader of England 's riders , was the bitter announcement that English horsemen might switch to ping-pong . Americans clucked at the reluctance of Australian cricketers to tear up their turf , though surely those who clucked would have had the same trouble persuading the New York Yankees to tear up all the sod in their outfield . Armand Massard , president of France 's Olympic Committee , announced that he had always considered Australia a poor choice " thousands of miles from everywhere . " Los Angeles boomed out , " We 're an emergency landing field if Melbourne has trouble . " There was always some American city circling like a dingo , eager to snatch the Games if Melbourne faltered . // THE CHANGING FLAME // If everyone had stopped barking , Melbourne would still have had trouble , and so may many cities in the future if the Games continue to depart from the simple idea of good will conceived by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , Americans and Australians at the first modern Olympiad in Greece in 1896 came on their own , and some competed in events they had never tried before . The first gold medal , in fact , was won by a Harvard student who played hooky to try the hop-step-and-jump . If the Greek hosts had added a seal barking contest at the last moment , it is doubtful whether anyone would have been rude enough to object . Though held in a fine new stadium , this first modern Games retained some of the flavor of a small , impromptu party  --  no one , including the hosts , worried too much about who was invited , who came or what happened . // Much taken by the Olympic idea which stresses individual performance rather than country or old school tie , almost the whole world now joins in . An Olympiad has now become a gargantuan affair , and though very much has been written and chanted against the trend toward national rivalry , very little has been said about another unfortunate departure from the original ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incline toward the false theory that the bigger and better the show , the brighter the Olympic flame will burn . Some flames  --  the almost insatiable ones of Hollywood , for instance  --  must burn brighter and brighter and some hosts like the silver-plated princes of the Cote d'Azur perhaps must throw bigger affairs to avoid becoming social dodos . It was not meant to be , but the staging of the Olympics is becoming in itself a competition between cities of the world , with the emphasis on pleasing the tourist . Cities with a smart eye for tourist cash bid years in advance for the Games . The old idea of the individual performer has become a little lost . If the pressure continues , though many cities like Melbourne might wish the honor , only a few  --  the big booster cities of the U.S. and the big tourist cities  --  will be able to put on the show . For a few million dollars Los Angeles did a fine job as host in 1932 , setting up an Olympic village of two-room cabins for 1,700 athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabins put up at the 1936 Olympics to serve as shoddy contrast to the far superior quarters built by the Nazi hosts . No one today is quite as heavy-handed as Hitler , but they are heavy-handed . At the 1949 meeting where Melbourne won the 1956 Games , the city of Detroit might have had a chance , since it had been asking since 1936 . However , five other American cities also applied , and Detroit 's chances were killed by overhustle . In seeming desperation this year , Detroit bid for the 1960 Games , offering to pay the travel costs of all athletes . Rome won out . The Gamesstill belong to the competitors but the cities are getting their elbows on the table . // During the past year , while many outsiders were still betting Melbourne would lose the Games , Melbourne 's progress was steady , until now it compares well with that of earlier hosts , including the go-get-'em city of Los Angeles , which was assigned the 1932 Games eight years in advance and did not finish its village for 1,700 athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 6,000 athletes and officials are already under construction , and all will be finished five months in advance  --  and surrounded by a fence to keep out house-hungry Australian squatters until after the Games . New stands for the main stadium are 30% complete and when finished will give a spectator capacity of 110,000  --  the same that Hitler 's stadium held and more than any other . The minor stadiums for swimming , hockey and soccer are roughly one-third finished . Including all the small details which a proper Olympic host must look to these days  --  seven-foot beds for American basketballers , steam baths for Scandinavians , and 10 menus to suit the whole world 's odd tastes , these Games will cost over $11,000,000. // This April , Avery Brundage , the International Olympic President who pursues his Olympic business with the austere zeal of a Cotton Mather , flew down to inspect Melbourne 's progress . He was not completely pleased and on departing said so at some length . " Mr. Brundage , " Australia 's Prime Minister Robert Menzies observes , " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to Brundage and said little , feeling that his parting blast was perhaps deserved and surely good for jolting anyone who might still be dozing . This June in Paris Brundage said , " At last they are awake to their great responsibility . " At the same time , half a world away , surveying Melbourne 's Olympic construction in a clot of Australian and foreign journalists , the Executive Director of the Games , General William Bridgeford , was saying much the same in his Fair Dinkum way . " The corner is turned , " barked the General above the rattle of work . " We can look the world straight in the bloody eye . Now if you gentlemen are satisfied , let 's go have a drink of gin . " // A RETURN TO THE OLD IDEA // Over 17,000 foreigners will be coming to the Melbourne Games . Like previous hosts , to supplement its hotels , Melbourne will provide 30,000 beds in private homes . Whether this will be the biggest and best Games yet is best left to the speculation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared . It is being held in one of the two big hearts of the most sports-minded country in the world , and will no doubt derive some special richness from that fact . European countries will undoubtedly send smaller teams  --  for example , France , which usually fields about 280 will probably send around 100 . At Melbourne for the first time Australia and Asia will be able to field large teams with decent economy , and in view of that , the statement of French Olympic leader Massard that Australia is " thousands of miles from everywhere " seems to be an odd and snobbish perversion of the original idea . // Australia 's overseas airline , Qantas , has devised a safe way to fly the Olympic flame from Greece to Australia in a miner 's lamp . At Cairns , on the north Australian coast , runners will bring it the last 1,750 miles to Melbourne . To fit in a miner 's lamp , it will have to be a very small flame , which may be disappointing to some with circus-type minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but how far it could go . When it reaches Melbourne it will finally have gone all the way around the world .
