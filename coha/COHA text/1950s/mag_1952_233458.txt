Guatemala 's Congress this week passed one of the most sweeping land-reform bills ever enacted in the Western Hemisphere , and sent it to President Jacobo Arbenz . As the measure 's prime sponsor , he was expected to sign it promptly into law . <P> Backed by Guatemala 's influential Communists , the bill is designed to double the number of small landholders by expropriating larger landholders ' untilled fields . Owners of such idle lands-possibly one-third of the country 's arable acreage-will be paid off with 25-year government bonds . The bill exempts all farms of 225 acres or less and farms of less than 675 acres on which at least two-thirds of the acreage is cultivated . Also exempt , because they are cultivated : the vast banana plantations of the U.S.-owned United Fruit Co . <P> The new program promises to tear the social and economic fabric of the country as surely as did Mexico 's revolutionary land reforms . Even before the bill was passed passions blazed in capital and countryside . Near the eastern frontier , rabble-rousing organizers of the National Peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began measuring off parcels . Infuriated small farmers , swinging machetes , seized police headquarters in the village of San Jos Arada , wounding two cops . In Camotn , another band hacked a union leader to death and wounded five of his backers . <P> Nervous and obviously expecting more trouble , the government replied with increasing harshness toward the big landholders . In answer to hints that the law might bring civil war , it issued a decree last week forbidding any citizen to carry arms . And its congressional backers , led by Communist Victor Manuel Gutirrez , wrote another amendment into the bill : " Landowners who oppose the agrarian reform law by violent or subversive means will be totally expropriated by the government without regard to the limitations referred to in the law .
