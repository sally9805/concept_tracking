An unlikely gimcrack that for years has been the hottest-selling art object in Hokkaido , Japan 's northernmost big island , is the small plaster bust ( price : $1 ) of a stern-faced New England schoolmaster who died in 1887 . William Smith Clark stayed only eight months on Hokkaido , but the visit , in 1876 , was long enough for him to be enshrined by the islanders as something between seer and saint . On leave from his job as president of Massachusetts Agricultural College ( now the University of Massachusetts ) , Clark helped found the school that was to become the outpost island 's pride , its own first-rank university . Last week , as the university 's 5,300 mackinawed students settled themselves on the snow-blown campus for the year 's winter term , they slogged past an old landmark-a large statue of Clark-and a raw , new one : the shell of the still unfinished William Smith Clark Memorial Student Center . <P> Bibles &; Battles . When young , westward-looking Governor Kiyotaka Kuroda summoned Clark to set up an agricultural college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recommended Clark reverently-the island was only a few steps from wilderness . To Congregationalist Clark , the wilderness was a God-sent challenge ; he kissed his wife and eleven children goodbye and set out-with 50 Bibles in his luggage . <P> Governor Kuroda explained that Yasokyo ( Jesus religion ) was frowned on by the Mikado . Undeterred , Clark lined up his 16 students and announced firmly : " It is my intention to awake a lofty ambition in you , and to turn you into gentlemen and Christians , so that you may control your appetites and passions and thus conquer the sin of self . " The Yankee educator eased the problem of appetite control by smashing all his scholars ' sake bottles , made the students promise to shun both weed and wine and to glorify God . Classes began with hymns and prayers , and the first question on Clark 's first examination in physiology read : " Furnish evidences of the existence of one intelligent and benevolent Creator . " <P> In the evenings , while their instructor darned his socks , Hokkaido 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who ended the war as a colonel with the 21st Massachusetts Volunteers , would tell his awed audience : " At the battle of Chantilly , Virginia , on Sept. 1 , 1862 , I was surrounded by Confederates and was called on to surrender . Bullets whistled overhead ; my uniform was torn to pieces . Gentlemen , an American never surrenders . But I managed to retire , and returned to the Union forces unharmed . " When the fiery Clark left for Massachusetts , he gave his students a ringing injunction : " Boys , be ambitious ! " <P> Fish &; Physics . If Clark 's evangelism failed-there are only a few Christians among the present students-his ambition took firm root . To its agriculture and liberal arts offerings , the university has added faculties of law , medicine , engineering and economics . Last fall the university opened a new laboratory for nuclear physics . It is also bustlingly commercial , with two experimental farms , a model fishing fleet , a profitmaking cannery.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
