He was not opposed to foreign aid in general , Ohio Democrat Wayne Hays emphasized to the House during last week 's debate on the $2.9 billion foreign aid authorization bill . But he was opposed to $600,000 earmarked under the bill for Dictator Rafael Trujillo 's Dominican Republic , especially as , at the very same time , Rafael Trujillo Jr . was spending a bit of his $600,000 annual allowance on a $5,500 Mercedes-Benz and a $17,000 chinchilla coat in the U.S. for Cinemagyar Zsa Zsa Gabor ( TIME , May 19 ) . Predicted Ohio 's Hays , with spade-calling confidence in his congressional immunity : " If he keeps on fooling around with Zsa Zsa Gabor , who apparently is the most expensive courtesan since Madame de Pompadour , * the old man is going to have to raise the ante .

Flying into Washington the same day for a nightclub appearance , Zsa Zsa Gabor quickly dismissed the Congress with impeccable style : " Are the magnolia trees in blossom ? " asked the platinum-haired Hungarian of Washingtonians sensitive about their cherry blooms . " That 's the one thing I remember about this wonderful city .
