On December 15 , 1951 , a group of nineteen religious , labor , education , and - liberal leaders submitted to the General Aisembly of the United Nations a memorandum offering a constructive plan for the solution of the Arab-refugee problem . This plan calls for permanent resettlement of the Arab-refugee population in the Arab states , where there is ample land and opportunity if natural resources are developed , and for help in developing those natural resources . Under the auspices of the United Nations it would be implemented through the establishment of a $300,000,000 resettlement fund and a resources-development enterprise to which the international community might make an initial contribution of $500,000,000 , plus , of course , planning and technical assistance . In the view of the signatories , the plan serves three purposes : it will rescue and rehabilitate the hundreds of thousands of Arabs in the refugee camps , reclaim a once rich and productive region now in decay under feudal regimes , and make allies of the peoples of the Muddle East by showing then ; democracy at work for their benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete proposals , appears below . HE Arab refugee exists . His plight is tragic . His I problem is the responsibility of the international community . But it is not a responsibility which can be discharged either by protracted palliative measures or by pressure on Israel to open its doors to his return . The Arab of formerly mandated Palestine is truly a December 29,1951 displaced person . Whether or not he is classified as a refugee , he is without roots , without employment , and dependent for his daily existence upon international relief funds . Three years of palliative measures have not alleviated his misery . " The Arab refugee population is virtually destitute . The cost of maintaining them up to date has been $66,000,000 . But they are not much better off today than they were in 1948 . With the exception of Jordan , no government has proclaimed their right to stay . " This is the report of the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency to the 1951 session of the General Assembly . The Arab-refugee problem can be resolved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the vacuum to which it has been relegated , to look at it in the full context of its cause and effect , political and economic , its relationship to the peace and well-being of the area and , therefore , to the security of the world at large . Viewed thus , solutions are possible which can become permanent and redound to the everlasting benefit of the refugees themselves and of the entire Middle East . Proposals I The Arab states occupy an area of some 1,200,000 square miles . Although there are large desert tracts , it is potentially one of the richest areas in the world . Much of the /and is unoccupied , a large part underdeveloped . A number of Arab states urgently require additional pop-563 ulation , through immigration , to develop the great natural wealth with which nature has endowed them . We therefore propose that : 1 . In recognition of their responsibility to share in solving the Arab-refugee problem , the Arab states , principally Iraq , Syria , Jordan , should assign for the purposes of Arab refugee resettlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underpopulated , which are capable of being developed to support a substantial population . 2 . A definite assignment of specific land should be made to each Arab refugee family to be settled . 3 . An orderly transfer of Arab refugees to the areas designated should be undertaken . 4 . The transfer of Arab refugees should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations . 5 . The provision for housing and other requirements to establish the foundation for ultimate self-maintenance should be made by the U. N. resettlement agency . 6 . As part of the undertaking , also under the auspices of the United Nations , a program for the retraining of the settlers , as necessary , should be undertaken . 7 . The transfer and settlement of Palestine Arab refugees should be financed by an international fund created for this purpose in the sum of $300,000,000 . II Israel , occupying an area of 8,100 square miles , which in three years has been compelled to absorb 700,000 Jewish refugees  --  almost equivalent in number to the Arab refugee population  --  half of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Africa , can not reabsorb the Arabs who fled its borders . But it can , and indeed has offered to , contribute to a fund for Arab resettlement . We therefore propose that : Upon the establishment of the Resettlement Fund and agreement as to its scope , Israel shall be requested to make a fair contribution to that fund by way of compensation for abandoned Arab land in Israel . In arriving at the compensation total , account should be taken of Jewish property losses during the Palestine war and the property of Jewish refugees from Arab states seized or frozen by those states . III All experts are agreed that the reintegration of the Arab refugee population in the Arab countries can be accomplished only if simultaneously there is an improvement of living standards and employment possibilities for the whole area . We therefore propose that : 1 . A five-year program should be undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations to develop the natural resources of the area as a whole . Specifically , that a series of projects similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) of the Jordan River serving Israel . and Jordan ; ( b ) of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers serving Syria and Iraq ; and ( c ) of the Litani River in Lebanon . 2 . A Resources Development Commission should be established to plan and carry out this program . 3 . An international fund of $500,000,000 , as an initiating fund , should be established to begin the development of the natural resources of Syria , Iraq , Jordan , Lebanon , and Israel , and such other areas as may be designated by the Resources Development Commission . 4 . Liaison should be established between the U. N. Commission for the Resettlement of the Arab Refugees and the Resources Development Commission , with a view to the coordination of plans and programs . IV To carry out undertakings of the scope envisaged , a prerequisite is stability . Stability requires a permanent peace settlement between the Arab States and Israel . We therefore propose that : The United Nations should call upon the Arab states and Israel to negotiate and conclude a peace settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T HE plans proposed are in accord both with reality and with the provisions of the Charter . They are also based on practical precedents . Since 1919 the transfer of populations has been accomplished as a means of resolving a number of thorny problems . One of the most successful undertakings of this kind was the transfer in 1923 , under the auspices of the League of Nations , of 1,250,000 Greeks from Turkey in exchange for about 355,000 Turks . The League of Nations launched a loan to finance the provision of land , homes , and work for these refugees . The transfer of the Arab population of Palestine to Arab land is not a new idea . The exchange of the Arab population of Palestine with the Jewish populations of the Arab countries was proposed in 1937 by responsible British statesmen and favored by the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations as an effective way of resolving the Palestine problem . In practical effect , such an exchange has been taking place . During the Palestine war in 1947-48 , Palestine Arabs fled from their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab states . The Jewish populations are fleeing from persecution in the Arab states and finding refuge in Israel . The resettlement of the Arab refugees is a formidable undertaking . But it is much simpler to resettle them in Arab lands where identity of language , tradition , and culture exists than to return them as an alien minority to Israel , where new homes and livelihood would have to be provided in any event . The implementation of the program envisaged , by removing so large a cause of friction , should , moreover , stimulate and render more effective the concurrent efforts of the United Nations to bring about the negotiation of a peace settlement between the Arab states and Israel . Can the Arab States Absorb the Arab Refugees ? That this is feasible is the view of many experts . The U. N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees , in its 1951 report , underscores that the region , despite its present backwardness , has enormous potential possibilities . " It not only contains nearly one-half of the world proved oil resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has large areas of cultivable land , part of which were in previous centuries the homelands of large and prosperous populations , while other parts have never been seriously developed at all . " Moreover , the experts believe that if the capital investments were made for the development of the natural resources of these areas , the undertakings , in time , would produce the revenues to pay for the outlay . By the introduction of irrigation , modern farming techniques , and the harnessing of water resources , four Arab states ? Iraq , Syria , Jordan , and Lebanon  --  could support many millions of people , in addition to their present populations , on a highly improved standard of living . For two of these states , Iraq and Syria , an increased working population is imperative if they are to develop their own resources . Syria and Iraq , occupying a land area of 182,000 square miles , and with a population of less than 8,000 , - 000 , in ancient times supported a population of many millions more , and were granaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board , headed by Nelson Rockefeller , holds that , under proper development , Iraq alone could absorb an Arab refugee population of 750,000 . Responsibility for Arab Plight . In seeking a solution for the Arab-refugee problem , the international community must remember the circumstances under which that problem arose . The war of the Arab states against the U. N. resolution of November 29 , 1947 , is responsible for the present situation . The records of the U. N. show that the Arab states prevented an independent Arab state , provided for in the partition plan , from coming into being in Palestine ? a state which might in time have become capable of satisfying the needs of its population . And Arab leaders summoned the Arabs of Palestine to a mass evacuation , as the documented facts reveal . Wby Israel Can not Abu-orb Arab Refugees . That Israel did not expel the Arabs is confirmed by countless Arab sources . When the Arab attacks on Palestine began , the Haganah , and subsequently the Provisional Government of Israel , made every attempt to prevent the Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleas were not heeded . Israel 's refusal now to permit the return of the Arab refugees stems from the following fads : 1 . Such abandoned Arab villages and dwellings as are fit for human habitation are now occupied by Jewish immigrants . 2 . Israel still feels it is threatened by its neighbors . No peace settlement has yet been concluded . On the contrary , Arab demands for a second round against Israel continue to be heard , and no Arab government has offered to abstain from working for Israel 's downfall . 3 . The presence of a large Arab minority , which would be more responsive to the sentiments of the surrounding Arab states than to that of Israel , would render Israel insecure . 4 . Israel , in the three years of its existence , has absorbed a Jewish refugee population about equivalent in numbers to the Arab refugee population . Half of the 669,518 Jewish immigrants ' which the state has received since 1948 are Jews in flight from persecution and op- , pression in the Moslem lands of the Middle East and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1951 , to September 1 , 1951 , they accounted for 71.5 , per cent of the immigration to Israel . For Israel to absorb the Arab refugees would be to dislocate the economy of a state - which in the space of three years has been compelled to fight a war of defense , establish itself under democratic constitutional forms , and open its doors to almost 700,000 Jewish refugees . Indeed , its very existence would be threatened . Problems Responsible for Creation of Israel Still Exist . Further , the United Nations should review the circumstances under which it authorized the creation of Israel . The Jewish state was sanctioned by the U. N. in 1947 as a means of providing refuge , home , and rehabilitation for the pitiful survivors of Hitler 's extermination program , who , two years after the war 's end , had found neither home nor safety . When World War II ended , it was found that six million Jews had been massacred in Europe . Of some 1,111,000 survivors , one-third found their way to displaced-persons camps . The remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as charnel houses , to the frightful memories of mothers , fathers , sons , and daughters put to death in gas chambers , burned to death , starved to death , done to death'in labor gangs . Few countries of the world opened their doors in the period before the outbreak of hostilities in Europe to admit those Jews who might have been saved . And even at the close of the war no countries offered to receive the tragic remnants . Not until Israel was established did the work of rescue and rehabilitation begin . Since 1947 the need for migration of Jews has grown more , not less . One Million Jews Seek Safety in Israel . During the past six years , Europe has seen a revival of anti-Semitism which has stimulated the fears of the remaining Jews and produced an . enormous push toward Israel . To these have been added hundreds of thousands of residents of Jewish communities thousands of years old  --  communities in Moslem countries throughout North Africa and the Middle East  --  who today have become the victims of physical attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hitlerism . In the North African countries many of the communities had known . terror of Nazi occupation or Vichyite discrimination . Overwhelmed with the memories of so recent an oppression , these latest victims of Moslem oppression are seeking escape . The only door open to them is that of Israel . Today the new state is confronted with the problem of receiving between 700,000 and 1,000,000 Jews of Europe , North Africa , and the Arab countries , and offering them homes and rehabilitation . Israel Shoulders an International Responsibility . Should Israel fail , the responsibility for these Jews would , of necessity , devolve upon the international community . In offering them asylum , Israel is thus relieving the world of a burden and a duty it otherwise would be compelled to assume . To continue this work , Israel requires , first and foremost , peace . Second , it requires space to receive and settle the new victims of oppression . The 8,100 square miles Israel occupies can not be expanded , but neither can it be asked to accept the return of hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled its area . Third , it requires help in developing its natural resources and those shared jointly with Jordan . In three years Israel has spent one-fifth to one-quarter of its national income on immigration and agricultural settlements for the Jewish refugees . On these two undertakings alone , as of August , 1951 , this amounted to U125,000,000 , or approximately $370,000,000 . A review of the expenditures of only six voluntary agencies cooperating with Israel shows they spent $419,000,000 Together , conservatively estimated , Israel and these see voluntary agencies have already spent $789,000,000 for the transport , training , settlement , and rehabilitation of the Jewish refugee population . The actual total is probably well over one billion dollars . On some 41,000 Arab refugees in Israel , the government of the Jewish state has spent $11,000,000 , one million dollars more than all the Arab states together have spent on the entire Arab refugee population . Both the Arab and Jewish refugee problems must be solved . Neither can be solved at the expense of the other . W E PEOPLES who are still free face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Advisory Board . " One is military aggression and subversion . The other is hunger , poverty , disease , and illiteracy . " The proposals suggested are designed to meet this second major threat . Loyalty to democratic principles can not be commanded in a vacuum . It can ' be won from peoples only after experience of democratic practice . When the yoke of feudalism has been lifted from the backs of the peoples of the Middle East , they may well become the loyal allies of the democratic world against military aggression and subversion . But they can not become a bastion for democracy until they have been reclaimed from feudalism . Left in the status quo , they present a focal point of danger . The United Nations faces a great challenge . It is pledged " to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , " and " to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom . " By being greatly daring in this critical area , it can greatly advance major objectives of peace , security , and larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
