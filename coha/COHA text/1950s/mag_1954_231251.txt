She was the strangest lady on Fifth Avenue . Her face looked a little like a reduced version of Elsa Lanchester 's , her flower-covered , tubular body was rooted in the ground , and for a hat she wore a fragment of a vase full of spreading greenery . She looked like Maud who had finally come into the garden and been left there too long . The lady was all clay , and the creation of Denmark 's Bjorn Wiinblad ( rhymes with keen blot ) , one of the brightest ceramists in the business . <P> A one-man show of Wiinblad 's work last week transformed the third floor of Georg Jensen Inc. , the Manhattan emporium of Scandinavian good taste , into a strange place , half fairyland and half Punch cartoon . Puckish faces were everywhere , and they bore a remarkable resemblance to the artist-bright-eyed , point-nosed , with an expression of gaiety rampant . The show included chummy centaurs bearing candles , chubby wood nymphs lurking in the shrubbery , birds that never were , sinuous but homey maidens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navel flower-decked , sat sidesaddle aboard a centaur , who was chiefly interested in some birds . She looked piqued . <P> Though they might easily be insufferably cute , Wiinblad 's figures are always redeemed by a caricaturist 's humor and a painter 's technical skill . Also in the show : textiles with Wiinblad faces that look like otherworld creatures peering from flying saucer portholes , and a collection of bright , bold posters ( Wiinblad has done them for everybody from Danish music societies to the Marshall Plan ) . Standout poster : an exhortation to Danes to be musical ( " Play Yourself " ) , showing a sprightly young lady playing a bow across strands of her hair , an almost perfect illustration of a famed T.S . Eliot line ( " A woman drew her long black hair out tight / And fiddled whisper music on those strings " ) . <P> Artist Wiinblad , 35 , was a struggling painter of children 's portraits who worked as a typesetter to round out his diet during the Nazi occupation of Denmark . Friends at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he defied the Nazi curfew to slip into the school at night to work at the kilns . After his first ceramics show proved a critical and popular success , he started his own shop with three kilns and two helpers . They worked long and seriously through the week . But on Saturday they had fun , making spontaneous , gay pieces . Since then , these have become the regular product of the Wiinblad kilns . Says Wiinblad : " Now every day is Saturday .
