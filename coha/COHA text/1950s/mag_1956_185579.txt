REMEMBER THE HOUSE ( 241 pp. ) - Santha Rama Rau-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> <P> The intertwining of two processes-the coming of age of a sensitive . girl and the coming of age of an equally sensitive nation-makes a compelling novel . Santha Rama Rau , who writes English ( Home to India ) with the flourish of conquest , portrays newly freed India through the mind of Indira ( " Baba " ) Goray , daughter ( as is Novelist Rau ) of a rich and respected Indian politician . The story transpires in Bombay , in the hill country of the north , and among the elaborate Victorian palaces of the Indian rich on the Malabar Hill . Baba and her sophisticated schoolgirl friend turn their wary eyes on the fantastic events in which , trancelike , the Indians accepted the Nehru raj from Lord Louis Mountbatten , the last British viceroy . Baba teeters girlishly between the superstitious past ( as a child she had retched over a dead fish 's eye , which she tried to swallow in order to summon up strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dull , enlightened father , who talks like an instructor in social science . <P> Dinner After Dinner . As Baba moves to her formal Indian betrothal , the characters of Nehru 's India pass her eye . With the cruelty of youth and the precision of familiarity , Baba ticks them off . There is the strangely pathetic princeling drinking his schooners of champagne and serving a New Year 's meal consisting of a complete Western dinner followed by a complete Indian dinner . There are the bony peasants , the compounds full of servants and relatives related in intricate ways , the Congress politicians sidling for jobs , Goanese musicians with their " desperate nattiness , " mystical followers of that " tough realist , " Gandhi , and-most exotic of all-the Americans . <P> Baba and her friend have a private word-hysteria-for anything of which they disapprove . It is a word they use particularly often in reference to Americans . Yet Baba finds herself entranced by two Americans-Courtney and Alix Nichols , who betray the un-Indian heresy of being in love in the romantic Western pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Indian servants place a chair of honor for her , she insists on sitting on the ground . She will love the Indians , if it kills her-and them . Soon , of course , she is an expert on saris and embarrasses everyone by insisting on wearing one at an East-West social function . Most comical of all , the Indians ' rich , aristocratic , complexion-conscious Brahmans and Parsees of Bombay resent her modish suntan . <P> More Than Diplomats . Thus , cleverly , Santha Rama Rau puts in a novelist 's terms an Indian psychological dilemma , which in the terms and the person of Nehru irritates the West : just as the British were disliked more for their law and the incorruptibility of their lawgivers rather than for their conquest , so Americans seem to be disliked and resented for their quixotic good will rather than their " dollar imperialism . " In the presence of envy , gratitude is impossible .
