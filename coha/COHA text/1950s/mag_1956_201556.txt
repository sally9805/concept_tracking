BEYOND THE AEGEAN ( 260 pp. ) - Ilias Venezis-Vanguard ( $3.50 ) . <P> Some novels unwind like a spool of thread , others are woven like a basket . A spool-of-thread novel simply asks to be followed to reveal its meaning . A basket novel , on the other hand , is fashioned to cradle its meaning , and that meaning may be as evanescent as a mood or as intangible as a memory of a bygone time and place . Beyond the Aegean is a basket novel , and its artful strands hold an evocation of pastoral serenity , the life of the Greek community in Asia Minor before the coining of World War I , a conflict that made Turkey Germany 's ally and sparked the massacres and mass expulsion of the Greeks in the early 1920s . <P> Author Venezis , 52 , a topflight Greek novelist and playwright , is himself Anatolian-born , and he fled Asia Minor with his family at the age of ten . Hence his novel carries the dual poignance of a forec'osed childhood as well as a lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost casually tells of a small boy 's wonder , an old man 's passion tor the land , and a folk wisdom that blends faith with superstition , legend with reality . <P> A Pantheon of Presences . Of a hot summer 's day , Peter , the novel 's narrator likes to rest his boyish cheek against the black Anatolian earth and study the ants at their interminable labor , or watch a falcon wheeling lazily in the sky . Back of his grandfather 's farm towers a mountain range from which the region takes its name , the Kimindenia . Up in the topmost crags of the Kimindenia lives Peter 's private deity , the great eagle , which soars even above pelting storm clouds to seek the sun . To Peter the mountainside is a pantheon of presences , for his mother tells him that every tree has a soul . <P> Heart and soul of the farm itself is Grandfather Jannako , a rugged patriarch of 70 . Each evening grandfather reads the clouds like omens to foretell tomorrow 's weather . Then he closes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men the trees and the flocks . " The hardships of nature are the law of life on the Kimindenia , a life as archaic , simple and untutored as that of the days of Hesiod or Homer . The measured cycle of the seasons plays counterpoint to less stately rhythms of blood . Roving guerrilla bands of smugglers , with their glittering rifles and black fur caps , raid the passing camel caravans and spur their foaming horses into the night . Yet for old Jannako , young Peter and the good people of the Kimindenia the world is rooted in " unalterable peace . " <P> A Sense of Life . A bullet in Sarajevo murders the peace . As World War I breaks in on them , the children weep sensing only that " the song of our childhood was over . . . and so , without knowing it , we were the first to mourn that summer 's day of 1914 .

Fortunately , he has avoided stuffing it with sentimental gewgaws , and filled it instead with an abundant sense of life and an unforced sympathy with humanity 's lot that carries far beyond the Aegean .
