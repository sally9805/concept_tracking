" It is the fairest land that eyes have beheld , " wrote Christopher Columbus when he discovered the Caribbean island of Jamaica in 1494 . This winter 100,000 sun-seeking North American tourists are discovering Jamaica and echoing Columbus . The lush British colony , only three hours by air from Miami , is the Temperate Zone dweller 's vision of Eden : white sand beaches and an emerald surf , blue mountains and waterfalls in the distance , a green landscape of palms , banana and sugar cane , splashed with gaudy contrasts of scarlet poinciana blooms , yellow and coral bougainvillaea vines and fragrant orchards of mangoes , limes and tangerines . <P> Unlike most other islands of the impoverished Antilles , Jamaica can boast of more than sunshine and scenery . By the low living standards of the Caribbean , Jamaica 's 1,500,000 inhabitants are comparatively well off . Jamaica 's soft-spoken natives ( 80% Negro ) look healthy , clean and sleek beside the ragged poor of neighboring islands . Most of them wear shoes , and at least 70% can read and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kingston ( pop . 155,000 ) , a city of paved streets , department stores , supermarkets and good restaurants . <P> Balanced Budget . Jamaica 's moderate prosperity is new-found and self-made . Britain , whose absentee landlords drained fat profits from the place with regularity after the British routed the Spaniards* in 1655 , did not grant Jamaica limited self-government until 1944 . At that time the island was so run-down that a visiting British commissioner called it " a dung heap of physical abomination . " <P> Still under a British-appointed governor , but with an elected local Assembly running most of the island 's affairs , Jamaica has come along fast . The government is now headed by Chief Minister Norman Washington Manley , 62 , the West Indies ' most successful lawyer before he entered politics in 1938 . Under his shrewd eye , Jamaica balances its $60 million annual budget . Money that Britain used to spend to bail the island out of debt is now funneled into " extras " like land development schemes and the newly built University College of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , almost wiped out by disease during the early ' 40s , was rescued by development of a disease-resistant variety , and exports have doubled in the past eight years . During and after the war , Jamaica expanded its sugar planting and built up a $21 million-a-year British market ( and a current surplus that may soon force a compulsory cutback ) . Rice , a staple food that had always been imported , was grown locally under government direction , and production was boosted to the point where Jamaica is now nearly self-sufficient . In trying to encourage manufacturing , the government granted special inducements to foreign capital to build local factories . Island plants now employ some 20,000 and satisfy much of Jamaica 's needs for cement , shoes , clothes , soap , paint , canned goods , furniture .
