( See Cover ) In Guatemala , a lush , green little country only 1,000 miles from the U.S .. anti-Communist and pro-Communist forces were locked in battle this week . What kind of war was it ? Guatemala 's Communist-line government called it " aggression " and " invasion , " and shrilled accusations against its neighbors , including the U.S. The lightly armed insurgents who moved in over the eastern border from Honduras called themselves the Army of Liberation , took for their motto " God and Honor , " and urged all true Guatemalans to join them against the government and its Red friends . The first actual shooting came as insurgent aircraft strafed fuel tanks and airfields and dropped a few homemade bombs . Days later , two infantry task forces of a few hundred men each fumbled their way toward each other in the bush near a sleepy town called Zacapa and opened the ground fighting . The battle picture was obscure , but the government claimed that it had 3,000 men in " a general offensive " against 2,000 rebels along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rushed headlong into combat . Both knew that the outcome would almost certainly depend on whether the regular Guatemalan army , some 6,000 strong and not at all Communist , stuck by the government or swung over to the anti-Communist cause . But whether the Guatemalan clash swelled into bitter and prolonged civil bloodshed or petered out in anticlimax and frustration , the issue was nonetheless clearly drawn . Guatemala , in its special way , was a small-scale sequel to Korea and Indo-China . and the world knew it . Even the United Nations Security Council stirred into action ; it held its first Sunday emergency meeting since the June 1950 session on Korea . <P> " Supreme Chief . " The invading anti-Communist rebels were mainly Guatemalans who had been driven into exile in recent years . Their leader , emerging from almost total obscurity , was Carlos Castillo Armas , 40 , sometime colonel in the Guatemalan army , who had been jailed in Guatemala City in 1950 after an attempted revolt , but tunneled spectacularly out of prison and fled .

He also began quietly collecting arms , money and men . <P> No one had given his plans for " liberating " Guatemala much chance . But suddenly last week he was calling himself " Supreme Chief of the Movement of National Liberation , " and doing his best to look like it . From his Tegucigalpa house , boxes of arms appeared and were loaded into trucks . Soldiers were recruited , and promised pay of $2.50 a day . The force thus swiftly mobilized was uniformed in fresh suntans , and airlifted ( in commercial DC-3s , at $400 a flight ) to Macuelizo , Copan and Nueva Ocotepeque . Honduran hamlets on the Guatemalan frontier . <P> The way of the campaign 's beginning was certainly unlike any hot-war fighting of recent times . There were no tanks or artillery , and for that matter , no roads for such luxurious military equipment to move on . The army that gathered along the unpatrolled jungle border that first afternoon could have made no sense except against the background of Central America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry men with rusty Mausers and machetes.
