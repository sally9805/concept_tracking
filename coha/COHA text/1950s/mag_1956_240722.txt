In the grey German summer of 1948 Joseph Stalin reached out to strangle helpless Berlin , and U.S. planners , although caught unawares , responded with a monument to man 's ingenuity : the Berlin Air Lift . In late summer 1956 Western Europe faces a challenge that dwarfs Stalin 's Berlin blockade . The great question : How , if Egypt 's President Nasser closes down the Suez Canal-either by force or bungling-will Western Europe get the oil that is blood to its industry and life to its economy ? The answer : a Suez Sea Lift . <P> As in 1948 the burden of action falls on the U.S.-a fact that both Britain 's Prime Minister Eden and Secretary of State Dulles clearly recognized in their public statements last week . But this time U.S. planners will not be caught napping . Since last May experts of the State , Commerce , Interior and Defense Departments and the Office of Defense Mobilization have been charting their course . In August , within a fortnight after Colonel Nasser 's Suez seizure , the ODM had in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out in detail by a crack Middle East Emergency Committee ( made up of representatives from 14 top U.S. oil companies ) . <P> Vital Statistics . The plan envisions the most immense operation in oil logistics in human history . The Suez Sea Lift calculates that Western Europe 's oil deficit would be made up in two major ways : <P> 1 ) By routing tankers 11,254 nautical miles around the Cape of Good Hope from Persian Gulf ports to Western Europe . The trip would require more than 30 days , as against the 12-or 13-day journey through the Suez and Mediterranean ( see map ) . <P> 2 ) By vastly increasing the exports to Western Europe of U.S. , Caribbean and Canadian oil . <P> Western Europe 's present daily oil imports total about 2,500,000 bbls . Of that , about 2,000,000 bbls. , or 80% , come from the Middle East . Tankers carry about 1,200,000 bbls. a day through the Suez ; the other 800,000 bbls. are sluiced through pipelines to Mediterranean ports and pumped aboard tankers there . Assuming that Nasser does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipelines ( which would virtually amount to an act of war ) , Western Europe can concentrate its worries on finding a way to make up for the loss of the 1,200,000 bbls. now shipped through the Suez . <P> The Suez Sea Lift calls for moving some 800,000 bbls. of Middle East oil daily around the Cape of Good Hope-a schedule that U.S. planners consider well within reason . The other 400,000 bbls. would come from increased Western Hemisphere production , most of it from the U.S. Current U.S. production stands at about 7,000,000 bbls. a day-with an available productive capacity of 2,000,000 more . The Venezuelan government last week announced that it stands ready to shove up its oil production by 500,000 bbls. daily ( U.S. experts believe , however , that 200,000 would be closer to the feasible mark ) . <P> Where the paper work leaves off the grave problems begin . The two greatest : tanker transport and dollars .
