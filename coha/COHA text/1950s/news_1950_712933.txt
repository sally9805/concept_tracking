txt Continued expansion of employment in almost all areas of the nation during the early summer months was forecast today by the Labor Department 's Bureau of Employment Security . Further gains in the field of manufacturing are expected . Robert C. Goodwin , director of the bureau , reported that employment for the months between January and March rose in threequarters of the nation 's major production centers and in two-thirds of the areas where unemployment had been heaviest . He noted that this was in sharp contrast to the situation a year ago when unemployment was on the rise in nine out of every ten major areas surveyed . " As a result of this reversal in labor market trends , " he said , " there are good prospects that 1950 will be a better employment year than last . " Mr. Goodwin said that total civilian employment at the seasonal mid-year peak would probably come to at least 60,000,000 , but he cautioned that this post-war goal on jobs , first attained in 1947 , was no longer adequate in the face of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bureau of 100 major production centers , completed April 28 , revealed that there were four " A " areas , where unemployment is less than 3 per cent ; seventeen " B " areas , where unemployment stands at between 3 and 4.9 per cent ; twenty-one " C " areas , showing unemployment between 5 and 6.9 per cent ; forty-six " D " areas , having unemployment between 7 and 11.9 per cent , and twelve " E " areas , where unemployment exceeds 12 per cent . In January there were only one " A " area , fourteen " B " areas , twenty-two " C " areas , fifty " D " areas and thirteen " E " areas . Another bureau survey , covering sixty-three smaller labor market areas , tested only when unemployment exceeds 7 per cent , produced thirty-three " D " areas and thirty " E " areas as of the same date in April . Mr. Goodwin said that these statistics , when boiled down , indicate that , while employment is increasing and is likely to increase further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . " Employers interviewed by state employment security agencies , he said , were generally optimistic , however , about job prospects through early summer . While three-quarters of the 100 major production areas anticipate increasing payrolls , Mr. Goodwin said that one out of every four of these areas expects the increase to be great . " Food processing begins its spring rise in many areas in May , " he said . Textiles and apparel were not expected to follow a set pattern , with some areas forecasting a further rise and a few holding steady or cutting back . Leather and rubber products usually fall off seasonally by later spring . The metal-working industries will show a sharp rise as workers return to Chrysler plants after settlement of the strike and other motor vehicle companies continue to expand . Primary and fabricatedmetals establishments anticipate additional increases and machinery concerns expect to hold steady or make moderate expansions . Only three areas predicted substantial manufacturing losses : Miami ( food and apparel ) ; Tampa ( food ) , and Charleston , S. C. ( fertilizer ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
