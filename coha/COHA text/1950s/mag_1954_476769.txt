A CASE can readily be made that , with the single exception of the Civil War , no event of the past hundred years so deeply impressed itself upon the thoughts , attitudes , and voting behavior of the American people as the Great Depression . This importance is hardly reflected in the dignity with which history treats of the tragedy . The climactic stock-market crash which launched the depression ? and which was considerably more important in relation to what followed than the shots at Sumter ? occurred only twenty-five years ago this month , but it hasalready receded far into the mists of memory . One measure of this neglect is the widespread and quite erroneous assumption that there was one day in October 1929 when the great crash occurred . Another indication is the total absence of agreement as to what day it was . Thus Thursday , October 24 , the first day on which panic seized - the market , has regularly been cited as the Black Thursday of the crash . But the professionals have always leaned to the following Monday or Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of trading reached its all-time incredible high . Others have picked still other days . In a hook explaining the debacle , Professor Irving Fisher of Yale ? Professor Fisher as the acknowledged prophet of the boom was left with much explaining to do ? singled out October 21 as the day of catastrophe . ( On that clay trading was very heavy but the declines relatively modest . ) The authorized ' biographers of Herbert Hoover , in 1935 , refused to settle on any one day bin ? along with the twenty-ninth ? picked October 23 and October 26 . ( The twenty-third was the day preceding Black Thursday ; the twenty-sixth was a Saturday when things were tolerably quiet . ) Not , certainly , since the siege of Troy has the chronology of a great event been so uncertain . As a matter of fact , economic history , even at its most violent , has a much less exciting tempo than Military or even political history . Days are rarely important . All of the autumn of 1929 was a terrible time , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaluable aid of hindsight it is possible to see that throughout all of the early months the stage was being set for the final disaster . Four-Year-Old Bull 0N THE first of January 1929 , the Coolidge Bull Market was at least four years old . The New York Times average of the prices of twenty-five representative industrial stocks which had stood at 110 at the beginning of 1924 had eased up to 135 at the beginning of 1925 . At the close of trading on January 2 , 1929 , it was at 338.35 . Apart from mild setbacks notably in early 1926 and early 1928 , this climb had been almost uninterrupted . There were very few months when the averages did not show an improvement on the month preceding . There had been , in short , a speculative upsurge of unparalleled magnitude and duration . There were some reasons for thinking that 1929 might be different . For one thing , Mr. Hoover would replace President Coolidge in the White House in March and , in the narrow political spectrum of the day , that meant a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hoover himself has testified , knew nothing and cared less about the speculative orgy in which the country was indulging itself . ( A few days before leaving office he assured the country that things were " absolutely sound " and that stocks were a good buy at current prices .. ) Moreover , the instrument through which Mr. Coolidge would have had to act was the Federal Reserve Board , and in his time the possibility of this body 's initiating any drastic measures was remarkably slight . Its authority , constitutional and moral , was shared with the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York .. The Chairman of the Board , one Daniel R. Crissinger , had become a central banker by grace of the doctrine , which had held sway a few years before , that what was good enough for Marion , Ohio , was good enough for the country . His colleagues , with one exception , have been described by Mr. Hoover , with his characteristic conservatism , as mediocrities . In his memoirs , Mr. Hoover suggests that , by the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become practically an obsession with him . This was a fairly wellkept secret , for the market hailed his election in November with the wildest advance to date , and a day or two before he took office in March there was a fine upsurge which was dubbed the " inaugural market . " However , Mr. Hoover did know what was going on , and late in 1927 Crissinger had been replaced by Roy A. Young , a more substantial figure . There was now at least a chance that an effort might be made to restrain the speculation . Truitt , remained , however , the problem of what could be th-le ? and at what cost . Stocks , overwhelmingly , were being bought on margin . That meant that someone had to put up as a loan the part of the price which the purchaser was n't paying . The task of the Federal Reserve was to get control of the funds that were being thus used to finance the speculative purchase- of securities . But the rates on these broker 's loans were high ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade under 7 per cent . Seven per cent with near-perfect safety and your money available on demand is a very decent return . Individuals and especially corporations were finding this an increasingly attractive outlet for surplus cash , and the Federal Reserve had - no obvious way of checking this source of money for the market . However , in many respects this was a detail . There was the much more inconvenient question of whether any control could be exercised which , if effective , would n't bring an awful smash . It is easy enough to burst a bubble . To incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is an operation of undoubted delicacy . Collapse and an ensuing depression would be unpleasant for , among others , those who were blamed for bringing them about . This was sensed if not seen . Yet , there was the danger that if the bull market were allowed to go roaring along there would eventually be an even more violent crack-up . So early in 1929 the monetary authorities began debating the relative merits of sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Secretary Mellon was passionately for inaction ; Governor Young and a part of his Board were for action although there was dispute on the particular controls to be invoked . The issue was never decided , but the knowledge that the debate was going on began On the first of June the Times industrial average ? industrial stocks were the locus of the heavy speculation ? stood at 342 ; by the first of July it was 394 : on the first of August it was 418 ; when the market reopened on September 3 after the Labor Day holiday it reached 452 . This was a gain of 110 points ? 25 per cent ? in ninety days . The New York Times financial section on September 3 ran to fifteen full pages . Call money rates were 9 per cent ; the rediscount rate at the Federal Reserve Bank increased in August , was 6 per cent . Later in the week it was announced that brokers ' loans had reached the remarkable total of $6,354,000,000 . ( In the preceding three months they had been increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) However , the end was near , although never so far from being in sight . On September 5 there was a new break and the industrial averages fell about ten points . The nervousness of those who wanted both to stay to the last and get out in time was admirably indicated by the cause of this setback . It followed a statement by Mr. Roger Babson on September 4 that " Sooner or later a crash is coming and it may be terrific . " ( The drop was promptly labeled the Babson Break . ) All honor must go to Mr. Babson for his historic omniscience , although it deserves to be added that he had been making similar predictions at frequent intervals for some four years . T HE market was ragged the rest of September and into October . There were days of strength , but there were also days of weakness and generally speaking the direction was down . In the arresting terminology of the time ? as used in this instance by the Wall Street Journal ? " Price movements in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major advance temporarily halted for technical readjustments . " Others even spoke of the possibility of a further drop , although mostly to explain why it could n't happen . And no one should suppose that the old enthusiasm was gone . On September 20 the New York Times reported that " Investors and speculators alike appear keen for ' new names . ' . . . An example of this is in the Lehman Corporation which was offered at $104 and yesterday sold at $136 . . . . Another is in the new Midland MAGAZINE Marine , whose offering at $60.00 or thereabouts a share has not yet been made but which yesterday commanded $85.00 in the over-the-counter market . " On October 8 , from Germany , Charles E. Mitchell announced that " nothing can arrest the upward movement in the United States , " and a week later , on taking the boat for home , he helpfully added that the market was now " in a healthy condition " and that " values have a sound basis in the general prosperity of our country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that ? stocks had reached a " new high plateau , " and Time Magazine , young and not yet omniscient , got ready its issue of October 28 with a cover story on Ivar Kreuger . ( The following week it featured Samuel Instill . ) The Shakes 0 N SATURDAY , October 19 , Washington dispatches reported that Secretary of Commerce Lamont was having trouble finding the $100,000 in government funds which would be required to pay the upkeep of the yacht Corsair which J. P. Morgan had just given to the government . ( Morgan 's deprivation was not unbearable ; a new $3 , - 000,000 Corsair was being readied at Bath , Maine . ) There were other and more compelling indications of an unaccustomed stringency . The papers told of a very weak market the day before ? there were heavy declines on late trading and the Times industrial average had dropped about seven points . Meanwhile , that day 's market was behaving very badly . In the second heaviest Saturday 's trading in history , 3,488,100 shares were changing hands . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Sunday the break was front-page news ? the Times headline read , " Stocks driven down as wave of selling engulfs market . " The Times financial editor , who along with the editor of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle had never wavered in his conviction that the market had gone insane , suggested that , for the moment at least , " Wall Street seemed to see the reality of things . " The news stories featured two other observations which were to become wonderfully familiar in the next fortnight . It was said that , at the end of Saturday 's trading , an exceptionally large number of 76 HARPER 'S should be a buyer for everyone who seeks to sell . October 24 , 1929 showed that what is mysterious is not inevitable . Often there were no buyers , and only after wide vertical declines could anyone be induced to bid . The morning was the terrible time . The opening was unspectacular , and for a little prices were firm . Volume , however , was large and soon prices began to sag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell farther and faster , and the ticker lagged more and more . By eleven o'clock what had been a market was only a wild scramble to sell . In the crowded hoard rooms across the country the ticker told of a frightful collapse . But the selected quotations coming in over the bond ticker also showed that current values were far below the ancient history of the tape . The uncertainty led more and more people to try to sell . Others , no longer able to respond to margin calls , were sold . By 11:30 , panic , pure and unqualified , was in control . 0 UTSIDE on Broad Street a weird roar could be heard . A crowd gathered and Police Commissioner Grover Whalen dispatched a special police detail to Wall Street to insure the peace . A workman appeared to accomplish some routine repairs atop one of the high buildings . The multitude , assuming he was a would-be suicide , waited impatiently for him to jump . At 12:30 the visitors ' gallery of the Exchange was closed on the wild scenes below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his customary genius for being on hand with history . He was the former Chancellor of the Exchequer , Mr. Winston Churchill . It was he in 1925 who returned Britain to a gold standard that substantially over-valued the pound . To help relieve the subsequent strain the Federal Reserve eased money rates and , in the conventional though by no means unimpeachable view , it thereby launched the bull market . However , there is no record of anyone 's that day having reproached Winston for the trouble he was causing . It is most unlikely that he reproached himself . Economics was never his strong point . At noon , however , things took a turn for the better . At last came the long-awaited organized support . The heads of the National City Bank , Chase , Guaranty Trust , , ... MAGAZINE and Bankers Trust met with Thomas W. Lamont , the senior Morgan partner , at 23 Wall Street . All quickly agreed to come to the support of the market and to pool substantial resources for ' this purpose . Lamont then met with reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the day 's events in Only Yesterday described as one of the most remarkable understatements of all time , " said : " There has been a little distress selling on the Stock Exchange . " He added that this passing inconvenience was " due to a technical situation rather than any fundamental cause , " and he told the newsmen the situation was " susceptible to betterment . " Meanwhile , word had reached the Exchange floor that the bankers were meeting and succor was on the way . These were the nation 's most potent financiers ; they had not yet been pilloried and maligned by the New Dealers . Prices promptly firmed and rose . Then at 1:30 Richard Whitney , widely known as a floor broker for Morgan 's , walked jauntily to the post where Steel was traded and left with the specialist an order for 10,000 shares at several points above the current bids .. He continued the rounds with this largesse . Confidence was wonderfully revived , and the market actually boomed upward . In the last hour the selling orders which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net loss for the day ? about twelve points on the Times industrial averages ? was far less than the day before . Some issues , Steel among them , were actually higher on the day 's trading . H OWEVER , this recovery was of distant interest to the tens of thousands who had sold or been sold out during the decline and whose dreams of opulence had gone glimmering along with most of their merchantable possessions . It was eight and a half minutes past seven that night before the ticker finished recording the day 's misfortunes In the board rooms speculators who had been sold out since early morning sat silently watching the tape . The habit of months or years , however idle it had now beCome , could not be broken at once . Then , as the final trades were registered , they made their way out into the gathering night . In Wall Street itself lights blazed from every office as clerks struggled to come abreast of the day 's business . Messengers and board-room boys , caught up in the excitement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police arrived to quell them . Representatives of thirty-five of the largest wire houses assembled at the offices of Horn-blower and Weeks and told the press on departing that the market was " fundamentally sound " and " technically in better condition than it has been in months . " The host firm dispatched a market letter which stated that " commencing with today 's trading he market should start laying the foundation for the constructive advance which we believe will characterize 1930 . " Charles E. Mitchell announced that the trouble was " purely technical " and that " fundamentals remained unimpaired . " Senator Carter Glass said the trouble was due to Charles E. Mitchell . Senator Wilson of Indiana attributed the crash to Democratic resistance to a higher tariff . Weekend Calm ON FRIDAY and Saturday trading continued heavy ? just under six million on Friday and over two million at the short session on Saturday . Prices , on the whole , were steady ? the averages were a trifle up on Friday but slid off on Saturday . It was thought that the bankers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired while shoring up the market . Not only were things better , but everyone was clear that it was the banking leaders who had made them so . They had shown both their courage and their power , and the people applauded warmly and generously . Commenting on Fri-clay 's market the Times said : " Secure in the knowledge that the most powerful banks in the country stood ready to prevent a recurrence of panic the financial community relaxed its anxiety yesterday . " From other sources came statements of reassurance and even of self-congratulation . Colonel Leonard Ayres of Cleveland thought . no other country could have survived such a crash so well . Eugene M. Stevens , the President of the Continental Illinois Bank , said , " There is nothing in the business situation to justify any nervousness " ; Walter Teagle said there had been no " fundamental change " in the oil business to justify concern ; Charles M. Schwab said that the steel business had been making " fundamental progress " towardstability and added that this " fundamentally sound condition " was responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman of the Baldwin Locomotive Works , declared that " fundamentals are sound " ; President Hoover said that " The fundamental business of the country , that is production and distribution of commodities , is on a sound and prosperous basis . " H. C. Hopson , the head of Associated Gas &; Electric omitted the standard reference to fundamentals and said it was " undoubtedly beneficial to the business interests of the country to have the gambling type of speculator eliminated . " ( Mr. Hopson , himself a speculator , although perhaps more of the sure-thing type , was also eliminated in due course . ) A Boston investment trust took space in the Wall Street Journal to say , " S-T-E-A-D-Y Everybody ! Calm thinking is in order . Heed the words of America 's greatest bankers . " A single dissonant note , though great in portent , went completely unnoticed . Speaking in Poughkeepsie , Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt criticized the " fever of speculation . " On Sunday there were sermons suggesting that a certain measure of divine retribution had been visited on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was evident , however , that almost everyone believed that this heavenly knuckle-rapping was over and that speculation could be now resumed in earnest . The papers were full of the prospects for next week 's market . Stocks , it was agreed , were again cheap and accordingly there would be a heavy rush to buy . Numerous stories from the brokerage houses , some of them possibly inspired , told of a fabulous volume of buying orders which was piling up in anticipation of the opening of the market . In a concerted advertising campaign in Monday 's papers , stock-market firms urged the wisdom of buying stocks promptly . On Monday the real disaster began . The Failure of " Organized Support " TRADING on Monday , though in great vol- ume , was smaller than on the previous Thursday-9,212,800 as compared with the nearly thirteen million . But the sustained drop in prices was far more severe . The Times industrial average was down 49 points for the day . General Electric was off 471/2 ; Westinghouse , 341/2 ; Tel . &; Tel. , 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than that of all the preceding week of panic . Once again a late ticker left everyone in ignorance of what was happening save that it was bad . At 1. : 10 there was a momentary respite ? Charles E. Mitchell was detected going into Morgan 's and the news ticker carried the magic word . Steel rallied and went from 1931/2 to 19S . But this time Richard Whitney did not appear ; " organized support " was not forthcoming . Support , organized or otherwise , could no longer contend with the wild desire to sell . The market weakened again and in the last hour three million shares changed hands at rapidly declining prices . The bankers assembled once again at Morgan 's and remained in session from 4:30 to 6:30 . They were described as having a " philosophical attitude , " and they told the press that the situation " retained hopeful features . " But there was a more important clue to what was discussed for the two hours . It was explained at the conclusion that it was no part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market . Their operations were confined to seeing that the market was orderly ? that offers would be met by bids at some price , and that " air holes , " as Mr. Lamont clubbed them , would not be allowed to appear in the market . Like many lesser men , Mr. Lamont and his colleagues had obviously found themselves overcommitted . The time . had come to go short on promises . It was also chilling news . To the man who held stock on margin , disaster wore only one face and that was falling prices . He wanted to be saved from disaster . Now he must comfort himself with the knowledge that his ruin would be accomplished in an orderly and becoming manner . T UESDAY , October 29 , was the most devastating clay in the history of the New York stock market , and it may have been the most devastating in the history of markets . Selling began at once and in huge volume . The air holes , which the bankers Were to close , opened wide . Repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders and no buyers at all . Once again , of course , the ticker lagged ? at the close it was two and a half hours behind . By then 16,410,030 shares had been known to have beentraded ? more than three times the number that had once been considered a fabulously big day . ( On an average good day last summer sales were running about three million shares . ) Despite a closing rally on dividend news , the losses were again appalling . The Times industrial averages were down 43 points , canceling all of the huge gains of the preceding twelve months . Losses on individual issues were far greater . By the end of trading , members were near collapse from strain and fatigue . Office staffs , already near the breaking point , now had to tackle the greatest volume of transactions yet . By now , also , there was no longer quite the same certainty that things would get better . Perhaps they would go on getting worse . Slaughter of the Well-to-Do uRnsie the preceding week , the slaughter had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealthy ? the men of affairs and the professionals ? who were experiencing the egalitarianism long sup- posed to be the first fruit of avarice . " Where the board rooms were crowded the week before , now they were nearly empty . The new victims had facilities for suffering in private . The hankers met at noon and again in the evening of the twenty-ninth , but there was no suggestion that they were philosophical , In truth , their prestige had been falling even more disconcertingly than the market . During the day the rumor had swept the Exchange that , of all things , the " organized support " was busy selling stocks , and Mr. Lamont met the press after the evening session with the trying assignment of denying that this was so . It remained for Mayor James J. Walker to come up with the only constructive proposal of the day . Addessing an audience of motion picture exhibitors , he asked them to " show pictures that will reinstate courage and hope in the hearts of the people . " On the Exchange itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best be reinstated if the market were closed and everyone were given a breathing spell . This simple and forthright thought derived impressivefurther support from the fact that everyone was badly in need of sleep . The difficulty was that the announcement of the closing of the Exchange might simply worsen the been a tendency to decry the importance that this attributes to the stock-market crash as a cause of the depression . The crash was part of the froth , rather than the substance of the situation . A depression , it was pointed out , had been in the making since midsummer of 1929 , when numerous of the indexes began to turn down .. In this matter the history hooks are almost certainly right . The market crash ( and , of course , the speculation that set the stage ) was of profound importance for what followed . It shrank the supply of investment funds and , at the same time , it shocked the confidence on which investment expenditure depends . The crash also reduced personal expenditures and deeply disrupted international capital flows and international trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt and very real . Nothing else is a fraction so important for explaining the severity of the depression that followed . Since it was important , the question inevitably arises whether a similar cycle of speculation and collapse could again occur . The simple answer is of course ! Laws have been passed to outlaw some of the more egregious behavior which contributed to the big bull market of the twenties . Nothing has been done about the seminal lunacy which possesses people who see a chance of becoming rich . On the assumption that history does not repeat itself precisely , we may never again see the particular lunacy of the late twenties . But if we survive to suffer such things , we can undoubtedly count on some variation . The time to worry will he when important people begin to explain that it can not happen because conditions are fundamentally sound .
