Man of the Year <P> Sir : <P> . . . There can be only one choice-Sir Edmund Hillary , the man who got to the top . <P> <P> PATRICK BARNES <P> Tripoli , Libya <P> Sir : <P> . . . It is very difficult to forecast your possible selection this year , because no outstanding figure emerged during the year . Eisenhower , Brownell , McCarthy , Adenauer , Pope Pius XII ( he is always in the running because the Roman Catholic Church does most to counteract Communism ) , Malenkov , Truman , and the ghost of Harry Dexter White are all possible selections . . . Somehow , I can already see Joe McCarthy 's face staring at me from your first issue in 1954 . <P> <P> FINBARR M. SLATTERY Asdee , County Kerry , Ireland <P> Sir : <P> Nominate anyone-except Harry S. Truman or Joseph McCarthy . <P> <P> R. N. POWELL <P> Mobile , Ala . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Either of two men deserves the title . . . Chancellor Konrad Adenauer or Lieut . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vedado , Havana , Cuba <P> Sir : <P> How about the Piltdown Man ? <P> <P> ELLEN ANDREWS <P> New York City <P> Sir : <P> . . . Ramon Magsaysay of the Philippines . . . <P> <P> WILLIAM MAKINSON <P> Ellicott City , Md . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . Mr. Dick Tracy . . . Here is a man <P> who has contributed his all . <P> <P> MURRY GORDON <P> Brooklyn , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . The prisoner of war , both categories : Allied , who in overwhelming numbers , in spite of months of insistent propaganda , demanded repatriation ; Chinese and North Korean , who in overwhelming numbers , with no organized program of propaganda , rejected repatriation . <P> History is likely to show that this is one of the decisive events of modern times . It has given the free world a victory infinitely more important than would have been the reconquest of all North Korea . <P> <P> ( THE REV . ) PAUL G. BRETSCHER New Orleans <P> Smoking Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes a day TIME , Nov. 30 . . . Thank goodness I have Blue Cross and kept my G.I. life insurance ! . . . <P> <P> GEORGE WRIGHT <P> Chestnut Hill , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> All doctors will applaud your courageous and pertinent article on cigarette smoking . This should effectively confound the " unnamed specialists " . . . who report via TV and radio that there are no harmful effects to the cigarette smoker . . . Cancer is but one of many possible results under present investigation by groups throughout the country . . . While it is probably true that suburban or city dwellers are in general heavier smokers than those in rural areas , no true conclusion can be reached until a frank appraisal of the grave problem of air pollution can be made . <P> <P> ROBT . B. MARIN , M.D. Montclair , N.J. <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . You ask-what to do about it ? You fail to mention the obvious way . . . Stop smoking ! . . . <P> <P> TIBBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
