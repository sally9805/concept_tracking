THEY HANGED MY SAINTLY BILLY ( 3 12 pp. ) - Robert Graves-Doubleday ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> The English love a poisoner . When he is a doctor and a sporting man at that , they dote on him . They nearly made a national festival of it when , 100 years ago , Dr. William Palmer of Rugeley died a sportsman and a poisoner to his fingertips . On June 14 , 1856 , a crowd of 30,000 jostled and bargained for a good view of the scaffold outside Stafford Gaol , miners caroused in the taverns , and when Palmer died without a struggle , they cried , " Cheat ! Twister ! " , for they had come to see him kick at the end of the rope . Britain 's Robert Graves , poet , novelist , fabulist and all-round man of letters , has now issued a lively post-post-mortem report on the whole affair . <P> The words of the title- " They Hanged My Saintly Billy " - were uttered by Dr. Palmer 's mother . It was the death of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy-saintly or otherwise-to book . The friends ' financial transactions were more snarled up than the accounts of a waterfront loan shark , but it seems that Dr. Palmer stood to gain by Cook 's death . One night they met in The Raven Hotel , Shrewsbury , to toast the victory of a nag called Polestar . The scene , as Graves engraves it , is worthy of Cruikshank . " Will you take another glass ? " asked Cook of Palmer . <P> The doctor replied : " Not until you down yours . You must play fair , old cock . " <P> Cook downed his brandy and water , and later complained : " I 've been sick as a cat . I do believe that damned Palmer dosed my grog , for a lark . " He was dead a week later . Soon there were whispers about the deaths of 13 other people who had been connected with Palmer : patients , drinking companions , relatives , his wife ( a possible suicide ) . The literary-minded might make cracks about " The Charnel House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " never killed nobody , " was the victim of prejudice and circumstantial evidence in the Cook case . In other hands this story might be merely one of those Sunday-supplement series called " Did Justice Err ? " But Old Pro Graves has written a fine cross section of early Victorian life . With his flair for period and his ear for dialogue-he gives a wonderful Dickens-Surtees flavor to his reconstructed conversations-Graves proves once again that a born writer can make a readable book out of an old laundry ticket , or the yellow pages of a court record .
