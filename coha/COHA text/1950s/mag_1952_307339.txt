The honor of a La Scala premiere is great , but the abuse is often greater . Verdi-happy Milan audiences , traditionally suspicious of new operas , have vented their scorn at scores of composers , including Puccini , whose Madame Butterfly took a fearful drubbing in 1904 , and Menotti , whose Consul was hooted last year ( TIME , Feb. 5 , 1951 ) . Last week a handsomely dressed full house in the 174-year-old Teatro alla Scala gave another honored visitor the works . <P> Argentina 's foremost composer , Juan Jos Castro , * 57 , had reason to believe he would fare pretty well . A panel of distinguished judges , including Stravinsky , Honegger and La Scala 's principal conductor , Victor de Sabata , had picked his Proserpina and the Stranger over 137 other entries ( 16 from the U.S. ) in La Scala 's international contest for the best three-act opera . A philosophical soul , Castro was surprised but not overwhelmed at winning the contest . Said he : " I am always prepared for things not to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the lottery . " He got enthusiastic applause when he stepped to the podium to conduct . But almost with the first notes the clouds began to gather . <P> The curtains pulled back on a curious scene . The stage was split by two large pillars ; on either side stood a robed and hooded chorus of commentators , eerie in green and violet light . The action took place on a center stage created between the pillars , and much of it was violent-a skirmish between Proserpina 's lover and the police , an old-fashioned hair-pulling and biting scene between Proserpina and her jealous rival , and near the end , a rooftop death battle between a stranger and Proserpina 's evil friends . Musically , Composer Castro offered only a dissonant mosaic . There were vigorous Latin rhythms and fresh and sometimes stringent harmonies , but no big , powerful themes , and only snatches of anything hummable . <P> After the first act , the tension broke . Out came the whistles ( the ultimate in Italian expressions of disapproval ) . Partisans took up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the podium to begin the second-act prelude , he had to wait a full two minutes , back to the audience , for the din to die down . Before the opera was over , his critics were shouting , " Viva Verdi ! " , " Viva Wagner ! " and even " Coca-Cola ! " - from one listener who seemed to have North and South America confused . <P> Proserpina got six curtain calls . Said well-satisfied Composer Castro , calmly eating an orange after the final curtain : " Everything was very well organized , even the opposition . " <P> * Who is officially ignored in Argentina : in 1946 , he published an open letter declaring that Peronismo was leading the country to " utter confusion and ruin . "
