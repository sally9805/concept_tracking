And Other New Auto Features To Come <P> To auto engineers and designers , the sparkling new cars in the showrooms are history . What excites them are the radical changes soon to come . When will all cars have brakes to stop a car automatically as it nears an obstacle ? Are carburetors obsolete ? How soon will the gas turbine replace the piston engine ? <P> Some of the changes are soon to come . The automatic radar brake will be one of the most startling changes to be introduced by one automaker on 1957 models . The brake will be operated by a radar screen , built inconspicuously into the radiator grill . As the radar-equipped car approaches any object ahead , e.g. , another car or a garage door , the radar screen will flash an impulse to the brakes , which will slow down or stop the car . The mechanism will be geared to take into account the speed of the car as well as the distance . For example , the radar car would be halted with a jolt if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the slowing car were a few hundred feet ahead , the radar car would be braked easily . The radar brake can make electroni cally fast decisions for the driver who is inattentive or slow to react , can be canceled when necessary by stepping on the gas , e.g. , if the driver decides to pass the car ahead . - <P> But the greatest engineering change in next year 's models will be less spectacular ; it will be the replacement of the carburetor by a fuel-injection system by at least one automaker . Long used in aircraft and racing cars , fuel injection has been thought too tricky and expensive for stock cars . But the rapidly rising cost of the new four-barrel carburetors has closed the cost gap while several practical stock-car systems have been developed . In present carburetors , gasoline is mixed with air , then sucked into the cylinders through the manifold . With a fuel-injection system , small pumps attached to each cylinder spray the fuel-air mixture under pressure directly into the firing chamber . With better engine breathing and more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at low speeds , more effective horsepower and more gas mileage . <P> Fuel-injection systems , which may take years to reach all cars , will probably be the last major refinement of the present piston engine . The great change will be the turbine engine . But the first engine will probably not be a true gas turbine . It may well be a " free-piston engine , " a combination of the piston engine and turbine . The idea of the engine is old , but only recently have automakers been able to eliminate many of the bugs . In the present engine , the pistons turn the crankshaft as the explosions in the cylinders drive them down , thus transfer power to the transmission and move the car . In the free-piston engine , there is no crankshaft . Instead , there are two pistons , at opposing ends of the cylinder , which force gas at tremendously high pressure into a turbine . The turbine , in turn , transmits power to the wheels through a simplified transmission . By eliminating the crankshaft and a complicated transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horsepower by friction , thus is more efficient all around . <P>
