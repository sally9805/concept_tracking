More than any other single competitor , Austria 's Anton ( " Toni " ) Sailer held back the new giants of winter sport . Cortina 's only three-time gold-medal winner ( giant slalom , slalom and downhill ) , handsome Toni Sailer was the undisputed hero of the Winter Olympics . Thousands of his countrymen crossed the border to watch him schuss to victory , his well-known white cap topped with streamers , his bright white smile gleaming under dark goggles . His quick reactions to trail conditions underfoot were what set him apart from other top skiers . " He feels the snow through his skis , " they said . " I have snow in my veins , " said Toni . <P> For all Toni 's skill , days before the games ended the Russians were far enough in front to throw a victory party . All the medals they had won were reawarded by the Soviet National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate cakes . Later , there were still more medals , still more cakes for the Russian hockey team , which provided the last big surprise by beating Canada 2-0 to take the Olympic title .
