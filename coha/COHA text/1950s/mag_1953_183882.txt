Dozens of swept-wing F-86 Sabre jets streaked north across the Korean battle-line one morning last week , climbing steadily but slowly to conserve fuel . At the Yalu at 45,000 feet they found what they were looking for , and Russian-made MIG-155 began falling from the sky . In the afternoon the Sabres went back to the job . By nightfall they had destroyed 15 MIGs , set a new record for a single day 's action ( previous record : 13 MIGs downed on July 4 , 1952 ) , and brought the month 's MIG total to 74 . Delighted , the Fifth Air Force 's new boss , Lieut . General Samuel Anderson , announced that in 75 days the Sabres had shot down 143 MIGs , with only one Sabre lost in air-to-air combat . <P> Last week 's big day belonged to the aces . Back in harness was Major James Jabara , who became the first jet ace in 1951 , to shoot down his 13th and 14th MIGs . Colonel James Johnson , 37-year-old commander of the Fourth Fighter-Interceptor Wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vermont Garrison , 37 , who shot down eleven Nazi planes in World War II , got his ninth MIG the same day . Among the younger aces who added to their scores was Captain Ralph Parr , 28 , who flew 165 fighter-bomber missions on his first Korean tour in 1951 . Said Parr after destroying his seventh MIG : " I waited two years for this , and I 'm going to make the most of it . "
