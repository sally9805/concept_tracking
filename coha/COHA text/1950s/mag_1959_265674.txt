The Steel Strike <P> Sir : <P> How long are we going to maintain the fiction that the steel strike is a strike against the steel companies ? At one time strikes were largely against the owners , but now , at least the big strikes are against the general public . <P> <P> STEPHEN J. BUTLER Aurora , Colo . <P> <P> Sir : <P> We now find our progress limited and our security threatened by the unbridled greed of organized labor , against which our laws provide little or no protection . <P> Three crippling industry-wide strikes have been imposed on us by the steel , copper , and dock workers . Nearly all of us are workers , but we can recognize greed when we see it . Clearly none of these strikes are justified this year . <P> <P> THOMAS W. MITCHAM Tucson , Ariz . <P> <P> Happy Equation <P> Sir : <P> I am not at all unhappy about being a " compensation , " and I suppose I do n't mind being a " sort of Ivy League Dracula " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell a compliment better than anyone I have ever met . No , all I really have to complain about is that I think you underrate Clark Gable in the Oct. 12 review of But Not for Me ; he 's really a deceptively good artist . That 's all-but if overrating me goes with underrating him , then God praise the equation . TONY RANDALL <P> Los Angeles <P> Progress in Atrocities <P> Sir : <P> Your Oct. 12 article on Red China 's Liu Shao-chi is quite interesting , but you fail to present the actual side of progress and improvement . It is the side of approximately 500,000,000 people being helped in conquering hunger . <P> The " Big Leap Forward " was and is a miscalculation by a regime that is still trying to pull the correct strings of economic and political statesmanship . China is potentially strong ; it is a country which , whether we like it or not , will give us a great deal of trouble in its growing process . But this process can not be halted any more , regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRUNWALD <P> New York City <P> Sir : <P> A round of applause is in order for Boris Chaliapin for his cover . Never has there been a lexical or pictorial representation of degradation of human dignity of such impact as his composition of the ant colony of human beings . <P> <P> JERRY WALTER <P> Salt Lake City <P> Sir : <P> <P> How do you translate the slogan on the cover see cut ? <P> <P> P. M. BAYNE <P> Wolfville , N.S. <P> <P> I It says " Support peace . " - ED . <P> <P> Over Twenty One <P> Sir : <P> Re the kiss-and-tell TV contestants of the ill-famed quiz shows Oct. 19 : it takes at least two to make a bargain , crooked or otherwise . <P> <P> MARK L. JOHNSON <P> Fort Worth <P> Sir : <P> The crucifixion of Charles Van Doren is horrible testimony to the immaturity of our culture . Having idolized a brilliant man , people now ridicule him as they discover he is not the god they pretended but very much human . Van Doren did n't glorify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC apparently believes in a **28;11741;TOOLONG policy . It is frightening , regardless of how the game Twenty One was played , that an organization with such power in choosing vast quantities of ideas to be presented on TV to the American people can practice such an un-American ideal . <P>
