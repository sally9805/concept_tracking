Everything was kosher at the Archbishop of Canterbury 's Lambeth Palace garden party in London last week . Men came in grey toppers and morning coats , and women in summery prints . As they chatted on the velvet lawn , two experts made sure that the twelve gallons of fruit juice , 3,000 sandwiches , 2,500 pastries and 30 pounds of cake conformed with Jewish dietary laws . <P> The occasion was the climax of a series of grand occasions held to celebrate the 30Oth anniversary of the Jews ' return to England . And it was hard , among the Jewish peers and their ladies , the Rothschilds and Montagus , Samuels and Cohens , to remember the sad past that made it only 300 instead of 900 years . <P> Cattle for Milking . William the Conqueror welcomed the Jews to England . Trade then was mostly barter , and William felt that the money-handling Jews-would play a much-needed role in the economy of his new kingdom . <P> By the middle of the 12th century the lot of the Jews was growing hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old slander that Jews murdered Christian children in their rituals . In 1210 King John threw all the Jews into jail and extorted a ransom for their liberation , and from then on the barons usually treated them as a herd of cattle for milking . Several times , England 's Jews were " sold " by the King to British lords , who were then entitled to squeeze as much as they could from them . In 1290 Edward I gave the 16,000 of them that remained a little more than three months to get out . <P> In the 17th century the Puritan movement brought a wave of millennialism , and with it the notion that for Christ 's second coming the Jews must be liberated and perhaps even converted . Cromwell , impressed less with the Messianic than the political and economic advantages of taking the Jews back , allowed them to resettle and establish a synagogue ( though no formal decree was ever issued ) . <P> Security &; Scope . " We have come a long way , " said the Very Rev. Dr. Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Commonwealth , in his tercentenary address . Some samples of the progress : today there are approximately 450,000 Jews in the British Isles ( about .88% of the total population ) who worship in 450 established synagogues ; 13 Jewish peers sit in the House of Lords and 19 Jews in the House of Commons ; two hold high government jobs-the Marquess of Reading is Minister of State for Foreign Affairs , and Baron Mancroft is Under Secretary of State for Home Affairs . Of the 110,000 British Jews who served in the armed forces during World Wars I and II , 12,000 were killed and eight won the Victoria Cross . <P> Said Prime Minister Anthony Eden in a speech at London 's Guildhall ( in principle , Jews were not permitted to join England 's ancient guilds ) : " Let us freely acknowledge that they have richly repaid their welcome . " <P> <P> *An occupation forced on the Jews of Europe in the Middle Ages by the Christians , who were forbidden to lend money at interest - but not to borrow it .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
