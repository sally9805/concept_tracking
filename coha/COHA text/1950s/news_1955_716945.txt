txt Bernard Baruch told the Senate Banking ' Committee the stock market Price boom is due mainly to three factors . The " dranlatio  --  expanalon and improvement of so many industries " in recent years , the confidence of the people In business and the cumulative effects of inflationary policies " of the Government over the last 15 years . " If any economic danger threatens . today , " he said , it will be found not in the stock market itself . but in the effects of this inflationary heritage . " With Mr. Baruch 's testimony , the committee ended the first round of its stock market study and the top members promptly disagreed on its accomplishments and its future . Chairman Fulbright ( D. , Ark. ) said he felt the study had not turned up any " major abuses " in the market iequIring any " urgent legislation . " and added : " I did n't expect to find any when we started . " He said legislation was " not the primary objective " of the study , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maid he thought the initial phase had accomplished this and had drawn attention to problems involved In the stock market . Capehart Notes Lost Opportunity But Sen. Capehart ( R. , Ind. ) , the ranking Republican member of the committee , again attacked the aims of the study . He said after the hearing yesterday he thought that the committee had lost a " great opportunity " to study the market from the standpoint of Mr. Bauch 's views . " Even today , " he said . " we got into what I consider not the purpose of these hearings " The questions put to Mr. Baruch ranged at times far afield from the stock market . Mr. Capehart said he was standing on his former statement that the aim of the study - is to embarrass the Eisenhower Administration and undermine confidence in business by trying to paint a picture that aspects of the situation are the same now as those leading up to the crash of 1929 . ? ' Mr Fuibright 's statements to reporters after the session indicated he expects the committee to continue its study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information it has received and then scheduling a second round of hearings on specific subjects it wants to explore further . Others Differ But other committee members were less certain there would be more hearings . One top Republican who declined to be quoted declared flatly the study was " over , " and at one point Sen Robertson W. , Va. ) hinted in questioning Mr. Baruch that he might be the last witness . The chairman , on the other hand , said he " may nave ovhrstated the case " when he remarked last week that the injection of politics into the hearings had made them " ap.parently futile ! He said his mad sincethen " indicated interest and a considerable favorable reaction " to the study . " I think the approval is reassuring . " he said . Mr. Fulbright said suggestions for legislative action had been received from witnesses . the public , committee members and " even members of the Senate . " These suggestions . he said , concerned " everything from a motion to recall a witness to urgent demands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses . " He said testimony had revealed " some difficulties , such as tipsters , " but he did not think they called for " urgent legislation . " All suggestions will warrant serious consideration ? Mr. Fulbright stated . Now that the initial hearings are over , he said , the committee can digest the information received and relate it to problems the committee must resolve , " search our minds for solutions and determine what our future course should be . " He said the committee will meet in executive session in the near future and decide " what priority it will accord various subjects of the inquiry . " Asked whether the committee would call Louis Wolfson and Sewell Avery , who are fighting over control of Montgomery Ward , to appear before the committee , Mr. Fulbright said there were no plans to call them before Ward 's annual stockholders ' meeting April 22 . How ever , he added , it 18 a matter for the committee and hence is " subject to change . " In his prepared statement , Mr. Baruch told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " And no one , he added , can predict the course of the stock market with any certainty . The rise and fall of stocks is determined " by innumerable forces and elements , " he said . Largely because of the 1029 crash , Mr. Baruch told the committee . " the impression has been built up that the stock market is the cause of booms and busts . Actually , it is the thermometer , not the fever . " The stock market . he said . registers the judgments of buyers and sellers as to what business is like today and what it will be like in the future . Symptoms Are n't Causes " Bpt outward symptoms should not taken for fundamental causes , " Mr. said " The thermometer should not be blamed for reflecting all the uncertainties " of the world situation , business actions , or inflationary pollcies. he declared . Mr. Baruch said people invest in stocks for two opposite reasons : " In hope and cord/ ? dence in the future , or in fear that the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasnn stock fluctuations today are sin puzzling is that both these motivations are so active , he said . He noted that many businesses have increased " enormously in value " m recent years . " This is evidence of a sound economy , " he said , but complained that , white the nation has not yet stopped the rise in national debt , taxes have been reduced . Abuses of the stock market can be eliminated through regulations , Mr. Baruch declared , but the ' only real protection the small saver or any group can have is through the preservation of the credit and security of this country . ' ' " No form of regulation that may be proposed can take the place of sound Government policy , " he said . Mr. Baruch remarked he had appeared before the Banking Committee more than any other . In almost every instance , ' he said . it has been to discuss inflation . War Upon War " If this has been the central economic problem of our lifetime , it is mainly because during the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into a war or coming out of one . " he said . Turning to the market situation , he said that because of the expansion in the volume of money and credit , larger sums are available for investment , thus shortening the supply ci ? stocks . Contributing to this . he said , are a number of " structural changes in the stock market " over recent years . He listed some of these as the expansion of Industry through retained earnings and tax write-offs ; growth of investment trusts and mutual funds ; entry of institutions Into the market ; further stimulus to stock demand from growth of tax-free pension funds and tax exempt foundations , and the fact that the capital gains tax makes many investors reluctant to sell their holdings . " Let me add , " he said , " I do not favor any reduction in the capital gains tax at this time . " Mr. Baruch said no one has made a thorough study of how these changes have altered the market . Such a study he said , " might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee 's work . " The net effect of these changes so far " appears to have been to drive the market upwards . " " But one must ask , " Mr. Baruch declared , " whether these same factors could not serve to aggravate any serious downward trend , It such a ? trend were to develop . " He said the full implications of " every form of tax exemption should also be reexamined . " Steep tax rates are more and more determining business decisions . he said , which makes tax exemption " more far ranging In its economic impact . " " However , after these and other changes are surveyed , " he said , we still find the most important single factor determining behavior of the . market remains the condition of the economy , which in turn is dominated by the cold war . " Mr. Baruch said the committee hen received a number of suggestions as to what should be done about the market . Some have value . he said . " although I would caution against attempting to legislate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped make America great . " He said the committee should " weigh most carefully " whether what has been happening in the market " is not in large part a response to the effects of inflation . " Mr. Baruch rhetorically asked : " Mutt kind of dollars is one to use to measure the price of stocks ? If inflation is to persist , many stocks may be under-priced today " In any case . he told the committee its study " should not lead anyone to forget that in the main  --  the Mock market Is a mirror of the economy . " " If our general economic and security policies are sound . " he said , ? " the stock market will adjust to them and we will not need to worry about a possible collapse . If we do not preserve our national security and our national credit , then nothing can have lasting value . " He told the committee the nation should de- termine what the national security require ; " and then do it " ; forego SU tax reductions until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " discipline ourselves to whatever is required to win the cold war and a real peace . " " Given an effective shield of defense . " Mr. Baruch said , " we can build an economy which can continue to support the freedoms we cherish . By replacing the fear of inflation with the confidence of stability we can stand guard as long as may be needed . " He added that the nation today has " something that is priceless  --  a stable government and a belief in that government by its people . " " No Expert Any Good " Asked whether margin requirements are right at the moment , the witness said " I 've been arou.id a good many years and never answered that question . " Reminded that he was considered an expert by the committee , he said : " As your expert witness . I tell you no expert is any good on that subject . " Mr. Baruch said he thought at least one factor leading to the past year 's rise In the market was the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go higher after the tax was taken off , " he explained . Sen. Capehart ( R. , Ind. ) wanted to know whether tipsters , such as broadcasters , should ' be controlled . Mr. Baruch maid the Senator might just as well name names . " because everyone knows whom you 're talking about  --  Walter Winchell . " Then he added : You ca n't control a man 's opinion . Every day we Ilea opinions In the newspapers about who'n going to win the pennant , or the fight . " " There 's no reason why a radio men should n't do it if he thinks it wino . I would n't do it , " Mr. Baruch said as the audience chuckled , " I do n't know enough about it . " If Walter Winchell was a friend of his , he said . " I 'd say do n't do it , because it 's hard ta-preclict . But I see nothing sinister or im proper about it . " In reference to a statement by Mr. Baruch proposing a study of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. ? Ma. ) asked whether the presint " study " useful . Mr. Baruch said he thought the Banldnig Committee was " quite capable of recommendaUons that would be very helpful . " Among this things he thought should be studied were *I growth of Investment trusts , mutual funds , and mono ' in the hands of insurance cents parties . He noted that " the private individual does n't have much chance in the market against these things . " Mr. Baruch gave quite a different opinion of confidence in the economy than that offered by Treasury Secretary Humphrey last week . Mr. Humphrey said business and investor confidence is " built slowly and can be easily shaken . " Ho warned against tampering with It . Mr. Baruch , however , said " confidence has a very slow growth but it is a sturdy thing . " He said it depends first on belief that the country is secure against aggression and is ready to fight and win if it has to . It also depends , he said , on keeping Government receipts in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cuts , he declared . Back of presenreonfidence in business , he said , " is n tremendous faith in the country and its Government . The people will always have that , " ho predicted , ' ' no matter who 's in charge . " He said he was concerned lest the country ahead of security " He said he wanted to he sure the nation has the determination . If attacked . to retaliate . Seri Bricker ( R , Ohio ) asked whether fiscal management had n't been pretty good during the last Mo years . specially In regard to the " independence " of the Federal Reserve Board from the Treasury . The witness replied : " It would have been better if you had n't reduced taxes " in answer to Sen. Monroney ID. , Okla . ) , Mr Baruch said he could n't tell whether the stock market has discounted and absorbed the inflation of the economy that has taken place since the beginning of World War II . " If you can tell me what the market 's going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He firmly opposed raising margins much higher than they arc now . " When you let a fellow buy everything else for nothing down , " he said . " it 's unfair " A buyer at present must put up $60 cash for each $100 of stock bought on exchanges . He was also firm in saying that the Renegotiation Act should he extended . Sen. Monroney asked whether " we should reopen and reconider " this act for tengiiring wont on KOREAN war contracts ? ' and Mr Baruch said ' Yes sir , there 's no qualification about that . "
