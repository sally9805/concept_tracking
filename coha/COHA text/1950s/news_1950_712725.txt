Letters . to The Times Financing Federal Housing Senator Disputes Contention That Loans Constitute Subsidies To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW , YORK TIMES : In a Feb. 20 editorial Tim NEW YORK TIMES stated that the middleincome housing legislation ) was " economically irresponsible " because the terms of the loans were " so fantastically liberal that they , come close to being thinly disguised subsidies . " Two bases for such a conclusion were stated : First , the loans would be made at rates " only slightly higher than those at ' which the United States Government itself can borrow . " Second , a fifty-year amortization period was provided . In a letter which THE NEW YORK TIMES printed on Feb. 25 Senator Sparkman indicated why neither of the two stated bases would support the subsidy contention and stated that " no subsidy , thinly disguised or otherwise , is involved . " However , on that same day , in an editorial Commenting upon Senator Sparkman 's letter , THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidy contention , and asks " if these do not constitute subsidies * * then we would very much like to know how " that term is defined . In its commonly accepted meaning the term " subsidy " is defined as a gift or donation of funds or property from a Government to a private ' person or company to assist in the establishment or support of an enterprise deemed advantageous to the public . Let us measure against this commonly-accepted meaning of the term the four new bases now alleged in support of the subsidy contention . Loan Terms First , " the first $100 million ' of capital was to be put up by the United States Treasury . " The legislation specifically provides ( Section 307 ) not only that this initial capital shall be repaid ( as parenthetically noted in the editorial ) but also the stock held by the Treasury " shall be preferred as to dividends and assets of the corporation and shall be entitled to cumulative dividends for each year at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment and the current rate being paid on such obligations of the United States . In order to make our intent perfectly clear , I intend to offer an amendment which will specifically require the corporation to return to the Government the interest on the capital advanced as well as the principal . This is not a subsidy . I am trying to apply the same principle to commercial banks and the F. D. I. C. The United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank supplied the initial $289 million capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , but the law did not ' require the F. D. I. C. to reimburse the Treasury for the cost of such funds to thy Treasury . For the fifteen-year period during which the Government-subscribed capital stock was outstanding the cost of those funds to the Government at 2 per cent per annum amounted to about $80,564 , - 000 . I was successful in getting S. 2822 revised so that F. D. I. C. will have to repay in , full the interest due . I hope this principle can be retained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle-Income Housing Bill . Second , " the debentures which would be issued by the Mortgage Bank would be guaranteed by the United States Government " The mere fact of guarantee does not support the subsidy contention ; it could do so only if it may reasonably be expected that the Government will be called upon to make payment under its guarantee in order to absorb losses . Offsetting . Losses The debentures issued by the Federal Housing Administration are fully guaranteed by the Government . Nevertheless , we do not regard the F.H.A. mortgage insurance program as a " subsidy program " because experience has shown that the reserves built up by payments assessed against borrowers who use the system have been adequate to pay all losses . As pointed out in Senator Sparkman 's letter , under the middleincome housing legislation the payments required to be assessed against the borrowers who use that system would result in a ratio of reserves for possible losses to outstanding liability about five times greater than is the case in the F.H.A. Third , the debentures " would be tax exempt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal income taxes . The legislation provides and the committee report ( Page 87 ) states : " The debentures or other obligations issued by the corporation are not exempt , as to either principal or interest , from federal taxes , including , of course , federal income taxes . " Nor are they exempt from surtaxes , estate , inheritance or gift taxes imposed by the states or local taxing authorities . Fourth , the debentures " would be eligible for purchase . by the Federal Reserve banks . " s ' ) In connection with open-market operations , the Federal Reserve banks are authorized to purchase direct obligations of the United States and obligations fully guaranteed by the United States . This is a general power granted in the interest of proper management of the public debt ; it is not , as the editorial seems to imply , a special grant of authority in aid of the middle-income housing plan . As I have asked many witnesses who did n't seem aware of all the safeguards and sound provisions included in this bill , " Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " PAUL H. Douches . Washington , D.

" If , as you state , the Port Authority , based on the unanimous action of the Board of Estimate , raised $24,000,000 to relieve traffic with the Union Bus Terminal , which is presently being completed , what justification can be given a review by the Traffic Commission and the City Planning Commission ? Obviously , if Greyhound is allowed to enlarge its present bus terminal in a preferred location , should n't the same privilege be given to the other bus companies in midtown Manhattan ? And who will then be the occupants of the Union Bus Terminal erected by the Port Authority , supposedly on good faith of this administration . LEE MORRISON . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The remark in your editorial " Robins " that " there is yet no verified report of bluebirds * * * can now be corrected . Last Wednesday my attention was arrested by the calling of a bluebird . I rushed to the window and there Vas a vociferous fellow calling to his mate at the top of his lungs . Before long the - partner arrived and settled on another branch of the same tree right outside my bedroom window . They exchanged a few more words of greeting or something else and disappeared . It is quite possible , as your editorial states , that they " could have spent the winter in some near-by wooded valley .

This corporation was to be authorized to lend up to $2 billions for housing construction by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be amortized over a period of as long as sixty years . Under the plan 100 per cent of new housing development costs would be financed by government at per cent . By contrast , the F.H.A. operations are on a 4% per cent basis , with maximum loan maturities of 25-30 years and top guarantees of 80 to 90 per cent of cost . The chie  --  eason these terms were contemplated was that the mortgage bank was to be empowered to finance its operations by issuing debentures which would be governmentguaranteed , tax-exempt and eligible for investment by the Reserve banks . In other words , these purely private building projects would be able to rent , in. theory at least , some $14 a month lower than competing rentals in the same locality because they would , in effect , be underwritten by the United States Government . If this is not subsidy competition , then it seems to us that there is no such thing as a subsidy. ? Editor , THE TIMES . A Bold Offensive for Peace State Department Plan Considered to Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Your editorial of March 12 hints rather guardedly at the fundamental weakness of the " Acheson Plan . " There is no end to the cold war contemplated unless , as is implied , Russia will supinely beg for peace or as ylr . X , speaking somewhat officially for the State Department a few years ago said , a revolution removes the Communist regime there . This is a dismal prospect  --  years of fear of an atomic war , draining our resources of men and money , tying up with unsavory and unreliable " allies " for a period unknown . Such a fan-tastic ideal omits the hard fact of Russia 's nationalism , that in the period when we refused recognition she developed into a great power . How different was her strength in the two wars . The intimation that a country must change its Government or its rulers to get our cooperation will only consolidate the feeling of its people . Woodrow Wilson tried it in Mexico and a fiasco resulted . If Russia should announce that it would stop her aggression only if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hot and not a cold war . Refusal to talk directly with Russia lends color to the Communist propaganda that we are warmongers . The vague and unconvincing hints that agreement should come through the U. N. carry little weight . The impotence of the U. N. in dealing with major issues , our by-passing it when convenient , the defiance of its orders by other nations , the veto , all suggest that the idea is not proposed seriously . I Further , there is no direct or indirect statement that we would let the U. N. decide , and probably Congress would not accept such a decision . Why should we not take a bold offensive stand for peace in such plain words that the world can know that a failure is due to Stalin ? Have we such an inferiority complex that we fear we will be hoodwinked ? This is a sad commentary on our confidence in the superiority of our ability . And if Russia does not carry out her agreements , are we any worse  --  can we not resume our efforts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time is on our side . Nothing could be more fallacious . France and England found that the enemy did not stand still . Even if we increase Our relative strength , that will be slight comfort in an atomio war in which there is as yet no defense . And if our scientists are correct , the greater the power of our hydrogen bomb the greater the danger that it may destroy us as well as our enemies . NORMAN M. BEHR .
