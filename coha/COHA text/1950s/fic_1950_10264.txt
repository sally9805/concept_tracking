looked at the photograph of himself  --  not with vanity nor with any grimace of deprecation , but as though he were studying the image of the bones and jaw and the big firm mouth , as though he were estimating their worth as assets in the job he had in mind . He went to the window and stood there a minute , a hard oak of a man leaning with his knuckles pressed on the sill . A momentary breeze rippled his shirt sleeves against his arms . At the corner of the next block a whirlwindspun in the open space where the old Knights of Columbus Hall had burned last year  --  a little whirlwind that caught up loose papers and weed leaves , common in this season . How quickly the summer had gone , he thought . April seemed not much farther back than last week . In April he had felt like a general whose armies are all in place , who can go back to his well-furnished quarters and read Clausewitz and Caesar and write the letters to his wife which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward his soldiers bitch and wait and maneuverinto position and finally assault the terrible beach that he has chosen . In April everything he could do this year to further his political fortunes was done . He had only to wait with perfectly implacable nerves , it seemed , until this action was done , looking meanwhile at the broad outlines of the next phase . The next phase would hardly begin inside a year  --  not until the pre-election deals of 1948 commenced . All in a month the strategy he had been shaping for a long time had come to a head . Soon after the first of April he 'd spent an evening talking real turkey with Murray in Chicago and on the same visit had talked to the Senator and a couple of his friends . That month he'dp175given the go ahead to Walker in the steel mill union to start raiding the Communist-led unions in the Veneta smelters and fought that matter out with the District Communist Organizer after he 'd caught on to what was happening . And at the end of that month he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school board . All these were finishing touches , the wheeling of artillery into position . " Give it a whirl , Tom , " he 'd said to Kettle . " I do n't know whether you can get him in or not , but give it a whirl . " He was feeling expansive that night . It was rainingand the rain that mushroomed on the window and distorted the glitter of red neons from below kept reiteratingthe assurance that they were alone and could not be overheard . It was the rain that made him feel he could risk talking to Kettle in his office . No one would be on the streets to notice him come in . The rain was good luck for him . A lucky wind had blown it up the river just before suppertime . " Just keep it going smooth , " Barkley added . " Get it as hot as you can , but do n't get in any trouble . O.K. ? " Kettle grinned foxily and asked , " Do n't care if we win ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really nice . But as long as your campaign goes along smooth and gets people interested that 's enough . Work it right and I 'll do what I can . Maybe I can give you a hand . Work it right and I 'll put the screws on Walker 's union to come in . " They listened to the thump of the rain . The sound of it filled the office for a time . " I 'm not doing this for you , Jay , " Kettle said . " I think you ought to understand . . . I 'm going to win it . " " Great . I never thought you were doing it for me . Ip176never thought you were doing anything you 've done for me , " Barkley said . He dragged on his cigar . " What 's eatingyou anyhow ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know , " Kettle said . " Things are on their way for us . They 've made up their mind they want me for Congress . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get them to make up their minds about me . They know I 've never even been elected dogcatcher , but with the Republicans riding high they figure they 've got to get the labor vote from down here . They 're scared . They 're going to go out of their way a little bit this time even if they do n't like the people I play with . They think they can take care of me later when things begin to swing . They do n't like me , I 'm afraid , but they 've got no choice . That 's the way we wanted it , was n't it , Tom ? " Kettle said after a while  --  after he had thought it over or else had given Barkley a chance to think it over , " Maybe they expect you 'll pull the Negro vote too . " " That 's what they think . " " Then you 'd better come along and help us with Jackson . " " I said I 'm going to , Tom . What 's eating you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I said was for you to keep it going smooth and I 'll swing the union around . But do n't let it blow up in our faces . That reminds me of one more thing . One thing I do n't like about your plans . Drop this Gordonkid . Leave him out . " " No , " Kettle said . " I 'll take care of my part of this , Jay . I 'll run my own part of the game . " " Maybe you wo n't , " Barkley said slowly . " Gordon 's getting himself wound up with the CP , is n't he ? Well Ip177had a little talk with the district organizer the other day . Smith . You know him ? He 's a little sore at me . Sonofabitchcame right up here to the office to see me . The CPs get stupider every day . There are people in town who know who he is and some of them are pretty apt to be right outside my door there most any time . I jumped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . He claimed I started the steel boys raiding the smelter unions . I said , You 're goddamned right I did and as long as you knuckleheaded sonsofbitches ca n't make up your mind what you 're trying to do . . . ' and so on and on . I straightened him up . Did a little horsetradingwith him . But I do n't count on it lasting . So along about the middle of the summer your Gordon is apt to get a tip to start some trouble . I 'd leave him clear out . " Kettle said , " I do n't know if he 's a CP or not . I saw him when he was home Easter and he talked a lot about it , but . . . " " I know . Smith had his name . Got it from the Chicago office , I suspect , and was too damn dumb to keep his mouth shut about it when he was talking to me . Can you imagine ? There 's no doubt about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and I do n't care . Maybe he is getting into the Party and maybe it would be a good thing for him . If we start to run Jackson I 'm going to get Boo working on it . " " Why ? He 'll make you trouble . " " Because it will be a good thing for him . He 's a pretty unsettled boy . " " If you want to run a nursery . . . " Barkley said , good-humored about it , showing that resource of detachmentwhich forever distinguished him from such a man as Kettle . " Only even the nursery tots are apt top178put a shiv into you if they get mixed up with a hophead like Smith . I 'm telling you . " Kettle had got up to prowl around the room . He kept touching everything aimlessly , the edge of the desk , the coat hanger , the door frame . He 's getting worse than he used to be , Barkley thought , relaxing heavily in his chair , watching through the fine screen of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would n't even try to tell you that Boo will do us much good . I 'm going to get him in this . Not because he is or is n't a Communist . " His eyes glittered rather mistily . " And if you think that maybe something else is the reason I 'm keeping him in or keepinghim around and that you know what that reason might be  --  why , do n't , because that would be a damn lie too . " Even so the plans for the Jackson campaign looked all right . He was n't counting on it much , and he was glad he did n't have to . Again it was like one of the battalions in an invasion force . It might be wiped out just as the others might by unexpected luck or opposition . But after it had been set up , along with the other battalions in their assigned places , you had to wait and see , staying out of it yourself , knowing that the best thing to do was to keep your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right time go to the phone and call your line commander and say either , Go ahead , I 'm throwing in some more stuff to support you  --  or else , say , You did n't make it and I ca n't risk trying to save you . Because he was a man who had not wasted any of his experience or his education , he could see analogies like that between his own position and a military commander 's . When he 'd been with the Senator in Chicago  --  after the other political wheels had said to him what theyp179had no choice but to say and had left the two of them alone  --  he had laughed quietly and told the Senator , " I realized tonight how much I 've learned about politics in the last few years . Napoleon said he 'd learned to use artillery the way a boxer uses his fists instead of like a battering ram . I 'm beginning to see what he meant . When you break into politics from the hard side , you have to learn something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man who knew how to use his fists all right . " I hope we 'll get your Sunday punch for the elections next year . " " No , " Barkley said . " I think I 'll save that one . " No one could tell how big the future might be , the Senator said with a cagey smile , and maybe Mr. Barkley was right in thinking the real chance lay somewhere ahead of the ' 48 elections . Some day there was going to be a big Yes or a big No for Jay Barkley , and he thought he could pick the time . Politics was like boxing  --  timing and force . You had to have a natural sense of timing , like a good fist-fighter , feeling when the time was right for the little jabs and waiting indefinitely for the moment for the big punch and knowing that the time might not come but waiting anyway . Mr. Hughes , whose steel mill in Riverton was only home base for imperial holdings in Kentucky coal , potteryin Indiana , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the showdown came with Jay Barkley . Funny how little he saw of Mr. Hughes and how close together they were . He was pretty sure that Mr. Hughes was trying to pick his time for the showdown too , and the sooner the better , as far as Hughes was concerned . Right now would be fine . It was all right to let the Party take care of its radicals after it had used them  --  or thatp180had been all right in Roosevelt 's time  --  but there was always the chance one of them would get too big and break loose . In these lovely days just after the war , Mr. Hughes would be happy to take care of Barkley right now at home . During the war he 'd almost got Barkley out in the cold . Then Barkley had come home with a ruptured duck in his lapel and the political advantage of that had almostcanceled out the disadvantage of his having been away . It was a long , long game unless some sudden break occurred . This was what Jay Barkley thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . Napoleon had learned how to fight with artillery  --  that too " like fighting with your fists "  --  and had broken through the tangles of convention , bending what existed to his own intention . In the century when the police power of the state made nonsense of the ideas of direct political action , made barricades and group independence and even campaigning impossible , politics was still , for the determined individual , a matter of using whatever organizations or sentiments existed as though you were fighting with your fists . " Is Mr. Hughes smart enough to figure this out the way I 've got it figured out ? " He had said this to his wife one evening about the outlines of the struggle that he saw becoming increasingly clear the farther he went . His wife was about the only person left , he thought , to whom he could talk openly . The more you learned the less you could say , the more secrets you had to keep . Even Tom Kettle  --  well , there were a number of reasons he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife kept on with her knitting . She had lived with him for twenty years and the steady beat of his energy had worn her to an accepting silence . " I do n't know , " he said . " I never see the old sonofabitchexcept at the Riverton Club . Every time he talks to me he 's like an old-maid aunt . He lectures me how we 've got to save the country from Communism like an old-maid aunt telling a kid about the evils of tobacco when what she means is that she suspects him of smok-ing . " " He 's a shrewd old man , " his wife said and shifted her knitting . " You be careful . " " Is he now ? I do n't think he is . I do n't think he is . Maybe it does n't make much difference anyway . BecauseRiverton is made in his image , bone of his bone , the way the universe is supposed to be the body of God . A body can perform involuntary functions  --  like getting rid of bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding what it 's doing . I 'm the one that has to be smart , not Hughes . " Now his wife came into the office on this hot afternoon , rapping on the door and waiting until he called before she entered . She was dressed smartly , ready to make a call , but inside the smart clothes she seemed frail and very dry . Barkley looked at his watch again when she came in . " I 'll be ready to go in a minute , Arlene . I 've got to decide something before we leave . Sit down . " Listen , " he said . " Something 's going on . I ca n't find out what it is . Everybody I try to pry it out of gets a silly grin so I 'm getting to feel like there 's a big fat cat sitting right close and waiting to gobble me up . " His wife sat very straight , listening to him as thoughp181she knew that he was not going to take any advice from her , but wanted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This morning I had coffee with that kid the County Attorney 's got for an assistant . All at once he pops out something about Kettle . Kettle of fish . Pretty Kettle of fish , ' he says . It 's a real good joke . I can see that . Then he clammed up all at once . Like he remembered something . Like somebody a lot smarter than he had warned him not to spill anything to me . " I know damn well that something is wrong , and I ca n't find out a thing . I can usually worm it out of somebody , " he said . " Not this time . I 'm worried . " " Why do n't you ask Tom ? " his wife said . Barkley stared down at her grimly . " If I could trust him . . . " he said . " Have you quarreled with him ? " " No , " he said . " No . " Then he made up his mind . " Just a second , Arlene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and he tried to call one other time that afternoon from St. Martin where he had gone with his wife to have cocktails with the family of a federal judge , but both times Kettle 's phone rang in an empty room.  |p183CAMERON  let himself in at the side door of the Junior College building . The windows along the corridors were open . The corridors smelled of the oil that had been used on the floors in the summer cleaning and of the chalk dust that not even two months of vacation had settled , those invariable smells of a school in summertime , which are all the more distinct for not being mixed with the smells of breath , bodies , and the toilet disinfectantof the school year . In the gloomy hall that ended in Dean Fischer 's office he passed the case of athletic trophies , figures of baseball , basketball and football players in victorious silver attitudes . He stopped for a minute to catch his breath , looked at the sun-yellowed leaves of a maple tree winking outside a window . He felt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had walked down this hall last . " Cameron ? Mr. Cameron ? " He noticed that the door to Fischer 's office was slightly ajar and realized that the man sitting beyond it had been listening to his approach , had probably heard him open the outside door , heard him on the concrete stairs and on the wooden floors , listening and waiting like a cat . " Yes , " he said . " Come in , " Fischer shouted . " How are you , old fellow ? You 've almost made a stranger of yourself this summer . I regret we have n't . . . but that 's my fault.  |p184So  many things to do . " He stood up to shake hands . His rimless glasses twinkled with professional good humor . His long teeth shone in a smile . He was wearing a creamcoloredwool suit  --  just the color of his teeth , Cameron noticed  --  that bunched up high around his neck . The seams of the suit were grimy . " How is Mrs. Cameron ? " Fischer asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over for bridge . I do n't know how many times Mrs. Fischer has mentioned that . We so much like your wife . Ah . " " It 's the first time I 've been here since school was out , " Cameron said . " I 've kept pretty busy too . " Fischer grinned as though he knew all about that kind of business , but he said , " Surely . I understand . It 's an illusion of the layman that the teachers work only  --  that they have a three-months ' vacation . " He shook his head in mock sorrow . " Anyway it 's for the cause , the good cause . By the way , how is your masterwork , your literarywork getting along ? That Mountwood "  --  the syllablesof the name sounded crisp as celery in the way he pronounced it  --  " is a fascinating chap . Fascinating . " One of Fischer 's cheeks clenched , narrowing his eye as he drove the last word home . " I envy you your subject . Tracing this  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cameron said . " Oh , yes . Ye-eh-ess . Yes , the layman who picks up a book . after supper and finishes it by bedtime has very little idea of the labor , the bonebreaking labor I 'd call it  --  would n't you ?  --  that a scholar puts into his work . I imagine , that is . I have n't written any books , but I . . . " he tittered confidentially to express the rest of his thought . He picked up a pencil from his desk and set the lead against his thumbnail , moving it in small circles . Thenp185he took a handkerchief from his pocket and scrubbed the nail clean . Cameron waited for him to speak and the silence grew heavier and heavier . Once Fischer looked up , noticed that Cameron was watching him , and , discoveringthis to be so , grinned sheepishly and began drawing circles on his thumbnail faster than ever . " Mountwood ! " he exclaimed suddenly . He bounced out of his chair and unlocked the book cabinet behind him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped it out , thinking I 'd certainly pass it on to you . " He leafed through a book looking for it , grinned , took another book from the shelf and went through it in the same way . " Shoot , " he said . " I know I put it in one of these books . " He went with increasing speed through the pages of book after book until he had the whole shelf full piled out on his desk . " Shoot , " he said . " It was from a historical journal and I told myself , I must give this to Mr. Cameron . ' " He sat down and shook his head helplessly . " I appreciate your saving it , " Cameron said . " You 'll find it later . What was  --  the subject ? " " Ah . . . " Dean Fischer 's eyes were rolling franticallybehind the glasses as though he were trying to turn them on the back of his skull where he had the memory stored . He picked up one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shook it angrily . " Never mind , " Cameron said . " You might find it later . " " I never lose things . Wait , " Fischer said . He lifted his telephone and dialed with a pencil point . " Mother ? " he said . " Mother , go look in the top dresser drawer in my room and see if there is an article there called  --  the title has to do with free speech . Free speech . " He began tap/ping the transmitter with the pencil point . " Hello . Good . It 's there , all right , " he explained to Cameron , and the discovery restored him to a kind of calm . " I never lose things , " he said . " Wonderful man , Mountwood . I 'm glad to hear that you 're getting along so well with your book . " " I did n't say well . " " I 'm sure you are . I 'm sure you are , " Fischer said . " Your book  --  I happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is  --  and he was fascinated . You may know the Hugheses have been amateur Mountwoodiologists  --  is that what you 'd call them ? " Cameron nodded . " I 've used the collection of Mountwoodletters in the library . Orin Hughes donated that , did n't he ? And Mountwood 's rifle ? " " Not Orin Hughes . His brother , I think . Anyway I was pleased the other night when I spoke to Orin Hughes . He was fascinated that someone on the faculty here was working on such an ambitious project . You ought to talk to him sometime . He 's democratic . Richest man in  --  well , possibly the state . But he 'll talk to anyone . He 'd be very interested in talking to you . We 'll get you togethersometime . " Fischer had relaxed comfortably into his chair now . He held the lead pencil just above the rims of his glasses , holding one end in each hand and turning it slowly as though he were unwinding a scroll . He said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , even if that means we 'll be losing you in a year or two . Yes , it does mean that . You 'll have your higher degree and , no doubt when it 's published , quite a reputation , and you wo n't be content to stay in a small puddle like Riverton . You 're one of those who has a real future ahead of you . You came here very well recom/mended and I said to myself at the time , We wo n't keep him long . ' I even said to myself , What 's this chap up to ? What 's his angle ? ' Ha ha . Anyway that 's as it should be . We 're a modest place . We try to keep the college as good as can be , but we 're small and Riverton is small . We ca n't deny that , can we ? " He lowered the pencil a trifle so that it was in front of his eyes and he was looking at it instead of at Cameron . " So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does come here  --  someone who 's used to the cosmopolitan world , we might call it . I suppose a big person like that might feel cramped a little by some of the provincial  --  ha ha  --  qualities he would find in Riverton . " " I see , " Cameron said . " Well now , I hope you see . Some little thing has come up this summer which  --  I might as well say this  --  seems to have gravely endangered your job . I thought it was my duty to point this out to you . You do n't want to risk your future . No , no . I suppose there are some things about Riverton you  --  being from bigger places  --  might not understand at first . " " I see . " " You understand what I 'm talking about ? " Fischer asked eagerly . He seemed much relieved . " You 'll probably be leaving us in a couple of more years wo n't it take you that long to finish your book ?  --  anyway , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedagogue in his first year of teaching to spend only one year at a place . If you want to go on teaching . . . Well , you know there are certain rules a teacher has to live by . You know that . His public life , what the community sees of him , has to conform . I suppose these laws are unalterable as the laws of the Medes and the Persians in a town like Riverton . Or let 's call them rules  --  what is expected ofp188teachers . There is n't actually a law that says a teacher ca n't have anything to do with the selection of schoolboardmembers , but , oh my , you can see what an unsatisfactorything it would be if the teachers selected the school board and the school board selected the teachers who had selected them . That could lead to real corruption . Not very democratic , would it be ? " Cameron nodded thoughtfully . He was resentful and at the same time naked . The events of the summer , his own spiraling thoughts about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision . Ready or not , a decision for the record was being demanded of him now . He tried to resist the necessity , tried still to keep on middle ground . " I suppose someone feels that I 'm trying to raise my wages or secure my job if I support John Jackson ? " he asked , trying to console himself that this minor note of defiance would maintain his sense of integrity , that it would clothe his nakedness . " Certainly not , " Fischer said snappishly . " You 're purposely misunderstanding . I spoke about the principle of the thing . " " There are principles involved in Jackson 's running for the board , " Cameron said . " Yes . Ye-eh-ess . If the Negroes want to band together and support their man , I 'd be the first to say , Let him run , give him his chance . ' " " Cut off their legs and let them run , " Cameron said half to himself . " What ? " " That is n't quite enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what you 'd want more than democracy . " And again , as he had at the beginning of the interview , he grinned slylyp189as though he knew obscene secrets about Cameron 's preferences . " I do n't know that I 'd want a man on our staff who did n't agree with me about democracy . Tolerance is a splendid thing , but can we tolerate the forces that want to substitute something for our democracy ? A rhetorical question , of course . " Cameron became aware that for the last several minutes he had been rocking back and forth in his chair . It was a swivel chair with springs that squeaked as he rocked with a sound like remote and fiendish giggling . I should n't have come , he thought all at once , clutching the thought like a life preserver . The springs beneath giggled at him . He took a deep breath . " I do n't know what to say . I do n't entirely agree with you . I think , for instance . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I 've seen too much of you to doubt it . Oh , we have great hopes for you , young man . You 'll finish your book and we 'll all be proud that we knew you . We 'll say , I remember I was once a friend of Andrew Cameron 's . I do n't know if he 'd remember me now that he 's such a big gun , but . . The only thing is . . . " " I see , " Cameron said . " I 'm sure you do , " said Dean Fischer . Cameron nodded , kept nodding for the remainder of the interview , and it seemed to him that he was still nodding  --  endlessly , mechanically , like a doll whose head is set wobbling by the pressure of a child 's grimy fingertip  --  whilehe walked down the corridor and down the oil-smelling stairs . At the door he lifted his face to the warmth of the sky , breathing deeply . Here I am and I 'm afraid , he thought . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straight track in a terror dream  --  something he had been writing , strug-p 190gling with in the medium of words on paper , not many days ago . Corrin , the man who had been Mountwood 's friend once and had deserted him . There was Corrin who had a wife , a son , a farm so that he had to balance his fear of losing them against the fear of losing his own integrity , without a third alternative . Now that kind of choice between fears did not seem remote . It was neither a hundred and ten years in the past nor safely fixed in the manuscript pages paperclippedtogether in the drawer of his desk at home . And , realizing how he stood between the hammer and anvil of inner and outer fears , he went to find Kettle , knowing at last what he was going for , what he had always gone to Kettle for . He still told himself consciously that he was going " to help " but at the borderline of consciousnesshe knew that he was joining that small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to Kettle for help or consolation for themselves . He had no idea of where to find Kettle except that if he drove around in the poorer sections of town he might see him on the streets . Until nearly four o'clock he cruised back and forth . He ran low on gas and had to stop to refill . As he was leaving the filling station he saw Kettle cross an intersection two blocks up the hill from him , lumbering along massively , swinging his cane or sometimesleaning on it like a seersucker beetle stuck on the end of a pin . " Surprise , " Kettle said . " Thought I 'd see you to-night . " " You thought we 'd come to eat your food whether we did anything else or not ? " " Hmmm . " Kettle struggled to hide a smile of pleasure . " I 'm glad you came , Andy . " He ought to ask me , at least , what Fischer said , whatp 191I said to Fischer , Cameron thought . He ought to ask at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ignored that obviousquestion . " Had good luck today ? " Cameron asked . " Is the underground getting ready to emerge ? " " Mmmm , " Kettle said . " I 'll tell you about it this evening . I would n't want to risk giving you any more wrong ideas . " " No , " Cameron laughed . " Turn in here , " Kettle said . " We 've got to see Glass-man . " Abraham Glassman answered the doorbell . He had no shirt on and he was barefooted . His toes were pink and white as shrimp . He was a short man with a circle of ferocious gray hair around a bald spot , looking not merely unkempt but like the protective spiny armament of plants or undersea creatures . In his hand , folded open to the sporting page , he still held a St. Louis newspaper . He led them into a front room whose walls were dotted with furniture-store pictures of magnolia blossoms and groups of eighteenth-century ladies playing musical instruments .

" Certainly . It is the old and tragic story . Everywhere always the same . Nothing new , positively . The conscience tells us what is right . Yes . Then we wish to act . And within the system we are permitted to do this little thing or that little thing . We can maybe elect a Negro to the school board . Is that right ? Why not governor ? Why not senator ? Why not president ? We can  --  maybe  --  electp192him to the school board and nobody cares . They laugh at us and say , Well , little fella , so what ? ' You squirm . You get nowhere . They laugh , " he said , " until the day when the people are finally going to catch up with them , pick them up by their coat tails , squash them like beetles . " He let the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too soon . What can you do ? You run a little store and you try to have things nice . " He swung a short arm to indicate the pleasantness of his house . " We have tried before and it is only squirming . You make a union . You squirm a little to be free . The first thing you know the union bosses are thinking like the employers . It is worse than before . " " Not worse , " Kettle said . " You know , Abe , what it was like around the mills before 1936 . It 's not that bad now . " " If it 's not so bad that 's worse , " Glassman said . " It means longer until the revolution comes . " " You going to wait for the revolution ? " Kettle asked . He turned to Cameron and gave a stagy chuckle . " Like pie in the sky . In the old days the masses waited for pie in the sky . Now they 're waiting for the revolution .

" He sprang to his feet and paced across the room . " In the mornings I think . . . " He stopped abruptly and looked at Cameron , made up his mind and went on in a quaveringvoice . " I think , My God , before I die there shouldp193be a Red Army on the bridge from St. Martin . I would get my pistol out of the drawer and go to welcome them .

Maybe the young man . " He nodded at Cameron . " It is not opium , " he went on . " It is fact . The day will come . But what can we do now ? The conscience says we must act . What can I do ? " " How about B'nai B'rith ? " Kettle said . " You 're a big shot there . " " Oh , no . Oh , no . I open my mouth to them and they have me spotted as a Red . They will not listen to me . I try to tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers are lying about the anti-Semitism in Poland . Who are the anti-Semites ? They are the butchers that are fighting the people 's government . The Beck gang . I can not even tell Jews this , but they say I am a Red . It would be better for Jackson if I did n't say anything to them . They would label Jackson a Red . " Glassman went back to his chair , sank deep into it , shaking his head in gloom . " What can I do ? My wife is sick . In the hospital . Why do you think you find me home on Thursday afternoon when I ought to be at the store ? I am an old sick man . I have no sons . What can I do ? " Kettle said , here 's Professor Cameron who'sp194sticking his neck out and risking his job just to let people know where he stands . We 've come close before , Abe . Barkley 's still with us . " " What is Barkley ? " Glassman snapped . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you trust the Social Democrats ? They are shifting sands . As for Mr. Cameron . . . That is good . " He nodded encouragingly at Cameron , a kind of small-boy intensification of seriousnessin his face and voice . " You will see it . You make me ashamed . I say God bless you . Once upon a time when I was your age I was not like I am now . Ha , " he said , " I marched a thousand miles with the Red Army of Poland . We saw many places before they hired the butcher Pilsudski and gave him all their weapons to drive back the people to their slavery . The people knew who were their friends . Do n't let anyone tell you different . In the pogrom they used to rip open the pregnant women and throw the babies out of their bellies on the street where the horses tramped over them . " He sat chewing his lips in fury . He belched loudly and it looked for a second as though this indignity might be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up very straight in his chair and said , " Gentlemen , I ca n't do nothing . Positively . I would n't want to fool you . Still I would like to help . I would like to give you a hundred dollars . If you ca n't do nothing else with that , Tom , you can go to Windy Harper and buy twenty votes . Hey ? " As he and Kettle went out , Cameron glanced through the living-room window . He saw that Glassman had once again picked up the sport page , was holding it in front of him , but not so he could read it . He seemed to be watching , above the paper , the shadowy army of his youth , forever marching onward and forever marchingp195away from the real world and from real time . He snapped the paper viciously , belched again , and began to read . " There 's a fifty-fifty bet , " Kettle said , nodding back toward the house where Glassman sat . " He 'll do something for us . But he wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark that riles him up . Maybe we ought to send a whatyoucallit . . . " " Provocateur , " Cameron said . " Yeah . Into the store to rile him up . " " Good idea , " Cameron said . " What will we do with the hundred dollars ? " Kettle said , " You know , Glassman is n't rich . That 's kind of touching , is n't it ? " Then he answered the question . " Maybe we 'd better give it to Windy Harper like he said . Buy ourselves a few sure votes . " That was funny , " he added a little later . " His saying Barkley is a Social Democrat . " " What is he then ? " " Far left . Far left , " Kettle said . Their next stop was the Methodist parsonage where they found Walter Boyd mowing the lawn . " Ca n't afford to let him go just because he ditched us once , " Kettle said . The parsonage was a pleasant building set back among a grove of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , was parklike in its meticulous arrangement of flower beds and well-kept shrubs . Boyd nodded agreeably enough to Cameron . His greeting to Kettle was somewhat colder . The three men had scarcely begun to talk when Mrs. Boyd appeared on the porch and sat down . She had a book which she let lie in her lap while she watched them suspiciously . " Did you read , " Boyd was saying , " that article in thep196new Atlantic ? It was a humdinger , Mr. Cameron . By some Southern fellow , and let me tell you he told some of the old diehards that not all the Southerners think the way they do . " " I have n't had much time for reading lately , " Cameronsaid . " Too much work of my own to do . And then the campaign . . . " " Ah . Well , I 'm collecting books and articles on the race question , " Boyd said . " How is the Jackson campaigncoming ? We have n't heard much about it lately . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing about it , I guess , " Kettle said . He let that soak in for a moment and then added , " Me , I have n't been doing what I should . I 'm out today to try and find where we stand . " " Oh , " Boyd said . He stooped to free some grass that was twisted around the axle of the mower . He leaned on the handle and looked away from them past the end of the yard . " I hope it 's going all right . My , the time has flitted by this summer , has n't it ? I 've been working on plans for a culture-study program for next winter that 's kept me awfully preoccupied . " " The Negroes themselves are pretty well organized , " Kettle said . " I 've talked to Dupree and , of course ; Jacksonhas n't wasted any time . No , sir . I wish we had all been working as hard as he has . " " That 's splendid , " Boyd said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth so that it left brief indentions in the grass . " We 've just been talking to a Mr. Glassman , " Cameronsaid . " He 's going to help us with his friends . We hope so , anyhow . " Kettle said , " He will . When Abe Glassman makes up his mind , he sticks like a snapping turtle . "  | " I 'm glad to hear that , " Boyd said . " Mr. Cameron , I should think you 'd hardly find time for this  --  sort of thing . Did n't someone tell me you were working on a book ? Mountwood , is n't it ? I 've been thinking about that lately in connection with this culture-study program . I 've meant to ask you if you would n't lecture to the group on Mountwood sometime this fall . After school begins , that is . " " We 'll see , " Cameron said . Boyd went on , " I have some really growing minds in the Young Men 's Bible Class . They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Challenging ideas . Young businessmen who are going to have a great influence on this community , or have that influence right now if they 'd bring it to bear . There 's Morgan Henline who , believe it or not , is well up toward the top on Orin Hughes ' payroll . I 've had a number of talks with Morgan about the race situation in Riverton , and he 's said quite flatly to me that he thinks it 's nonsense . " " That 's a luxury only the rich can afford , I suppose , " Cameron said . " What ? " " To think it 's nonsense . " Boyd looked surprised , then said , " I suppose . But when you see the top economic class taking that attitude there 's a great deal of hope . There are others like Morgan who are not so far from seeing things . If we could use Mountwood as a kind of opening wedge on them , get them to see the race problem through the eyes , you might say , of Mountwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riverton . For a long time I 've meant to get a few intelligent Negroes into this group too . . . " " All right , " Cameron interrupted . He was badly jarred to hear this man , this Boyd , talking about his book in thep198way he had recently thought , talked , of it himself , as though he were looking at his own mirrored reflection and did not like it . " I do n't suppose I can argue with you in theory . But what we Tom and I  --  are asking this afternoon is , How are you on the goose ? ' " " I do n't . . . " Boyd began , smiling . " How are you on the goose ? ' It 's what the Freestaters and the slavers used to ask each other in Kansas when John Brown was there . It 's like saying , We 're not talkingtheories . Are you with us or not ? ' " " Well . . . " and the smile , still carefully preserved , glittered like ice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made any secret how I feel about Jackson 's running for the board . At the same time . . . " " You have n't made any secret of it from us , " Cameron said . " That 's not the point . Have you and will you come out openly for Jackson ? You 've got a pulpit and you 've got convictions . Use them . You talk about using Mountwoodfor a wedge . How about using him for an example ? " Boyd moved the lawnmower back and forth . He turned half around to glance to where his wife sat on the front porch . He smiled more than ever . " You say I have a pulpit  --  as though it were mine and I could do with it what I wished . Supposing I could  --  which I ca n't  --  would I be justified in alienating people like those I 've mentioned to you  --  tackling them before they 're ripe  --  to make an appeal for Jackson that would probably be fruitless ? " " You could go ahead and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you out and hang you like Mountwood . Then it would n't be fruitless at all . " The smile on Boyd 's face altered to positive triumph . " I see you 're joking , " he said . " At any rate , Sally "  --  he jerked his head toward the porch  --  " and I have talkedp199this over and we 're not awfully sure we 're completely convinced of Jackson 's worth or the worth of this campaign . What is Jackson 's program ? Would you tell me that ? I do n't feel that I ought to vote for him until I know what his program is , at least . " " Program ? " Cameron said . " My God , what do you expect ? Do you think that one man on the school board in Riverton is going to tell the rest of the board that he 's going to abolish segregated schools , mix up white and black teachers , end social discrimination outside of schools so the kids would all have the same chance when they sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gnat and swallowing a camel , my friend , if you 're going to excuse yourself because you do n't know what Jackson 's program is . " " I do n't wish to swallow either the gnat or the camel , thank you , " Boyd said . " I 'm sorry I ca n't agree with you , but . . . " " Come on , Tom , " Cameron said . He turned abruptly and walked to the car . He noticed the shaking of his hand when he reached for the ignition key . They drove in silence for several blocks before he noticed that the car seat itself was trembling with Kettle'slaughter . " What 's so goddamn funny ? " he asked , beginning to laugh himself . " You know , you and me had a talk about liberals one day , " Kettle said . " You thought I was a big fat fool . " " Boyd 's  --  Boyd , " Cameron said . " I liked Glassman better . My God , Tom . Do n't tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some a lot better and some the same . Sometimes you hit and sometimes you miss . " " No doubt I spoiled something for you there , " Cam-P 200eron said . " You probably would have found some sneakingway to jelly him up so he 'd be good for something . " " Naaa , " Kettle said . He began to laugh again , all the multiple bulges of his body quivering . " I 've been intending to kick him in the butt for a long time . We do n't need him . Altogether I 've had a good day . " " Where next , Tom ? " " I 'll tell you . It 's getting late . Let me out along here and go get your good wife and meet me at the saloon . I ca n't afford to take you to see anyone else . " " I 'm sorry I screwed up things with Boyd . " " No . Do n't be . No , no . " " We 'll see you in about an hour . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Boyd was that he 's so much like me . " " To be sure , " Kettle said smugly . " We 'll talk about it at supper . " Watching Cameron 's car disappear up the street , Kettle thought happily , I 'm getting him . He 's worth more than the rest of them and I 'm getting him . It has n't been a bad day at all . He climbed the backstairs to an apartment building to see John Stoloff . No one was home here , so he turned up the street toward his own place . Off to his right the river lay like oily metal , like an immense oiled knife jabbed into the dry August hills . The swallows in the riverfront park spiraled tightly as they caught the first wave of the willow bugs that came in that evening . His seersucker suit showed black patches in the armpits , and he used the cane now as it was supposed to be used . He was rather pleased with his afternoon . He had p 201his last good luck for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Brack was getting in his car . He had to wave his cane and run to get Brack 's attention . " Make an old pot-bellied man run like that . Pheew . " " Did I make you run ? " Brack said . He flipped the ignition and started the motor . " Let me sit down a minute , " Kettle said and slid into the car . " You 're not in any hurry , are you ? " Brack , in resignation , said he was not . " I 've been trying to get ahold of you . " " Try calling the paper ? " Kettle laughed . " That 's right . You work there , do n't you ? " " What 's on your mind ? " " I 've got a news story for you . About the school-board election again . " " Yah . " " Well , here 's the latest . You want to take this down ? " " I 'll try real hard , Kettle . Maybe I can remember it . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kettle gave him a slip of paper . " But here 's what I want to tell you . There 's going to bea meeting for Jackson next Wednesday at the Y. " " We wrote up that meeting you had in June . " " I know . Sure , you did . But this is going to be abigger one . We were just getting started then . We'llprobably have fifty or sixty people at this one . " " How many ? " " Fifty . " " Crap . " " You want to come and count them yourself ? " " No . " " O.K. Fifty people . Can you give us a story the dayp 202before and then a write-up on what they say ? I 'll send that down to you . " " You going to write it ? " " I 've got a ghost-writer . " " I should n't give you two . The old man 's hell on that . We would n't do it for the other candidates . You ought to get a paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid ad . Just a bottom corner on the front page announcing we 're going to have a meeting . " " Crap . " " And Barkley is going to talk to the union Tuesday night . He 's going to say something about Jackson . " " We carry exactly nothing from the union . But nothing , unless it 's paid for . You know that , Tom . " " But could be for Barkley , huh ? " " Maybe . Depends on who 's got the finger on the old man now . I 'll see . " " Do n't you know ? " " I really do n't . Last year it was the Republicans all the way . Might still be . " " If you write it up , put in something about what he says about Jackson . " " You want a headline for that ? Big type ? " " One more thing . You 're the man that can do this , Brack . What 's the Beaver using for editorials these days ? " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slot-machines . " " And then slot-machines and Communism for variety . He 's a journalistic craftsman . " " Right . Now , how about getting him to let you do one on Jackson ? No Negroes on the school board here . The city of Ezekiel Mountwood , the great Abolitionist , Riverton 's greatest son . We have to make democracyp 203work , see , or we 'll get Communism . How 's that for a start on an idea ? Of course you could write it up nicely yourself . " " Not me . My foot might slip . " " It 's a good cause , Brack . " " There ai n't any good causes , pal . " " Just this one thing . " " As a personal favor , boy . I want that understood . No good causes . " He had been watching the river and the circling swallows over the trees in the riverfront park . " That 's fine , is n't it ? Pretty on a hot , day . This would be a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come up and have a drink sometime . " " I will . I 'll see what I can do for you . "  |p204TH  E Camerons got to the saloon before Kettle . They found the door locked and sat on the running board of their little blue coupe waiting for him . This was the last hour of the afternoon in which the sun would be hot and just then it was very hot . The touch of it on their freshly bathed skin was irritating as sandpaper . Sitting on the running board gave them the protection of the car 's shade . Margaret was wearing a gray and pink striped dress of thin cotton . She had put on lipstick very heavily and beyond the edges of lipstick there were thin , wiry lines like the indentions a thumbnail might make at each side of her mouth . " I 'm glad you told Boyd off , " she said . " He was slimy . Maybe you should have told off Fischer too . " Cameron shook his head . " Getting hot at Boyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already . " " Really ? " " Sure . What good . . . ? " " I do n't understand you , " she said . " No . " " But I try , " she said . Her voice was small and cajoling . " What did Kettle have to say about slimy old Fischer ? You did n't tell me . " He shook his head , grinning and spreading his hands inp 204a gesture of bafflement . " Not a damn word . It was just as though he knew exactly what it would have been and did n't need to ask me . Or else . . . " They saw Kettle turn onto the street and they stood up to wave at him . " Or else what ? " Margaret said . " I do n't know . Tom and I got along swell when I found him . But I kept feeling he was being much too hearty with me . I do n't know . " Kettle stood before them , wilting , mopping his face with a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosened his tie . He waved toward the Republicansign across the street and when they 'd looked at it , he said , " I 've had enough of everything but a tall cold drink . Can you folks stand one ? I 'm awfully sorry you had to wait for me . " " Good night , do n't apologize , " Margaret said . " After all , you 're the one who 's been out calling the underground to the barricades . Andy was telling me . You still think you can trap Riverton into electing Jackson ? It 's a diabolical thought . " " I put out some bait today , " he said . " Andy and I put out some bait . " She nodded at him , " You 're quite a baiter , Tom . If you tempt everyone the way you do us . Luring us down here with the promise of steaks . " " I hope I have some . " " It does n't need to be steaks , " Margaret said . " The chance to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good , " Kettle said .. He brought a key from his jacket pocket and let them inside . " Stuffy in here . Let me get a fan . Margaret , you 'll have to supervise the cooking I do  --  I do n't promise much  --  but we 'll have the chance for ap 206nice talk before the others get here . The place is empty and I thought we 'd eat down here . But we could go to my rooms if you 'd rather ? " " Down here , " Margaret said . " It 'll be fun down here . May I work your beer spigots ? I 've always wanted to draw beer . I 'd like to be a barmaid . " " I wanted to be a historian , " Cameron said petulantly . " Old goon , " Margaret said . " You never let go , do you ? It never lets you go . " " Draw all the beer you want , " Kettle said . " There 's something better under the bar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair wine stuck under there for my own use . Help yourselves . I 'll go up and shower , if you 'll excuse me . " " Fine , " Cameron said . " You may find us stiff as pigs when you come down . We need it . I guess this weather has finally got us on edge . We 've been snapping at each other the last few weeks . " " I hope not really , " Kettle said . " Not really , " Margaret said , and then when he had left them and they heard him rattling around in his rooms overhead , she added , " And not not really . Why did you have to say that to him ? He 's not an arbiter for us . " She did not expect or wait for an answer to that . She went behind the bar , amused herself looking over labels on the shelves and on the bottles piled on the floor at the bar end . She brought two drinks to the table at which Cameron was sitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The quickest way out of Riverton or Newcastle or wherever a poor man finds himself . " In the emptiness of the saloon the sound of Kettle 's footsteps upstairs rumbled ponderously . " My , he 's a big man , " Margaret said . " Such an old maid , though . He halfway blushes whenever he looks at me. " p 207 " It 's the way you 're dressed , " Cameron said . She looked at herself . " Well , I 'm cool . " She lifted her arm . " Nothing shows , does it ? " " Mmmmmm . " Her eyes were mocking him over the edge of her glass . " I sure excite you when I put my clothes on , do n't I ? You get the right ideas at the strangest times . " " Do n't be bitter , honey . Remember , I 'm a scholar . Withdrawn . Contemplative . You 've no idea how you look in my historical perspective . " In the midst of this banter , like a ponderous drumbeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which intruded into every lapse of silence , every pause for breath even , there were echoingthrough his mind the impressions of the afternoon with Fischer and the others . Why had n't Kettle asked him about the talk with Fischer ? " How ? " Margaret asked . " Good . " What do they all know that I am constantly kept from seeing , am blind to ? Cameron asked himself . " There 's something about eating in a deserted bar , " she said . " It 's luxurious . Was n't Tom ever married ? " " How should I know ? I think he was at one time . lie 's the kind of guy whose past seems to still have all kinds of odds and ends in it that keep creeping out . Why do n't you ask him if he was ever married ? " Ile lowered his voice again , though they had been talking quietly so their words would not be heard upstairs . " When you and he were talking when you just came in , you said somethingfunny about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were going to tell him he was a master baiter . It would be just like you with your exaggeratedway of saying things . " " I did n't say that . " " I know . I know , honey . It was just a funny thing that 208popped into my head . It 's one of those quizzical questions that 's hard to stop . When does a baiter become a master baiter ? " She lifted her glass and smiled like a Sphinx at it . " You might ask him . " " That would n't be a good question to ask an old man that lives by himself . " There are no jokes . There is only meaning on one level over another , colored but transparent like an oil film on water above the stream bed , showing what everybodyknows but creating an illusion and customs of ignorance . The pucker of a ripple on the surface reflects the sky and hints , too , the guessed shape of the stone underneath . When Tom Kettle came downstairs , dressed in another seersucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was carrying a book in his hand . " Present , " he said , grinning painfully and bashfully . " You know what this is , Andy ? " " Sure . I was brought up right . It 's a Bible . What do you want us to do with it , kiss it ? Ca n't do us any harm , Tom . " Then the flyleaf came open with the most careless flicking of his fingers . " Mountwood 's , " he said . " Mountwood 's ? I ca n't take this , Tom . My Lord , man . Do n't you know what this is worth ? I ca n't take it . It must be worth a couple of hundred bucks for some museum . " He had no idea of its worth . " Like you say , it ca n't hurt you , " Kettle said . " Can I ft you another drink , Mrs. Cameron ? " Baiter , Cameron thought , and this is more bait . He has n't asked me yet what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to quit . He was n't going to ask until he gave me this  --  even though he told me before to back out if I wanted to , he had to give me this first as a bribe or maybe just a sign that there 's more to this thanp 209electing Jackson to the school board and I ca n't back out . It struck him that he might know more about the reason for the gift than Kettle did , and as he thought about it he began to resent that Kettle had thought it was necessary to bribe him . He had n't made up his mind yet about what Dean Fischer had said . " Where did you get it , Tom ? From Ezekiel ? " " What a thing to ask , " Margaret said . " Are n't you grateful ? You have n't said Thank you yet . " Kettle said , " No no no no . Do n't thank me . Thought you might be able to use it in your literary labors . You know I bought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out to him whose it was and he did n't even recognize the name . Do you know what I paid for it ? Thirty-five cents . " " Aha , " Margaret said . " There 's a detail you can put in your book , Andy . ' Ezekiel 's gospel was sold at secondhandfor thirty-five cents . ' Something for the book-club women . They 'll love it . I love it too . It is exciting . " " Write that a no-good saloonkeeper bought it for a souvenir . " " As a matter of fact , " Cameron said , " he 'd better keep it . It 's worth too much to give away , Tom . " " We 're not going to sell it ; but you could if you wanted to . I did n't get it to make money on . " " Now you 're embarrassing me , Tom . We 'll forget about it for now . " But it had led them to a favorite subject , the one thing which they had always talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on other things , and sitting here , in his restaurant in the middle of the redbricktown was n't the same as sitting in a dive in New York or in Boston with people whose minds swung like reeds gracefully in any direction  --  music , sex , art , p 210politics  --  while they got drunk , and perhaps it was only back there they would be really at home . Kettle was the mail-order , mid-Western substitute for the twentieth century and its problems ( which existed only in the New York mind ) but they could , with him and in his place , take up a gloomy Spenglerism toward Riverton and rehearse the decline of that city and the slight impact Mountwood had made on it ; put things together in order to scoff at what had become of a brave history . They noted that the Riverton Standard was named after the little paper which Ezekiel had published . From which they rambled to Mountwood and freedom of the press . " Andy , have you found anything to make you think Ezekiel cared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sure . You have to twist things too much to think he did n't . Just because Coolidge spoke about him as a free-press champion does n't mean it is n't so . He 's the American example . " " I know that much , " Kettle said with a protective sarcasm . " Sure . But do you think he really cared about it ? I do n't . I think if Ezekiel could have freed the slaves with a free press that he 'd have done it . If he could have freed them without it , he 'd have said fine . That 's my idea . " Andy nodded . " That makes him out a kind of fanatic , does n't it , Tom ? " " Was n't he ? " " That 's another quizzical question . If he was n't normalthen Riverton is . Me , I 'd rather think he was normal and Riverton is out of whack . " " That 's fine , " Kettle mocked . " It is n't true , though . Riverton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people that do n't belong in Riverton . But Riverton is here to stay . " p 211 " What an unhappy thought , " Margaret said . " I like Ezekiel better than I like Riverton . " That 's all there was to it . " I think you 're twisting it if you say he was n't worried about a free press . There would n't be any point in freeing the slaves if you had to give up a free press doing it . Would there , Andy ? Everything goes together . " She was indignant that they both laughed at her . " What 's wrong with what I said ? " " Nothing , honey . It 's just the way you said it . Such a note of optimism . We 've just been saying that Riverton is so hard-shelled you ca n't get anything to come out of it and you say everything , everything . ' You 're wonderful . " Margaret 's mouth drooped and she looked from one to another to see if they were being serious now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secretive eyes that always made her think of someone peering or spying through a barricade , were more receptive and encouraging than she had ever seen them . She felt a novel sympathy with him , but felt something dangerous , too , that she had not anticipated . " What is this ? " she asked . " A conspiracy ? When I 'm simple little old Margaret who sits home with the baby , you come home , Andy , and say , ' Tom Kettle was pointing out that such and such was all lied in with so and so . ' Then when I say it to you  --  why , it 's just silly to you . " " Well . . . " Cameron said . " Come on now . I 'm calling your bluff . " " She really is , " Kettle said laughing . " Maybe I have n't thought it out completely , " Cameronsaid . " So I 'm convinced one time we ought to look at each issue all by itself and another time . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " suppose everythingdoes go together . So we get Jackson elected to the school board . That is n't much in itself but it changesp 212everything else in Riverton . The whole thing begins to unravel . Everybody feels it . Is n't that what we want ? " " Not if you tear up everything getting him elected . Not if you lie to people . You put these stories in the paper saying there were a lot of people at the meetings for Jackson when there were n't . I did n't like that . That will only get us in trouble . " Her husband interrupted . " The Standard deals in lies . You know that , honey . Every story they run is a phony if you follow it back far enough . Lies are a kind of languagewith them . You 've got to use it in a newspaper story just like you 'd have to use French if you write in a French newspaper . " " You 've said that before and I still do n't believe it , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to write your book about Mountwood in French too ? " This hit him harder than she could have any idea , Cameron thought . The farther he had gone with his Mountwood book the more he realized that telling the truth demanded more than just wanting to tell the truth . There were times when he felt that every impulse to put an idea about Mountwood on paper was an impulse to lie , since he was still so unsure of what the man had meant . " If I have to , " he said . " If I think that will do some good . " " Then what 's the good of writing it ? " she asked , and however seriously she meant that , the question rang menacingly in his head . " You 're too clean for Riverton politics , " Kettle said . " There may be things here you do n't understand . " " Clean ? " she echoed , and again she saw in his eyes an intimation of sympathy between them that made her uneasy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets she kept from everyone . " No , I 'm not. p 213What nonsense ! If there are things I do n't understand why do n't you tell me ? " " I 'll try , " he said . The late evening sun had thrown a bar of light from one end to the other of the long room . In the supper-time street no one and nothing moved . The perfect , inhuman heat of August held Riverton in silence , or as though it had embalmed every wheel , stone , wire , and building in clear wax into which they might peer but in which they could not move . " A lot of people like you two have come to Riverton , " Kettle said fondly . " I keep snooping for them , and I find a lot of them . There was this painter I told you about , Andy . He was always getting thrown in the clink for being drunk . Why do you suppose that was ? There was one Communist organizer and his wife . And there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of place , just like Ezekiel was . Something happened to all of them and they left . Riverton ca n't stand them . But they were always the unhappy ones . Why is that ? " " You think something bad is going to happen to us ? " Margaret asked . " That 's up to you . " " He means if we 're any good . No scars , no good , " Cameron said . " How did you get by in Riverton so long ? " " You just answered that , " Kettle said . Sitting in the center of the empty room , they managed to project their notion of being alone out over the city itself , seeing it as though it were deserted by panic and flight ; and the weather helped . As though the moving sun should ring like a brass bell on the solemn and empty walls . To each of them the evening was special , and in the haze of brandy not quite real . This was what they had been looking for when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he had lured them to , unnecessarily bribing them with an old Bible that he had bought for thirty-five cents . He wanted them there on that island of the mind that he had made for himself , whatever use he might want to make of them . That was hard to tell . When is he going to ask me if Dean Fischer told me to lay off this nigger business ? Cameron thought . " Are you satisfied with your day with the underground ? " he asked Kettle . Kettle tried to answer that while they finished their drinks and then went to the kitchen where Margaret insisted on helping , watching closely at least , as he fixed the steaks . There were just three of them , bright , dripping red , and huge , laid together behind the ice in the wooden refrigerator . " Such bait , " Margaret said happily . " How marvelous , Tom . I love you . " And Cameronwondered once again , Why is he so damn sure he needs bait for us ? Kettle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was not much clarity , not much direction in the account he gave . He had been to see eight people , or nine , if Brack was counted . It was not clear as Margaret said more than once , whether he thought these people were influential  --  principals who could get something done . It was n't clear either whether he had persuaded them they should support Jackson in the coming election . In his painstaking , roundabout way he kept insisting on the weaknesses of the people he had seen and on the whole scheme of the campaign . In the end it was as though they had listened to a lot of babbling voices , like the murmur in a big department store where thousands are talking and only produce a suggestive hum like music . But there was something . Not much . A pattern drawn in syrup of lines leading to a single center , p 215a balancing pattern perilously achieved with each person committed partially because Kettle had promised them that someone else was working . " I see it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you 're fitting these people together . You do n't have much faith in any of these people though , do you ? Alderbritton , Boyd , Glassman , and this dentist Dupree all sound like pretty weak reeds . " " You make them sound that way , " Margaret said to Kettle . " I do n't get it . And another thing I do n't get  --  where do Andy and I fit in ? Really , wo n't you tell us ? You must see us just the way you see these others  --  somebody that 's got just one little quirk you can use . I 'd like to hear . " Kettle shook his head in confusion . " Oh , no , " he said . He gulped his coffee . While they had been eating slowly and listening to him , he had alternately given all his attention to what he was explaining and to eating very fast to keep up with them . It was a hectic , nervous performance . He seemed now to be exhausted , ready to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like you people , " he said . Cameron thought , Why did she ask that ? Because if he thinks we 're weak reeds too then he thinks about himself the same way and what it amounts to is this the only chance he 's got  --  we 've got  --  of success is that somehow our failures can be parlayed into exactly the right combination . It might work , but , God , it 's flimsy. 1 le expects us to run like rats in a maze and he does n't think we 'll bother to work the maze out ourselves . " You people and Barkley and maybe Boo Gordon are as much in the middle of this as me . But the others . . . " Kettle was saying . " All right , " Margaret said . " You were just telling us how many stupid things Boo Gordon did . How he'dp 216almost spoiled some of your contacts . Now how about us ? " " I did n't want to give you the wrong idea about Boo . He makes mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a mistake last night , Cameron thought . He remembered the revulsion he had felt when he found the rubber on the car floor . Why had Boo mixed  --  as it appeared he had  --  his political errand with his pursuit of sex in one scrambled evening so that a judgment of exactly what he was up to became impossible ? How could you feel secure with people like that around you ? How could you depend on them ? " Boo has to be helped along , " Kettle said . " The way you would need help or I would need help . " He 's conning us again , Cameron thought , or he 's foolinghimself , because he needs  --  somehow , psychologically , perhaps  --  to have us all believe that he 's the super rat we count on that can solve the maze for us . He thinks he is . He does n't see himself the way he sees us , after all . But I 've known this before , Cameron went on to himself . It 's as though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get clearer and clearer , transfixed , not doing anything about it . Because I could n't do anything about it , he thought . Because somehow I was fixed in a double pattern of rationalization that convinced me the paths to success and destruction were the same , so I was motionless as a cutout on wheels , being towed closer and closer to this tight cage that 's got to give . I 've got to act now . Whatever way I can find . Tom Kettle did n't apparently want anything in motion that he had not started himself . He wanted every line in his own hands . How could you tell whether those hands were skillful or just capricious ? He would n't claimp 217that anything was going to succeed ; it did n't seem necessary to him to believe that it would . Maybe all the bait he put out was as crudely obvious as the gift of Mountwood 's Bible that lay there now on the counter . That could n't work . You ca n't bribe people into doing what they think is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would understand that . His kind of crudeness might do more harm than good . Maybe he had flavored his story with contempt for other people in order to impress the Camerons . That was crude at the bottom , too . Of course they would overlook it , but would the others ? The conclusion was there , whichever way you came at it . No matter how much you liked Kettle or , if that was the way it had to be , you pitied him for his perilous cause , his was not the right way . How ? Then Tom Kettle was not the right man to do it . Who ? Margaret and Kettle were working toward the same question . " I agree with you , Mrs. Cameron , that we need the union . There ought to be people we could reach there without having to depend on Barkley to make a speech to them . And what did you say , if the Negroes and unions do n't work together we do n't get any progress ? But this union is n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they tend to be . That 's natural . " " There is n't a man in this union that feels the way you do about Negroes except Arthur Wilks , and he could n't persuade anybody to buy a sack of peanuts , let alone persuade these Hoosiers they 've got to vote with the Negroes . " And here , Cameron noticed , the same unusualp 218snobbishness  --  the implication that even Arthur Wilks felt that way only because he was a hanger-on of Kettle 's . " You mean you do n't know anyone else ? " Margaret said . " Well . . . " Kettle 's blush and smile were perpetual now as he resisted Margaret 's attack . " Maybe that 's the same thing . If we ca n't get to them , and they wo n't come to us . " " Of course it is n't , " Margaret said . " It would all be hopeless if you were right . " He shrugged . " I wo n't let it be hopeless , " she said gaily , believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoined the conversation . " Are you hopeless about it , Tom ? " " It may work this time . " " Do you believe it will ? " Margaret asked . That was a question that anyone but Kettle could have answered yes or no . As Barkley would say later , " He 's been at it too long to know what he thinks . " " Except at night , " he said . " Oh , dear , " she said mocking . " And it 's getting dark now . " " Yes , " Kettle said . " I 'll get the lights . I 'm awfully sorry I did n't realize that I had n't . . . I 'll get them . - Here . " It was part of that strange evening that would linger in Cameron 's mind , qualified by the descending clamor of the sunlight now faded , by the vision of Mountwood 's Bible being towed on a string through black waters , by the disequilibrium the brandy produced , by his disappointment in Tom Kettle  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson leading his boy George , and Arthur Wilks should come in . At the same moment , patp 219like the villain in an old tragedy , the telephone rang . Or , if you wanted to , you could say Kettle made it ring . Kettle was at least the stage on which Riverton played out its little drama of John Jackson for school board , and he may have been all the actors too . The telephone was just behind the bar but nobody meant to listen to Kettle as he answered it . " Howya ? " Boo Gordon said . " How 's things going ? He was wearing a battered old canvas hat . His face was burned darker than his hair . It was always hard to tell what he was looking at . His deep-set eyes never seemed to focus on anything . He sat down across the table from Margaret Cameron and lit himself a cigaret without offering the pack around . " May I have one ? " Margaret asked , and Boo acted as though he had been caught stealing chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for her , then holding the match like a penitent votary until he was sure that the cigaret was burning properly. . . but Jay , we decided . . . " " How are you , Cameron , Missus ? " Arthur Wilks always smiled . His lower lip fitted over his upper one as though he was trying to keep from saying anything . " . . . Jay , do you know what you 're doing ? I talked to Dupree this afternoon . You 've got to go through with it , do you understand ? Do you think . . . ? " Though they did not mean to and though Boo was whistling faintly , they were all listening to Kettle now , and it was necessary , somehow , that they should all have heard him lie . " Nothing , Jay . No . I give you my word that nothing has happened . Jay . . . " He came around the bar and sat again at the table with them . " Well , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art ? Boo ? " His big hands , white from scrubbings in the kitchen , lay on the table among the dirty plates and napkins as if they were dead or maybe held without any motion but the wrist 's bulging pulse by some steel stiffness inside . " Barkley has quit , " he said . " He did n't say if , he said no . " He looked at Jackson sadly and shook his head . " So , " Margaret said , almost in triumph . " So your whole house of cards comes falling down . " Now surely her doubts were proved right . " He 's a fool . Damn fool , " Kettle said . His voice was like a nail scraping on tin . " John . I talked to Dupree this afternoon . Seemed like Attorney Barkley might have forgotten us . ' That 's the way he said it . Is that right , John ? " " That 's right , Tom . They are wondering about him . " " Damn it , " Kettle said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink all around ? " He got them , and he got a bottle of strawberry pop for George Jackson who was sitting quietly in a chair by the wall . The brandy again , the civilized distorter that moves everything a tenth of an inch from its accustomed place so that everything is seen differently as though the world was made new , but still meaningful with memories of the old . " This does n't fit with what you 've told us about Barkley , " Cameron said . " Something does n't fit . He would n't sell us out . " Kettle had hold of himself again . He was tugging at the corner of his lip with thumb and forefinger . " You know what I said about Ezekiel ? That he did n't care if the press was free if he could do something more important ? That 's Barkley . He 's not playing for nickels . " " And we are ? " p 221Kettle waited a long time . " No , " he said . " This is big enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was too close to a big Coca-Cola sign on the south wall , and from its semi-circle of scarlet produced a really hellish glare . Boo Gordon 's head with the shapeless cotton hat was rimmed with the light , and from where Cameron sat , the childish , delicate face was a spot of shadow against the morbid red . What a silly circle of conspirators we are , Cameron thought  --  a flabby , egotistic saloonkeeper , a punk kid , a quiet Negro who maybe knew something but was n't letting on , a dumb , good-hearted steelworker , and a couple of veteran readers of the New Republic . When someone asked , " What we going to do now , Tom ? " it seemed to him to epitomize their silliness that they should always be asking Kettle . We 're going to talk , talk , talk , talk , he thought . A million dollars ' worth of jabber at a low rate per ton . All right , perfectly all right if there were n't something that really needed doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were supposed to be doing something , and maybe doing things politically was never anything but massing talk . Maybe Kettle had something built together out of ' talk , however rickety and suspicious , before Barkley pulled the pin out , but he had put it together with such wandering talk that it did n't seem possible to go through it all again .. If they could n't do anything but talk , there should be some talking done to the point . When you find a situation you itch to act . Amazingly like a projector and extender of his thought , Boo Gordon suddenly said , " Machine guns . " He waved his hands and Margaret stared at him stupefied . " That 's what we need . A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a . " No one knew whether to laugh or call the nut wagon , because that wasp 222about the first comment Boo had made all evening . Good Lord , so this was a partner of their enterprise ! " Tom , " Cameron said . " The main thing we wanted Barkley for was to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go . Arthur is a member . He can get me the floor . I 'll see what I can do with them . That might be worth some-thing . " He knew he should have talked it over with Margaret before he made any such rash commitment , but he knew too that after the first recriminations ( " That 's fine , Andy , but I do n't like to find out your plans by listening when you talk to other people " )  --  after those it would be all right . Even with the baby to think about it would be all right . Kettle was looking at him with surprise , and he looking back to say to him , Why are you surprised ? I 've paid you for your Bible now , I do n't owe you anything . The question came as flat and toneless as though it had been in a formal catechism . " What did Dean Fischer have to say to you this afternoon , Andy ? " He 's waited all this time , Cameron thought , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me this afternoon or when we first came , when whatever I answered could have been passed off as a joke . He waited until he had me on the spot before he asked it . He shrugged and said , " You were right . It was n't so hard to guess . That 's all he could say , is n't it , since he lives in Riverton too ? He gabbed on about my book  --  and the free press , et cetera . He gave me a word to the wise . Let me know I had n't gone too far . Yet . " " Can you get another job this late in the year ? " " Margaret and I can manage . " Thanks , we can do some things for ourselves. p 223Kettle shook his head and the expression on his face was of genuine concern . " Do n't make up your mind yet , boy . You know it might not do any good anyway . The union does n't meet until Tuesday . You might be thinking over what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday . " " I said I would do it , " Cameron said . Kettle did n't seem to hear him . " Do n't forget . You 're not Barkley . You might not do any good at all . Think it over . " The evening could not have ended at this point . Things had got terribly messed up in the last three hours , but the Camerons might have gone home thinking there was some difficult but still reasonable thread of continuity running through the situation in which they were now so irrevocably involved if Boo Gordon had not supplied a final touch . After he had foolishly broken into the conversation to suggest " Machine guns , " he had become quiet again . His eyes seldom left the glass he held in front of him on the table . Sometimes he would stir as though with a suppressedexcitement or maybe a commentary which he was making to himself on the pedestrian considerations they raised . Sometimes he went quietly to the bar and refilled his glass with brandy and water . Now when Cameron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in Riverton , Boo said , " Nuts . " As though a two-for-a-nickel job was a trivial thing to lose or maybe , on the other hand , as though a town where you could lose your job for backing a Negro candidate was too trivial to worry about . What did he mean ? The others at the table paused and turned to him , politely listening for his explanation. p 224With all their attention turned to him he spoke in a low voice to Margaret . " Did you ever see this trick done , Mrs. Cameron ? " He set his cigaret between the thumb and forefinger with the coal against the ball of the finger . She had seen it before . It was a common drinker 's trick . The idea was to pinch an iced glass hard enough to numb and chill the ball of the forefinger , then to hold the cigaret briefly . Boo 's glass had no ice and he had n't pinched it . He simply pressed the coal against his finger and let it burn . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trick was time . She could smell it now . The smell was like burning hair or fingernails . She lunged across the table and struck his hand with her fist so the cigaret bounced away . " You little fool , " she said , smiling angrily . They could all smell the burned skin . " Good night , " he said . He went out , turning at the door and nodding good night to them once more . " I do n't understand , " Cameron said . " Was he trying to prove something ? " Margaret said , " Could n't you smell it burning ? " She spoke almost hysterically . This on top of the other upsets of the evening . " I want to go home , Andy . " " Showing off , " Cameron said . " Tom , what do you think ? " " Yes , showing off , " Kettle said . His face  --  and Cameronwas watching it with the same stupefied fascination as a minute before they had been watching Boo burn his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that burn and the pain of frustration that prompted the act and the pain of a parent who has to watch his childp 225do something ridiculous in public . It was pretty horrible to watch him , but then he got control of himself and said , " Boo . . . He 's having a hard time . You 've no idea what he 's come through . His folks . . . awful . Kind of religious maniacs and . . . " He sensed that this explanationwas not hitting the necessary note . " Boo 's been having some trouble with a young lady . " " Oh , a girl . " This explanation seemed so complete , so common , so unimportant that everyone relaxed and grinned . So that 's all it was . Trouble ! Cameron thought sardonically. p 226S A T U R D A Y morning was hot with rain-threatening mugginess . At breakfast the baby , Ellen , as though her skin were an itchy barometer , had been mean to the limit of her ingenuity . Her big eyes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddity on having been frightened by a Cyclops while she was pregnant  --  rolled angrily in her pink and sweating face . She upset her fruit juice and dabbed her face with the sticky stuff , then cried in vexation because she had done it and because  it did n't feel good . " She 's got a little breaking out . Heat rash on her bottom , " Margaret sighed . " You look a bit sandy yourself , " Cameron said . " Sandy ? I 'm fair fed up , man . If you touched me I 'd pop . Oh , I do n't mean that , but hell . . . " " The season in hell , dog days in Riverton . It 's no place for a child of the elite , " Cameron said . " Why do n't you take Ellen back to Massachusetts for a while ? " Margaret arched her eyebrows in a gamin expression of pleasure with the idea . " O.K. Will you come along ? " " Ah , " he scoffed . " You know better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be fun ? Huh , Andy ? We could afford it somehow . " " It would be nice for you and Ellen , " he said . " I 'd justp 227as soon you were out of town for a while anyway , both of you . " " Oh . " Margaret had been putting things in the icebox and carrying dishes to the sink , but now she sat heavily in the chair opposite him , rested her elbows on the table , and studied him from a personal and complex point of view . " Oh . You planning something desperate ? " Of course the way she said it demanded that he give a reassuring laugh . " Nuts , " he said . " The only desperation Riverton allows is interior . " " Then , " she said , " If you 're all desperate inside you 'd better come with us and get it out of your system . " " You know better than that . " " Nope . " He said , impatiently , " You know I promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . You do n't want me to talk in front of them , do you ? " " What does that connect with ? " Her eyes widened in genuine surprise . " I want you to do what you think is right . " " Nuts , " he said , surprised himself that , he could speak to her with such heat , as though she and not the elusive , hated , constrictions of Riverton were the cause of his feeling . " Do what I think is right and get my butt canned out of here and go on to some cow college next year and another one farther back in the sticks the year after that while the damned book gets further and further from being anything I can finish . Is that what you want ? " She winced while he was talking , waited a minute unhappilyafter he had stopped . Then she came around and stood with one hand under his chin , lifting it so he would have to meet her eyes . " There are a lot of things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a small voice . " I do n't know whatp 228you 're thinking about if you do n't tell me . Whatever you make up your mind to do  --  talk or not talk  --  is fine with me . Believe that ? You 'd better believe that . I 'll go to cow colleges with you . Do n't you know that ? " " Yeah , " he said . " Yeah . " " Or I 'll have teas with Dean Fischer 's wife if that 's what you want , " she said . " The bitch . " He laughed and pushed her gently aside as he got up . " We 'll wait and see . I 'd better talk to the union , though , and right now I 'd better get to work on Ezekiel . " He had just gone to the front porch , spread out his notes , lifted the cover from his typewriter , lit a cigaret and begun to stare into the trees across the street when she came out to join him . " Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , " he said . " You know I ca n't let a placid old pedagogic fool like Dean Fischer scare me away from this nigger business . ' That would be licking too much spit . " " Well , " she said . " That 's very true . But since the other night at Kettle 's place I 've been wondering more than ever about him . About some things . Something 's going on we do n't understand . " " A lot of things , " he admitted mildly . " No . I do n't mean in general . You 've got to look at as much as you can . I do n't get this business of Barkley pulling out . If he 's the kind of a guy that Kettle has been claiming . . . Andy . . . " " Uh huh ? " " Do n't you think we ought to go see Barkley before we get any deeper in this thing ? Would n't he talk to us ? I 'm afraid to keep going along so blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " p 229 " Today ? Before you talk to the union ? " " Not today , honey . Monday . " " I think you should . " As she left him , his thoughts , driven by separate compulsions , flickered between images of Mountwood 's world and the stresses of this present . He had not yet considered what he would say to the union , if he spoke to them . That was something to think about too . There also could be success or failure . He would have to drive one idea home by whatever repetition or shouting he could bring himself to  --  the working man has no security unless he guards the rights of Negroes . Give them their rights if you want your own . They would listen to that , all right . Would they ? Kettle seemed to be grinning at him sardonically . He picked up the volume of Whittier 's antislavery poems from which he meant to Lake quotes for his book , and opened it to the Toussaint L'Ouverture with its footnoteof Wordsworth 's poem about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that the editor had to put it in to show what Whittier must have felt and intended  --  reading " There 's not a breathing of the common wind that will forget thee , thou hast great allies , thy friends are exultations , agonies and love and man 's unconquerablemind . " Fine , he thought . Fine for the book , but what about man 's conquerable mind , that we 've learned about in our time ? The swing in which he sat creaked and the leaves rustled . A cleaner 's truck stopped at the house next door . Two little boys passed with a string of fish , and a little way farther he saw them get off the sidewalk to let anotherboy pass on his bicycle . Down at the corner two women stood in an attitude of monumental patiencep 230waiting for the bus to take them shopping . In the midst of this bourgeois morning he sat knitting and unknitting his world , from Ezekiel Mountwood to this living minute , looking for material to support a decision for himself while fifteen blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . An hour or so before , Kettle had been arrested . Two patrolmen had driven up to his saloon in a black Ford police car , and one of them , Duncan , had come in to make the arrest . There was no fuss at all  --  in fact not more than fifteen words had been exchanged in the simple process of the arrest  --  and Kettle had ridden with them to City Hall . There in one of the corridors he had seen again  --  as it had perhaps been arranged that he would  --  the two men from the carnival gang who had come into his saloon for the first time less than two weeks before . They had found his bar by accident the first time , and then on a payday had come back to Riverton to visit it and visit him again . Their return was not an accident , but a part of the same tight pattern of necessity that brought him here to meet them  --  see them at least  --  this morning . The one called Dick , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white T-shirt this morning and he had been given a haircut . He sat on a bench beside a policeman , and the little fellow , Jonesy , was on the other side , sitting with his feet not quite touching the floor , like a child or maybe like a puppet , with his Punch 's face drawn into studious wrinkles and his cheek and nose discolored with bruise marks on one side . Neither looked up when Kettle went by them and he gave no sign that he recognized them . He was n't seeing or nodding to anyone that morning . He was scared . Whenp 231Patrolman Duncan had come into the saloon and told him they wanted him at the station  --  not explaining why , too bashful to come right out and say it , Kettle understood , because the fear and guilt of it were there at once , coming automatically as they would have come from any sudden fright , as , if a pistol had been fired by his ear without warning , he would have thought , That night . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had locked the door and turned out the lights downstairs . He could hardly walk to the car . He thought he could hardly walk to it , but he did n't give any sign then or later of how scared he was , moving through the next few hours with his eyelids lowered , his head up , saying nothingexcept to talk about the bail . Then when they got there he thought he could not get out of the car and get into the station . The glaring sun and the tarry smell of the streets echoed the qualities of his terror dreams . In broad daylight something was happening to him that even in the night had never quite caught him . The mob that he had so often assembled in his imagination appeared , in reality , not with torches and ropes , but in the shape of the familiar personages of Riverton going about their routine jobs . But the hot smell of the street and the light that he could hardly bring his eyes to focus on were enough like the terrors of his dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed , was much the same as the mental punishmentwhich had driven him to commit it in the first place . All at once , on a morning in 1947 , he was a child in the world of adults . All at once . He had lived in Riverton a long time and had paid his taxes , run his little business , talked baseball scores and weather and done the other things necessary to pass for an adult , and suddenly all that was gone , found out , forfeited . It was as if they had p 232found out a secret he had kept since he was a child and , discovering it , had rolled back Time , made him exactly that child again ( only now grotesquely loaded with fat like a child wearing the padded unfitting hand-me-downs of his father that will embarrass him at school ) and created the relationship of father and child first for Patrolman Duncan and him , then Sergeant MacArthur and him , and finally for the City Judge and him . So he was standing in front of the Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet , wondering if he was going to fall over , when the bail was set , and it was only because he was by the nature of what they now knew about him reduced to anxious dependence on the adult Judge that he made the mistake and said , " I 'd like to call . Would you call my attorney , Jay Barkley ? " He did n't see or at least did n't pay any attention to the smile which showed almost benignly on the Judge 's face . " Barkley , huh ? Sure we 'll call him . " It took him a long time to get it straightened out that he did n't need a lawyer at all and could post his own bond . But that was after they had called Barkley and he refused to come . They had arrested Tom Kettle in his saloon at 8:30 on Saturday morning . That was in time for the story to make the Standard 's deadline at 11:00 , in plenty of time so the Saturday-afternoon crowd in the downtown saloons and the farmers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hear about it . It was not a front-page story and ( or because ) it did n't have to be . Whoever wanted or was supposed to find it had no trouble hunting it out in the lower right-hand corner of Page 3 . That linked , looped nervous system which was Riverton could detect when it wanted to , orp 233when there was peril to the faith by which it existed , slight stimuli and echo them abroad through the outwardchannels of its nerves so the hackles would rise , adrenalin flow , the conditioned mind rehearse its defensivecabalisms . The story discreetly said that Thomas Kettle , proprietorof Kettle 's Bar and Restaurant at Number 23 on 18th Street , had been arrested on charges of moral turpitude , involving immoral acts with two men , members of the carnival company which had its stand in Riverton two weeks before and in Steel City a week ago . ( The Standard served as a daily paper for Steel City as well as Riverton . ) The men , Richard St. John and Ralph Jones of Cleveland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set for them . The story did not say that , these men had been held for three days before somebody decided the time was right to arrest Kettle . That was the black-and-white story . No more details in the Riverton Standard . It was a family paper and touched pitch only for the sake of public service . No more details in the Riverton Standard which  --  the orators said  --  bore the purest name in American journalism ( that was the name Ezekiel Mountwood used for his abolitionist paper and the name which was so bitter to the property owners that they hanged him for it ) . In the produce stations , loitering at the edges of the parking lot , in the bars , the backrooms of stores , the white chorus of Riverton found the story and responded . They got Tom Kettle . Locked him up . No ! What for ? Fruitin . They got that Kettle . About time. p 234Is n't he the one ? Yes , he is the one . ? Yeah . Does n't come right out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Standard story while the moisture from a glass wets a circle higher up the page , searching as though there might be some missed word there which , touched , would release an evil , heart-warmingflood ) but they put it clever so you know damn well that 's what he was doing . Ever get it off'n Kettle , Luster ? You shut your mouth ? Just wondered how it  --  You shut your mouth . Is n't he the one ? Yes , he is the one . That got Art Wilks ' wife that time . He is the one . Ought to have them snipped . Ought to have them clipped . Ought to have them fried . Brack , what do you think ? Must I think ? I 'm not paid to think . The story was news . Crap . Is there any paper that would n't have printed it ? Crap . You know . . . All right . You know and I know . You want to write an editorial about who done it ? There are n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People 's Open Forum . But it was n't put in for news . That 's all I know . Why should they call you and tell you ? You ai n't crippled . You could have found it out . It was n't put in for news. p 235But it was news . Oh yes . Let 's get a drink . The Saturday afternoon chant of voices became insistent , angry , and reverberating in the buildings of this city by the big river. 235p 236TH E story , which naturally blasted the little campaignto elect John Jackson to the school board , came in time so Brack would never have to write the risky editorial suggesting that Communism could best be held back by the practice of democracy . Or rather , since he had really begun to write it , praising the prosperity , the reputation , intelligence , enlightened selfinterest , the prospects for the future of Riverton and was almost satisfied how he would put the hook under all this bait  --  rather he did n't have to show it to the editor Denham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , sucking his buck teeth in a way that would finally have ended up as a smile , knowing and crafty , as though he had maybe discovered the ruse that Brack had attempted , driving his editorial mind to the heart of it all by saying , " Seems to me that this "  --  rapping the sheet of paper with the back of his hand  --  " is the line the Communistsare taking these days . I like your idea "  --  meaningthe nice compliments to Riverton , not that Jackson should be elected to the school board  --  " but I do n't think you 've got it quite simmered out yet . I 've been thinking along those lines myself . But I think we can use yours . " Well , that scene which might have happened never did , because when Brack found out Kettle had been arrested he tore up the beginning he had made. p 237The Kettle affair broke in time so that Cameron , sitting on his porch shuffling the notecards labeled Mountwood , never would have to decide whether he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steelworker 's Union in Jackson 's behalf . He had believed that the decision was made . After Kettle 's arrest  --  which was almostfour whole days before he would be finally committedpast any recall , so that he would have no choice except to send Dean Fischer a short note that said , " I am resigning herewith " or " forthwith "  --  he was never again entirely sure that he had made the decision . He had come back to his porch swing , his typewriter , and his books after lunch when Margaret called him to the phone and he heard the news from Boo Gordon . " They 've arrested Tom . " Just that way . And his first reaction to hearing that would never go out of his mind , made him sure later that there was a mysterious identity of kind to everything that Kettle ever did . They 've found out , he thought , they 've discovered t hat we are running Jackson for the school board and they 're arrestingus for it  --  and the feeling of guilt rose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Kettle 's arrest . Then he said , " What ? What for ? Speak up , Boo . I ca n't hear you very well . " " I think it 's to smear Jackson , " Boo said . " Who told you ? " " It 's in the paper . " " Well , what did the story say ? " " Aah , I ca n't make it out . They have it all messed up so I ca n't make it out . Get yourself a paper . They only cost a nickel . " " Do n't get so excited , Boo . You think it 's a smear ? " " The Fascist bastards . . . " p 238 " What does the story say , now ? Do you have it there ? I 'd have to go downtown to get an afternoon paper . Ours wo n't be here for an hour . " Boo did n't answer and he hung up . Margaret was standing at his elbow with the baby in her arms . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom . Some kind of a smear charge , Boo thought . " " What was it ? " " Boo would n't say . Must be graft , or liquor , or women . His shady past . You remember what the librarian told me . They must have dug up something old on him . " Margaret 's face got terribly white . She started to say something and then shook her head . Putting the baby in the big chair , she got cigarets for them . " I wonder if it 's . . . ? " " What ? " She shook her head . " I can imagine all sorts of things . " " The police probably can too . " " You go get a paper , " she said firmly . He bought one at the newsstand on Main Street , standing in the middle of the sidewalk while ambling shoppers brushed past and the sun made a dazzle of the sheets through which he searched . He got it straightened out finally . The cripple who ran the stand had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story and as he folded it back together and put it under his arm , asked , " Find what you want , Buddy ? " " Yes , " he said . " Thank you . " He drove past Kettle 's place on his way home . Seeing no one inside he did n't stop . " Sure enough , " he said , as he gave the paper to Margaret . " They do n't play for nickels when they play politics in Riverton . This is really cut-throat pool they'rep 239playing . " He watched her as she read through the short paragraphs . " Somebody has got the big gun out for us . My God , what a frightening town . " " Do you believe it ? " she asked , her lips trembling . He said irritably , " Believe what ? That they arrested Tom ? Sure . That they 're trying to smear this campaign to get a Negro "  --  he did n't say Jackson now  --  " on the school board ? Sure . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " He was surprised how angry this made him . " What guff ! What 's the matter with you , honey ? A man is presumedinnocent until he 's accused is that it ? " " Andy , now . I would n't . . . well , would n't jump on him anyway . " " O.K. , honey . But all I see is that they 've picked out the one charge that 's really dynamite really loaded with emotion  --  to tie it up in people 's minds with Negro rights and whatever else they mean to sling ; it him before this is over . It 's nothing new . It 's the old story that the pro-slavers circulated about Mountwood , same kind of thing , that he was slipping in to see this old lady Corrin while her husband was n't home . They 've modernized it . Adultery has lost its punch by now , so t.hc y accuse him of homosexuality . That 's all . " Margaret was still shaking her head . " I wonder . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did you start to say just after Boo called ? Before we knew what they had arrested him for ? " " That , " she said simply . " Nuts . " " I 'm not joking , Andy . " " Well , what on earth made you think that ? This old superstition that women can tell fairies just by coming into the room with them ? Lord , honey , do n't tell me youp 240believe that . Do you believe that you sour milk when you menstruate ? That 's the same kind of fable . You 're too old for such foolishness . Then there 's that kid you used to go with before we were married . Everybody knew he was a fairy but you . " " Oh , " she said . She did not want to believe any superstitions , but she did believe this about Tom . She shook her head . " No . All I asked was , What if it is true ? and you raise your voice . Why are you afraid to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're taking sides with Riverton , and condemning Tom without a hearing . " " I 'm not condemning him . I did n't say anything about that . You wo n't talk about it because it  --  because Tom 's a friend of yours . " " And that would make me out one of the daisy chain ? " This last remark of hers had not made him angry , but only vaguely uneasy when he had to agree that she was right , and in his own uneasiness he saw the token of the male wrath that would be roused up against Tom by this story , making him the scapegoat , the excoriable image of anybody 's insecurity and doubt . " Let 's stop being so smart with ourselves , " he said . " Maybe I 've got a block against admitting it . Assume that it 's true . He 's a kind of lonely old guy . Maybe he got drunk and got into something . It could have happened . I do n't know . I just rather doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret said . " Maybe he 's always been one . " " Oh hell , honey . Maybe he has . So what ? " " So what ? " She had seen her opening and came through it fiercely . " So he had no right , if he knew that , knew he might get caught , to mix us up in it . Maybe you think it 's easy to be noble and say , sure , I do n't needp 241this little old job , I do n't need to write this little old book . We 'll move somewhere else and mess around in some other jerk-water college . Are n't you and I ever going to have anything , Andy ? Where we can settle down ? But I would n't mind that if it would do some good . He got us into this , knowing that it could pop like this . Just for nothing . How about the rest of the people he got into it ? And the Negroes and all that really need something done for them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , did he ? He can wear silk pants if he wants to . I 'm not prejudiced about that . But he had no right . . . " She had said it now , got it out of her system so it would n't bother again , closing up her accounts so she would not have to be troubled again by what she did n't understand of Tom Kettle . " O.K. , " Andy said wearily . " Thai 's a line case . I agree with it . But I do n't think it 's true . You have nothing to go on but a superstition . I would just remind you that you never mentioned such a possibility until you saw it a few minutes ago in the newspaper . Until , as a matter of fact , you knew he was in some kind of trouble . " " But . . . " she said . Her head hung like a child 's . " Where do you begin , Andy ? Where do you begin , when everybody makes such damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mean to be bitchy about it . " After a moment she said , " Why did they arrest him if it was n't true ? He could sue them for false arrest . " " That 's pretty easy . They 're not playing for nickels , that 's all . You know we talked about that phone call he got from Barkley . Some way Kettle and this whole business of getting Jackson on the school board are mixed up with Barkley . And some Mr. Big  --  Mr. Hughes maybe ?  --  is shooting for Barkley , trying to mess things up by attacking Tom . So they arrest Tom on false charges. p 242Maybe they even have to pay him damages , but I doubt it , because they have him spotted as a nigger lover in Riverton and he could n't pull much real weight . Mr. Big has what he wants if he wrecks Barkley for next year , cutting off his Negro support . Or planting the idea that he might be queer . I do n't know . That could be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The compliment was not quite deserved . The scheme had missed fire when Barkley had got wind that there was a Kettle of fish cooking . The trap would have snapped more effectively if he had spoken to the union , urged their support for Jackson , if Brack had put the story of Barkley 's speech in the Standard . But no securitysystem is perfect and no intelligence system , either . Nobody in City Hall knew that Barkley had planned to speak to the union . They had missed a bet . Barkley had n't missed any in this encounter . When the Judge called him and told him that Kettle was there under arrest and asked if he wanted to arrange bail , he did n't ask what the charges were or even expose himself by asking , " Why do you call me ? " He said , " No , " and hung up . ) " Oh , hell , " Margaret said . " Why did this have to happen ? " She began to cry , picked up the baby as though that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood with her face against the screen , looking at a fragment of that Riverton which she hated and which baffled her , which had betrayed her and the fine ideas she had been saving so long , the ideas that her husband  --  gone so long overseas and not even home when the baby was born  --  must have been fighting a part of the war for , a better world which her child , at least , should live in by rights . And some day they would see the rosy beginning ofp 243it . In Riverton everything went backwards , picking at the hopes and the nice illusions one by one and shredding them up like no longer pertinent love letters . " It did n't happen , " Andy said . " Somebody . . . " " Oh , somebody , somebody . It is n't somebody . It 's just Riverton . " In her tears she felt a rush of compassion for everything that Riverton hurt , and even for Tom Kettle . " He ca n't help it . Nobody can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to it , Andy ? " He said , " Honey , do n't do that . This is only a small bobble . Riverton is n't the country , thank God . This will blow over like everything else . " " Do n't talk to me like I was the baby , Andy . " He had come to put his hands on her shoulders , but , she pushed him , who could only grasp the things that men can understand , away from her . " He can get out on bail , ca n't he ? " " I have no idea . He must have money enough . " " Go get him . He must be out . Bring him to supper here . " " Are you sure ? " " I 'll be nice to him . Go get him . And you be gentle with him , too . But he did n't have any right . . . " Kettle was alone when Cameron came into the saloon looking for him . He was sitting in the booth farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him , but he was not drinking . Cameron did not see him at first in the dim room , and Kettle made no sound to guide him , only watching him with opaque eyes , noting an intruder on the field where the battalions fighting were all his own . " Tom , " Cameron said , " am I disturbing you ? The door was n't locked . Mind if I sit down a minute ? " p 244 " No . " But there was hostility in the voice , forbiddingcompany and particularly forbidding sympathy . " Tom , Margaret sent me down to ask you to come tothe house for supper . " " Margaret ? " " You know . Margaret . " " Oh . Sure . Sit down . Get yourself a drink . Here , I 'll get you one . " " Stay where you are , Tom . My Lord ! I do n't want any now , thanks . We can get a bottle and take it to the house . " But already after making the gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no attention to him . " Tom , we 've all got ourselves wound up thinking too much about this mess in Riverton . Tonight we 'll listen to some records . Talk about something else for a change . Listen . It will do you good . " " I 'm tired , Andy . Some other night . " There was the kind of moment in which you hear the clock tick , or listen to any handy mechanical sound and find in it as much meaning and more propriety than in anything you can think of to say . Time was the medium in which they swam . The medium that filled the room and in which they sat immersed like divers , the words they said not communicating , but , like bubbles of breath expelled under water , rising and vanishing . " Why do n't you stay out at the house for a couple of days ? " Cameron said . " Thank you , Andy . Thank you . " And then a minute later , to explain why he would not , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium thickening . Deadly Time toward whose surface we fight gasping and hoping and seeing over our heads not light itself but the filtered luminosity of green , p 245wonderful air , surged higher in the room , higher than the bartop and the gleaming spigots , up the hardly visible signs advertising Coca-Cola and the local brands of beer , choking the room with its dammed silt . " You 've had a hell of a day . " Then pretty soon , " This is a hell of a way to smear a man , Tom . " " Smear ? " " To accuse you of . . Time . " Oh . " " I read about it in the paper . " " Was it in the paper ? " As if whether it had been or had n't been was something he had not got around to worrying about yet . That was something that effected other people and he would think about that when he had time . " Naturally . Naturally . That 's what they arrested you for , was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help me and Margaret and the rest of us by showing the pure shape of evil and injustice in what we think we 're fightingagainst . Just say they framed you . ) " You read about it in the paper , huh ? " " Boo Gordon called and told me about it . " And Time . And Time . " Boo read about it in the paper . There was n't any need for that , " Kettle said . " I guess so . He said he had . Come on out to the house , Tom . We can talk about it there . Margaret wants you to . " " Boo has his problems . " " Sure he has . " " Without that . " " They 're hitting at a lot of us , Tom , when they jumpp 246on you . That 's why we 've got to all stick together . " It was the kind of Boy Scout remark that deserved the expression of scorn that Kettle gave it . " Do you think Boo can stand yet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , can he stand by himself ? " " Sure he can . " " I 've been keeping an eye out for him . I ca n't do it now . There are some things . You know , you must n't give people a good opinion of yourself . " " Boo 's like any kid . He 'll find his way . " " Are you sure ? " " I do n't know him as well as you . " " That 's what I thought . " From the street outside a crescendoing auto horn , held down hard , booed past at considerable speed . It might have been only some high-school boy , honking for the hell of it ; but for Cameron it was threatening and derisiveas it rose in pitch and volume to the moment the car passed with a sudden diminishment and then it stopped . Cameron said , " Tom , you do n't suppose they did it to set a mob on you to get you beat up ? Picking Saturday when a lot of guys would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you got out of their road . Come out and stay with us . " Now , watching Kettle 's eyes , he understood that they had not been actually looking at him since he came in . The pupils , the retina maybe , but not the nerve behind . They were looking at him now . " What does Margaret think about this ? " Kettle asked . To Cameron it only occurred halfway what " this " meant . But partly he understood too , the knowledge ofit tricking him into words that he had not time to weigh. p 247 " She just thinks it 's a bad break that all these political things should get mixed up with your pleasure . No , " he added , " that is n't it . She thought if . . . " " Pleasure ? " Kettle said . As if the word might have broken his mouth so the white splintered ends of bone showed instead of teeth . Broken the seal , too , that had kept him from talking . lie rose from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swung with his open hand at a chair , missed it , and swung again with a ridiculously petulant . gesture . His face was like a bloated fox 's . His nose punched out sharp in front of him and his eyes shining angrily . " Oh , my . Oh , my . Pleasure ? You can all go to hell , " he said . " Whenever you need something , go to Toni Kettle for it , whether you need a laugh or a five-dollar bill or a Negro vote . You all want to be happy liberals with all the right ideas and go get Tom Kettle to do it for you so you wo n't get in no trouble yourself . Let me tell you something . You picked the wrong man . I 'm no good but , goddamn it , I do n't owe it to nobody that I should be . the miners screwed me and sold me out . The Communists screwed me and sold me out . The unemployed sonsofbitches think I 'm crazy now if I tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  my friend , my friend , the people'sfriend  --  would n't lift his goddamn hand to get me out of jail .

Ca n't you understand that ? The bones are picked . There is n't any more . But you come around . Mr. Barkley comes around . Will I please for old time 's sake get the hell out of town before I do any more damage ? Will I please in the name of Eugene V. Debs get out ofp 248Riverton , or else . Or else what , my literary friend ? You can put this in your book . Or else they 'll get Boo Gordon in on this too and have me for contributing to the delinquencyof a minor . See ?

" And you come around . You wish I had n't such and such . Well , so do I. So do I and that does n't cut anything . What would Ezekiel Mountwood have done ? All you can think of . Hell with him . Why do n't you go home now ? The bones are picked . There is n't any more . Can you get that straight ? " He might have gone on and on until he was cleansed and rid of it if Marybelle had not come in just then . She arrived dressed in her white waitress ' smock , arrivingto work if there had been work for her to do that evening . " Mr. Kettle ? " she asked . She stood just inside the door , waiting to be told it was all right for her to be there . " I thought I heard you . " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can go back home . " " Wandy told me , " she said . " Thought I 'd come down and see anyway . " " You better go back home , Marybelle . " " Art 's on shift . I 'd rather stay here . " Kettle shook his head and gave up . He took a chair by one of the tables on which he could put his head in his arms . Very wearily . But when Cameron touched his shoulder he sprang back in the chair to throw off the hand . " Do n't touch me . Are you one , too ? " " I 'm sorry , Tom . " p 249 " O.K. , boy . Go on home . Marybelle will take care of me . " " Have a big drink , Tom . Knock yourself out . " " Yeah . " " We 'll see you tomorrow , huh ? You wo n't have the place open , will you ? Come out tomorrow . " " Yeah . I wo n't open up . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " p 250AT HOME , reporting his failure to Margaret , Cameron kept returning to the moment when he had understoodthat the charges against Kettle were true . " Becauseit knocks the bottom out of everything . Because you know you 're at the bottom of the heap when you try to do something like elect a Jackson to the school board anyway , but it seems to be a solid bottom . Then you feel the hinges move and a trapdoor drops out from under you and there you are trying to push with nothing to push from . I feel like I want to run and hide . This kind of thing gives everybody but me a chance to say I told you so . If I go back and see Fischer again , tell him I 'm quitting or if we stay , I 'll have the feeling that he 's thinking What about your Tom Kettle and your nigger business , after all ? And then that poor bastard Tom . How 's he going to get out of this ? He 's managed to wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Is n't there anything we can do for him ? " " What ? He 's an original . He 's made himself a situation they do n't have any salve for . You feel about him that he wanted such good things and got such bad ones . You ask yourself , Is that the way it all works ? ' Maybe the way things are is God , and if you monkey with them youp 251go to hell . Tom has sure got himself a good dose of brimstone . Maybe he 's a warning . " " Quit it , " she said . " You have to keep on trying . Bad things have happened to people before . " " That I know . Why do they happen ? You know Kettle used to keep saying , There 's a reason for everything . ' That 's a kind of standard line for the village atheist , I always thought . No use to keep repeating it , but it hits you in a thing like this . Why is it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in Riverton ? The man they can criticize the easiest does something  --  puts up Jackson that he 's most likely to attract criticism for . Why is that ? " " It 's accidental , " she said . And he said , " No . " Kettle was behind the bar when he saw the car stop across the street and the young men jump out , like a raiding squad and come running across toward the saloon . Three of the five were wearing T-shirts . They came like a team , adjusting their formation on the run so there would be no delay at the door , so they could sweep into the place still at a run . He recognized them . Not their faces nor anything about them as particular persons , but , he had always dreamed about them . Sometimes he slept in a tower room and only knew they were coming by the sound of footsteps on the stair , and sometimes they came marchingalong a railroad spur wearing steel masks with rectangular slits for the eyes . They were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night the poundingon his door had wakened him , the faithful creatures who came because his heart 's guilt first created them and then called them . Well , he had dreamed about them oftenp 252enough . They were in the hostile dream that had fringed his whole life . He knew what they had come for and when he first saw them come in he felt a great sigh shake him . He was relieved that at last they were real . The prison of the dream was broken . Things could be settled in the real world . He was relieved but not prepared , so he had not time , or finally , the inclination to do anything but drop to the floor and roll into a section of the bar in which he sometimes kept extra cases of beer . It was too short a space for him to lie . at full length . He had to double up his knees to get into it . He heard them run the length of the room to the kitchen . Marybelle had the light on there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faint tinkle of a glass beside his head and realized that he was shaking and that the quivering of his body was making the floor shake delicately . But he was not afraid . This was so much better than the dream had been . He felt relieved of responsibility for what happened . He almost felt like laughing . " Where 's the old man ? " he heard and Marybelle answering , " I du n no . He was here . " The tramp of feet slowing to a stop and then shuffling restlessly . The boards on which his face was resting carried the sound of the feet on the other side of the bar , magnifying it so it was the eminent noise through which the voices came dimly . " Look in the crapper , Art . " " How about upstairs ? " " Which one , the men 's or the women 's ? " Another one repeated this , and they laughed . " How about getting us a drink , Susie ? " " How about upstairs ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p 253 " But you 're not . We came right in the door . Anybody can see you 're open . How 'd you think we got in ? " " You want us to help ourselves ? " " No , " Marybelle said . The feet scuffled mysteriously . Marybelle said , " No . " " Leave her alone and help yourself . This must be the nutty one . " " The one that Kettle . . . ? " " Yeah . " " Aw . For Chrissake . How  --  do you  --  suppose ? " The tramping moved toward the end of the bar . They were going to find him now . Only Marybelle would n't let them come behind the bar . She came around herself , and when she did she saw Kettle . The men who watched her apparently saw no sign of the discovery on her face . As she moved in between the bar and the racked bottles on the shelf behind , Kettle could only see her legs and skirt . " He told me it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to pay for it . " " You hear that ? We 'll pay for it . Only hurry up . " There was the sound of silver coins on the bartop . " No , " Marybelle said . " No . " " Come on or I 'm coming after it . " Someone crawled on top of the bar . Marybelle reached a bottle quickly and set it in front of them . " Art , you and Joe look upstairs . " " That 's what I 've been saying . He lives upstairs . " " Look out for him . He might have a gun . " " Nuts . " They were brave young fellows , all right . They were in the right and they did n't worry about the gun . The gun . There was a gun . When Kettle heard them he thought of it . There was an Army forty-five , but it was in ap 254drawer at the other end of the bar . The beer cooler and Marybelle were in his way . Maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at it or even remembered it . If he started to crawl for it  --  as in dreams he sometimes crawled looking for a gun he could not find  --  they would hear him . They would get to him faster than he could get to it . They might not find him anyhow . They might go away . He heard a crashing of furniture upstairs . It sounded like a chest of drawers falling over . Then glass breaking . Window ? Mirror ? Or the big watercolor of Mountwood 's column ? The feet returning down the stairway . " He 's not here , Willy . " " For the Chrissake . " " Look behind the bar . " Marybelle moved to the end of the bar where the footstepswere moving , the end opposite the drawer with the gun . She did n't say anything . She put one hand on the bar and the other on the liquor shelves to bar their way . " She ai n't going to let us look . " It was odd how happy their voices seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us look , kid . " " She 'll let us look . " Kettle could see the hand , just the hand and forearm , reach down to part the smock that Marybelle was wearingand fumble inside . " What do you find , Willy ? " He rolled cautiously on his belly and began to crawl . " Bring her back here where we can see , Willy . " Behind him he heard the dragging of her heels on the floor , and he surged up like a hippopotamus catapulting itself up a riverbank and jerked the drawer open . " Look out ! " " Hey ! " He pulled the slide on the gun and saw the fat brownp 255bullet move up from the clip . He let the slide snap forward . How fine the heavy handle of the gun felt against his fingers , as though it was what his restless hands had always been fumbling for . " All right , " he said calmly . " Over in front . Stay away from them , Marybelle . " They came around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all frowning like petulant children whose game has been interrupted . " Jump him , " Willy said tersely . Kettle laughed . " You 're not that drunk . " He watched them move where he directed them with a gesture of the gun barrel . It was so easy and pleasant to control them now . He knew already what he was going to do . " Which one was it , Marybelle ? " She pointed . " You 're Willy , is that right ? " The young man 's lip curled derisively and he would not answer . " I 'm glad you came , Willy . " They looked at each other . " Jeez , he 's crazy , " one of them said . " We 'd better . . . " " The rest of you go on along , " Kettle said . " Willy . I want you to stay . " He moved down to be farther away from the window . Someone passing might see him . He wanted a little time . They were looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . I do n't want to fool anybody now . " You came down to beat me up , " he said . " That did n't work out right , did it ? You figured that there would n't be any way I could stop you , is n't that it ? You were n't worried about the gun until you saw it . Brave but foolish , now was n't it ? You said to yourselves There 's an old man we can rough up . Get our kicks . Is n't that it ? And you found a woman in here and that madep 256it more fun , did n't it ? " Never in his life had he been more calm or spoken more calmly . Fatigue from the whole bad day was part of it , and there was something more smoothing him out . His belly felt warm and good , as though he had drunk a large glass of whiskey and it was taking hold . The way he talked he might have been a genial old farmer lecturing some boys he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repetitiously , soothingly so that when he repeated his command , the other four went outside and left Willy . Quickly as they were out the door they raced for the car . They would be back . As soon as they had figured something out they would be back , maybe with the police . It would take several minutes for them to arrange a return . That would be enough . Willy was standing there with his arms hanging down slightly in front of him as sailors stand . He was a husky , light-haired fellow . His blue eyes seemed rather bulbous , as though his hatred for Tom Kettle had created too much inward pressure . Poor Willy . Do n't hate so much . That 's what gets you in all your trouble . He expects me to keep talking to him , Kettle thought , so that he can crack back tough and defiant . There was nothing more to say to Willy . He was going to kill him . The beautiful peaceful serenity of it , the drunkenness of it , the hysteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known in his life . It was better than the sun and the river themselves , banjo music and watermelon . Whoever might imagine they had measured Tom Kettle 's lusts would be quite wrong . This was what warmed the old belly . Life that had given him so many whippings , with its majestic perversity had made up for everything with the big music of this minute. p 257It was an instant of private pleasure . Still it was not a cat 's playing with a mouse . The mouse did n't know yet , in his innocence , what he had run into . Willy might be a little afraid , but not much , just standing away there because he respected the gun , knowing , however dumb he might be , that it was n't guns that killed you but people . He really did n't expect what was going to happen to him . He was a fine blue-eyed boy who had most likely been in the army fighting the other blue-eyed boys . Every year of his life the cabals of Riverton had been soaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do no wrong unless he should turn against them , therefore was protected by a moral force , something like God . It was n't finally his fault that he was going to be killed for . He could have learned differently . Given time the myths could have all been broken down . He might , have begun to wonder if he came to the saloon for himself or if he had been sent . Who sent you , Willy ? Was it , Mr. Hughes ? Was it the mean little men in City Hall that work for Mr. Hughes ? Was it the voice of the Standard ? Nobody sent me . All right then . You . can believe that . Five minutesis n't long enough for an education . Kettle was holding the gun just below the level of the bartop so no one would see it from the street for a while more . He wished that Cameron could be here to watch it happen . It would be something for the book . Little Willy had been there when they hanged Mountwood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caught up to him and was going to settle the account . This is what it was all for , Kettle thought . The messes I got into that I could n't understand . They had to be that way so finally Willy would come in here just like this . I would n't have found him any other way . There 's a reason for everything . Willy is what I 've been for . Whateverp 258bad I did was necessary , was bait to bring Willy here , just this time , just this way . So there  --  in the mind , so there would be no newspaper stories about it and no monuments put up for it , either  --  the murder was done and an old score settled . And because it was in the mind it was lost again , movingto some other location in time , as the Grail moves . The man in summer twills who stepped inside the front door was n't at first going to disturb anything . Let him ask if the bar was open and then go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to be . If Willy said anything to him , he would be a witness . " Mr. Kettle ? " " Yes ? " " Are you very busy this evening . I thought . . . " " Yes , " Kettle said . " Busy . " " Well . . . I wonder if I could speak to you alone for a minute ? " " No . " " It might be important to you . " Kettle grinned at him . So was the extermination of Willy . Yesterday was the time for people to talk like that to me , he thought . Go away . I have what I need . The man in the summer suit looked at Willy to size him up , and Willy must have looked dumb to him because he said , " My name is Raleigh . I work for Orin Hughes . Mr. Hughes would like to see you tonight . " The drunkenness , the glory , the peace of being about to kill Willy Whatshisname faded out in reasonableness . " Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on . Run , Willy . We 'll take you home , Marybelle . " He put the gun quietly on top of the beer cooler . " My car is around the corner , " Raleigh said. p 259MRS . BAR K L E Y answered the phone when Cameroncalled , and she told him first that her husband was not home , would not be home that evening . " When can I get him ? " he asked . " I 'm a friend of Tom Kettle 's . Cameron . Andy Cameron . " " Oh . A friend , " she said and laughed a little . " Can I call you back in ten minutes ? " It was less time than that when the Camerons ' phone rang again . Barkley was on the line . " You wanted to talk to me , Cameron ? " " I did . As soon as it 's convenient . " " Uh huh . What 's on your mind ? No emergency , is it ? " ( And what emergency was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his office waiting for ? Waiting for something to happen or for some word to come ? Sitting on a box of dynamite wondering if it might blow up some time that evening . ) " I need your advice about Tom Kettle . " " Did he ask you to call me ? " " No . " So Barkley had to think it over for a while before he said , " Do you know where my office is ? You know where Woolworth 's store is ? " Through the open windows of Barkley 's office the twang of the nighthawk 's wings seemed to pull in morep 260of the muggy and city-smelling air , like a sharp instrumenttugging at dough . The two men listened to it attentively , as men do when they hedge at first around a subject which they both understand  --  each in his way  --  and which they both regard as too fragile to risk in an unfriendly encounter . " You are not here , I take it , because you want to do something ? " Barkley asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done about it now ? " " Yes . " Barkley had a way of shrugging immensely , drawing his chin against his chest in an open simulation of a man hiding a smile when he has produced exactly the answer he wants , which he will presently , if he is a lawyer , use to hopelessly muddle and expose as a liar anyone who has been foolish enough to utter an intelligible answer . " You want to put the milk back in the pitcher after it 's spilled all over hell ? " Barkley asked . " Or do you want a chaplain ? Or do you want good advice ? " His hand moved so it caught the light between them , a signal , a cutting gesture that meant simply Get things a little straightened out before you say them , insisting that , since all men are fools and that 's expected , you try to be as little foolish as you can . Then , almost insulting , as though he were already sure that Cameron would see that he was caricaturing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , hopelessdopes who come to the politician at whose vulgar image they have been taught to laugh , wishing in some desperate moment that the image , the ridiculed stereotypeis not after all true ) , he said , " Cigaaaaaar ? " " Thanks , " Cameron said . He cupped his hands around the match and sucked until the smoke was coming through thickly . Barkley was running in the directionp 261he had picked out , so he would have to wait and see where that went . " I do n't know how deep you are in this thing , " Barkley said . " Deep ? Tom told me you were one of the people he was counting on . For putting Jackson across . You can get out on a limb doing that in Riverton . Right ? I hope you knew that before you started . Yeah . You knew I was  --  uh , interested  --  in it . Then I pulled out . You probably thought I was all kinds of a sonofabitch right about then and probably still do . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste time arguing about it . But  --  I 'm trying to be a smart one . Oh , I 'm trying hard . " He smiled a kind of professional smile . His eyes seemed in the crossways light to have sunk into the stone and oak shapes of his face . He was slumped in his chair as though he too might have taken a beating from this bad day , but even in the posture of fatigue he looked intact , rather like a boulder hanging at a cliff edge that would be capable of a crushing energy yet , if it should be disturbed and allowed to fall . He had lit a cigar , too , and squinted at the smoke rising from it . " All my life , " he said , " I 've been running into people who had a lot of faith in new and different ways of doing things and then people that thought I might have some new and different ways of doing things . There is no such animal . There are n't any new ways for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful experience to find that out . You told me on the phone you wanted advice . I 'm not sure I can give you any . Not anything you have n't thought of for yourself . There is n't any hocuspocusI can give you . " Some people go to a surgeon . Maybe they 've mashed their foot up , say . They expect the surgeon to cure them , cure that foot . Huh uh . It ca n't be done . He can cut it 262off for them . Maybe a little neater than they could do it with a pocketknife . He ca n't cure it any more than they can . You see what I 'm getting at ? I do n't have any cures for anything . Maybe I can tell you what needs cutting off . You see , that mashed foot  --  if the poor bastard did n't have sense enough to cut it off or let somebody else do it  --  would pretty soon spread an infection that would kill the guy . He 'd like to keep his foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it . " Now look , are you still thinking about Jackson running for the school board ? Forget it . Erase it from your mind . That 's finished and done for . I hope . Unless Tom Kettle does something else foolish . " " Like what ? " Cameron said softly . " I would n't predict . " Barkley said . " Anything at all . Now is the time for everything to be absolutely quiet and I hope it is . " " Like jumping in the river ? " Barkley did not answer for a long time . " So what you really came to see me about was what can we do for Tom Kettle ? " " That 's right . Let Jackson and the rest of it go for a while . I do n't agree with you about that , but let it go . " " You do n't agree with me about the rest . I see . Youwant to keep your mashed-up foot because it used to be such a fine thing . I see . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want things to get better . They just wish to hell something had n't happened that has happened . That 's how they screw things up . Make big magic and try to recapture the past . Huh uh . " " You mean that 's how they screw up things for you ? " Slowly Barkley grinned . " And that 's pure selfishness , is n't it ? Yeah . I 'm a selfish sonofabitch . Keeps me fromgetting mixed up . Let me ask you something , though. p 263We 'll just assume you represent the generous kind of people . From what you said I was n't just sure which you thought was most important , the school board or Tom Kettle . That 's always a nice thing to be straight on before you start something . It 's about time you made up your mind . " Cameron shook his head impatiently . " I do n't know . This I do know . Besides Kettle nobody in this town  --  and I include myself  --  seemed to give a worthwhile damn about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving than all the rest who do n't give a damn ? " " Something like that . " Looking back , Cameron was amazed at himself for having said that , , always to feel that he had been tricked into saying it , by Barkley or by something peculiar in this one situation since he would not accept it as a guiding principle yet . I t amused Barkley . " That 's a nice literary viewpoint . It 's not , political , " he said . " No , that wo n't do . You 're more interested in an enemy of the people than in an issue you probably think is for the good of the people . " " Enemy of the people ? " Again the lawyer 's shrug and smirk from Barkley . " Just as you are . You just now confessed it . More interested in one person than the mass . Tom carried it to a logical conclusion . More interested in himself but , now get this , not in succeeding . In seeing what would happen . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been very , very serious . This time Kettle was indulging himself without any respect for actuality . " " In a way that is so , " Cameron admitted . ( What do you want out of this for yourself ? Kettle had said. ) p 264 " Like your man Mountwood , for that matter . Criminalsand idealists or any mixture thereof . Enemies of the people . Both useful sometimes . " " Then all other men as individuals , " Cameron said . " I guess so . As individuals , all other men . " They sat there sucking at their own thoughts , as their lungs , the multiple branching red sacks , sucked at the night air with its smells of burnt gasoline , dust , popcorn , and the face powder of the older ladies . Cameron nodded at the Lincoln photograph hung above the desk . " No individual ? " he asked . " A leader , " Barkley said . " That 's something else entirely . He knew how to float . It 's like swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you pick that time to start struggling you 're a goner . That 's what Kettle did when he lied to me and tried to go on with this Jackson thing in spite of hell . If we could have got him out of town three or four days ago . . . " He thought a minute . " If we can get him out of town now . . . " He sank into his own computations , private sums in ledgers which had , by Kettle 's misfortune , delinquency , betrayal , whatever you want to call it , been scrawled over with counterfeit entries that he had to remove patiently . " This business Kettle is into , " he said , his voice deprecatingthe seriousness of it , reducing it to another incident of the road . As though life were problems to be solved and he were the only responsible mathematician , sitting with his stylus and clay or his adding machine , putting things in the red column or the black , only interested in the current totals . " It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two fellows , have you ? These carnival fellows . " Integers , he seemed to be saying , named Jonesy and Dick that the wind had blown in who counted forp 265nothing except the damage they had done . No hunger , no loneliness , no early mornings when the train whistled in the mountains and they were moving elsewhere . No hanging around the dining tent at the carnival , exiled even there so they had to wait for the small town , the impressible and outcast hicks or the children or the villageeccentric with whom they might stand in the outskirtsof the gaudy lights , passing for unknown adventure  --  thedirty border gypsies crawling like insects out of some crack in the neat kingdom , whom even the lady of the castle looks down on ( hovering in the torchlightsof the courtyard ) with an unnameable longing as for death . " He could at least have got him a fat boy . " The joke of a man to another man . The mistaken betraying joke which taboos have shaped so that the object of perversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort while the substance of the more fateful love is masked , but through which  --  because it is a joke- leers the skull , the image of eyelessness . After the joke Barkley accounted for that , too , in his own way . " There 's only one explanation for it . He did it for the hell of it . When people find out it 's too tough to do what they want , they can always turn around and go whole hog to tear it all up . " All right , that 's better , Cameron thought . " Yes . I mentioned pleasure ' to him . He let me understand it was n't that . " " No , " Barkley said . " I do n't believe it was that . So ? " " So we 've salved our Puritan instinct , I guess . He did n't get any fun out of it so it ca n't have been sobad . " " You worry about such things , do n't you ? " Barkley asked , the question asserting that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Cameron said . " Tom thought very highly of you . . . " " No , " Barkley said . " I will not budge unless he does something else foolish and I have to . " " Wait , " Cameron said . " There 's one thing more . You knew , did n't you , that Tom was , had been , a homosexualbefore . Knowing that , you still  --  you used him , did n't you ? Anyway , you let him stick his neck way out , and you knew what might happen . It seems to me that you owe him something for that if not for anything else . " " Yes , I knew , " Barkley said . " Yes , I owe him something . That is exactly why I will not budge . " He shook his head impatiently . " Do you know how much politics cost ? You were in service , were n't you ? Where were you ? " " New Guinea , Luzon and Okinawa . I was in Aviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . The enlisted men knew about the engineering . " Barkley acknowledged that with a nod . " I was in headquarterson Okinawa . Were you there while they were fighting ? " " No . We came in to build the big strip by Naha . " " Oh , yes . Naha . You saw that . Shuri . Very exciting . You know , one night they had more than twenty battalionsof artillery firing on Shuri . It was a sight . Left a lot of bodies . You saw the bodies , no doubt . You must have seen a lot of things . You 're a historian , and so forth . Did it occur to you that what happened on the line across the island from Naha was politics ? Of course it would . You would look at it and say , This is part of what they cost . ' Then the war is over and you come back home and find yourself in Riverton . You still know that 267it was politics that made the war . How many people killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that figure gives you an idea of what they pay for politics these days . " You say to yourself , that 's world politics . That is n't Riverton . In Riverton , politics is a few sharp heels fixing themselves up in a lifetime job . County sheriff spending a few thousand so he can get in on the slot machines and the numbers and the cat-house graft . You 're a man who sees things so that makes you mad . Go a little further  --  the Negroes have segregated schools and there is no Negro on the school board . That cries to heaven . Still , it 's only Riverton and it 's hard to connect Riverton with the world , with politics , the way you think of them . You 've read the big books . You don't. think any politics in this little dump are as important as one man . That 's what you said . " You ever go to an officers ' beach while you were in the Pacific ? Yeah ? Well , there you 'd be on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Caledonia . Sun shining and palm trees . A little beer . Everything nice . All these young fellows lying along there with the nurses . Everybody happy . You ask yourself , Is this the war ? Na , this is n't the war . You 're a thoughtful bird . You say to yourself the enlisted men are off in the brush beating the bishop because they ca n't get at the nurses the way the officers do . They do n't have any beer . That 's about as much as you can worry about , right there . You say to yourself this officer-enlisted business which is like whites and Negroes  --  is wrong . That 's not what we 're fighting for . But still you say to yourself , This is n't the war . The war is someplace else . You lie down in the sand , you drink your beer and you 're happy . Maybe youp 268saw a newsreel the night before so you know there 's a war going on . But you ca n't really connect that with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not good , but you can get your beer here and not worry about it too much . You may make some parallels with what 's going on other places in the world , but you do n't really want to make the connection . It 's too much trouble . There are issues here , but because you ca n't change the world with them , you think that one man is more important than they are . You want to take care of your friends . You might let your friends go to hell if you could get Riverton changed into the Garden of Eden for the trade . But you do n't - see that Riverton is small and is still connected with the kind of politics they pay forty million lives for . Romantic ideas  --  everything or nothing . The Ezekiel Mountwood disease , if you want to call it that . Well , Tom Kettle used to know better than that . " Now you and I probably have a lot of ideas in common . You would n't be involved with getting Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some things we want to happen and some things we both want to prevent . " You know what Hitler said about a thousand years ? His Reich lasting for a thousand years . Ever think that he was right ? Not for himself but for somebody else that could do it better ? Somebody that would have more money , more newspapers , more people ? Might settle things forever . Agree so far ? " " Go on , " Cameron said . " I 'm getting the drift . " " What 's to keep them from it ? Liberals ? No organization , no guts , no press . Third party ? Pure pipe-dream . Communists inside and red-baiting outside . War ? Nobodycan fight them now and they do n't intend to waitp 269until somebody can . Union labor ? Too dumb and too late . Too many mistakes . Do n't quote me . Just look at them . " " Maybe the people , " Cameron said . Ordinarily such a conversation would have excited him . Barkley was talking in a low even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it did n't communicate . " Some-how . " Barkley laughed good-humoredly . " The people , yes . The people , yes . Did n't you hang around Tom Kettle long enough for him to educate you about what the people are ? The people ' is a lazy man 's abstraction . Politics is n't a lazy man 's business . Tom would have taught you that . " No , " Barkley said . " Or yes and no . But not by themselves . Real , living , breathing , ornery , bought , and innocentpeople working through the mess of laws and political machines they have been tricked into saddling themselves with , yes . Pure democratic action , no . Years ago I tried to win an election with good will and a good name . I had n't studied enough history . " " Kettle told us about that . They beat you with whiskey . " " Uh huh . So we have got to draw on the whiskey , the machines , and the good will . Make each one buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got to get the 81st Congress . There are people all over the country who 've got to get in . Morse , Taylor , Kefauver , Wyatt , and Mrs. Douglas . Folks like that have got to get in or the whole thing is finished . " " And you , " Cameron said . Barkley pulled out a pigeonhole drawer and flipped from it an old election bill with the picture of a round smiling head . " There , " he said . " If the state machinep 270decides I ca n't pull the union and the Negro vote , that will be your party candidate for Congress from this district . Frank and fearless tub of lard . I 'm not soliciting your vote , so I 'll skip the modesty . " We 're getting away from things . My point is that your officers ' beach connects with the war . Part of it . Riverton connects with Washington and the rest of the world . All the things we want and do n't want have to be settled on a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that . Even Riverton 's Negroes ' problems have to be settled from outside coming back . It 's a law of nature . You ca n't beat the pattern as long as you 're inside it . At least you have to have room to move . Riverton ca n't tax the steel mill . Hell , they ca n't even declare it inside the city limits . But the Federal Government can . Riverton ca n't make itself an FEPC . But the Federal Government can in time . Even that is small potatoes . " I asked you if you knew what politics cost . I suggestedthey 'd cost something like forty million lives in ten years . Now I think  --  you may or may not  --  that everything in the world may hinge on American politics in the next few years . Yet  --  you 'd blame me for not throwing away my chance to do something about them by making some futile gesture like defending Tom Kettle . You know they have an open-and-shut case against him , do n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him sewed . I tried to explain that this afternoon . " " And Boo Gordon ? " " That 's hare-brained . They might use it . They would n't expect to make it stick . But anyway you cut it there 's nothing left except for Tom to run for it . Ip 271do n't think they 'll chase him . For his own good , if there was nothing else involved , I 'd advise him to get out . You seem to think I do n't care what happens to him , and that is n't the case . And you asked me why I had n't told him a long time ago to keep clear of politics . As a matter of fact , he asked me that this afternoon when I saw him . But that was n't Tom Kettle talking when he asked why . Because there was n't anyone else in Riverton to do what he was doing . Is n't that simple ? It was a risk we had to take . Do you know what would happen to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as much time with Negro people as Tom has ? My name would be mud . There had to be two of us working at it in different ways . There should have been lots more . There should always be lots more . There are n't . So he was elected . " " Now there are n't two . " " No , " Barkley said gloomily . " The little Indians are falling all around . One little Indian boy . " " They will get you next , " Cameron said . " They will not get me . I 've got through by the skin of my teeth . I 've got enough now , if I can keep it , in Rivertonand Bluff City and the refinery unions . I do n't think they will stop me now . And that 's the thing that Kettle has been working for all these years . You know , there was a time when Kettle used to feed me and my family . Why ? So between the two of us we could bust out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back now . Man , man . That is n't Tom Kettle you hear when you hear him say that Barkley sold him out not the real Kettle . Did he tell you I sold him out ? " Cameron said gently , " Yes . " " And you know just enough about it to think I did . I say you 're wrong . You blame me but you do n't evenp 272know half the things you could blame me for . You 're still wrong . Did he mention anybody else selling him out ? " " The miners and the Communists . " " Uh huh . " " Is that true ? " " Yes . Everybody has always sold him out . I think now that maybe he asks for it because he wo n't settle for what he can have . That was what made him , but that 's his big trouble , too . You 've got to float with things sometimes . " Did he ever tell you anything about the miners ? I better tell you about that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the war . We were both working in the Star mine in Elgin County . Plenty of Socialists in that part of the country then . You 'd be surprised how many until we got in the war . That separated a lot of the boys from the men . There were a lot of Germans and Englishmen . My father had been a miner in England , and he was a red-hot Socialist . Kettle 's father was a miner , too . Do n't know where he came from . I guess he 'd been a farmer . His father was killed in the mine when Tom was about twelve . I used to think that made him radical , but he tells some things that make me doubt it . His father must have been a terrible guy , so it could n't have been revenge that made him hate the mine . He was a natural , dumb rebel . " My father gave him a lot of books to read , and the first thing you know he was n't just a Socialist . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anarchist . But we went along with the Socialists because it looked like they were going to do something . Even after the war , though it was gettinglean by then . What happened in Russia gave it a spurt . My father used to say about that , It 's come , it'sp 273come . ' Everybody felt it . They elected a Socialist mayor in Bridestown . Then it petered out . You know about the strikes in ' 24 and ' 25 when the National Guard came down ? We fought the strike with them and pretty soon , bang , they tossed us out on our ear . This ear . " He turned his head around in the light to show the cauliflower . " You 'd be surprised how much support I get from that ear . The same old guys that were howling for my scalp and Kettle 's come up to see me year after year when I talk in their neighborhood and kid about it . " The National Guard camped in the Star for a while . A lot of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at them , picking up stones and dropping them between their knees and spitting on the ground . The women came out in the afternoon to yell at these tin soldiers . They ran in a bunch of scabs for about a week and then had to pull them out because they were n't doing anything and because we kept tearing up the spur so they could n't get anything out anyway . They put a detachment on the spur , but we 'd go out with lights , a big bunch and stand on the tracks so they couldn't. bring the trains in . A matter of moral force . We could think up more damn things for them to do than they had the guts to go through with . And there was Kettle with a big black stocking cap that did n't quite get all his hair in and stuck down for him , racing around like it was all a hell of a lot of fun . Standing with some punk guardsman holding a bayonet in his belly , leaning over it , like it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neighbor . It 's a nice thing to be young , Cameron , and think that revolutions and what not are a lot of fun . " Along in December the UMW settled downstate . Somebody killed a scab in our part of the county and there was a lot of feeling against us . It looked like the 274whole thing was going to fold . Then it was pretty much the Socialists that organized a march . We were going down in Lewis 's country and get them out again . We went along all right at first . Got two or three of the mines out again . They even went along with us the second day . Then we began to run into barricaded towns and had trouble with our supply trucks . Outside of a place called Blairstown a bunch of cars came busting along the road and stopped in the middle of the column . We cut for the brush and they opened up on us with Tommy guns . Kettle and I ducked into Blairstown . We were in a restaurant eating when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers in town . They held us there for three days until they were sure the march was broken up . When we got home the Star was working again  --  all but the people who 'd been in the open as Socialists . They thought they could do without us . A bunch of them jumped us outside the union hall one night . They had found out about us . Yes , yes . " I 've always thought the way the men turned  --  men that had been our friends  --  surprised Kettle so he never got over it . He 'd been pretty cocky before that , but here it 's twenty-three years later and he is still trying to find out what happened , trying to get back to the place where he could tear up the spur of the Star mine and make everything come out right instead of wrong . He wo n't let go of things . That 's his trouble . " I went to school after that and Kettle moved into town here . When I came back we naturally worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before . He worked the alleys and I worked the streets . We had everything figured out , even after we 'd been through this stuff with the Socialists . It is the simplest thing in the world . You 'd think the unions would have discovered it , p 275but they never did . They had to have their own political representatives . They would n't furnish them , so somebody had to do it for them . " There were always a few working for them in this district . In Riverton they 've come and gone . Kettle and I stayed . If there were ten or fifty others , we were always a couple of them . The way things shaped up I had to keep out of trouble more and more . " So Kettle had to work the Communists when they came in like he worked the other alleys . He kept track of them . We used what they did when we could . They had a good organizer here for a while . Then they sent in a sonofabitch . You knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , did n't , you ? " One time he had . Plenty of them . The bust- was when he was trying to get Negroes into the union at the mill . This Communist organizer fought it down . Wanted his boys in office and bought himself an election over Kettie 's nigger-loving friends . Do you see ? Then two of the Communistsgot booted and the others got religion . So now it 's a bread-and-butter union strictly . " " I am  --  I was  --  going to talk to them next Tuesday , " Cameron said , rather absently . In the pause that came after Barkley 's story he was thinking of Kettle and Barkley walking into Blairstown twenty-three years ago with the high excitement of youth , imagining themselves tied together forever because they 'd got , themselves jailed three days for a good cause , and thinking , He means he 's going to do it anyway , in spite of that , . That the mashed foot is his own , and he is going to cut it off himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to do it ? " " I said I would . " p 276 " And he was going to let you ? " " Yes . " " Uh huh . What would that do for your job ? I did n't know they let Riverton schoolteachers . . " " Fixed it . " Barkley nodded . " Uh huh . Now you can put things together for yourself . Kettle knew you were sticking your head in the noose . He knows enough to know that you could n't have done a damn thing with that union . But he was going to let you go ahead and throw your job away . That is n't like Kettle . He 's tearing up things right and left with this school-board election . You know , I was going to talk to them about Jackson until I got wind he was in some trouble they could smear us all with . I called him up and asked him if there was anything to it . That 's when he lied to me . He knew how much was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought it would slide by until after the election . " " I do n't believe it . " Cameron said , " Tom 's a complicated guy . Maybe he did . " " He 's a drowning man trying to drag everybody else down with him . " " And we are going to let him drown . " " Uh huh . All I could possibly do would be defend him in a hopeless case . " " Which might be all he needs . " Barkley jerked his head impatiently . Bull . Bull . In this state he would spend an indefinite time in an asylum and would also be liable to two years in prison after that . My good young friend : Do you think Tom Kettle would come out of that ? Do you think I would advise him to stay and face that ? I would not . p 277 " And I take it I know Tom Kettle a little better than you do . Tom has worked all his life for something that seemed valuable to him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's been beaten and bayoneted and starved . All he 's got left is what chance I have of getting through to Congress and wherever I can go from there . He has lost faith in me . All right . Do you know why ? Because he has lost faith in himself . And I do n't choose to go that far . " Do you think I am going to help him ruin me after he has worked to get me this far ? If this is his last kick , I am sorrier than you are , Cameron . But he must not , drag everything else down with him . You know that , man . " " But he was working for you . He thought , you needed the Negro support you 'd get if you came out for , Jackson . " I do need it . " " Maybe you 'll lose without it . " " Maybe I will lose . But I can try . I am going to try . If I get where I can do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to them . That 's all I know . " Then suddenly Barkley looked at his watch . Cameron thought he knew why . Because he had been sitting here through the evening wondering if something else were going to happen . But what ? Barkley had it all figured out , even outsmarting Kettle for Kettle 's own good . There was no real argument to be made with his position . He was honest and he was logical . Ile had picked the least forlorn hope . But he was looking at his watch , afraid of some irrational thing that might yet happen to climax the bad day , really at the mercy of one unpredictableman . Cameron said , almost as an afterthought , " And still you admit you may not win either . " p 278Barkley , who had seemed sometimes genial , at most showing an occasional eagerness to talk as though it were doing him , who must be secret with so many , some good to examine his own conscience in talking , shook his big head in annoyance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege to say , Maybe they win Maybe they lose . ' Ca n't you understand it makes a difference whether we win or lose ? Think it over . " He said , " I talked to you tonight because I thought you needed to see this thing . I would not have done it if you had not been a friend of Kettle 's . Do you see ? I can tell I have n't explained things to you . I 'm not sure that 's my fault . " He looked at his watch again , as though the first glance a moment before had been already forgotten . He got up , took his coat from beside the picture of Lincoln . " I 'm going home now , " he said . " I 'm tired . Can I give you a lift ? " He led the way from the office down the tinsel-glittering concrete of the steps to the street level . Rather distantly he said good night and strode off quickly by himself . It was twelve o'clock p 279THE car did not stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on the bluffs . The gravel drive where McKinley 's carriage had once rolled had been extended on one side with a concrete strip that circled the house and brought Kettle and Raleigh alongside the garden pavement that swept down like a piece of sculpturedcloth swirled out toward the river valley . Lights were on in the garden , small spots of luminosity in the early twilight . A bar of cloud with a yellow edge masked the sky up the river and would hide the sundown . There appeared to be guests in the house . A number of people were sitting in lawn chairs below the pillars of the porch , but Mr. Hughes was sitting by himself in the farthest corner of the garden , where he could see the edge of Riverton below him , the barges loading with sand at the dredge , the railroad spur to the quarry , the stacks of his mills farther down , and the expanse of the industrial valley which ended at the northern edges of Riverton . Up here an evening breeze had begun . It , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the advance of the cloud that was over the river in the North and West . The old man was wearing a linen jacket ; his face was lifted toward the breeze . A handsome old man whose p 280white hair and eyebrows against the tan of his face suggested a California tennis player or an outland Britisher sent to colonize a land of wastes , savages , and equatorial sun . In spite of his seventy-two years , something in his face suggested a young man 's eagerness and anticipation of life . Surely he tasted the first breeze of the evening with a fine palate . He turned when he heard Kettle 's and Raleigh 's footsteps on the stone paving . He did not get up to shake hands . He did make an excuse for not doing so . " I 'm too old to do everything I wish , " he said . He motioned Kettle to a chair beside him and Raleigh sat down a little farther off with his elbows on the chair arm and his fingers laced loosely in front of him , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched them both with the uninterested , unwavering stare of the professional myrmidon . The old man nodded toward the landscape he had been watching . He said , " It 's a great thing to look at . I never tire of looking at it . " And he seemed to be pausing to give Kettle time to take in all the vision which he had glimpsed . Just across the river were the shanties of South Riverton , the nearest standing on stilts among the willows . Farther on the fecund body of the river had marked its path with the lights of Bluff City . Next was the glare from the refineries ( fantastic schemes of electric bulbs traced in the red fires of waste oil  --  like Christmas trees in hell ) and then the smelters and farther , once again on the other shore , a smear of cream on a dark crock , the sky reflections of the city that called itself the gateway to the West . Under all the cities was the fat pancake of loam that the river made first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to tell whether the old man wasp 281referring to the land or the lights . At any rate , not even the eagle on Mountwood 's column had a better view  --  if it could have seen  --  of the valley 's wealth . " Mr. Kettle , it 's a great country , is n't it ? Where on earth could you find anything else like it ? " He was talkingalmost to himself , it seemed . " Plenty of people that criticize her . Seems to me there are more of them every day , picking at this , picking at that . I suspect it 's easy to find fault , if that 's what you 're looking for . Do you see those shacks over there ? That 's South Riverton . People live there in very bad conditions . I suppose our Communist friends might say they live like animals . They do . They 're dirty . They bite and they snap at each other , and goodness knows they do n't have all that they should . " Why , my goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drayman in St. Louis when I was a little shaver . ' I know what it is to wear ragged pants to school and live so close to your neighbors you hear all their fusses and quarreling . And to go hungry , too . I understand t hat , . " Yes . If we looked at South Riverton too long , why , no doubt we 'd get to thinking America was like that . I call that the worm's-eye view . That 's the worm's-eye view . They do n't see America as I see it . " I 1 is voice , thin but resonant , like a woodwind , rose with a genuine emotion . " They do n't see it whole . I wish every schoolboy and schoolgirl in Riverton could see  --  see- the America that we 're looking at down there . The power from those refineries . " He shook his head marveling at it . " Steel . My goodness , enough steel comes out of this valley by itself to produce more cars and trucks and plows than old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Kettle shook his head . He could not quite orient himself to his being here . In all the time he had lived in p| 282Riverton he had never met Mr. Hughes . Of course there had been no occasion . He had probably spent a round month of time talking about the old man , in an abstract way blaming this eminence for what took place on the floor of the city , talking so much that he had built up a complete picture , somewhat larger than life , somewhat more flattering , in one sense , than life , of this handsome old gent . And the image stood in his way , kept him from understandingwhat the old man was getting at , because , simply , he expected something better , more clever . He shivered . The faintly cool breeze was painful on his body . All day the nerves had been whipping it from the inside and they had produced a considerable fatigue . He looked at Raleigh and wondered what Raleigh would think  --  as a professional  --  if he knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the saloon . When he did not answer , Mr. Hughes went on , " That 's the case . Now we know there are things wrong with America . Even right here in Riverton . Of course there are . Do these smart alecs that criticize and criticize think they are the only ones that have eyes ? The trouble is that they have eyes like worms . They take the worm'seyeview , I call it . " Kettle began to shake . His beat-up body was shaking with a cold , uncontrollable amusement but he kept his face straight . " Are n't you feeling well ? " Mr. Hughes asked . " No , I 'm not . " This did not fit into Mr. Hughes ' conception , so he ignored it , merely saying , " Oh , that 's too bad , " and then returning like a forgetful , but not yet lost preacher to the sermon which he knew so well. p 283 " Poking their snoots ' around in the dirt . They do n't seem to understand that it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He waved his hand illustratively toward the darkening industrial landscape to assert again I hat from here things appeared in their wholeness , not as though he expected that proposition were doubtful , but only because he thought it might have been forgotten . Give me the hook , Kettle thought . The psychological inferiority he had felt when he stood before the Judge earlier in the day was gone . He had recovered much of his insight so it was not fear but knowledge and respect for power  --  and then the main thing again , the desperate curiosity which was the culmination of his wasted life  --  which kept him silent and apparently agreeing . " But they have to admit that things are getting better and better . Yes , sir . Even they have to admit that . They do n't like to . Do you know why , Mr. Kettle ? Because they like to be able to find fault . I call them **28;4852;TOOLONG , because if there was nothing wrong with our system they 'd starve to death . They would n't know any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook . " They are flies . Like flies in the summertime . They are an annoyance with all their theories . Do this , do that . We have to be careful not to let them spoil things before the work is done . Before we tidy up and make America what it is going to be , where even those poor people in South Riverton will live like kings compared to the people in old Europe . Poor old Europe , with its Fascists and its Communists quarreling and killing people . We do n't have any room for their sort in America . " What would Raleigh do to me if I laughed out loud , Kettle wondered . Just as earlier he had been comfortedp 284in the notion that he was going to kill Willy , now it did him good to imagine he might cut loose with a laugh that would scare the old man over his bluff into the river . Orin Hughes sighed . " There never seems to be an end to the struggle . Things are so much better than they were when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died from a disease that can be stopped like that today . " He snapped his fingers . " But they 're not satisfied . They wo n't be satisfied . There are more Communists and Fascists today than ever before . Do you agree , Mr. Kettle ? " " Yes . " " Am I boring you ? Wait . I am trying to get at some-thing . " " No . Not at all . " " It 's you young men , Mr. Kettle , who are going to have to make the future of America . You wo n't mind my impertinence . How old are you ? " " Forty-seven . " " Still young . " It was one of Mr. Hughes ' favorite themes , as reported by the Riverton Standard , that only sissies quit work at sixty-five . Himself , he would work until he was ninety or his Maker called him home . " That means you grew up with the century , did n't you ? And you may live to see it through , with all the advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war , " Kettle said listlessly . Do n't you understand , Mr. Hughes , that millions of men might fight it out with rape , fists , and automatic pistols in tacky old saloons if they could n't find any other way of doing it ? he thought . " There wo n't be a war , " Hughes said . " Unless , unless , the troublemakers in America weaken us so much that 285they dare attack us . That 's my fear . That 's why I 'm so hopeful of young men like you . " Suddenly Kettle was startled . For just a moment he did n't grasp the import of what the old man had said . Then , Does n't he know what happened to me today ? Even that I was arrested ? His sudden alertness must have been noticed by Hughes , for the old man smiled reassuringly at him . " I have always loved Riverton , " Hughes said . " I built once in Connecticut . It was n't home to me . This is America , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too many of the kind of people who are greedy and grasping for money there . " I call this my home . Sometimes I 'm ashamed that I 've done so little for my own home . That 's the businessman'slast regret , that he 's been so busy with affairs he does n't have time for community service . I frequently tell young men that and they do n't take me very seriously , I 'm afraid . Oh , I 've given money to this thing or that ; that 's not what I mean by service . A man must be willing to give of himself . He may see things that need to be done in the community that others would miss . I 'll illustrate . " Here in Riverton we 've never had a colored man on the school board . That 's a serious matter . It goes against the grain of the American tradition . What was it our forefathers said ? Taxation without representation is tyranny . ' And that is what we had allowed to happen right here in Riverton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Folks just overlooked it . Things had always been that way , so folks assumed that everything was all right . That 's not the American way . America is discovering new things . Of course colored people ought to be repre-p 286seated on the school board . Of course . It 's as simple as ABC once somebody has the eyes to see it . " When I heard the rumor that you were active in sponsoring Mr. Jackson for the board , I said to myself , There 's a man who has seen what the rest of us have n't . I said to myself , now why have n't some of our ministers , or editors , or someone else thought of that ? Are they so blind ? I said to myself , here 's this man Kettle who is going out of his way to be a good Samaritan for the colored people . He 's the kind of a man that 's doing something for the future of Riverton and America . " It impressed me so much that I called Mr. Denham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here now . What 's going on in Riverton ? Why is it that the paper is n't backing this Jackson fellow up ? ' I said See here , I 'm just an ordinary Riverton citizen myself , but it seems to me that we citizens have a right to expect our newspaper to come out boldly on an issue that concerns the whole community . ' I really gave him a dressing down . More people should shake up their newspaper editors once in a while . That 's what they 're for in a country where you have a free press . " I told him that all these editorials of his were nothing but wind . They were nothing but wind , I told him , unless he was willing to get behind them . I said to him , You know as well as I do that it 's situations where people are n't satisfied that give these Communist Johnnies something to poke their noses in and stir up a fuss about . As a matter of fact , someone has been seen passing out the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think of that , Mr. Kettle ? " " I 'm not surprised . " " I did n't think you would be , Mr. Kettle . " The show was getting better , Kettle thought . Maybep 287it would be worth letting Willy go , after all . " May I have a cigaret ? " he said . " Raleigh . . . " Raleigh brought the cigaret and lighted it . " I understand you are an authority on the Communist Party , Mr. Hughes , " Kettle said . He was thinking of an incident of several years before . The Communist organizerjust arrived in Riverton had called up the people who subscribed to the Daily Worker . Mr. Hughes had been among those called and invited to attend a meeting . " Somewhat , somewhat , " Mr. Hughes said . " I keep abreast of all their theory . It 's necessary to study Communismin order to know how to fight it . I understand that you had a little fracas with a Communist Johnnie that called himself Hart a few years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " They were figuratively sniffing each other now , cautiously . " We were talking about the colored people , " Mr. Hughes said . " I was quite confident that the Standard would come out and support him  --  not necessarily as a person , though he seems suitable , but so the colored people in Riverton will understand that this is their communitytoo . " Then this unfortunate thing happened today . Unhappilythere are always rascals around who think they can make a dishonest penny by smirching someone 's reputation . Did it begin with blackmail , Mr. Kettle ? " He did not wait for an answer . The question was only there to make sure that his point would not be missed . " I would be very much surprised if any fair-minded jury would believe the testimony of a couple of scamps who do n't even live around here . They should have known they could n't get away with it . I do n't suppose the Judgep 288had much choice , though , except to hold you after they made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It thundered low and fast over the bluffs . Its red and green lights seemed friendly and close against the few distant stars now appearing in the gray sky . Orin Hughes seemed to be gettingtired of his talk . " People being what they are , some thoughtless ones are bound to connect your mishap with this fellow Jackson'srunning for the school board . " " Were n't they supposed to ? " Kettle asked . It was his one indulgence during the conversation and Hughes did not pay any attention to it . He said , " What we need to do if we can is get the Standard to clear up this story by Monday or Tuesday with a full account of the blackmail . There will still be a day or two for them to come out for Jackson . I think we can persuade Chuck Denham it 's the right thing to do . His heart is right . " Now there is one other thing . I called the courthouse to find out the details of your case . There 's one thing I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyer , refused to go bail for you . I ca n't understand that at all . Why someone told me that you and Barkley almostgrew up together . I ca n't understand a false friend . " I must admit I 've never quite trusted Mr. Barkley . Maybe I am old-fashioned enough to distrust all these fellows who style themselves the friends of labor . It seldom rings true . I wonder if we do n't have to watch those false friends very carefully . Keep an eye on them and see what they are really up to . Do n't you think so , Mr. Kettle ? " " Keep an eye on . . . " Kettle said hoarsely . " Uh huh . " He coughed and began shivering enough so that Hughes noticed it. p 289 " Do n't you feel well ? Maybe we could talk another time . Tomorrow , " Hughes said . " I 'm all right . Go ahead . " Hughes ' hands lay gracefully in his lap . He leaned a little farther forward . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They get to be pretty slick operators . Their trail goes in and out . In and out . I suppose there are a great many things not known about Mr. Barkley . But you would know them , would n't you ? You would know ? " Kettle shook his head . " Of course , " Hughes said . " You would know . You probably know more than anyone except , Mr. Barkley  --  about the organizing of the steelworkers , the deals that someone maybe Mr. Barkley made to get certain Communists official positions in 1 he union ? Come on now , friend . We do n't need to know very much . Not very much at all  --  and then we 'll take care of this unfortunateproblem of yours . " Add up the score . The oldman who sat . in the eagle 's place and looked down shrewdly on all 11w flat world was making a better proposition than he could have realized . Kettle was through with Barkley . Not , because Barkley refused to go bail for him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already catching glimmerings of his final appraisal of that he might almost have admired Barkley for keeping his foot out of that , trap . But , because he believed in nothing . Forty-seven years of beating could not defeat him , but they had taught , him something . He wanted nothing but to live , exist , . With every word Hughes said he despised him more . ' This , this little mouth with its foolish jabber had built the empire . The often-discussed heavens had opened at last and exposed the Boy Scout conniving God . But God was offering a hopeless man another shelf to which he could cling ap 290while longer over the gulf of his own fear . If he could beat the scandal he would still have friends . Cameron , Jackson , Boo Gordon . The men and women who had worked for him , who would n't want to see him on the street unless he was cleared . But the old man had made some mistakes . First , he should not have mentioned Boo Gordon running from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city of Ezekiel Mountwood , he should n't . Second , he was too cute . An Army expression has it , Kettle thought . There is some I will not eat . Third , to open his mouth at all to Tom Kettle and then be so confident of his power that he let Kettle leave his place still without physical chains and leg irons to think it over . At one o'clock , in his shirt sleeves , Kettle took the train to Chicago . He carried no baggage bigger than his checkbook and the pocketful of bills , quarters , and half dollars that he had scooped from the cash register at the saloon . As the train gathered speed , he leaned close to the open window . He felt the rush of air on his forehead , felt it come faster and faster , and he had the delusion that he had kicked free of the planet itself and was moving out into inhuman space . He heard an explosion that seemed to come from the center of town . Looking in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then there was a pillar of flame standing tall , one second licking even higher than the silhouetted tops of city buildings , then eclipsed from actual sight , burning a while in an after-image . It 's nice of them to see me off with fireworks , he thought sourly . Then he forgot that too , slumped across the seat , and closed his eyes. p 291W HEN Cameron left the house the next morning the sun was still very low and red in the early haze . Distorted by the atmosphere , it looked flattened , like a rubber ball that has struck earth and is just beginningits rebound . The dusky east windows all along the street reflected it in uncertain red lines , and at Kettle 's place the upstairs windows were colored dimly by it so there seemed to be a cooling fire within . There were pigeons in the street that rose hopping in brief alarm as Cameron left his car and crossed to the saloon door . He beat sharply on the glass with his knuckles . There was no reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed back like brackish water that has momentarily been displaced . He tried the latch and finding the door not locked he went inside , walked halfway through the empty barroom , stopped , stood listening , feeling his heart accelerate , sensing in the undulant silence the return of the same fear that had wakened him half an hour before . " Tom , " he called and then after a minute called again more loudly . He became aware of a liquid , soprano sound , very faint . It was a tap running into a tin sink in the kitchen . He had awakened as though to the sound of an alarm , coming immediately wide awake , alert , before his breathp 292even had time to change from the slow rhythms of sleep , and he had felt the body of his wife lying against his right arm at the same time he became aware that it was anxiety about Kettle that had roused him , an anxiety that had the insistence of a dream though he could not remember dreaming . It seemed to him clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret last night after the talk with Barkley had been performed under some narcotic compulsion that kept him from thinking clearly what might by then have happened to Kettle . He and Margaret had talked a long time , talked as though they too were skirting some dangerous pit that could be escaped only if they had each other 's guidance . And then in the later hours , after she had cleansed herselfby that peculiar confession , they had made love and then quickly fallen asleep . Sometime in the course of explaining to her the things which Barkley told him , he had said , " So it 's Barkley 's own foot that he 's cutting off when he lets Kettle go without trying to help him . It 's his own eye that offended him enough to let someone else pluck it out for him . " Last night that had seemed a grave , conclusive and acceptable judgment ; but that comment of his had soured during his sleep and had come back to him on awakening this morning . It seemed to him terrible then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barkley had done , led to saying , in effect , " Let the sharks have him if it will lighten ship . " So he had crept from the bed , careful not to wake Margaret , and come to try once more to help Kettle , and as he had come he was punished by the notion that he was late . He went to the door of the stairway leading up to Kettle 's rooms and shouted again . " Anybody home ? Tom . . . " He could see now that the upstairs door wasp 293open and knew that Kettle could have heard him if he were there . He went up and looked in . I better call the police , he thought . Something awful . . . There was broken glass spilled across the floor like a little stream of ice . A chair had been thrown into the corner . A cabinet was tipped over flat so that its back , spotted with bits of fuzzy gray dust , lay upward . The glass , Cameron saw finally , had broken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table . Something awful happened here , he thought , and I 'd better get the police . Then he thought , how silly . He could n't go to the police after what had happened yesterday . But confronted with the empty , broken room he sought over and over some way in which he might get help at least to find out what had happened . It was quite undeniable that the situation had all moved outside that narrow corridor where the forces of law can help , and outside the problem became one of individual responsibility . He thought of calling Barkley and gave that , up . There was no source of help outside himself . He searched the upstairs rooms , even went , into the unused rooms across the hall , but found nothing to tell him more than the smashed furniture had . Downstairs again , he went behind the bar . It occurred to him that he ought to check the cash register . I f there was money gone that might be some clue . His mind flicked over the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glanced up and saw a boy 's face at the window , peering in at him . He slammed the drawer shut . Goddamn , he thought , a kid delivering papers , and if this mess we 're in keeps getting worse he might tell somebody that he saw me with my hands in the till . He went to the front door and spoke to the boy. p 294 " Mr. Kettle want a paper this morning ? " the boy asked . He kept at some distance , watching Cameron with distrust . " Sure . Why not ? " " Well . . . " The boy shifted nervously , grinned . He pulled a thick Sunday paper from the sack at his side and thrust it out in front of him , poised , ready to run . " Who 're you ? " the boy said . " A friend of Mr. Kettle 's . " " Thought maybe you was a policeman , " the boy said . He tossed the paper toward Cameron 's feet and went away quickly . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police are going to be here before long , the regular patrolman if nobody else , but maybe some others too , and if they find me I may be not only outside the law but at odds with it . He checked the cash drawer quickly . All the coins bigger than quarters and all the bills had been cleaned out . So what ? he thought . Maybe Tom 's got them . But still .. . He was moving to leave when he found the pistol on the beer cooler . He picked it up gently , lowered the hammer , sniffed at the barrel , then took out the clip and counted the cartridges . The gun had not been fired . But why not , he wondered . He put the gun inside his shirt and hurried to his car . From up the hill a solitary church bell had begun to ring , a monotonous hard rhythm in the clammy air . " That 's the way I found things , " he said to Margaret later in the morning . " No Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun all ready to be fired . What can you make out of that ? " " Nothing , " she said . " Wait and see . " p 295She looked at him with an odd , stricken smile . " There are some things that break and that ca n't be fixed , that 's all . " She sat tapping her knuckles together in a special , thoughtful gesture . " Did I say that last night ? That 's what I finally thought , even if I did n't say it . " Again she stopped . " Are you sorry about the things I told you last night ? " " No , " he said . " Will you ever be ? " " No , I 'm glad . They were n't important except to you . " " Except to me , " she said . " I 've always wanted to tell you , anyway , but I could n't . Then after what happened to Tom it was just somehow as if there was n't any wall any more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't see how those things got wound together . " " But they did . " " That seems to be true , " he said slowly . " Just like Tom 's being what he is  --  all wound into the election coming up . I wish to Christ there was n't going to be an election . " " There 's always one thing more to come . " " Now we have to draw back and get wound up one more time for the election itself . But what the hell is there for us to do ? " " Wait , " she said , and there was a kind of inexplicable serenity in the way she said it that he wished he could share . Waiting through the odd days from Sunday to Friday , the day of the election , Cameron floundered toward a conception of what had been broken , what was left , by Kettle 's arrest and disappearance. p 296On a news broadcast Sunday afternoon he heard of the burning of a police car parked on a downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire was not accidental , the newscaster said , and Cameron wondered , perhaps because he was overtense , if it had anything to do with Kettle 's trouble . Everything 's tied together in this damn town , he thought . Then because it was too outrageous to imagine a connection , he dismissed it from his mind . Later Sunday afternoon Barkley called to tell him that Kettle had left a note , a very brief announcement of his intent to run from Riverton . " Where to ? " Cameron asked . " Did n't say . " " No mention of what he was going to do ? " Barkley clucked and said ruefully , " He did n't say that , either . " At least , Cameron thought , putting down the phone with a sensation of partial relief , at least he 's not dead , as he could have been by now , by his own hand or maybe by someone else 's . But in some ways Kettle 's flight was like a death , even if there was no body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone . On Monday and Tuesday the Camerons fretted for mail , hoping that some note would come from Tom , telling them that he had arrived somewhere and was " all right "  --  though how he could be all right , what possibilities for the future he still had , they did not conceive . Then , gradually , just as it would happen after an actual death , the focus of their concern swung from the man who was gone back to the raw ends of their relation with him , ruptured by his departure . Outwardly  --  in the social part of their existence  --  Kettle 's flight seemed to hollow the city . Naturallyp 297enough for such outsiders , for such transients as they were , who had no habitual ties with the life of the town , its whole meaning had seemed to focus in Tom Kettle and in the " Negro problem " of which he had been the confused personal symbol . Now it was as if a gathering excitement had been suddenly suspended without climax , without a summing up which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though they could  --  would have to  --  wait for the election , there was no longer any hope that they might do anything to influenceit . Jackson 's name was on the ballot and he might do very well , or might not . At any rate they had felt close to this matter before and now felt very distant from it . Inwardly the effect of the flight , death , breaking  --  think of it as they might  --  of Tom Kettle counterpointed the social catastrophe painfully and yet not hopelessly . The night Cameron had come home from Barkley 's office and sat late in the kitchen with Margaret , the fact of Kettle 's arrest  --  like a single strain of bacteria that would work variously in various media  --  had worked inwardly in them , producing a kind of fever that seemed to burn clean enough to heal something in themselves . Just as in Barkley 's office  --  and who knew where else ?  --  the same inoculation had worked , creating many relationstotal in themselves and yet linked to the other relations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of some invisible corruption in the world 's shape which Kettle if he did nothing else  --  opened with all its stink . That night they had talked of the logic of the situation until all at once , in their uncertainty , they began talking of the possibility that Kettle might kill himself . Margaretsat there then with her eyes perfectly blank , herp 298lips loosened with the strain of emotion , and she had said , " I do n't think Tom will . He would have already if he had been going to . Would have before now . " " That 's a funny female statement . " " I know . It does n't make much sense , does it ? That 's what I believe . " " Too easy . Too damn easy . We talk about his having somewhere to go and I keep remembering the way he said pleasure . Pleasure ? ' That hurt . I 've never heard anybody say anything that way before . That 's about all he 'd have left if he pulled out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , put her face in her hands in a short , coquettish gesture , and when she raised her head again , her eyes were glittering with something that was not sorrow nor happiness either . She had blushed so the tips of her fingers left white spots on her cheeks where they had pressed . " Andy , this is funny . Shall I say it to you or not ? " " Say . " " You 're not going to laugh at me ? "  --  and now oddly she began to look pale and frightened . " Do n't laugh at me , Andy . This is what I 've figured out from thinking about it all evening . Here I sat all evening thinking while you were gone talking to Barkley . Men can go do things while women ca n't . That makes a lot of difference . But there 's , well  --  I could n't help thinking that I understood Tom Kettle better when I found out for sure he was a homosexual . Because I 'm a woman , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child that wants approval . " But it 's the kind of trouble , in some ways , like the trouble a woman gets into . You would n't know anything about that . Do n't you think maybe I do know better ? " p 299He shook his head . " That 's imagination . Barkley told me a lot of things tonight about Kettle 's past ' that I 'm trying to fit in . All these years with the progressive movements that have been going to pieces under him . It 's got something to do with that . Some kind of hellwith-it-allgesture . " " No , " she said . She came to him and put her arms around his head , pulling his face against the wide , yielding , marsh-soft curve of her belly . She drew back to look at him . " I love you so , Andy . My good Andy . " Then she pulled him to her again . " My dear , dear Andy . Come in the bedroom , Andy . I want to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this light . " They lay on the bed with their flanks touching and holding each other 's hands . Margaret 's hand was damp in the palm . " Andy , do you know what it feels like to be really lonely ? " " Yes , " he said , but the single and empty word was not enough for her . " No , you do n't know what I mean . I think women know better . And about Tom . . . " The white curtains around the windows made a frame a little paler than the walls or the night , and he watched this pale frame while she gathered her thoughts and went on . " You know they say homosexuals have female genes or something like that , so they 're part women , and you 're not one so you do n't understand . I 'll have to tell you . Do you believe me ? " " Everybody has been lonely , honey . If you mean that homosexuals must be lonelier than other people , I 'll agree . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't mean because of social pressures and so on . Before . " p 300As he lay there watching the curtains he heard her swallow hard . " Andy , did you have any girls while you were in the Army ? " He felt his pulse begin pounding , but it was not with any fear for himself . He knew from this beginning what would come . His mouth felt dry . He knew that she was crying . " Once , " he said . " In Texas . It was n't anything . That kind of thing does n't matter . " " Does n't matter ? You fool , you fool , you think because it 's a war you get a dispensation like the Jews and Catholics to eat meat anytime and there 's some kind of dispensation that says it does n't matter ? " She made a fist of the hand he had been holding and struck gently again and again at his leg . " Oh , you big fool . No wonder you ca n't understand Tom Kettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not for you , because you 're a man and it really does n't . I was going to tell you about something that happened to me . " " Yes , " he said . " I knew that . " He felt the spittle in his mouth becoming like glue , because he was afraid for her  --  with Time broken by the realities of the mind in which memory can be experience  --  and pitied her for what she was going to go through . " I knew you were , " he said reassuringly . " Nothing happened really . " She caught her breath . " I mean there was n't what they call any penetration when they write about it legally . I mean that did n't happen . But it could have happened . It was n't my fault it did n't . I wanted it to . You know that , Andy ? " " All right . Honey , honey . It 's all right . " He pulled her head into the crook of his arm . " O.K. now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 'm trying to explain . What happened was that I wanted to and I would have , but . . . p 301Oh , hell , it was right after you had shipped out of Stonemanand I felt so black . It was right after you 'd gone , and I 'd started home and stopped in Kansas City to see Aunt Clarice and Barbara . Barbara and I went out with some friends of hers and there was this old man , this old bastard . . . Then he asked if he could take me home and then he asked if I 'd go out to his house . He stopped downtown to go in a drugstore and while I was sitting there I thought about you on some ship already and how it was no use , no use , and how I hated him and I wanted him to come back quick and take me to his house . I wanted him , " she said in a strange voice that was the same voice as Tom Kettle 's saying Pleasure ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andy , Andy . I do n't know what I wanted , but I missed you so . " Through the tranquil hot air that came into the bedroom , hardly moving , changing , with no wind and the trees outside holding the current , memory spun its filaments like a spider 's , swung adrift . in the hope that they might catch at some unknown solidity iii the dark . After a while he said , " What happened ? " " It was only for a minute I felt like that , . I got out and walked away before he came back . I got a taxi . Was n't that heroic ? " He said , " Was that all ? " She moved against him and the passionate roll of her body was hard to interpret at first because it was no more the writhing of a woman aroused than it was the frantic insinuation that a frightened swimmer might attempt on the body of whoever had swum to the rescue . " Oh God ! Do n't you know it hurt me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? You ask , Is that all ? ' No . I slept with every man I could get my hands on as soon as you left Stoneman . There , does that mean something to you ? " p 302 " That is n't true , honey , " he said . " Do n't do that . I do understand in a way . " " All right , I did n't . I felt as dirty as if I had . Do you see , Andy ? Please ? After I did n't do anything with that guy , I would dream about him . Every time , somehow , he was n't going to only lay me he was going to kill me too . It was because I was so lonely . But I could n't have killed  --  myself . Could n't it be that way with Tom ? " She would n't have told me , he thought , if it had n't been for what Tom 's done . He saw how long she had carried this painful thing unsaid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe , " he said . " My poor darling . Oh , honey . " When he kissed her he felt her lips ripening and opening and her breath in his mouth cried hunger , death , fulfillment , life and they looked for comfort where the lucky ones have always sought it . But nevertheless when he had wakened the next morningguilt had driven him to go look for Kettle and he had not found him . And through this week of waiting he hung suspended between some resurgence of hope that Margarethad created and a premonition of utter failure for what they had staked on the election . Oddly , Margaret talked to him very little that week . After what she had told him she was more shy than she had ever been with him , but serene too , in a distant way , as though she knew that before long , when the necessary fever had quieted , they would have a new closeness ; something that they both needed would be there as it had not been before . He watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it exasperated him sometimes that she should seem so sure of realities still hidden from him . Hints of the way the election would go nagged at him. p 303The day before the election , Margaret got a call from a woman who asked , " Will you do me a favor , Mrs. Cameron ? " " That depends on what it is . I do n't promise favors until I know what I am promising . Who is this calling , please ? " There was a gurgle at the other end of the line , a sound that might have been a chuckle , and the woman said , " Mrs. Cameron , there 's a nigger running for the school board . Every decent white person ought to turn out to keep him off , Mrs. Cameron . " " Who is this speaking ? " Margaret said . " Who is it ? " " I asked who it was , " she told Cameron , " and she just hung up . " " Do n't you know ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who ? " " The voice of the people . " " Do n't be discouraged , darling . " " I 'm not , " he said and began to type . Margaret said , " You know we talked about having a telephone campaign for Jackson . Could n't we do it yet ? Even if it was just you and me . " " Nuts . This town has been fixed . It would n't do any good . " So  --  at least  --  they went to vote themselves . At least they did that much for John Jackson , themselves , and Kettle . At noon on Friday Cameron drove past their precinct polling place , a gray frame building that had once been a neighborhood grocery store and was now a recreation center maintained by the city . " They 're getting a turnout today , " he said later to Margaret . " Cars were parked tight for three blocks eachp 304way and the parking lot was full . And the cars . . . not a running board on any car in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baby-blue and yellow postwar dream jobs . So far it 's the bourgeois voting . " " Did you see any of our people ? " " I do n't think those we know will vote in this pre-cinct . " " Nobody we knew , " she said musing . " Oh . I saw Dean Fischer and his wife . They waved at me . " Then he did n't go on his vacation , " Margaret said . " He had to stay here and see that Riverton was run theright way . Margaret , let 's wait until five to vote . By thenpeople will be getting off work . I do n't know what Iexpect to see , but I want to see them . See who does vote . " ' " Of course , " Margaret said . " The working people . " He did not try to work that afternoon . He sat in theporch swing holding a bottle of beer that got warm in hishand . Once Margaret looked through the screen and said , " Are you trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a better way ? " He could see her through the screen door drying her hands on her apron . The screen door took away the definiteness of outlines , blurred the colors of her clothes and body . " Drive down and see what 's going on in the West End , " she said . " Please ? " So half an hour later he pulled in behind a brown-andtanPontiac across the street from the polling place on Racine Avenue where most of Riverton 's Negroes would vote . He sat there for quite a while before he realized that the two white men in the Pontiac were doing the 305same thing he was , that they were watching the Negroes on the other side of the street . Presently one of the men got out and came to lean onthe window of Cameron 's car . He grinned slowly . " Therehave n't been very many , " he said . " Not many at all . " " How many ? " Cameron asked . " I have n't got the figure , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded toward the Pontiac . " But do n't worry , it has n't passed a hundred yet . " Cameron nodded . He felt his car tip slightly as the man put his foot on the running board . Ile said , ' There 'll be a rush of them after five when they get oft ' work , I expect . " " Do n't worry , " the man said . He pulled on his watch chain and a tiny knife came out of his pocket , like a fish caught out of a pond . He began paring his nails , glancing back over his shoulder at the Negroes standing in small groups on the opposite sidewalk . A pure white paring fell from one of his nails as the knife worked at it . " It 'd take them at least maybe fifteen hundred , " he said . ' There 's not going to be that many . " " You sure of that ? " Cameron asked . Ile could feel himself tightening up . He could see the brown spangle of flecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man laughed . " How long you lived in Riverton , bud ? " Then he stopped laughing . " I ) o I know you ? I do n't , do I ? You live in Riverton now ? What 's your name ? " Cameron said nothing . The man flipped his littleknife shut and tucked it back in his vest pocket . " I asked you what 's your name ? " he said . " Plainclothesman ? " Cameron asked . " Listen , " the man said . White spots began to show atp 306either side of his mouth . " I just asked who you were . " " Get your goddamn foot off my running board , " Cameron said . He started the motor , backed up , swung out fast from the curb . It was not until he was at the end of the block , waiting for the traffic light to change that he realized what the name was the man had called him as he drove away . The same word they would  --  naturally  --  be using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , but I 'm not a fighting man . Oh Jesus , they 've really got me where they want me now . All tied up , and there 's not a damn thing I can do . Except vote . It was just past five o'clock when he and Margaret stepped into the line of voters at their own polling place . Cameron was carrying Ellen . The line was fairly long . A large part of it ran out through the front door and curved up the sidewalk . The Camerons were forty or fifty places from the voting booths . Several feet ahead of them a bunch of young men in work clothes were horsing around impatiently in the line , exchanging blows to one another 's biceps . Except for these the line seemed to be mostly women or elderly men . " Mr. Cameron . Mr. Cameron . " He felt a tug at his sleeve and turned to see Miss Garris , the city librarian , looking five feet tall and not more than eighty pounds . She was wearing a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face were quivering in a high , childish excitement . " Hello , " he said . " I have n't seen you for a while . I . . . " and then he realized that he had never seen her outdoors before , that her incongruous slightness had never seemed so out of place when she walked amongp 307book stacks or sat behind her oak desk at the library . " I hardly recognized you . This is my wife . Miss Garris , Margaret . " " I 'm going to vote for him , " Miss Garris said in a sibilant whisper . " I do n't care . I am . " She stood with them for a second more as though she had discovered some concentration of truth which she must impart or burst , then nodded nervously and headed for the end of the line . " Score one , " Margaret said . " A mighty host , " he said . A low-voiced man in glasses checked their registration . He nodded pleasantly at Ellen and said , " You going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she a fine little lady ? " " Can we vote her ? " Cameron joked . The pleasant man nodded . " If you vote her the right way . Ha ha . " They smelled Sen-Sen as he spoke to them . " I voted the right way , " Margaret said when she came out of the booth . " Score two . Goddamn it . " The election results were in Saturday 's Standard . Again Cameron went downtown earlier as he had a week before . " Did he . . . ? " Margaret said . " No , honey . " " How many ? " " You and me and Jackson and . . . " " Do n't tease me , Andy . How many ? " " Five . " There was nothing more to say about it , but the human animal with its recuperative mind can not help talking . Cameron said , " Five out of three thousand two hundred and fifteen . The heaviest school-board vote they 've everp 308had in Riverton . This ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep them in their place . " " That means none of the Negroes voted for him , " Margaret said . " You 'd think that some of them . . . " " You 'd think that , " Cameron said distractedly . " You 'd think so , but it damn well seems that all the thinking we 've done this summer was wrong . What a town ! Let 's get out of it . " " No , " she said . " We wo n't leave . We ca n't let them run us out too . " p 309THE windows were open but it was half dark in the room . The Venetian blinds were nearly closed , admitting only enough light to the office to suggest its elegant quietness and restraint . The noise of Chicago traffic came in the open windows , strained to melody and autumnal richness by the time it got , to the thirty-second floor . There seemed to be no individual sounds or cries in it or so many that they melted together and canceled out meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrist  --  towhom he had been coming for five weeks now and to whom he had been paying considerable parts of his remaining cash- thumb through t he typed notes on the chartboard , and at the moment Kettle was wondering , not so much what they would presently be confiding in or demanding to know of each other , as how doctors ' offices , which are the very inns of morbidity and death , can seem always to exude a sterile assurance that neither weakness or death is a reality . I le was amused by himself that he should sense this assurance so quickly each time he came to the office , and being amused he could not quite bring himself to accept it . " Tom , " the psychiatrist said . " I think we 're making progress . You remember what you asked me the first day we talked ? Of course . On the face of it it was a veryp 310strange question . " He chuckled , the tone of his chuckling carefully , professionally , calculated to deride without giving offense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  very much disappointed because you had not killed a man . You needed to kill him , of course . Our job is to readjust so you can get what you need without that violence against another person . As you agreed , of course . " " Sure , " Kettle said . " Only I do n't really agree . Maybe I ought to have . I only agreed on principle . I do n't know yet . " " When we kill people , " the psychiatrist said , " we seldom kill what we want to kill . You understand that . " " Sure , " Kettle said . " Well , forget about Willy . " " It 's not a matter of forgetting . We want to remember , but remember everything so that finally we 'll see things in their right relations . " " That sounds right . I always said . . . " " Well . . . I have the notes here that I made when we gave you the sodium amytal . Let 's go through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . " " I 'm glad , " Kettle said . " I did n't want to be a complete disappointment . " The psychiatrist looked at him quizzically for a little bit and then smiled . The two men were nearly the same age , and that was all the obvious similarity . The psychiatristwas trim and browned from week-ends in the sun when he had sailed on the lake or bathed from the dunes , assured and assuring in the same way his office with its substantial appointments was . He belonged , it seemed to Kettle , to the same race of the naively healthy as old man Hughes , hoping , as maybe even Hughes did , to lift as many as he could up through the trapdoor , outip 311of the litter and mess of life to his own eminence . With the litter and mess he had no sympathy  --  it was only something to be scrubbed off . A good man , Kettle thought , but that 's all you can say for him . " Tom , there is n't any need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a person you need to fend off . There 's nothing I want to take from you and nothing I will laugh at . Ca n't you let it go ? " " Sure , " Kettle said . " Sorry . " " Has there ever been anyone  --  any friend  --  that you did n't have to take that sarcastic tone with ? " " Sure , " Kettle said , " but only the fools . " The psychiatrist grimaced in sympathy , the wrinkle of the frown making a line across the immaculate tanned face . " Yes , I see , " he said . " It 's strange , is n't it , that the closer we get to people the more careful we have to be to set up fences to keep them away from us ? That should n't be . " " Now , " he said heartily . " Let 's begin . Of course this is all jumbled up . You were n't exactly literary while you were drugged . Sit over there , wo n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lake . I 'll have to have your help in figuring out what these things mean . " One thing that you kept repeating . You talked about a banjo . Does that mean anything ? " " I dream about it . That 's all . I do n't know . " " What shape does the banjo have in your dreams ? " " Round . " It seemed a disappointing answer becausethe psychiatrist went on . " Does bingo have anything to do with banjo ? Bond carry the wood in the snow and bingo . " Bingo boxes , ' " the doctor read from his notes . " Bingo  --  is that a name ? " p 312 " A game . " There was a sort of cold shock in Kettle 's mind ; for the moment he believed that somehow this immaculate man had spent a life in some rarified seclusion where no one had ever heard of Bingo games . " All right . What connection between Bond  --  your brother  --  and bingo ? " " We used to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I. That 's all . " The crawling dialogue , the search for the puzzle 's parts , went banally on . There were no surprises for Kettle . Jumbled as the transcript was that the doctor read to him and questioned him about , each part had its associations welling up with a much more intense profusionthan he could talk about . " The black circle in the grass . " " Willis could n't ever whip me the day with the green sunflower stalk . " " The long black curly grass and the fence posts five six . Seven eight nine ten the bedspringsgoing outside their window . " Fragments from a living reality that he had lived over whole again and again in his memory . Nothing surprising to him . And the little parts they gouged out and put in words added up to nothing . " Your father was a hairy man , was n't he , Tom ? " " Yes . And he 'd let his beard grow . He 'd get little drops of milk in his beard . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " So they went on . Kettle stared through the window at the clouds and the gulls that were coming in from the lake . He was getting impatient with the psychiatrist . He was having to hold back to let this note-taker stay ahead of him . God , he thought , do I have to pay him so he can play Sherlock Holmes ? These things seemed sop 313dry and thin when you talked about them . They were batting words around like children batting cornhusks . " The black grass might be the hair on your father 's body ? " " Yes . I did n't like to think about it . I was afraid I 'd grow some too . " And inside his mind , livid , was no single image , but a succession of images such as you would get if you laid one photographic negative over another . All these things had reappeared dozens of times in his life memory , and every time they had come back they had been modified by new associations and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or taking its place . He had the feeling that the psychiatristwas counting too much on the meaning of some single one of the images and that seemed too trivial an undertaking to bother with . He kept on answering without a great deal of interest . " The grass burned off the patch and the garden . ' What about , that patch , Tom ? Is that the same as the black circle ' ? " " The girls sleep around there , " Kettle said . " My sisters slept in that side of the yard in summer and Bond and I slept on the other side of the house under my folks ' window . The girls whistled for me to come around one night . My father came down and caught , met here fooling around . Threw me down in this burnt , grass with my face against the ground and sat on top of me . I le was poundingat me until my mother got there and made him stop . " " I see . " The psychiatrist was writing busily . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused him in a bitter way . He 's going to write all this down and I can get him as much as he wants right out of my head . I 'll keep him busy for ten times forty-seven years . " I ca n't afford it , " he said. p 314 " Ca n't afford what ? " " I ca n't afford to hire you to take down my whole life history . There 's too much of it . " The psychiatrist smiled . " We 're looking for what 's been hidden . You understand that . " " What if it is n't hidden ? What if I knew all these things anyway ? What if all of them put together that I remember made me the way I am ? " The psychiatrist nodded patiently . This was what they all said . All of them believed it and he was sure they were all wrong or they would not be there in his office . He was very sure of that . " Tom , " he said , " the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing the value of psychiatry with me . " " O.K. " Kettle said . At least he liked this man and he did n't mind talking to him . " Then my mother said , Now you stop that . ' She was a strong woman in some ways . My father was a violent guy , but she always told him what to do . " " Gentle little Jesus Mountwood . His hands black water in the washpan . Cameron laughed at me . ' You want to take those one at a time ? Or do they fit together some way ? " the psychiatrist asked . He stared at the sky beyond the window and he knew that he did n't want to take them one at a time . What was this all about anyhow ? This elegant office in Chicago , this being soothed and listened to by this elegant man ? The confused threads of his life would never be wound up here in any way that satisfied him . This place was so far from Riverton . Riverton was dirty and noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anywhere , and maybe Cameron , after all , was the one to help him get it . He had dragged Cameron into the mess of River-p 315ton . Maybe only a man standing with him in the mess would know the answers . Not here . Not in this office . But he submitted and let the consultation go on . He understood there was no easy way for him to get back to Riverton . The law had its greasy jaws set for him there . He was a long way from knowing just how he could get back . " Mountwood . . . " He began to explain in primersimpleterms who Mountwood was and what he had thought about him in the long years in Riverton . The way he would have to explain it to a child he explained it to this sophisticated stranger . While he talked an undercurrent of his mind was shaping the possibilities of going back . There is a way , he thought . I had it in my hands once . I could have killed him and cured myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kill a few and get it over with clean . In his fatigue he was envying Mountwoodthe quick clean snap of the rope behind his ear. p 316AROUND the lawn of the Junior College building theelms and maples turned yellow , a soft hot yellow against the sobering sky of the autumn . In Riverton , poised at the edge of the South , autumn came late and slow . The days stayed hot through the beginning of school , only more mute than they had seemed at the height of August . During these days the sky was often cloudy . Winds came with a persistent reiteration from the south or southeast , driving ranks of cloud ahead of them like battalions being rushed northward for some struggle already lost . Ditched by the failure of the election and Kettle 's disappearance , Cameron was living mechanically , sustained only at the level of those things he had been taught to do . He had begun his work at school , his history classes , with a certain docility . He had to admit that in a social way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the year before  --  as though some thorn of dissension that had not permitted him to give these young people the slick propositions which they came eager to accept had been cut away . As though this summer castrated me , he thought sometimes . And it seemed to him that this mental castration which made it easier to be a teacher had made it impossible to move ahead with his book on Mountwood. p 317After Kettle was gone , Cameron had tried to pick up his work on the book again . He made a trip to the state capital before the beginning of the school term and read through some of the records of Mountwood 's time owned by the State Historical Library . Among them he found the minutes of the debating club that Ezekiel had organizedas a front for his anti-slavery campaign . Up to the date of Ezekiel 's murder the society had debated slavery month in and month out . Then there was the time when the body hung all night on the cottonwoodby the river bank before his friends dared to come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next meeting of the elocution club  --  which continued  --  Ezekiel was not even mentioned . At least the minutes did not record his name . Simply the name of Mountwood had been replaced by that of one Farquahar as president of the society . The undercurrents which Ezekiel had liberated for a moment had killed him and sunk back into the ground . For the next year the subjects debated and " discoursed upon " had nothing to do with slavery . " The Nomenclature of Clouds " was one thing they had talked about and later " Phrenology : a Study . " Through the rest of 1838 and 1839 the people of Riverton had faced the slavery across the river with a hollow silence . " The Nomenclature of Clouds "  --  a fine subject for discussion in Riverton in 1947 and 1948 . What shall we call this one , dear friend ? Call it , Brother Cameron , a strato cumulus . Thank you . Thus shall we live in peace . And this early part of the fall did hold a kind of withered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped out of reality . Cameron saw Dean Fischer , chatted with him , nearly every day with complete outwardcordiality . Sometimes they met on the steps outsidep 318the building as they arrived in the morning and stood there for a while , breathing the fine morning air and exchanging banalities about the weather or commenting on the progress of this student or that . Around them the trees of the lawn changed color though it had not yet frosted in Riverton . It was as though the mere imminence , the inevitability of the frost that would come surely enough had prompted them to die while the weather still was warm . On several afternoons Cameron stared at the changing trees from his office window . He watched them turn and turn through all the brilliant colors of morbidity against a still benign sky . And it has n't even frosted yet , he said to himself . From time to time Boo Gordon called . Once he 'd had a note from Kettle in Chicago and then a later one from Nashville , saying nothing except that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smart-alec tone , " I joined the Army . I 'm a soldier now . " " Did you enlist ? " Cameron said . Hearing that news from Boo seemed like another betrayal . " Going to fight the Russians ? " he asked and Boo did n't answer . " What happened to your job ? I thought you had a pretty good new job . " " It was a funny one . At the steel mill . I think they wanted me to be a spy or something . " " Oh . " " Yeah . " " Well . Good luck . " " Yeah . Good luck to you . " That was all from Mr. Gordon . Maybe it was easier saying good-bye to him over the telephone , not because they had done anything to him , but because they wouldp 319know just as he would that some brutal operation had been performed on him and there would be the strain between them that you find in hospital rooms between the ambulant visitors and the convalescent lying under the incomplete mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutilation underneath . Spared that meeting they could finally come to the point of telling each other that , after all , they had n't known Boo Gordon well . Maybe he slid through it easier than we . . . . Maybe he did n't . . . Then it was November , a day when the clouds were colored and spotted like spring clouds , and showers were falling here and there down the river valley . That morning Barkley called before Cameron had gone to school . " I 've got some news for you , " he said . " What time can you come in ? Three ? Four ? Make it three if you can . " So in the afternoon Cameron climbed the stairs for his second visit to Barkley 's office . He had to wait for a few minutes before Barkley was free . When he went in Barkley was already spinning in his swivel chair to face him and something in the glint of Barkley 's eyes was a warning . " It 's bad news , " Barkley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Martin . I got a call from him  --  which was nice of him he says he 's coming back . I 'm afraid he wo n't listen to me . But he might listen to you . I thought you might want to go over and tell him not to come back . " " Oh . " " You can play around just so long , " Barkley said . " But one way or another Tom is going to stay on the 320other side of that damned river . From what you said the last time we talked , I gather you 'd prefer to have him persuaded . " Cameron stared , rather out of balance , feeling all at once precipitated back into the chasm which he thought had been left behind at the end of the summer . There was something about the gaiety of Barkley 's manner that he could not fathom . " I suppose I wondered if he would n't come back , " he said finally . " What 's his reason ? " " Lunacy . Why else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to be heard . There were a lot of things unexplained when he left . I found his gun  --  a gun  --  on his beer cooler and somebody had been wrecking things upstairs . " " The rights of man , " Barkley said mockingly . " They 're  --  how many ?  --  ten , a hundred , a thousand years off . We 'll get them some day , but right now nobody is ever heard who ca n't make people listen to him . That 's a maxim for you . Think about it before you mess around with politics again . Anyway you look at it , nobody in Riverton is going to listen to Kettle 's side of the story . Unless you want to when you go to St. Martin to tell him not to come back . " " I 'll go see him . " " But even you wo n't listen to him . " " Of course . " Barkley shook his head . " No . No . There 'll be a bar between you . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from listening . You 'll keep watching him to see he does n't put his hands on you . " " No , " Cameron said . " Do it the easy way , " Barkley said . " Go tell him short and sweet not to come back . I 'll give you another reasonp 321why . This may affront your taste , so I 'll make it brief . You remember last summer when some of our pals in town decided that Boo Gordon was a pretty easy way of getting at Kettle ? It probably would n't have worked then . At least they could n't have made it stick . I 'm damned positive of that . But people go on their crazy way  --  silly little Gordon walked right in and set things up so it will work now . He can be had if necessary . Now , do you remember a police car burning the night , Kettle left town ? Somebody tossed a match in the tank . Can you guess who did that ? " " You 're guessing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrong about- this , my friend . That police car exploding was silly little Gordon expressing himself . Do n't you see how that would work ? " Cameron waited without expression , feeling the sharp probe of Barkley 's eyes that sought , some admission of agreement . Barkley said , " Surely you 've known enough hysterical , infantile Leftists  --  you 've been in college to see that , he would be capable of doing something just , that stupid , huh ? " While Cameron shook his head , he was nevertheless thinking in a quick succession of images of the way it must have been  --  Boo Gordon , shaken and uneasy about the beginning of his sex experiences , upset , that night , of the meeting in Kettle 's saloon , admiring Kettle , smashed at by the revelation of what Kettle was , afraid , his uncertainty , of what he himself might he , that , awful doubt of adolescence , feeling so much tension that , it had to emerge in violence  --  it all added up . It , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Barkley grimaced . " Whether you do or not , somebodyp 322saw him . He was running pretty damn hard , and he was n't running in the direction of the explosion . How do you suppose he did it ? Must have had some kind of a fuse , huh ? Maybe used his handkerchief or necktie for a fuse into the tank . Hmmm . I 'd say if he did that he 'd have about a fifty-fifty chance of not getting blown up himself . But he did n't . " " If somebody saw him , why did n't they tell the police ? " Cameron asked . " Lot of people do n't like the police . You ought to have found that out . " Barkley examined the ends of his fingernails . " That would make a good story for Riverton to work out on , huh ? I have the dope , my friend , and it will be safe with me as long as Tom does n't come across that river . Do n't you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town any more ? I 've got big ears . Anyway , it 's as simple a proposition as I said . I 'll leave it up to you how you want to use this information . You may not have to tell Tom if you 've got other ways of persuadinghim . " " You could have told Tom that over the phone . Could n't you face up to telling him yourself ? " " I do n't say things like that on the phone . " Cameron twisted as though some physical act might provide him an escape . Now I 'm in the middle , he thought . One after one they get each of us in the middle , line us up and smash us . Barkley said , " I hope  --  this is honest  --  that you know how big the issues are . Do n't think I 'm doing this for personal reasons . That 's all I have to say . " He swung the chair so it faced his desk . " One thing , " Cameron said . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think so . " p 323 " You do n't have any hold on me . I might spoil your plan , you know . " Barkley said , " You 're no adolescent like Gordon . I do n't need a hold on you . " He put his thumb on the butt of a cigar in his ash tray and pressed hard until it broke up in brown shreds . " Do I ? " he asked , watching Cameron from under lowered lids . " If you do you 'll find one ? " Cameron asked . " That is it , is n't it ? Or else you think I yellowed out this summer , that if I had really stuck with Tom he might have had a chance to fight it out then ? Is n't that it ? " He felt his voice getting unsteady and hated himself for this unmistakableconfession of weakness , hated Barkley for sitting there so shrewdly weighing this tremble in his voice along with what he said , so that the words were discounted . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never mind . I want you to understand whatever I 've done  --  have not done , what I 've . . . Oh , hell , I want you to understand that I regard this as a serious matter . " " So do I. " " No . You do n't get me yet . " It was so very hard for Cameron to say . It was very hard to get himself out of the mold of convention in which such things are never said except in joking or in discussions without consequence . " Some things are ultimate , " he said . " There 's a point beyond which nobody or no one can push you , you ca n't let them push you . " He said , " I ca n't permit you . . . " The words sounded humiliatingly pompous , empty in his own ears as if they had come from a mimicking bystander . " . . . to make any decisions for Kettle without hearing what he has to say . " p 324Barkley said gravely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it . " Cameron got up and groped his way toward the door . " And if he does n't listen to reason  --  your reason  --  I suppose there are other ways of keeping him from coming back . You said , One way or another . ' No . I wo n't even stand by this time . I 'll go see him and if he wants to come back I 'll see that he gets back and I 'll see that he gets to whatever office or court or jail at least that he wants to go to . And I 'll be armed , so if you want to . . . " " Oh , my God , " Barkley said . " Go cool off . " He was grinning when Cameron left . He drove home and explained briefly to Margaret why he had to go this evening to see Kettle . He had to invent an errand for her in the kitchen so he could take Kettle 's gun from the closet shelf and slip it into his briefcase , keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing this he seemed to sense that behind his back the grin on Barkley 's face , magnified though , and disembodied , grew huger and more general so that the whole conventional world of his background and knowledge was contained in an enormous amusement at him . A kid playing cowboy , he thought , and the humiliationburned hard , but he was committed , nonetheless , to the humiliation itself. p 325I T MAY have been that the Oxford hotel was Tom Kettle 's proper monument ; there where the purplish bricks of the wall and the one after another green blinds that hung in the uncurtained windows and the sign ROOMS BY DAY OR WEEK hived over him like some incrediblybaroque pyramid conceived to protect against Time not the immortal parts or even the name of a man , but only the recollected passions of the aging , cherished against the wind in the city streets , and of which it is said , at the right time , when there is nothing else to say of them , " These must not die "  --  while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the November day was turning a bright green and the green was scratched with clouds as though an enameled bowl had been scraped with a knife so the metal showed through , and at its top , against , this illuminatedcolor , the hotel wall looked black and sooty . A cat walked along the stone window ledge of a firstfloorwindow . As it walked it peered into the dark window and saw its own reflection . A drugstore occupied one corner of the building . In its display window among the yellow price cards and tiers of medicine boxes stood a torso in plaster . The torso was vaguely female , colored pinkish and brown to representp 326skin , and it was wrapped in a corded pink truss that criss-crossed elaborately on the belly . The three men lounging in front of the Oxford Hotel were all wearing black suits . One of them wore a cap and the collar of his shirt was open . They stood with their hands in their pockets and , now and then , one of them looked down the street or up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coming out of the hotel to loaf a while was to look at the sky or look as far down the street as a theater marquee advertising " Souls in Pawn , " or to look at nothing , only to shift from foot to foot and smoke until the cold forced them to go back to the pyramid hotel to lie through the winter night in their parallel beds , room over room marked with the numerals in stamped tin . The hotel door was two steps down from the level of the sidewalk . The floor of the lobby was crossed with rubber strips the color of the suits worn by the men outside . Coming in from the street , Cameron plunged into the smell of ancient rubber and the memory-tripping mixture of odors in which it dominated  --  as though this monumental hotel , in its very transience , proclaimed not a steel or a bronze but a rubber civilization . A couple of men sat on the couch in front of the window . One of them read the Christian Science Monitor and the other watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat . She might have been quite young or she might have been thirty-five . Her round blonde face clenching on her gum like a fist kneading dough turned toward him as he crossed the lobby . The smell of these people and of the endless faceless host of their hoteldwellingancestors ( back to the fish crawling out of the fish-smelling rivers of prehistory ) was there with the smell of the rubber mats , which were not only stainedp 327but compounded now with tobacco and spit and the litter of the streets . The desk clerk said , " Room 34 . " A plant was growing out of a pottery urn by the stairway . The sun seemed never to have touched it . Its leaves on the yellow stem looked older and waxier than life . The stairs were carpeted with purple velvet . Kettle sat at a table in the middle of his room  --  the room was surprisingly large , but shadowy . The two windows opened on a wall three feet away . He had on a clean white shirt with the cuffs rolled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekbones punched through the sag of his jowls were spots of dark red that Cameron in his first quick glance thought . ( frightened when he saw them ) were rouge . They were a network of veins , and his skin had whitened , turned more transparentsince summer . He had said , " Come in , " without looking at , the door and he was lifting his head now as t hough he had rigged a hoist on his own back and was behind , tugging the encumbering weight of it into the posit ion he wanted . " I 'll be damned , " he said . The fingers of his left hand , lying on the table were rolling and unrolling a scrap of paper . " You never know , do you ? Never know who will come to see you . How 'd you find out I was here ? " " Barkley . " " Barkley sent you . He sent you over to keep me from coming back . " " That 's not quite it , Tom . I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to . I wanted to see you , man . We 've been worried about you . " " If I want to , huh ? " " Where have you been all this time ? " Cameron said . " Boo kept us posted as much as he could . You sure did n't tell him much . Look , we 've really been worried . I wenttp 328o your place and found the gun . What happened ? " " You found the gun ? " " The automatic . Lying on the beer cooler . I took it before anyone saw it . Gets to be a serious matter when there are guns involved . " He smiled to indicate the facetiousness of his remark . " Nothing happened , " Kettle said . " What was the gun for ? " " I was going to shoot somebody . I meant to shoot him . " The fingers of his left hand snapped and the scrap of paper flashed up into the air . " I did n't get it done . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Riverton for ? " Cameron asked . " What ? For what ? " " To shoot somebody ? " " No . No . What would be the good of that ? I wanted to come back . I 've lived there a long time . " The opacity and slowness of the conversation disturbedCameron . He did not want to push too hard , to ask questions that , a few months ago , he might have asked without hesitation . There was a barrier between them of things that had happened . It did no good to say that events " did n't make any difference "  --  that it did n't make any difference that both of them remembered the mess of the summer and its revelations  --  it had made a difference , as though when their friendship had been more casual , less informed , there was no gulf between them . But knowing more about each other now they recognized the separating barrier . The barrier could be explained simplest in terms of Tom 's perversion  --  but , after all , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain , accept the gulf and talk across it . " Where have you been ? " Cameron asked again . " In the dark , " Kettle said , nodding his head affirma-p 329tively to emphasize the statement . No one else could have or would have said it that way , or with such earnestness . It had an archaic sound  --  I have been in the dark  --  or not that , perhaps , but the false literary sound that would be the hallmark of a public library education . Mountwood , who lived naturally with his Testaments and classic literature , might have said it gracefully . In 1947 in a cheap hotel room it was as grotesque and pitiful too as though this fat old man should have tried to wear Mountwood 's clothes , his belly bulging through them , their antiquity only suggesting a presumptuous delusion . Maybe the delusion existed . If so , then the reason for going back to Riverton could be guessed . It was the one possible gesture left , himself the bait this time , tricking the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own guilt would be contained and forgot .. Perhapshe foresaw a time when people in Riverton would talk less about what he had done than about what , was done to him . Perhaps that restoration of a good name was his motive now . Cameron shook his head . " But where were you , Tom ? " " Chicago , Nashville , Memphis . " " What were you doing ? You should have let , us know . " Kettle shrugged . " Hard to tell , boy . Lots of things . I went to a psychiatrist in Chicago for six weeks or so . " " You should have gone before . You needed help . " Kettle shook his head and grinned . ( ' That too out of place , false , lying , awkward . ) " I was afraid to . Maybe ten years ago I would n't have been . Maybe I did n't need to go then . Or else they should have taken me to a psychiatrist when I was born . " His shoulders shook with some inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He reached under the table and produced a pint bottle still wrapped in the heavy paper from the liquor store except for a torn fringe around the neck. p 330 " Drink ? I do n't have any glasses . You know I was drunk the night that  --  happened . I must have been drunk . Jesus Christ . " He stared at Cameron to see if he was being believed and Cameron shook his head . " But how drunk can you get ? " Kettle asked . " I do n't know . I thought maybe the psychiatrist could tell me . He was an interesting fellow . We had some good talks . If he had been a surgeon trying to cut my belly open he 'd have ruined all his knives by now . " I 'm forty-seven , Andy . By then you get too much stuff to hope to straighten it out . " Again his gross body shook with amusement at the joke played on him by the secret workings of Time  --  the outlandish , destructive , and awful joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of things . He found out that I hated my father . I knew that when I was eight years old . And that I felt guilty about his death . I knew that too . So when we struck the Star mine I was after revenge for my father . I had to pay him to tell me that . Do you know what he told me , Andy ? Finally ? " " Yes , " Cameron said . Because it was what the world of things as they are would have to say , unaware of the irony which was its own doom as well as Kettle 's . " He said that you 're not the kind of person that should get mixed up in social movements . That you ought to leave them up to somebody else . John Brown should never have raided Harper 's Ferry . Mountwood should never have come to Riverton . They ought to have waited for Ralph Waldo Emerson to go do it . Because he was so beautifully balanced . " " Right , " Kettle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph . " So well balanced that he never would have come . " " Barkley sent you to tell me the same thing . He sent you to tell me to stay away , did n't he ? " p 331Cameron shook his head . " Barkley does n't tell me what to do . That 's another thing I 've graduated from . Forget about Barkley . " Kettle said , " I intend to forget about him . What I do now I 'll have to do for myself . Whatever is right for me personally I have to do . I 've come too far to worry about anyone else now . " " You 've never worried a whole lot about anyone else , have you ? " For a moment Kettle looked hurt , as though he had relapsed for a moment into the vision he had of himself six months before , and as though he meant , to ask again whether Cameron did not know about- the unemployed and the unions . Then he said , " Maybe not .. Maybe so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was doing them some good . That was the point . The trouble was always  --  help me think this out , I 've had such a hell of a time with it  --  always  --  that I was trying to get , for somebody else what I could n't have for myself . I hoped they 'd get the things I could n't have so that in a second-hand way I would have them , own them . " Like with Boo Gordon . I suppose you think I was trying to pogue him . No , goddamn it , . Whatever they 've said about me lately I 've never put , my hands on any kids . I never let myself put my hand on his shoulder . I mean that I knew what I was and I knew what . I would n't let myself do . Do you think anybody that would watch me would be any stricter than I was with myself ? Well , that sounds like bragging , and it 's a hell of a poor thing not to have anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He started to laugh and the laugh turned into a fit of coughing that made his face turn red . " No , " he said . " Boo is a fine , bright kid . He might as well not have had any folks as those praying lunatics he had . So I thought I was helping him get away from them. p 332I 'd have been proud if he could have finished college  --  if I could have stayed to help him , I mean . It would have been like I 'd done it myself . " He nodded mournfully . " That was all wrong . You ca n't get anyone to live your life for you . You have to get your own things . " " Yes , " Cameron said . " So why do n't you forget about Riverton ? Go somewhere else and start again . " " No , " Kettle said . " Tom , they 're going to lock you up for a long time if you go back . Barkley told me about the state law . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , it 's not just , " Kettle said . " If I run away I let them get away with it , with an unjust law . " " They 're not going to change it because you go back , " Cameron said . He was aware of an unworldly progress of the argument , rather amazed at himself for taking it so solemnly  --  and yet he had not come to the point where reason completely failed in what Kettle was saying . " They do n't have to change it , " Kettle said . " Let them use it . Let them keep using it and maybe they 'll wear it out or get tired . " " I do n't know how to answer that , " Cameron said . " I 'm right , " Kettle said . " If someone has a bayonet and you have to take it away from him . . . You ca n't . But you can wear it down by letting him use it on you . " " That 's crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreed with ponderous seriousness . " There have to be , " he said . " If you had to have a glass of water and the fixed price was a million dollars  --  you 'd have to pay it or else . " Sitting at this old table , marked with the burns of cigarets and ringed with moisture and scratched with pencil marks , seeming more at home here than he had in his more prosperous rooms , there was something monstrous enough about his appearance to compel ap 33certain belief in the truth of what he said  --  as though this body of his contained the evidences of dissension that all the people who ever lived had made against the institutions that again and again hobbled them short of the freedom they sought , the kind of life they had to lead . " I 've been thinking all this time , " Kettle said . " Damn it , I am not going back to Riverton for fun . It 's the right thing for me to do . You ca n't beat the system with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your back . Your wife said once  --  she is a smart girl , Andy that , ' everything goes together . ' You remember that . We laughed at her because we thought then that you can be smart and arrangethings so they 'll come out right one after another . You ca n't settle things one at a time and come out ahead . That 's where Barkley has gone wrong . ' That 's where I was wrong  --  fooling people about myself , trying to hide what I was , everything I was . That can't. help . The only way I can do anybody any good is to go back and fight the law if I can and let them do whatever they decide they want to do with me . I wo n't need a lawyer for that . If I 'm honest with everyone , that might help . Somehow . " I have to give it to him , Cameron thought .. I have to hit him with the facts because this religious ecstasy of his or whatever you call it , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coin that he and everybody else is given to spend in this world . " Tom , " he said , " wait . There 's Boo Gordon to think about . " " What about him ? " " You were talking about wanting to help him . What do you think it would do for him if you went back ? Do n't you think he was hit hard enough by what you did this summer ? He 's not going back to college as it is . He'sp334joined the Army . What do you think about that ? " He might have said , " your son Boo " because just then he saw it that way and needed to express it that way so his report would have enough edge to hurt . He would not , he thought , stoop low enough to say what threat Barkley had made against Boo . He refused to let that muddle the argument . He could see Kettle wince , sighing and nodding . " All right , " Kettle said . " I know . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I 'm glad you came . So you can decide for me . Go ahead . Give me the rest . What else did I foul up ? " " The election . " " Bad ? " " Very bad . The kind of flop that ends things definitely . There is n't going to be any Negro on the school board for a long time to come . That is n't all . Now they 're talking about a bond issue to build segregated schools to last for the next fifty years . It could have been better than that if we 'd used more common sense . " " No ! It could not ! " Kettle 's hands were on the edge of the table , the thumbs under the edge and fingers spread like rays onto its wooden top . His voice was a combined wail and roar . " It could not . You are lying , " he said . " Do n't lie to yourself about common sense . You mean schemes . The kind of schemes I had in mind last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes to him . We have been going the wrong way with our schemes . We 've got to be honest . That 's why I 'm going back . " His fingers began to curl . The knuckles rose first . Each joint bent separately . His nails scraped in the hardwood , and then the hands were fists . The rasping sound of his nails on the wood stopped . " How bad did I wreck things then ? How many votes did Jackson get ? " he asked . His voice was dead . Ip 335Cameron waited , because the insulting , significant , insuperablenumber was the best argument he had . " Five , " he said . Kettle fumbled in his shirt pocket for cigarets that were not there . " I 've got some , " Cameron said . But Kettle , as though he were alone , as though for another fierce moment he had opened an interior battle to which he must give all his attention , got up and wandered around the room , looking through the pockets of the clothes flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron was holding out to him . " I fixed things , did n't I ? " Kettle said . " I 'm glad you told me that . I get mixed up still , Andy . " Ile put the cigaret in his mouth and leaned toward the match that . Cameron was holding , his eyes fixed almost . desperately on that little point of light . He said , " Andy , I told you once- I think I told you , I meant to anyway  --  that I 'd been putting off a smashup for forty-seven years . When it got here it was a good one , huh ? I guess I 've been telling myself that what happened last summer was n't the end , that it did n't finish things right . But it was , was n't it ? Only if that . was the end , what am I doing still alive ? I ought to he dead . That , would tidy up things . I ought to lie down , only I do n't want to . I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You understand that ? Or is it more nonsense ? " " My God , Tom . You do n't have to explain that . " " I do n't want to . " " I know . " " But is that enough ? Do I have any right to keep going after a smashup like that ? " " That 's enough . " " Thanks , " Kettle said with tearing irony . After a while he said , less sarcastically , " We 've got that settled between me and you  --  though there mightp 336be some other people that would n't look at it that way . Hell with them . All I can afford to worry about is what seems right to me and you . I guess I 've got the right to go on somehow . I can live if I do n't fool with people or try to make them different . Do n't you fool with people either , boy . Leave them alone . That 's the main thing . " And then after some more time he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tell you some things . Then you 'll have to decide whether I come back to Riverton . " " No , " Cameron said . " I wo n't do that . You just said , Leave people alone . ' I wo n't decide for you . " " You had decided when you came here . You came here for Barkley to tell me to stay away . I 'm giving you a chance to change your mind . " " I did n't come to tell you . I came to find out why you were coming back . " Kettle shook his head in disbelief . " You do n't mean that . You had made up your mind before you came . There are a lot of things you do n't know yet , but you had decided . We got into something and now we  --  youhaveto wind it up by deciding once more . I think that will clear us , pay up for our fun . I think that will be enough . But you have to decide it finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have to . " " Whatever you decide . . . " Cameron said . " Not me . You . You already had decided when you came here . But take another crack at it when I get through telling you . There 's a story about Tom Kettle , " he said solemnly . Because he seemed to be thinking very hard of what to say next , how to put it , Cameron said , " I know . Barkley told me about it . It was all good , Tom , no matterhow it worked out . " p 337 " It was all wrong . But that does n't matter so much . And Barkley does n't know much about it . That doctor in Chicago was a good fellow . He knew part of it . A little bit . I ought n't to make fun of him . If I can make some money maybe I 'll go back to him sometime . If I do n't go to jail . If you decide that I do n't go to jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cameron was aware of the triviality of the question . Kettle answered patiently , like a teacher who must see that the pupils are comfortable , the distractions removed before the lesson begins . " I have n't sold the furniture from the saloon . Wanda Berry goes with a gentleman who will buy it . I can work . " But this doctor found out part of the story . It all goes in together before you can understand . You need it all . I found that out . One half needs the other . " Riverton , Cameron meditated , needs its Mountwoods or its Kettles , not to use any other way , but , to kill ? Or did he mean simply needs needs to have ? Or was he talking only about himself ? Cameron was not sure , but it seemed to him that Kettle was talking confidently , surely , now , as though below hope there was a level of his own from which he could not be shaken . " That was the trouble , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon enough . There 's always been something wrong with me . Fighting back and forth . I know something about , it now . I 'm not a literary man like you , Andy . But if a man wants to find out a lot of people 's ideas-he has a lot of time to read before he 's forty-seven . When I found out , about myself I did a lot of reading of Freud . " For only a second while he paused Cameron imagined him in some lost and lonely years carrying away from the library , from the vivacious Miss Garris who would rejoice that someone in Riverton was reading her " serious books , " the volumes like re-p 338peated doses of a specific drug  --  as the doomed man with the inscrutable pain of death growing inside him takes gravely from the pharmacist 's hand the wrapped , little package of pills , which can be had in a ritual exchange for money , and goes back with them to the night-shutteredroom where with them  --  only them and his own incantations  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I 'd read those books sooner  --  if I 'd known what they meant  --  I do n't say I do know  --  they might have done some good . When I got them , there did n't seem to be any good to do . " The doctor knows part of the story . There are parts he thinks are important , but I ca n't separate them from the rest of the things that worked on me . It was his idea that whatever I tried that was supposed to change Riverton I did because I hated the image of my father . " Cameron nodded as though he were agreeing with this , but Kettle snorted impatiently , " O.K. , that 's part of the truth , but only part . Maybe he 's right , too , that it was the same kind of hate that made me a homosexual . Funny things get mixed up together . There are other things he pounced on . One was  --  a little kid mixup . I 'd feel sorry if I knew it had happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to you . All us kids used to sleep in the yard in summer and my brother Bond and I were supposed to sleep on one side and the girls on the other . One night I heard my folks inside and got ideas and went around where the girls were sleeping . They yelled out and my father came and beat me up . The doctor thought this might be pretty important , might have twisted the way I felt about sex . I told him a lot of things like that when I took amytal and he makes something out of several of them . But there 's a lot he does n't know . He could n't find out why I dreamed about banjoes. " p 339 " Banjoes ? " " A banjo . It seems to be what I want . I had this mixed in somehow with the bingo games we used to play  --  oh , hell , everything mixes with something else . But I do n't know , the banjo is just what I must want . Anyway I dream about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There 's always been something wrong with me that I could n't catch up to . People could look at me and tell . " " That is nonsense , Tom . " There was a mirror hanging over the commode , and , glancing up , from where he had obviously been sitting for a long time so this was not the first look he had taken , he saw and grimaced at the image of that lumpy body in which he had squirmed and fought . " They knew , " he said . " It 's funny how much people know that you do n't think they do . I thought they had me spotted because I was awkward and clumsy or because I was a Red or something . Some joke on me . I thought I did n't get married because I was always cooking some kind of a political scheme that needed time . Some joke , too . Somebodyhas been laughing at me all my life . I did n't know what it was until after I got the saloon . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairies and pansies . Maybe they knew all the time that I was one , but I did n't . " Then my brother Bond and his wife died in ' 37 . Both of them . I had to take in their boy , Abel . Kid about fifteen , but he did n't look it . He was shy all the time . The way the farm boys are . I did n't think anything about it . He used to hang around the waitresses in the place all the time and pick up any little piece of clothes they left lying around and put it on . He 'd tease them to let him wear their bracelets . I watched him for a year and took him to the doctors . He had a bad time in schoolp 340and quit . I kept watching him . It got so I knew . It was n't some little thing that happened that he could get over . It was him . You see things  --  other people besides yourself do things and then you know about yourself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andy . " I did n't care what he was . I never cared what anybodywas . You know  --  tolerance . To live and walk around free whatever he was . Do n't you think he had a right to do that ? " " Tom , everybody has . . . " " No , they have n't . Not yet . I should have known that when Abel  --  turned inside . We had to put him in the asylum and he died there . You ca n't hold onto people . You 've got to let them go . If a thing is begun bad , you 've got to let it work out to a bad end and then bury it . Do n't try to stop it being that way . Well , I did n't know that . After Abel was dead I was scared as hell because I had n't been able to hold him . I read a lot . I was afraid to go to a psychiatrist . Had too many irons in the fire that I wanted to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I talked it over with Barkley and promised him I would n't take any chances . Do n't ever make any promises like that , Andy . You ca n't get away with them . " I do n't want you to think , I would n't want you to get the idea that I 've ever been happy about this . I was ashamed . I do n't think I am any more . I 've learned things , even if they were always too late to do any good . " Then he turned violently  --  as though he were spitting it  --  on the word which he had been using so often to explain his thoughts . " I do n't mean do good . How can you do any good for anybody ? Now , I 've got devils to sleep with . Did I do anything to deserve them ? Who did I ever hurt ? You ca n't even do any good for yourself. p 341Do you know that , Andy ? You and I have been wrong . I started to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Before I left Riverton . Willy somebody . Maybe I should have killed him . It would have been more honest with him than trying to persuade him to do something I thought was good . You ca n't put that in your book about Ezekiel , Andy , but that 's the way it should be . " That doctor in Chicago wanted to help me get rid of things that had happened to me that made me the way I am . He was wrong . Those things belong to me . I bought them . There is n't anything in my life I have n't paid for . I wo n't give them up . That 's the way it has to be . You ca n't use just a part at a time . " " You 're convinced of that now , are n't you ? " Cameron said thoughtfully . Kettle nodded . " Have you got a cigaret ? " he said . " I 've been meaning to go out and get some . What time is it ? " " Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and I thought I had something figured out until you came . I Damn it , do you think it is easy for me to make up my mind to go hack to Riverton ? Anyway , here 's something that . may help me explain . There was a ruckus out in the hall here last night . Some guy beat up a woman , a little woman in a dirty little coat . She was standing there when I saw her , drunk and bawling in an awful way . I wanted to do something to help her , change things some way so she could stop bawling and be happier . But all at once I knew I should n't do that if I could . I thought if I was God Almighty I would n't take any of her trouble away from her that she 's had and that she 's going to keep on having , because people have a right to their own pain . It 's the pain that keeps the world balanced up . Do youp 342see ? Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it would be right for me to hang onto mine , too , and see them through to the end . That 's the way I think when I think I 'll go back to Riverton and let them do whatever they have got to do to me there  --  Barkley and Hughes and all of them . If they had to work out on me just as I am  --  with no fooling any more  --  it would be the best thing for me and them . The best thing I 'm still free to take any part in . " He was through talking now . It was time for the question , " What do you think of that ? " Without really thinking , impulsively , Cameron said , " No . " " So you have decided for me ? " Kettle said . " You said that you would not , but you did . " This time Cameron took longer to answer , but the answer was no different . It was the same because he was afraid , and because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision , he wanted to help Kettle . " That 's what I think , " he said . " You followed my argument , did n't you ? " Kettle shook his head wonderingly . Whether he was pleased or angry Cameron could not tell . " You understood what I meant and you still decided I should n't come back . Did you do it because you 're brave or because you 're scared of what would happen if I came back ? " Cameron said in a dogged way , " I think it 's best . " Kettle shrugged and jerked his chair around so it was facing the table fully . " So now I 'll go away somewhere and you 'll go back to your Riverton and write your Mountwood book and prosper and . . . " " No . I ca n't write it , Tom . " " Cameron , listen . Damn you , boy , you are so smart and you still do n't get it . You had a choice and you made it . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youp 343made that , but that does n't give you any way to give up altogether . I do n't know whether you chose right or not , but you ca n't choose to quit . That 's not in the choice . " " This summer , Tom , knocked me loose from whatever I thought I knew . I had the book right in my hand once . I would n't know how to write it now . " " You do n't have the choice to quit . You ca n't get out . " " O.K. I admit I was born . I ca n't get out . " " Yeah , that 's it , " Kettle said . " Only , listen . Were you trying to be nice to me ? Is that all your book was worth ? Things are tough for you , pal , so I 'll cut oil ' my parts to make you feel better ? ' " " The book 's dead . I did n't , mean I would n't want to write it . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . They 're not enough . " " Damn you , yes , " Kettle said . " If doing things is too hard then you 've got to write about , them . Only do n't expect to do that too quickly . Maybe you ca n't do even that until you get old and sick and mean enough to see how hard even the writing will be . It will be hard . " He reached his hand out very slowly so Cameron would see it coming  --  so , if he wanted to , he could back away . Deliberately he put his hand over Cameron 's and held it a minute . Cameron 's belly tightened . There was a cold revulsion in all his senses while he watched the fat hand settle on his own . He knew that Kettle was putting a final mark on him , and the knowledge terrified him . The touch was not casual any more than Kettle 's ever touching him could be casual again after what he had learned in the summer . Nevertheless , he endured it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervert 's hand  --  on his , said , I am every disgraceful thing they call me and still everythingp 344you know I am . Not from either of those can you escape . " I do n't know . Maybe sometime , " Cameron said . " How do I know that I ever can write it ? " Kettle had moved back away from him now , withdrawinginto the depths of his chair , his obese head settling into a kind of pained serenity . " You think it would be worth it  --  Mountwood and all the others that got hurt and did n't change the evils in the world  --  if it were written down ? " Cameron asked . " Yes , " Kettle said , nodding earnestly . " It would have to be . " All right , Cameron said to himself dizzily . He was back on his own side of the river again , driving the open stretch between Paris and Veneta . Ahead of him , over the smoke of the refineries and the lights on the refinery towers beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Riverton surmounted by the Hughes mansion . All right , he thought , I am whipped down enough to believe Kettle  --  believe that the writing , the knowledge , would have to be worth the impotence . He stopped the car alongside a slough backed up from the nearby river . Waiting for a lull in the traffic so no one would see him , he took Kettle 's gun from the briefcaseand threw it out into the water . The gun , he thought , was the last cheat of his illusion that the means to moral action were accessible to him . But still , in its roundabout way , it had been a necessary detail in the progress he had made out of last summer 's jungle . He watched the ripples it made in the icy water and when they were quiet he drove on . Overhead , the sky was a pure evening yellow as though for a thousand miles westward there should be no blemish in it bigger than the black lines of geese and ducks migrating , or sometimes a trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that simple bath of color . I believed , he thought , but Kettle would n't let it go at that . He had to show me . But why did he have to do it that way ? So I would not forget what it meant or what I had chosen ? So I would always know that life has to be paid for with corruption , just as a final honesty like Mountwood 's would have the price of death for whoever chose it ? You can go along talking to him , he thought , as though he were a human being and then he pulls these things on you as easily as if he were a stage manager . It was n't just a coincidence what happened next . " It would have to be , " Kettle had said . He reached down for the paper-wrapped bottle , unscrewed the top , took another drink , sat still and serene studying Cameron when somebody knocked on the door . Tap . Tap . Tap . A discreet knocking . He sat there not answering it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it was , Cameron thought ; he did n't have to do that to me , except to be damned sure he had his mark burned into me . Then Kettle had yelled to the man outside , " Come back in half an hour , " and taken another very big drink from the bottle . The footsteps went down the corridor , fateful and significant , their measured sound piling higher and higher the anguish in Cameron 's mind . " Tom . . . ? " he asked . " Yes . You chose your life , " Kettle said . He was kind enough not to  --  or did n't need to  --  add , You chose mine , too . " Go on now , boy . " So I would n't forget and think sometime that what I learned was only words like other words you can qualify until their meaning is lost , Cameron thought . I le was through Veneta and into Steel City . He would be homep 346in ten minutes with Margaret , and he knew that facing her would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . So I would not forget how much things cost when I write the Mountwood book , he went on to himself . All right . If it has to be , it is worth it  --  whatever little there was to get had to be worth all it cost . If that was the price the nature of things set , you had to take it at that . For Mountwood 's pains it was only the eagle on the column that still commemmorated the idea that freedom costs everything , more than people can afford , so that only a fatal extravagance can buy it . And the reason  --  there is a reason for everything , as Kettle said  --  that he had been hooked into or baited into this last and doomed conspiracy of the summer was that it was important , when it failed , that somebody be left who had been shown once and for all the harsh alternatives  --  educated in a way that could not be wiped out or overlaid . Remember , Kettle said , what you chose when you chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everyone you have any power to choose for . All right , Cameron said to himself , he was satisfied with the way I chose , if I remember that . He did n't expect me to pass a miracle . He will be satisfied as long as I do n't forget . So now I know what I can do and what I have to do , he thought , and it occurred to him now with a kind of odd remorse that he had said good-bye to Kettle withoutsaying thanks , without having quite realized yet that he should have said thanks . Exist , he thought to himself , and there was nothing trivial in the word , but rather something substantial and hard as metal . Like the bronze eagle . Say nothing until you know . Do nothing yet . Remember . Believe . Wait.
