My Twenty Seconds in a Flying Nightmare By LT . E. V ( SKIP ) CRANGLE , USN THIS was it ! I shouted into the lip mike the international distress call : " Mayday , Mayday , Mayday ! Miramar Tower , this is Park-field Six Zero ! I have a flame-out ! Coming in for a dead-stick crash landing ! " The Panther Jet 's engine had stopped . I had a flame-out , the thing all jet pilots dread most . With all its power gone , the plane was soon sinking fast . I knew that what I did in the next few seconds would mean the difference between life and death . For the past hour this same jet had streaked all over the Southern California sky . But in a few violent seconds it had turned from a soaring dream into a sagging nightmare . Three hours earlier I had given a lecture on instrument flying at our squadron 's morning pilots ' meeting . To arouse interest in the subject , I started the talk by quoting from the Navy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week during the past year has seen the fatal crash of a naval aviator who became involved in weather flying from which he was unable to emerge successfully . " I added , " Who will it be next , you or I ? " This attempt at rhetoric came all too close to the mark , for I was to escape being " next " by the slim distance of one inch . After the morning pilots ' meeting in the ready room I fortified myself with a cup of coffee and waded into some legal paper work in the squadron 's intelligence office . One of my collateral duties was squadron legal officer . Lt. Dick Goodwin , our intelligence officer , was busy compiling the latest " hot dope " on Korea for a pilots ' lecture next morning . " How 's the coffee this morning , Skip ? " he asked , glancing up from a neat stack of combat-intelligence reports . " Lukewarm and lousy , " / replied . Dick was in charge of the coffee mess in the ready room , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee . Dick , contrary to Navy tradition , would n't touch the stuff . He maul " tamed a supply of tea . bags . It was August 22 , 1951 , the day I had marked on the calendar to send off a letter to the district attorney at Long Beach , California . One of the crew , tabbed " Archie Negative " by his shipmat0 ' had been involved in a disorderly-conduct charge there and had failed to appear in court after postiq bail . After disposing of routine correspondence , started drafting a letter to the district attorneY ' stating that " Archie Negative " had been physical1Y unable to appear in court at the scheduled time , since he was in the brig for a subsequent military offense . I had almost finished the letter when I noticed it was 1230 . I had just enough time to grab a sandwich and change into flight gear . Take-off was scheduled for 1330 . " Dick , " I said , as I started to leave , " I 'm going to put this paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as soon as I get back from my hop . " " O.K. , Skip , " Dick replied . " See you later . " I never did finish that letter . I ate my lunch and walked across the street to the locker room . It was a beautiful day for flying . The weather was CAVU ? ceiling and visibility unlimited . All the squadrons were flying heavy . Jets screamed by overhead , while others whistled down the taxi strips for take-off . The slower prop Planes putted over in less impressive patterns , and helicopters stirred up swirls of dust as they slowly edged downward to their little landing mat away from the busy field . Going into the quiet dimness of the locker room I thought of the stepped-up jet flying I would be doing in the next few months to prepare for combat . I snaked into my coverall G suit and tightened it around my legs and chest . After buckling on my Mae West life jacket , I snapped the oxygen mask onto my crash helmet and checked it for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G suit , that inflates automatically at highsPeed maneuvers , and the flashy reinforced football helmet , but all of us knew that they had saved many pilots ' lives . Dressed in my man-from-Mars regalia I went Into the line shack and signed the " yellow sheet " for Plane 60 . No gripes on it ; the plane was fueled and ready to go . Upstairs in the operations office I checked out with Ens . Stan Kramer , the duty officer , then hopped down the stairs and out to the Plane . " Parkfield Six Zero " in Smooth Take-Off SIMMONS , the plane captain , was waiting . I strapped myself into the cockpit and snapped on mY oxygen and G-suit connections ; the switches checked and the tailpipe was clear . I energized the starter and heard the engine wind up like a slow-turning muffled siren . I fed her the fuel and , with a throaty rumble , she swallowed the gas and lit up , rotating into a fast purr . I called the tower , using our squadron call , Parkfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miramar Tower , this is Parkfield Six Zero , taxi instructions , over , ' , The tower droned hack mechanically : " Parkfield Six Zero cleared to taxi , Runway Two Eight . " Simmons gave me the All Clear sign and I Started down the taxi strip , happy with the fine Weather and automatically planning my flight ahead . Stopping at the intersection of the taxiway and Runway 28 , I turned her up to full power , feeling her strain at the brakes . The gauges checked . she was raring to go . The tower cleared me for take-off and I rolled her into the slot and down the runway . The jet sucked in air and pushed me smoothly , gradually off the deck . The landing gear and flaps came up quickly . I closed the canopy , , 113'ing over the construction crews and huge bull- ' ( ) zerti at work by the end of the runway . The plane quickly picked up speed to 375 mph as I pointed her nose upward and climbed straight " head . The pretty coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below as I soared over the Pacific , ucean . I made wide climbing circles over Sail uiego and was soon at 27,000 feet , enjoying the view from Los Angeles to Mexico in one glance . I cranked in El Centro , California , on the " coffee grinder , " the radio receiver , and practiced homing Lill on their radio range . El Centro was a wonderful haven for pilots when the unpredictable Pacific fog blew in over the coastal areas . Since El Centro , with ' hi hot , dry desert air , seldom had bad weather , we ? , fret ' used it as an alternate landing field when Miramar " socked in . " I took departure over the center of San Diego . Within eleven minutes I had covered the ninety-five miles from San Diego to El Centro , flying ' Natty over the towering Laguna Mountains and the bordering desert to the rich greenness of the Imperial Valley . The air-speed indicator read 500 mph . I sat back comfortably and enjoyed the ride , making gentle turns to keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clouds passed ' swiftly below . La Mesa , California , slid under my left wing , miles below . I picked out the spot where we lived , remembering that Av , my wife , had said , " Skip , now do n't forget to bring home a head of lettuce . " I wondered what she and our two-year-old daughter Karen were doing now . The jet ate up distance smoothly and effortlessly , performing like a pilot 's dream . Over El Centro I banked her toward San Diego and ran her through some wing-overs . I dived her to nearly the speed of sound with no strain , then pulled her up into a steep climbing turn . She responded as if she loved it , shooting up like a rocket-8000 feet a minute . The Panther Jet was in her glory . Automatically , the G suit pushed air pressure against my abdomen each time I dived her down and rolled the plane from one wing-over to another . It was as easy as rocking a cradle . Yes , sir , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . The cockpit clock read 1430 , time to head back to Miramar . I was zipping along at 25,000 feet . Escondido , California , with its big white E etched on a mountainside , nestled in the hills just off my right wing . I whipped the plane around and pointed her to the field . As a standard precaution for landing I spilled the wing-tip fuel tanks . Escaping gasoline sprayed into the thin air , forming two wispy vapor trails . I checked the gauges  --  all O.K. ? retarded power , dropped my dive brakes and pushed'the plane down in a dive to the field at Miramar . From 25,000 feet it looked the size of an air-mail stamp . I was diving at 300 mph , losing 6000 feet a minute , when I began to pick up vibration , just barely perceptible at first , but now steadily increasing . I raised my dive brakes into the nose of the plane to see if the vibration would stop , but it remained . The jet is built to run as smoothly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I concluded I had " thrown a bucket " ? tossed a piece of metal off one of the engine turbine blades . The smallest piece will throw the fast-revolving turbine out of balance and set up vibration . I looked at my altimeter . I was at 7500 feet , ten miles northeast of the field . I notified the control tower : " Miramar Tower , this is Parkfield Six Zero . I have a deferred emergency , vibration in engine , request precautionary landing . " The tower came in quickly : " Roger , Parkfield Six Zero , cleared to land on Runway Two Eight . " All the years of training in simulated emergencies set my mind working automatically . I went over my emergency cockpit procedure and planned my approach . At this point there was no need to sweat . Though throwing a bucket sets up vibration , you still have power in your engine . A high approach to the runway with reduced power was my plan . The vibration was steady now and was not increasing . Had n't Paul Corrigan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it almost the same way ? I brought her over I left the flaps up  --  too much drag . The ground was closing in . I pulled back on the hard stick , slowing it down as much as I could before impact . If I could just get her over that deep ditch that ran between me and the runway , I would probably have a good chance . At least the crash crew could quickly reach me . I was still in a turn . I kept reminding myself to level the wings before hitting the ground . The stick and wings began to shake . The stall was coming . I threw my stick to the right to level the wings , and braced myself in the welcome tightness of my shoulder straps and safety belt . From this point on , there was n't a thing I could do but ride it out , hope and pray ? and pray I did . Wham ! At 140 mph six tons of hurtling jet slammed into the immovable earth , just 150 feet short of the runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced back into the air and bashed down again . It screeched and ripped across the ground . The entire nose section sheared off . My shoulders bent forward , straining against the straps . Something gave . My body jackknifed forward . My head smashed against the bottom of the instrument panel . The plane sliced along , grinding off its belly , ifs busted nose digging in t he dirt . It scraped to a violent stop just as the cockpit floor was pushing up under me . My head snapped up , then dropped to a bowed position . The plane broke in half two feet behind me . Ironically , it piled to a stop at the intersection of the taxiway and Runway 28 . This was exactly the same spot I had turned-up my engine for take-off an hour before . I felt as if I had been tossed around in a concrete mixer . Where was I ? I forced open the heavy lids over my eyes and saw the fuzzy image of the crash car barreling down the taxi strip . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God . It was good I did n't look to see where my head had hit . I had missed by an inch smashing my face into the control stick that juts up from the middle of the cockpit. floor . The stick had knifed up the right side of my crash helmet and mangled my lip microphone . The control apparently had jammed in the position I had placed it just before impact . I could just as easily have placed it an inch to the left and thus signed my death warrant . The crash helmet was a shattered shell . The beautiful plane that had stopped at this same spot before take-off an hour before was suddenly an ugly pile of twisted metal . It had gouged a path for 200 feet , shredding pieces all along the way . In a dreamy stupor I sat there sagging and bewildered in what was left . My bowed head seemed loaded down with all the blood in my body . My back was limp , but I felt no pain , just a dazed numbness . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. " I was afraid to look for blood . The danger of fire momentarily awakened me . My reflexes were clumsy and slow as I forced my left hand to turn off the fuel master switch . This deliberate action foolishly relieved my fear of fire , which so often spells doom for an injured pilot . But behind me and unseen , fuel was gushing out of the main gas tanks that had been ruptured wide open by the crash . A fire had already started . But I could only sit there , bent over and limp , too weak to move , too tired to look . I tried to snap out of the daze , but I was exhausted . I could n't straighten my back . My eyes just wanted to sleep . They finally opened to see the crash car stop a discreet distance away . It did n't strike me why . Fire trucks screeched in from all directions , surrounding the airplane and spilling out a hose-carrying bunch of running , yelling men . This was no drill . In my dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Someone shouted , " Get the pilot out of there ! It may blow up any second ! " Men were crawling above me now , grunting and groaning , risking their lives . Others threw a torrent of white foam over the plane to smother the fire . I sat there , crazily content , thinking they were needlessly worrying about a fire starting . " Do n't worry , " I weakly shouted into the noise and commotion . " I have the fuel master switch off . " Unaware of the fire , I just slumped in the cockpit and waited . I do n't think I could have got out if I had tried . My body seemed to weigh a ton . Hands darted into the cockpit , unfastened my safety belt and shoulder straps , disconnected my oxygen mask and G suit . The hands reached under my armpits and pulled me out carefully , hastily . Someone carried me away from the burning plane . " Thanks , " I said to the hands . I never did see the face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed up alongside , forcing a worried smile . He cracked , " Hey , Skip , how are you ? Still have all your teeth ? " H ? had lost some of his in a plane crash during the war . I smiled , appreciating his attemut at humor . My stupor was wearing off rapidly . I began to hear clearly and understand what people were saying . " Smitty , " with whom I had been joking an hour before in the operations office , was standing next to the car that had rushed the exec and him out to the crash . He was as white as the foam on the airplane . He stared blankly at his feet as they carried one by , afraid to look after seeing the plane . I was feeling a little silly now , and seeing such a glum expression on his downcast face , I yelled back , " What are you so sad about ? " He still did n't look or speak . The firemen eased me onto a stretcher and placed me in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wiley , the squadron flight surgeon , went over me rapidly , checking for injuries and shock . The exec asked , " Do you want me to call your wife ? " " No , " I said , picturing her on the receiving end of a phone . " She would worry too much . I 'm all right . " But he knew better than I , and called her as soon as he got back to his office . Later I was glad he did . The ambulance leaped ahead with siren screaming as Doc ripped open the left leg of my flight suit . I did n't look . I could feel the warm , sticky blood on my leg and knew it would n't be a pleasant sight . I was babbling away to Doc , " Check the oxygen system . Maybe I had anoxia . " In jets we are very oxygen-conscious , wearing the oxygen mask from the time we start our engines until we cut them off in the chocks at the end of the flight . Why that idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 was in right after the impact unconsciously reminded me of the similar heavy , drowsy feeling you have in the oxygen chamber . To teach pilots to recognize its symptoms , the Navy medicos simulate anoxia by cutting off your oxygen supply at high altitudes . It makesa lasting impression . Doc Wiley listened sympathetically as he continued to look me over . I rattled on now , mentioning how sluggishly heavy the controls were without hydraulic boost . Then I began to worry whether I had done a good job . All pilots take pride in their flying ability , and I was no exception . Hearing and reading about other pilots ' crashes and aircraft emergencies , I had often wondered what I would do if confronted with their problems . I always hoped that I would stay calm and not pull the " panic switch , " that I would follow the correct emergency procedures , quickly make a sound decision and stick to it . This is what I had tried to do , but now I wondered if I could not have done better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensary emergency entrance . The stretcher-bearers whisked me by a gaping hunch of corpsmen and onlookers to the examining room . To me they looked stupidly surprised to see the pilot alive after a crash landing in a jet . I had got on a laughing jag now , but it was quickly followed by a mood of silence . I had little control of thoughts , speech or moods . Someone handed me a lit cigarette and a phone . One of the figures in white dialed Scotty 's phone number for me . The Scotts lived across the street from us in La Mesa . We had lived out there only four months and had n't been able , as yet , to get a telephone . But the line was busy , and I was actually relieved . Having little control over my emotions , I was afraid that I would make a fool of myself when I heard Av 's voice and tried to explain what happened . Yes , it would be better for someone else to tell her . Commander Rieder , the senior flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal doses of morphine and penicillin . Commander " Sandy " Crews , the squadron CO , sped in and asked anxiously how I was . I shall never forget his drawn face or the sudden sigh of relief when he saw me . Veteran aviators like the skipper , though they have seen many a crash in war and peace , can never become indifferent to them . Seeing him , I muttered , " I 'm sorry , captain , for piling it up . " " Forget it , Skip , " he replied . " We can always get another plane . Are you all right ? That 's what counts . " They shoved me into the operating room . Commander Rieder was soon stitching up my right thigh .. I felt him push in the exposed muscle as he started to work . Still under shock , I was keeping up a constant stream of chatter , intentionally looking the other way while the commander worked quickly and silently with his needle . From the adjoining room I heard the deep voice of the commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How 's the pilot ? " " The pilot will be all right , captain , " Commander Rieder replied , not dropping a stitch . The pilot will be all right . I repeated it to myself . It was an unqualified statement , and it was music to my ears . I thought of all the people who in a short space of time had worked feverishly , some risking their lives , for my safety . Half sensible as I was , I felt proud and appreciative of their efficient teamwork . As the doctor methodically sewed away , I was surprised to feel no pain but just an over-all numbness . He must be quite a craftsman , I thought . Forgetting the difference in rank , I complimented him , " Doctor , you should have been a tailor . I 'm not feeling a thing . " I sneaked a glance toward him as he pulled a stitch tight . He grinned slightly , continuing with his job . Presently the doctor straightened up , his stitching completed , and instructed the waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried technician was waiting for me . He helped in easing me on to the slab , and was soon hurriedly shooting me from all angles . Lt. ( jg ) Fritz Smith , a squadron buddy , walked in , looking like a pallbearer at his brother 's funeral . He was getting married a week from Saturday and had asked me to be best man . " Fritz , " I said , " it looks like you will have to get another best man . I do n't think I 'll be able to make it . " He tried to smile , and said , " Av and Karen are outside , Skip . Do you want to see them now ? " I nodded , " Yes , please . " As my wife and little daughter walked in , a hard lump suddenly wedged in my throat as I thought of how close I had come to never seeing them again . I never had appreciated my family more than I did in that moment . Av stood there acting brave and straining a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays showed later I had fractured three vertebrae . I was smiling again as I passed by inquiring pilots from the squadron lined up in the passageway . I was trying desperately to keep up a gay front , for I could feel the emotion piling up inside . The solicitous corpsmen slipped me into the bed , and as they left and Av came in , all the pent-up emotion inside me broke through in a flood of tears . It had to come out . It was soon all over . Then , for the first time since the flame-out , my fired-up brain and body relaxed . Another shot in the arm and I lay quiet and drowsy . It was all over . I wondered how long it would be before I would be flying again . As I fell into drugged sleep , I fervently whispered thanks to God .
