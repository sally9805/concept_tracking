CALIFORNIA From his plush apartment in Sacramento 's Hotel Senator across the street from the State Capitol , mountainous ( 300 Ib . ) Arthur H. Samish , 56 , has directed one of the most effective lobbying operations of modern times . " I 'm the governor of the legislature ; to hell with the governor of California , " good-humored " Artie " Samish liked to say . When Earl Warren was governor , he agreed , saying , " On matters that affect his clients , Artie unquestionably has more power than the governor . " <P> Artie 's clients from time to time have included some of California 's beer , liquor , cigarette , motor bus , trucking and railroad companies ; some race tracks , banks and mortgage firms . Samish was once credited with " owning " 30 of the state 's 80 legislators , with electing a California attorney general and a mayor of San Francisco , and with dictating the selection of several state assembly speakers and the entire membership of the two legislative committees which concern him most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no state cigarette tax and no other state has a lower liquor or beer tax . Artie used his clients ' slush funds , e.g. , $150,000 a year from the brewers alone , for campaign advertising on behalf of his legislative candidates . Sometimes he backed two or more candidates in the same race just to make sure he was riding a winner . <P> Lobbyist Samish was seldom seen in the Capitol itself . He kept voluminously informed through an intelligence network , made up of stenographers , clerks , politicians , businessmen , gamblers , gangsters and high state officials . Sometimes Artie mischievously dropped in at a legislative committee meeting in which he had no direct interest . Thereafter he was likely to get the credit for anything the committee might accomplish . <P> Since the day Artie Samish made his first million , at 32 , commissions and contingent fees have steadily swelled his personal affluence . But a major setback came in 1951 when the Kefauver committee called nationwide attention to his activities . Last month a federal court convicted Samish of income-tax evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a $120,000 commission from the Biow Co. , a New York advertising agency . The money , payment for Samish 's services in landing the Schenley Distillers ' account , was remitted in checks drawn to ex-prize fighters , bookies , friends and relatives of Samish , and even to fictitious persons . Last week Federal Judge Oliver D. Hamlin imposed a fine of $40,000 and a three-year jail term on Artie Samish . Still pending : the Government 's claim against him for $908,983 in back taxes and penalties .
