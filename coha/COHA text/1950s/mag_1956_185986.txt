At Washington National Airport this week , an ear-tingling ig-gun salute heralded the arrival of the man who fitfully straddles the chasm between the Soviet 's open cynicism and the Western world 's open hand . Jawaharlal Nehru , idolized leader of India 's millions and to many minds the spokesman for the yearnings ( as well as fiery passions ) of most Asians and Africans , had come at Dwight Eisenbower 's invitation for his first visit to the U.S. since 1949 . <P> Escorted to the White House by Vice President Richard Nixon , Nehru , dressed in his customary achkan , high-buttoned coat and salwars ( jodhpur-like trousers ) , jauntily shook hands with Mamie and the President . Said Ike , just back from an 18-day vacation : " It 's a privilege and an honor to welcome you to this land-to this house .

A political name in her own right , she is a member of the topflight working committee of India 's big Congress Party , and only woman member - by an overwhelming vote-of the party 's <P> Central Elections Committee .

Like him , she has served time in jail for political agitation against the British , as did her husband , Lawyer-Newspaper Executive-Member of Parliament Feroze Gandhi ( no kin to Mohandas ) . Also like her father , she avoids religious orthodoxy , once explained : " I do n't believe in temples , churches or mosques , but one should have an aim in life which is above one 's personal needs or desires .
