txt " If we try to compete with the Russians by appointing czars , we 're fighting the wrong Russians . If Boston public officials think they can turn the question of teaching science in the public schools over to a science director or a central high school and then forget about the problem , they will be making only about half the advance on this front that they should . " This sharp comment by a leading university ? educator in the Boston area purposely exaggerates the danger that may befall such plans as were - put forward yesterday by the Boston City Council and School Committee . It mirrors the comments of other professional educators in the area who welcomed the interest of the two public bodies in natural science education but said that such interest in the ' cause of education must be sustained  --  not be just a matter of momentary political expediency . Yesterday 's moves ? by the council and school committee were these : Councilor Edward . F. , Jr .. introduced A resolution calling for " a cornChristian Science Monitor plete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught . in Boston high school ; and for a School Committee study of " the advisability of establishing a central high school devoted primarily to the teaching of scientific courses . " Boston School Committee Chairman John P. last night requested Superintendent Dennis C. Haley to consider the need for a coordinator of natural science instruction at all levels in the city 's Public schools . Dr. Haley has since reported that he approves the idea . Several education specialists at local universities agreed today that the coordinator was the more promising and feasible of the two ideas . One noted university dean called the  --  school committee plan " good sense " and observed that there is " a good deal to be said for a policy coordinator not only in science but other educational fields . " He said , however , that adding a new specialty high school " every time there is a new menace ? and goodness knows I am not underestimating the current  --  crisis ? would only litter the landscape with high schools like hot-dog stands .
