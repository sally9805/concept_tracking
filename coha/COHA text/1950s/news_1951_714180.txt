Mr. Siskind said he purchased twenty-three case with potential fees of more than $400,000 , from Mr. Boyle . The transaction was effected , Mr. Siskind testified , without a contract , signed agreement or note , and without setting rates of payment or deadline for clearance of debt . There was no provision that would apply in case of Mr. Siskind 's death or for Mr. Boyle 's eventual return to law practice , Mr. Siskind said . The agreement was made , Mr. Siskind said , immediately after Mr. Boyle went on the payroll of the Democratic committee as executive vice chairman on April 20 , 1949 . It was not dated , he said , and the only documents consisted of a main work sheet and numerous scraps of paper on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long a volunteer worker at the Democratic National headquarters here , assumed the executive vice chairmanship of the National Committee on a nonsalaried basis on Feb. 8 , 1949 .

To date , Mr. Siskind testified , he ' load paid Mr. Boyle $99,268.71 , eaving a balance of $50,731.29 . At the outset of the hearing , Mr. giskind read a statement presentng his story of his dealings with tr . Boyle . Tonight , under questioning , he admitted that Samuel 3rightman , assistant director of mblicity for the Democratic Naional Committee , at his request // " as a long-time friend , " had helped him prepare the statement . Senator Richard M. Nixon , Republican of California , a subcommittee member , said during one of many stormy exchanges that it appeared from the testimony that the agreement was not one for the sale of a law practice but a subterfuge for continued participation by Mr. Boyle in the practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator Clyde R. Hoey , Democrat of North Carolina and subcommittee chairman , ordered Mr. Siskind to identify the clients involved in the twenty-three cases . Mr. Siskind argued , against this , pleading that the order would subject the clients to " unwarranted publicity . " " There has been no wrongdoing by them , " Mr. Siskind shouted . " Why should they be subjected to the headlines ? " " There are implications of wrongdoing , " said Senator John L. McClellan , Democrat of Arkansas , and chairman of the Expenditures Committee , of which the investigating panel is a unit . " By whom ? " Mr. Siskind asked . The subcommittee did not enforce the order immediately . Later , it met in closed session and decided unanimously that Mr. Siskind be required to identify the clients in cases that concerned dealings with the Government . Subcommittee Insists " We have no desire , " Mr. Hoey said , " to violate confidences or inquire into cases of a purely private nature . We do , however , believe ' it to be our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to in cases involving the public interest . " " This , " Mr. Siskind said , " would violate every code of ethics under which I have practiced for twentyfour years . " He urged that the identifications be " narrowed down , " that cases completed , except for full payment of fees , be omitted . The subcommittee insisted and called a night session to receive Mr. Siskind 's identifications and answers to questions concerning ' the cases . At the night session , Mr. Siskind spent two hours answering in detail questions asked by the committee . In all of the cases that concerned Government matters , he identified the clients , told about the cases and their disposition and checked back on the fees and collections involved . Senator Hoey thanked him for his cooperation . Mr. Siskind previously had made his income tax returns for periods covered by payments to Mr. Boyle available to the subcommittee . Members asked for the returns of Mr. Boyle also . Francis D. Flanagan , chief counsel of the subcommittee , said he had requested Mr. Boyle to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done so as yet . Senator Nixon proposed that if Mr. Boyle 's returns were not made available voluntarily , steps be taken by the investigating group to obtain them by subpoena . The payments to Mr. Boyle , totaling $24,500 in 1949 , $55,500 in 1950 , and the rest of the $99,000 this year , were listed , for tax purposes as " forwarding fees , " or fees split between attorneys . Mr. Siskind said he presumed , but did not know , that Mr. Boyle had listed his receipts from the payments as income . Otherwise , he contended , Mr. Boyle would have been required to pay taxes on the ' whole of the $150,000 " before he received it . " Under principal investigation was whether Mr. Boyle , as an executive vice chairman or chairman of the Democratic Committee , had influenced the authorization of three loans totaling $645.000 by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ' to the American Lithofold Corporation , a St. Louis printing concern , in 1949 . Mr. Boyle was Washington attorney for this company from Feb. 1 , 1949 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave up this account it was turned over to Mr. Siskind . The retaining fee was $500 a month . Mr. Siskind has received thus far some $14,500 in fees . He conceded under questioning that he never had had a case that required less work . Since taking over , he said , he had handled two minor matters for the company . Mr. Boyle , Mr. Siskind said , suspended his law practice in April of 1949 . He Mr. Siskind took over the Lithofold account through Cecil A. Green , Washington reprecited as being involved in the $150,000 settlement . " No one can sell a retainer , " Mr. Siskind explained . Mr. Siskind swore that he never had been requested by Lithofold to perform any legal services in connection with the R. F. C. loans , to represent the company in any Government cases , or to solicit procurement contracts from the Government . Mr. Boyle , Mr. Siskind testified , never participated in any of the fees that he Mr. Siskind had received from Lithofold , never participated in any legislative activity for Lithofold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Mr. Siskind was engaged . Mr. Siskind said he never had been Mr. Boyle 's law partner . They shared offices and cases , he explained , but only as associates . When they got together for Mr. Boyle 's suspension of practice , Mr. Siskind asserted , they found six cases that had been completed , but on which fees had not been paid fully . These cases had a potential final fee value of $56,000 , Mr. Siskind testified . Seventeen cases in various stages of progress were estimated to have a fee value of $354,000 , he said . This brought the total to $410,000 . Later , in going through a listing of the cases , identified by numbers instead of by clients , Mr. Flanagan found the estimated total to be about $432,500 . Most of the cases involved matters with some department or agency of the Government . They included two R. F. C. loans involving about $400,000 each , planting acreages under the Department of Agriculture , claims against the Government , a bank loan for foreign Government , sales of surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post Office Department , Government housing and tax matters . Included also were cases involving a violation of the War Production Board construction limitations , mislabeling of food under the Food and Drug Act , a disputed lease over War Assets Administration property , a claim against the Chinese Nationalist Government , a violation of the Federal lottery law and a case involving purchase by veterans of a cooperative housing project . A Few Cases Left Blank For some of the cases Mr. Siskind originally had provided only sketchy information . A few cases were left blank and unexplained . Tonight Mr. Siskind filled in the gaps . The missing data , so far as it involved cases " of public interest , " was what the subcommittee sought tonight . Case No. 16 , involving a $50,000 fee , called for a retainer of $650 a month . To date , the record showed , fees had . run to $34,000 . This , Mr. Siskind explained , was one of Mr. Boyle 's former cases that was still pending . The subcommittee sought to find out why Mr. Siskind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement under the $150,000 agreement , and not the Lithofold retainer fee , which had been paid , at different times , to both of them . Mr. Siskind said the railroad retainer fee case had been reported because the case was still pending . No case involving Lithofold was pending , he stated . Besides , he said , Mr. Boyle had never told him about being the Washington attorney for Lithofold . " Of course there was no Lithofold case pending , " interjected Senator Nixon . " The case was over . Lithofold had obtained its R. F. C. loan . " Attorney Protests Mr. Siskind protested that Mr. Nixon had drawn an assumption that was not founded on fact or evidence . The questioning indicated suspicion that Mr. Boyle 's entire law practice had not been turned over to Mr. Siskind . It had , Mr. Siskind said , to the best of his knowledge . Throughout the day committee members questioned the witness about the lack of contract , note or other formal business transaction papers in the settlement for $150,000 . Some subcommittee members asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow worksheet " and other papers upon which the agreement was reached be produced for inspection , No decision had been made tonight whether these papers would be demanded . sentative of the company , even while semi-monthly checks for $250 each were being written for Mr. Boyle . The first check arriving after Mr. Boyle went on the Democratic Committee payroll was endorse dby him and turned over to Mr. Siskind . The first intimation he had that Mr. Boyle had been an attorney for Lithofold , Mr. Siskind said , was when he received the check made out to his law associate . He said he asked no questions . The Lithofold account was not included among the twenty-three cases .
