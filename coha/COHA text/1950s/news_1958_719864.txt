txt A former Army official said today that he had protested vigorously last year against " pressure " in an Army contract case that involved Sherman Adams . Roswell M. Austin , who retired last September as a member of the armed services Board of Contract Appeals , said he had written a " hot memorandum " against " unethical conduct " in the case turned up by Congressional investigators . The communication that " sparked my resentment , " he , said , was a letter from Mr. Adams asking for information and enclosing a letter from someone either connected with or familiar with a New England textile company . The enclosed letter , he said , asked " help " from the Assistant to President Eisenhower . Concern Was Penalized The letters dealt with the now defunct Raylaine Worsted , Inc. , of Manchester , N. H. , which was penalized nearly $80,000 for late delivery on wartime cloth contracts but got back $41,284.21 last year on one contract . Mr. Austin also said there had been a letter from a " member of Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Austin said that as far as he knew there had been nothing questionable about the final decision although he did not participate in it . His only participation was in a decision to reopen the case . The final ) decision granting the company 's appeal was made Nov. 27 of last year . Mr. Austin retired Sept. 30 . Col. Joseph A. Avery , president of the contract appeals board , declined to comment " at , this time . " Hearings Start Monday Mr. Austin was interviewed by telephone at his home in near-by Chevy Chase , Md . Colonel Avery talked from his home in near-by Arlington , Va . A House Armed Services subcommittee will hold closed ) hearings Monday On the case . It was first disclosed by the Special House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight , which was investigating Bernard Goldfine and his relations with Mr. Adams and Federal regulatory agencies . The District of Columbia police announced today an arrest ) in one phase of the New England industrialist 's case , that of the alleged theft of Goldfine papers from a Sheraton-Carlton Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson Watter , 33-year-old cashier at tile- hotel . He was held under $1,000 ? bond and waived a preliminary hearing until - he had consulted a lawyer . He was charged with housebreaking , Specifically , he was accused of entering Room .842 of the hotel between the nights of July 3 and July 8 . Mr. Goldfine 's bookkeeper , Miss Mildred Paperman , reported the theft of papers on Monday , July 7 . She had spent the Fourth of July week-end in Boston and returned Sunday night . At midnight , the chief investigator of the subcommittee was caught with a microphone and recording apparatus in a room adjacent to an eighthfloor suite of Jack Lotto , Mr. Goldfine 's public relations adviser . The chief investigator , Baron I. Shacklette , was found in the room with Jack Anderson , an employe of Drew Pearson , newspaper columnist . Mr. Shacklette was dismissed by the House panel . He had been investigating alleged wire-tapping of subcommittee members ' telephones . Mr. Goldfine flew home to Boston today . He was bid goodbye at the Steller Hotel by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created in the bizarre case . Mrs. Goldfine said " certainly " when asked if she and her husband had been to the Adams ' house last night . Mr. Lotto added that the Goldfines had had dinner with the Adamseg . But at the White House , James C. Hagerty , press secretary , said the dinner story was not true . He : observed that " there is something very mysterious in the reports " of the dinner . He said Mr. Adams had declared " he did not have dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Goldfine and they were not at his home . " Mrs. Goldfine said  --  and Mr. Hagerty confirmed  --  that she and Mrs. Adams had talked and lunched together since the hearings began . In the Raylaine case , Representative F. Edward Hebert , Democrat of Louisiana , said he had ordered subpoenaes issued for " half a dozen " witnesses to appear before his Armed Services special investigating subcommittee . He declined to identify the witnesses but said they did not include Mr. Adams . He said he had ordered the closed hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of testimony that tended to defame , degrade or incriminate anyone . This was a point raised by Mr. Goldfine 's lawyers in the investigation of whether Mr. Adams had influenced the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission . Mr. Hebert said he had not yet decided whether public hearings would be held after the executive sessions . Mr. Austin said he first had learned of the letters from Mr. Adams about April , 1957 . Mr. Adams ' letter was addressed to the Army Chief of Staff , Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor . It asked for information and a draft of a reply . Mr. Austin , 70 years old , is a brother of Warren R. Austin , former Republican Senator from Vermont and former Ambassador to the United Nations . The letters , Mr. Austin said , were brought to him by Col. C. Robert Bard , who later wrote the decision awarding the company $41,284.21 . Colonel Bard , he went on , replied and told- Mr. Adams that a decision " might be expected in thirty days . " " There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House was interested in the case , " he said . " And there was interest on the part of a member of Congress . He also wrote a letter . " " Around the board members would pop off and say ' the White House is interested , we should n't say too much ' and that 's what annoyed me , " he explained , He recalled having " cautioned other board members to use their own individual judgment in the case " and not be " influenced by anything outside . He said he did not remember the name signed to the letter sent along by Mr. Adams , but that he could not recall having even seen a similar letter attached to any other request for information from the White House , members of Congress or from other officials . " It was unusual , " he commented . . The Adams letter asking for information and a draft of a reply , he said , was " an innocuous thing " but the other letter from either a Raylaine official or one of " Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorandum , and attach it to the draft of the suggested reply requested by Mr. Adams . He said he could not recall exactly what he had written but " I think I made the remark that it appeared there was a growing sentiment to permit reconsideration of this old ' case and that If this , , , was beciuse ? of pressure I thought it extremely unethical . " He added that " some of the board members felt the same ; way . " Thei. - seconCletter , I he said , was ' fordirectshelr fiorn , Mr. Adams . " I - Considered this , was one of . , those influence matters , " Mr. He said he has agreed with the other ' members of the board that Alie , attorney " for the company should . be heard in a new a.ppeal . for reconsideration , of the , penalty . The governingfactor in this decision , he said , was the fact the . Controller General of the United States , Joseph Campbell , had rescinded a 1942 order upholding the penalty . The decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was approved by sixteen of the then nineteen members of the normally twenty-one-member board . One member was on leave and the other two did not participate . Stilt unexplained in the complex case is the differences between the penalty the company first sought to have removed and the amounts later involved . In 1942 the company ? was charged with so-called " liquidated damages " of $49,784.74 . This is the amount deducted from the contract for late delivery of the woolen cloth . But , according to the General Accounting Office , the company had " protested " only $25,462 . The armed services Contract Board of Appeals considered the $49,784.74 . It upheld a penalty of $8,500.53 , which had been made on the contract up until July 30 , 1941 , for late delivery . This was ' deducted from the $49,784.74 to make the final damages returned to the company as $41,284.21 . In 1950 , the company filed a petition in the United Stated Court of Claims ? to recover a total of $79,086.95 representing net losses it contended had been sustained on several contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under investigation . The Court dismissed the company 's petition in December of 1956 . In January of last year the company moved for a correction in the findings of fact . This motion still is pending .
