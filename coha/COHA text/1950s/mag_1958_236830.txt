In a Prague court last week , a Czechoslovak entrepreneur named Roman Novotny drew a stiff sentence of 4 years in prison and forfeiture of all his property for engaging in one of the most profitable - and widely practiced-businesses behind the Iron Curtain .

The price of 90,000 zlotys ( $22,500 at the official rate of exchange ) for a new Warszawa represents 250 weeks ' work for a Pole . Hungarians , Bulgarians and Rumanians , who manufacture no cars of their own , must set their sights on imported Russian Pobedas , which cost them the equivalent of from 130 weeks ' work to 750 weeks ' work ( in Rumania ) , depending on the currency .
