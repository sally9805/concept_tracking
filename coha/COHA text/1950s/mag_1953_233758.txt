In his Carmel , N.Y . studio one winter morning in 1939 , a harried artist packed a portrait into his station wagon and headed for Manhattan . As the car slithered down the slippery lane , one of the doors jounced open and snagged a roadside pine . The door was left behind dangling on the tree as the car sped on . <P> Thus did Ernest Hamlin Baker hurry to deliver his first TIME cover portrait : Poland 's Statesman-Pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski ( TIME , Feb. 27 , 1939 ) . Artist Baker , who had done some previous work for FORTUNE , had been given just 48 hours to turn in the rush assignment . He made the deadline , and has been doing TIME covers ever since . So far , he has done an impressive total of 347 portraits for TIME . Since so many of you have written to tell me how much you liked Baker 's portraits , I asked him to tell us something about himself and his work . <P> His first ambition , says Baker , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , where he made pocket money by selling caricatures of the faculty , the Poughkeepsie Evening Enterprise hired him as a $21-a-week cartoonist . The next year Baker married , borrowed $500 , and took his bride to New York City where he enrolled for evening classes in an industrial art school . This was a mistake , he says . " I lost confidence in myself and got so scared I quit after three months . " He decided to go out and simply draw . <P> Baker 's decision that he was his own best teacher proved to be correct . With his wife Ernestine acting as his agent , commissions began to come in . It was a series of profile illustrations for The New Yorker magazine that caught the eye of FORTUNE 's art editor and eventually brought TIME and Baker together . <P> It was with Baker 's first cover that TIME started its unique portraiture reporting , a technique in which the artist works entirely from photographs . Says Baker : " Having the subject sit through many poses would be impractical both for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so newsworthy . For each assignment the artist is given a basic photograph of his subject plus ten to 30 other pictures which furnish supplementary data on head construction , facial forms and expressions revealed by the different camera angles and lighting . I have searched thousands of photographs for facial forms , from bony structure and musculature , through talebearing wrinkles down to skin texture . I have found that this detached objective exploration of a person 's features brings forth the subject 's appearance and his character with surprising fidelity . ' ' <P> Although the finished cover portraits are the property of the artist , TIME occasionally buys the original to present to the subject . So far , 105 people own original Baker portraits , 16 bought directly from the artist and 89 presented by TIME . The latest subject to receive his original portrait was U.S. Atom Boss Lewis Strauss ( TIME . Sept. 21 ) , who wrote recently to say that he considered himself highly flattered by Artist Baker 's work .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
