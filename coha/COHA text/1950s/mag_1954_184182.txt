THE PRIVATE DIARIES OF STENDHAL ( 570 pp. ) - Edited and Translated by Robert Sage-Doubleday ( $7.50 ) . <P> <P> Poor Henri Beyle ! He had no looks , no money , no social status , not even a good job . All he had was genius . But at 18 , Henri Beyle was the only one who knew it , and not even he could be sure . He had just left his native Grenoble on what was to become a lifelong journey devoted to la chasse au bonheur-the pursuit of happiness-and the first stop was Milan , where young Beyle served as a sublieutenant in Napoleon 's army of occupation . Ambitious , hot-blooded Henri knew exactly what he wanted to be : " the successor of Molire " and " a seducer of women . " <P> Unfortunately , he had no knack for rhymed comedy and little gift for seduction , but that did not stop him from trying . To drive himself on , he noted tactical maneuvers with military precision , e.g. , the sneak attack camouflaged by an embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy whimpering ( noted Henri : " If you go about the business calmly , you ca n't fail " ) . He also jotted down guiding principles : " Heroes have intervals of fear , poltroons moments of bravery , and virtuous women moments of weakness . " But the weak moments came when Henri was not about and his amorous success consisted in courting the daughter of a household and being bedded by the mother , in falling into the arms of women he did n't love while dreaming of those he did . As a lover , he embraced compromises , but not as a writer : he would contemplate nothing less than the accolade of eternity and rejected two " fine subjects " for plays " as incapable of enduring more than 200 years . " <P> Nonetheless , the youth who later adopted the pen name Stendhal and became one of the world 's great novelists once deigned to write something not for the ages , but for himself . The result is something for the ages . It is the famous Journal , finally translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written . <P> Analyst v. Butterfly . This extraordinary diary is Henri Beyle 's completely candid dialogue with himself between 1801 and 1814 , from the age of 18 to 31 . Diarist Beyle permitted himself no second thoughts , following his own basic rule " not to stand on ceremony and never to erase . " He put it down simply , quickly , directly , without ornamentation , racing on the wing of the event , often dashing off notations in telegraphic French and dotting it with unlikely Italian and improbable English ( " She did can well perform and not be applaused " ) . Diarist Beyle 's spontaneous self-communion is raw , inchoate , crackling with vitality , sometimes overdetailed , often brilliantly illuminating .
