In his 22 years of writing and editing , Wilder Hobson , 44 , has specialized in the good things of life . Long a member of the staffs of TIME and FORTUNE ( off &; on from 1928 to 1949 ) , he is an enthusiastic judge of such high-priced consumer goods as yachts , racing cars and evening gowns ( none of which he owns ) , is also a trombone-playing musicologist ( American Jazz Music ) and novelist ( All Summer Long ) . <P> Last week Yaleman Hobson moved into a job well calculated to suit a carriage-trade taste . He became managing editor of Harper 's Bazaar ( circ. 340,605 ) , Sanhedrin of the high-fashion world . Hobson replaces Frances MacFadden , who retired after 18 years in the post . As the new M.E. , Hobson will be chiefly concerned with Bazaar 's non-fashion articles . But he will also read fashion copy and make criticisms from a man 's point of view . Explained Editor Carmel Snow : " I think a man is terribly good for woman editors-I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fashion magazine . " <P> Hobson put it somewhat differently . Said he : " My connection with the fashion operation of Harper 's Bazaar is at best gossamer . However , at what Cole Porter has described as the charming age of puberty , I ceased drawing racing automobiles and began to draw women , with equal detail , and with what I like to think was even more combustible effect .
