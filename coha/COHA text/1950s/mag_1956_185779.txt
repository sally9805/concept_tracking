In the sleepy corn-and-cotton hamlet of Coyolito , near El Salvador 's Pacific coast , last week 's big soccer match promised special excitement . Aside from their sporting rivalry , Captain Jesus Rivera of the local sport club and Ricardo Ayala , captain of a team of workmen from the nearby railroad , were mortal enemies in private life . When they trotted onto the field , both were wearing unusual football equipment : long-barreled pistols . <P> Keyed up by corn liquor , the crowd watched the scoreless game tensely until the referee made a disputed decision : seconds later the pistols were drawn and machete-swinging spectators poured onto the field . In 20 minutes six were dead and six seriously injured . Police restored order , but the game could not go on . Rivera had been hacked to death and Ayala severely wounded by gunfire .
