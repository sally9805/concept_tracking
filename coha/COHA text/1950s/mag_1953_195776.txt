The annual report for 1952 showed a deficit of $5,509,434 , worst in the company 's 64-year history . No dividends have been paid on common or preferred stocks since last fall . Last week the stockholders finally heard what sounded like good news : control of the company was being bought by Philadelphia 's Bankers Securities Corp. , headed by Albert M. Greenfield , who has made a specialty of buying sick companies and making them well . <P> The deal involved the sale of approximately 200,000 shares ( out of 513444 outstanding ) , at an estimated price of $900,000 , by Johnson 's widow and son , C. F. H. Johnson Jr. , who succeeded his father as Botany 's head . At that price , control of Botany seemed a bargain , even though it is short of working capital . It has up-to-date plants and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers of " Botany Brand 500 " suits . Daroff agreed to buy 15 million yards of woolens at a cost of approximately $75 million . <P> Greenfield is still president of Albert M. Greenfield &; Co. , the realty firm which started him on his way in big business . His Bankers Securities Corp . also controls Loft Candy Corp. , Hoving Corp . ( Bonwit Teller ) , seven Philadelphia hotels and City Stores Co. , ( twelve stores ) . As if to show that one big transaction a week was an inadequate measure of his talents , Greenfield also announced a $4,000,000 modernization program for his Bellevue-Stratford Hotel .
