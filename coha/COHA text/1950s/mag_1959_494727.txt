Some of you , students of Columbia University , have written me , commenting on an article on the Van Doren case which was published in the New York Times Magazine of November 22 . Since the letters either raise identical points or express the same general philosophic position , I am addressing their writers collectively . By doing this in public , I am establishing already an important difference between your and my position . For all of you request that , if I should write on this topic again , I not reveal your names ( incidentally , the only anonymous letter printed in the New York Times Magazine under the title " More Reaction to the Van Doren Reaction " is signed by " Columbia , ' 63 " ) ; and one of you asks that the content of his letter not be revealed either . You appear to shun the public debate of public issues and prefer to drop your opinions into the confidential darkness of the mailbox . I believe that in a democracy which still possesses vitality , public issues must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , heard and counted in the interchange of ideas and in the interplay of interests , out of which a new national consensus will arise . Your letters are courteous , decent , intelligent , literate and moving in their concern about the moral problem and their anxiety to be on the right side of it . The opinions you express are eminently respectable and even conformist to a fault . You say what almost everybody says and you say it better and with greater erudition than most , but there is not a rebel among you . The only deviation which you allow yourselves is a criticism of the trustees of your University for having acted hastily in accepting Van Doren 's resignation ; but that indiscretion you had already committed when you signed the petition asking that Van Doren be rehired . And this demonstration , which looks like rebellion against the authorities of your University , is in truth but the risk-less articulation of the majority opinion . If your letters were published and the identity of the writers revealed , it is inconceivable that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to be ashamed of , you have violated none of the mores of society , and you have much to be proud of by way of intellectual accomplishment and moral aspiration . Why then , are you afraid ? I will tell you what frightens you . You are afraid of your shadows in the sunlight . You are afraid of the sound of your voices in the silence of the crowd . You are afraid of yourself . You are afraid to speak what is on everybody 's lips as long as it is only you who would speak . Only when your voices merge into the chorus of the mass do you cease to be afraid . It is the protective anonymity of the crowd which gives you courage . To sign a petition in the company of 65o of your fellows , then , is one thing ; to speak without assurance that you are not alone is quite another . But imagine for a moment where man would be if his most intelligent , best educated , and most secure children had throughout history hidden their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose lives and works you study are remembered exactly because they were not anonymous , because they showed their faces above the crowd and spoke in a loud voice all by themselves . What they spoke was more often than not the opposite of what the crowd believed and wanted to hear , and many of them lived in prison or in exile and died in disgrace or on the cross . Have you ever heard of two German students by the name of Huber , brother and sister , who openly defied Hitler in the University of Munich and were hanged ? Do you not remember the Hungarian , East German , Polish and even Russian students who risked everything for their convictions and many of whom paid for them with their freedom and their lives ? And you , risking nothing at all , refuse to speak above an anonymous whisper ! Why are you so frightened by your own faces and your own voices ? The answer to that question will become clear at the end of this letter ; for it is intimately connected with the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stung by my assertion that you are unaware of the moral problem posed by the Van Doren case , and you assure me that you disapprove of his conduct . But my point is proved by the very arguments with which DECEMBER 21 , 1959 you try to reconcile your disapproval of Van Doren 's conduct with your petition to rehire him . The issue is for you confined in a three-cornered relationship among Van Doren , yourself , and Columbia University .. Your concern is primarily with the misfortune of an attractive teacher , your regret in losing him , and the rigor of the University 's decision . You support your position by five main arguments : the confession has swept the slate clean , Van Doren will not do it again , his teaching was above reproach , academic teaching is not concerned with substantive truth , and the University acted with undue haste . These arguments , taken at face value and erected into general principles of conduct , lead of necessity to the complete destruction of morality . If confession , especially one which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by free moral choice but extracted by sheer necessity , can undo the deed , no evil could ever be condemned and no evil-doer ever be brought to justice . If wrong could be so simply righted and guilt so painlessly atoned , the very distinction between right and wrong , innocence and guilt would disappear ; for no sooner would a wrong be committed than it would be blotted out by a confession . Confession , even if it is freely rendered as an act of contrition and moral conversion , can mitigate the guilt but can not wipe it out . The argument that the morally objectionable act is not likely to be repeated assumes that the purpose of moral condemnation is entirely pragmatic , seeking to prevent a repetition of the deed ; if what has been done once is not likely to be done again we might as well forget it . Yet while it is true that according to the common law a dog is entitled to his first bite , it is nowhere written that a man is entitled to his first murder , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is not a utilitarian instrument aiming at the protection of society , even though its observance has this effect , but its commands are absolute and must be obeyed for their own sake . Oedipus did not think that it was all right to marry his mother once since he did not do it again . Or would you suggest that evildoers like Leopold and Loeb should have gone free because it was most unlikely that they would repeat what they had done ? Guardian of a Permanent Treasure The arguments of the good teacher and of teaching not being concerned with substantive truth go together . You assume , and some of your academic experiences may well support your assumption , that the teacher is a kind of intellectual mechanic who fills your head with conventionally approved and required knowledge , as a filling station attendant fills a tank with gas . You do n't care what the teacher does from io a.m. to 9 a.m. so long as he gives you from 9 to 10 a.m. the knowledge which he has been paid to transmit . You recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and his way of transmitting knowledge , because you do not recognize an organic relation between transmitted knowledge and an objective , immutable truth . Yet the view that knowledge is but conventional ? one conception of truth to be superseded by another ? while seemingly supported by the radical transformations of physics , finds no support in the fields of knowledge dealing with man . If it were otherwise , Plato and Aristotle , Sophocles and Shakespeare , Montesquieu and Locke , Jefferson and Lincoln could mean nothing to us , except as objects for antiquarian exploration . There is , then , in these fields an accumulation of knowledge , old knowledge being refined and added to , but not necessarily superseded , by new insights . The teacher of such knowledge is not only the recorder and transmitter of what goes by the name of knowledge in a particular time and place , but he is also and foremost the guardian and augmentor of a permanent treasure . This is not a part-time job to be performed during certain hours without relation with what goes on before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profession which requires the dedication and ethos of the whole man . Of such a man , it must be expected that he be truthful not only between 9 and To a.m. when he teaches , but always . The last argument that the trustees of Columbia University acted with undue haste is the most curious of all , and it gives the show away . One of you says that the trustees could not have evaluated the evidence during the four hours of their deliberations . Another mentions that the trustees acted before all the evidence on Van Doren was in . Still another argues that they wanted to wash their hands quickly of the whole business for fear of public opinion . And one advances the ingenious proposition that the students would not have protested if the trustees had waited a month or so with the acceptance of the resignation , pretending , " however untruthfully , " that they were investigating the case ! In truth , you do not mean any of these things , which are either patently at odds with the obvious facts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which justify your unwillingness to transcend that three-cornered relationship among yourself , your teacher and your university and to judge the obviouS facts by the standards of morality rather than adjust them for your and your teacher 's convenience . You are sorry about losing an attractive teacher and you hate to see that teacher suffer ; nothing else counts . But there is something else that counts and that is the sanctity of the moral law . Your Dean , in an admirable statement , which I have seen quoted only in your student paper , has formulated it thus : " The issue is the moral one of honesty and the integrity of teaching . Appearing as a teacher , Mr. Van Doren engaged in an act of deception in professing to know what he did not know , and of dishonesty in accepting answers in a test of knowledge against an opponent he believed to be honest . Thereafter , he continued to act out the deception and continued to lie about his actions , even under oath , until after he had been subpoenaed by a committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been contrary to the principles that a teacher stands for and undertakes to instill in his students . If these principles are to continue to have meaning at Columbia , Mr. Van Doren 's ultimate offer to resign had to be accepted . " Here is indeed the nub of the matter . You must have smiled indulgently or shrugged with impatience when you saw me refer to the sanctity of the moral law . Is not morality , so you might ask , a relative thing , the ever-changing result of environment and circumstances ? If this were so , let me ask you , how do you explain that we can not only understand the moral relevance of the Ten Commandments , originating in a social environment and circumstances quite different from ours , but also make them the foundation for our moral life ? How do you explain that the moral ideas of Plato and Pascal , of Buddha and Thomas Aquinas are similarly acceptable to our intellectual understanding and moral sense ? If the disparate historic systems of morality were not erected upon a common foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and place , we could neither understand any other moral system but our own , nor could any other moral system but our own have any moral relevance for us . It is only because we as moral beings have something in common with all other men - past and present - that we are able to understand , and make our own , the core of the moral systems of others . What is it that all men have in common as moral beings ? The Moral Faculty All men - civilized and barbarian - in contrast to the animals , are born with a moral sense ; that is to say , as man is by nature capable of making logical judgments , so is he capable by nature of making moral judgments . As I have said elsewhere , man " is a moralist because he is a man . " Yourself , in your groping for a tenable moral position , in your anxiety to justify yourself in moral terms , bear eloquent testimony to the innate character of that moral faculty . Civilized man shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but excels over him in that he is capable of making the right moral judgments , knowing why he makes them . He knows - as Socrates , the Greek tragedians ( to whom one of you rather wistfully refers ) , the Biblical prophets and the great moralists and tragedians of all the ages knew - what is meant by the sanctity of the moral law . The moral law is not made for the convenience of man , rather it is an indispensable precondition for his civilized existence . It is one of the great paradoxes of civilized existence that - in contrast to the existence of the animals and barbarians - it is not self-contained but requires for its fulfillment transcendent orientations . The moral law provides one of them . That is to say , human existence , not in its animal but in its civilized qualities , can not find its meaning within itself but must receive it from a transcendent source . You are still in all likelihood closer to your birth than to your death , yet in the measure that your life approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that observation . For when you look back on your life in judgment , you will remember it , and you will want it to be remembered , for its connection with the things that transcend it . And if you ask yourself why you remember and study the lives and deeds of great men , why you call them great in the first place , you will find that they were oriented in extraordinary ways and to an unusual degree towards the things that transcend their own existence . That is the meaning of the passage from the Scriptures , " He that findeth his life shall lose it ; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it . " This connection between our civilized existence and the moral law explains the latter 's sanctity . By tinkering with it , by sacrificing it for individual convenience , we are tinkering with ourselves as civilized beings , we are sacrificing our own civilized existence . As Kant put it : " If justice should perish , man 's existence on earth would have lost its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asked to sign that petition on Van Doren 's behalf then , was not the happiness of a particular man nor , for that matter , your own , but whether you and your university could afford to let a violation of the moral law pass as though it were nothing more than a traffic violation . Socrates had to come to terms with that issue , and he knew how to deal with it . You did not know how to deal with it . And this is why you hide your faces and muffle your voices . For since your lives have lost the vital contact with the transcendence of the moral law , you find no reliable standard within yourself by which to judge and act . You are frightened by the emptiness within yourself , the insufficiency stemming from a self-contained existence . And so you flee into the protective cover of the anonymous crowd and judge as it judges and act as it acts . But once you have restored that vital connection with the moral law from which life receives its meaning , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of your voices . You will no longer be afraid of yourself . For you will carry within yourself the measure of yourself and of your fellows and the vital link with things past , future , and above .
