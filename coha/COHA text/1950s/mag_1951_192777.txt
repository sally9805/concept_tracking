Steaming off the North Korean east-coast port of Hungnam last week , her 5-in. guns blasting at enemy installations , the U.S. destroyer Ernest G. Small ( 2,400 tons ) hit a mine . Holed below the waterline in a forward compartment , the Small made Kure , Japan , under her own power , but eight of her crew were dead , 18 injured . She was the eighth U.S. Navy vessel to strike a Communist mine . Mines , cheap to lay , hard to find and hazardous to hit , are the real peril of the Korean seas . Communists lay them at night from sampans , frigates , barges and junks . They even drift them downriver . The location and dispersion of mines on the east coast above the 38th parallel indicate that some may be sown by Russian submarines .
