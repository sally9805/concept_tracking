After eight weeks of struggling to prove that the nation 's tax-exempt foundations had somehow been responsible for promoting something that seemed somewhat un-American or something , a House Special Committee , headed by Tennessee 's Republican Brazilla Carroll Reece , decided by a party-line vote ( Republicans 3 , Democrats 2 ) to end public hearings and to allow the foundations to submit sworn written statements instead . Official reason for the decision : " In order to expedite the investigation and to develop the facts in an orderly and impartial manner . " But Ohio 's Democrat Wayne Hays had another version : " In view of the fact that the case presented by the staff of the committee and the mere handful of witnesses was so utterly nonsensical and without basis in fact that it fell of its own weight , it seems to me that the action taken today was the least embarrassing way that Mr. Reece and his staff could get offstage .
