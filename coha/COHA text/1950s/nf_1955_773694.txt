txt // If we turn to the other end of the job hierarchy , however , to top management , we find a situation quite in contrast . Here are those individuals who have either been so fortunate as to start at a higher rung on the occupational ladder ( by reason of family , training , or luck ) so that even a short progression carries them close to the top , or those who have continued to progress ( by reason of greater aspiration , greater ability , or luck ) beyond the stage at which their fellows sought security . Such individuals are nonetheless concerned with security ? necessarily concerned with it in rationally choosing among alternatives on the basis of relative inducements to act , since risk to present position ( past achievements ) is risk to aspirations . Moreover , even for individuals at this level of advancement we may assume that some point in their life span is reached where security considerations carry increasing weight : the risk of loss of position becomes more compelling than hope of additional gain . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other forms than seniority , however . If security in employment depends on personal and corporate performance , these are both matters which are significantly within the control of top management . Corporate performance is attributable to the action of all those who compose the enterprise , to be sure , but the contribution of an individual in the upper echelon has a vastly greater marginal value than the contribution from an individual in the ranks . The difference corresponds to the part played by the President and individual legislators in the conduct of the United States in contrast to the part played by the individual voter . Because of the greater degree of individual control over and responsibility for the outcome , the personal performance of top management is identified with corporate performance . Under this circumstance the security of top management would appear to stand or fall on how well corporate performance matches the expectations of those to whom management owes its job , the owners . The basis for owner satisfaction , as we observed in the preceding chapter , is a profit showing comparing favorably with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secuTHE // rity , must thus match the returns of competitive enterprises . And if among these competitors there are some which are run by managements still bent on further achievement , an achievement which itself is measured in terms of comparative profit rates , then security for any management can be gained only by keeping up with the performances of its more aspiring competitors ! For top management , under the circumstances , there is no security of past achievement except through further achievement . This is , indeed , the situation from which workers in the shop have largely freed themselves . Competitive performances in the production process have been recognized by them as threatening the security of those who fail to match the records of the better performers . Through their shop society , by the sanction of ostracism , they have a means of restraining this interpersonal competition . It is partially through this means that they have been able to effect a job security which depends not on competitive performance but on seniority . No such means of achieving job security is available to top management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop society , in which overambitious managers can be ostracized . Quasi agreements may provide some surcease from competitive rigors in the case of oligopolists , but where there is lack of opportunity for interpersonal contact and control there is an understandable unwillingness to entrust the future of one 's company to an agreement reached through conjecture and subject to violation by some management bound on further achievement . This continuing pressure on top management can not be much relieved by weakening the control of owners ( stockholders ) . Typically in the large American corporation stockholder control is nominal rather than real , and management is to this extent freed of an effective needling by its capital suppliers , whose recourse in the event of dissatisfaction with the way the business is run is not to change the management but to sell their stock . But even in these instances there is no security for management except through further achievement . Since its job security is identified with corporate security ( irrespective of the degree of ownership control ) it must continue // to compete effectively with all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the make , " in order to assure its own survival . For top management , then , the possibility of substituting security for achievement , of foregoing further achievement in order to avoid gambling with past achievement ( present position ) , depends less on its own inclinations than on the behavior of its competitors . The same competitive threats to position which top management faces face too the rank and file of production workers , to be sure ; jobs of the latter as well as of the former depend on corporate survival . But the rank and file possess neither the power nor the personal responsibility for meeting the threat ; relieved of such responsibility , they can individually seek such job security as the corporate performance permits , through seniority . Top management possesses both authority and responsibility ; unable to evade that responsibility , it can not protect what it has by refusing to accept risk ; it must continue to risk in order to protect what it has . It must meet and match the performances of its competitors . Only through cartel action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this competitive pressure . And cartel action is unlawful in the United States . We have here contrasted the position of the rank and file production worker with top management . Between these extremes of the industrial hierarchy are numerous layers of lesser management personnel . It appears a reasonable conjecture that the farther one progresses up the career ladder , the less possible of attainment is job security ? the freedom from risking what one has already gained . Degrees of risk to one 's present position , attending alternative courses of action , always exist , of course , for those at all levels of the hierarchy . But as one goes up the ladder he has less chance of avoiding actions which necessarily threaten his position ; despite personal inclination his occupational position will less and less allow him to forego the action which , while it may bring further achievement , requires gambling with what he has achieved . Small wonder , then , that American businessmen , living in a competitive economy , are known for the bulging brief cases which they take // home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eternal competitive vigilance . Small wonder , too , that numbers of American workers voluntarily drop out of the competitive race , satisfied to remain on a lower rung of the ladder where risk of position is less and the pace is not so exacting . In the stream of job decisions which face the individual over his lifetime , then , the nature of gain and risk and the relative weight attaching to them vary depending upon a person 's age and the position he occupies in the job hierarchy . The younger person , at any level , is likely to be more ambitious , counting the gain as relatively more significant than the risk . The older person is more security-minded ? first , because he has more to protect and , second , because in most instances his stream of aspirations has been shortened by experience , dimming earlier optimisms , so that the next step diminishes in value because it may lead no higher ( the division superintendency must be valued only for its own sake and not additionally because it is a stage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time remaining in his life span for that ) . But how the older person seeks security depends on his position in the hierarchy . At lower levels , with limited personal responsibility for corporate performance , seniority is the trustiest device . At higher and higher levels , with increasing personal responsibility for corporate performance , less and less is job security possible except through continuing achievement : relaxation does not avoid but carries risk . Every person has his stream of aspirations , his conception of himself and his place in society as influenced by his past and his becoming . Every person makes rational choices , at some level of specificity of objective , which are designed to achieve his ongoing aspirations . The rational choice consists in a calculation of the consequences of the probable gain from an action for one 's future achievements relative to the consequences of the probable risk to one 's present position ( past achievements ) , coupled with an estimate of the relevant probabilities of the consequences occurring . // The result is something we can call the inducement to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain knowledge ; both consequences and probabilities necessarily embody only judgments and expectations . At any time a person is faced with alternative courses of action , since not doing is always an alternative to doing . An expenditure may be made or not made ; a job may be thrown up or retained . Decisions are thus always in the process of being made , though much of the time the alternatives may be unworthy of conscious consideration or the consequences of choosing between the alternatives may be of such limited significance for the achievement of aspirations as to permit choice to be governed by habit , impulse , or chance . When conscious , rational choice is called for , however , it is made on the basis of the relative inducements which alternative actions carry . The course of action offering the greatest inducement will be selected . The two principal streams of economic decisions for all individuals are those affecting the uses of income ( the budget decision ) and the sources of income ( the revenue decision ) . These decisions ? based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by the position which the individual occupies in his time stream of aspirations , by where he is , how he got there , and where he expects to go . The theoretical significance of this is that it removes economic decisions from being comparisons of relative prices at an isolated moment of time and converts them into comparisons of alternative actions which have consequences over time . Price ( including the profit , interest , and wage rate ) enters as a determining variable only when it affects the budget and revenue decisions at a level of specificity of objectives that calls for rational choice , with the specification of objectives depending on the individual 's position in his time stream of aspirations . // The Concomitance of Aspirations THE English economist Wicksteed spoke of a person 's wants as mirroring his personality . To know a person 's preferences ? his choices among the goods and services representing the many sides of life , such as food and drink , home furnishings and home location , sports , aesthetic pursuits , his clothing , vacation tastes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual . If this is only a partial truth it is nevertheless an important one . It helps to remind us that when we speak of " consumption " aspirations we are using the term loosely , intending it to embrace all those aspects of a person 's life which involve the consumption of goods . The aspiration is not actually for goods but for the things which goods make possible ? creature comforts , religious development , intellectual attainments , play and amusement , political participation , protection of person and property , and so on . It is these and not the goods themselves which constitute our bundle of wants . It is our choices among these objectives which are reflected in the budget decision . The satisfaction of these aspirations , depending on goods , is in an exchange economy first dependent on income , which is derived from current or previous work . But work ? thus made necessary ? has its own satisfactions which are not dependent on goods but which are sought for themselves and to which consumption aspirations may at some level be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " producer " aspirations , which include not only a desire for income , 65 // making possible the satisfaction of consumption aspirations , but also job satisfactions , such as the enjoyment of social contacts on the job , a degree of pleasure in the work itself , prestige deriving from one 's occupation or his personal performance . By the definition of " work , " these psychological satisfactions would not have been sought in this manner unless income attached to the effort , but whenever energy is expended to obtain income these satisfactions will also be sought from the job . In the revenue decision the individual decides what kind of work he shall pursue in the light of his income needs balanced against the nonincome satisfactions of alternative employment and his desire for personal command over his own limited time ( self-employment ) . The choice of a job , through the income attaching to it , affects a person 's choice of a standard of living . But the level of income is in turn partially determined by one 's valuation of the satisfactions attaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactions must be weighed against each other . It is thus equally correct to say that choice of a standard of living affects one 's choice of a job . Work satisfaction becomes an objective alongside consumer satisfaction , and choices are required which in some degree sacrifice one to the other . For the individual , then , the economic problem is one of balance ? a balance achieved through the revenue and budget decisions , a balance affected by the social role in which the individual is cast and by his position in his time stream of aspirations ( both conditions influencing the standards by which he compares his own achievements ) .1 In psychological terms this effort to achieve balance can be viewed as the attempt of the individual to achieve personality integration , to relate all his activities in a meaningful and satisfying pat-Footnote // tern . This effort is as compulsive as the effort to maintain good health and has in fact been conceived as an aspect of health . Individuals vary in the extent to which they achieve this personal integration , but they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical and mental sanctions . ' Individual acts of choice are meaningless in themselves . They take on meaning only as part of a pattern . That a person will prefer one good over another , because of what it is or what it sells for , is a chance bit of information until it is related to many other choices which collectively describe behavior . Even the occasional spree or binge to which most of us succumb drops its aberrant connotation and acquires its reasonable explanation when placed in context , achieving recognition as a means of escape from normal routine and rational conduct which at times becomes oppressive . ( As Bertrand Russell has observed , " A quiet life may well be a boring life . " ) At some level of specificity room may be made , by rational choice , for such infrequent , irrational ( but reasonable ) outbursts . The notion of balance , of the need of the individual to integrate his economic activities in a meaningful pattern , replaces the conception of the individual as a rational maximizer . Maximization as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major respects : ( 1 ) What constitutes the maximum gain resulting from some action ceases to be clear when concomitant aspirations are introduced . One objective ? the acquisition of consumer goods , let us say ? can be maximized , and we can objectively describe the behavior of an individual who seeks to maximize that one thing . But if an individual has more than one objective and Footnote // these are to some extent competitive with each other ( in the expenditure of time and effort , if nothing else ) we can not argue that he seeks to maximize them all . A businessman , for example , like any other individual , is involved in a network of relationships ? with his employees , with his customers , with other businessmen , with the public generally . There is no reason for believing that one motive ? the pursuit of profit ? is so dominant that it dictates the character of all his relationships , governing all his responses , directing him to make certain marginal adjustments irrespective of the resulting impact on the complex of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial and convincing evidence that businessmen in their relations with employees are concerned not only with marginal value products ( though they can not ignore that consideration ) but also with ethical , moral , and social aspects of those relationships . Wages are sometimes maintained when market considerations alone would warrant their being reduced . Superannuated employees have been kept on the payroll out of a sense of responsibility . Contributions have sometimes been made to tide employees over emergency periods , out of a sense of sympathy . Similarly with respect to customers , a firm does not always charge " what the traffic will bear " ? not simply from fear of the effects of customer retaliation on the firm 's future but because the management may , as members of a community , be sensitive to the effect on their social relationships . Again , wage and price policies are sometimes adopted in the light of how business colleagues will react ? not simply due to the conjectural interdependence of oligopolistic relationships , since some colleagues operate in different product or labor markets , but out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom there is an occupational or social-class bond . These aspects of business behavior involve the satisfactions of vicarious consumption or of prestige from one 's personal performance or the enjoyment of one 's work society . The balancing of these satisfactions with the drive for income and personal consumption reveals an integrated pattern of behavior explaining ecoTHE // nomic conduct more satisfactorily than does the maximizing approach . There is no need to water down the fact that the businessman is necessarily spurred by profit considerations , the desire for pecuniary gain . Our culture indeed requires of him that he earn a profit as the condition of surviving as an independent entrepreneur . It does not require , however , that he pursue maximum profit . When the desire for pecuniary gain is tempered by consideration of other goals which the individual would achieve we leave behind us the concept of rational maximizing and necessarily move toward the idea of balancing satisfactions according to a culturally influenced behavior pattern . ( 2 ) Maximizing ceases to be an adequate description of behavior as soon as the time element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) Actions affect the future , but the future is uncertain ; the consequences of present behavior must be expressed as expectations , with respect both to progress toward aspirations and security of past achievements . Large gains and large risks must be weighed against small gains and small risks , and low probabilities of favorable consequences against high probabilities of less favorable consequences . The result of such rational calculation is preferred courses of action but nothing which could be described , objectively , as maximization . It was the worker 's uncertainty about future employment prospects , especially in the light of the insecurities of the ' thirties , that explains why he and so many of his fellows during World War II refused to give up the seniority they had accumulated with current employers to transfer to other companies engaged in more pressing war work and paying higher wage rates . ' What was it here that was being maximized ? ( b ) There are some who would argue that in the above case what Footnote // was being maximized was income over time . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was not the case ( since workers appear not to consider that a brief spell of high-paying work is to be preferred to a steadier duration of lower-paying work , even though the former may result in a greater total income ) , there is a further difficulty with this formula . Maximization over time is possible only when some finite span of time is assumed . When time is a continuing stream it becomes literally impossible to calculate within what period of time income will be maximized . Maximization is logically defensible in a static system , with each moment of time isolated from the time stream . It is logically indefensible in a system in which time runs on without providing any discrete intervals within which there is some reason for maximization . This time element provides the answer to those who may wonder how a balance of satisfactions differs from maximizing satisfaction . Even admitting that work satisfactions must be considered along with consumption satisfactions , one may ask why we can not phrase the problem as one of maximizing all satisfactions . The problem may indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any meaning sufficient to permit investigation . Maximization in such a formulation has only the loose sense of subjective decisions with respect to what total course of conduct is most preferred at a moment of time . To speak of " satisfactions " as that which is to be maximized in any more precise sense is to set up a purported common denominator , as Bentham sought to do . But it is a common denominator which ? as yet , in any event ? we do not know how to use and with which we can only make empty generalizations about behavior . By leaving behind the meaningless common denominator and concentrating upon the identifiable aspirations of people in various circumstances , we can ? statistically ? learn something about the probable behavior of people in their economic relationships . We can find out more about the revenue decisions  - -  about the job choices of younger workers , and about the circumstances under which seniority becomes important , and about the characteristics of those who seek promotion , and how the production // process itself affects worker aspirations . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions saving will take place , the influence of price on purchases , how the age factor affects buying habits , what contributes to the consumer acceptance of innovations . By such investigations we can , over time , build a picture of patterns of economic conduct which will be genuinely explanatory of budget and revenue decisions ; with the further question of whether such patterns of behavior as are discerned maximize something called " satisfactions " over an indefinite time stream we can afford to be unconcerned . It is thus the pattern of behavior as related to the time stream of aspirations , it is a person 's conception of himself and what he is becoming , his changing integration of concomitant objectives in a meaningful and satisfying perspective that explain economic behavior , and not his effort to maximize some single quantity at a moment of time . But does this conception of a balance of satisfactions which is influenced by an individual 's position in his time span leave us with something vague and imprecise and therefore analytically less useful than the more precise concept of maximizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears that content must be supplied to the concept of balance on a different plane of analysis . We are seeking not logical certainties , such as the maximizing approach seeks to provide , but statistical probabilities , such as can be secured only by an examination of the behavior of numerous individuals in parallel circumstances . The interplay of the individual and his culture creates the expectancy that individuals in common cultural settings will reveal certain behavior traits in common . Subjected to reasonably similar conditioning , they are likely to respond to types of situations with sufficient consistency to make statistical analysis meaningful . The budget and revenue decisions of people in various subcultural groupings requires examination to elucidate the kind of balancing of concomitant goals , and the kind of balancing of gains and risks , which goes on at different periods in their life streams . Here we encounter the concrete data of the economic process which have as yet been insuffi72 A GENERAL THEORY OF ECONOMIC PROCESS sufficiently exploited , which have to some extent been obscured by our preoccupation with price data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , however , the economist need not surrender his primary concern with the use of scarce resources . His interest lies in the flow of goods and services and in the related flows of receipts and expenditures . The revenue and budget decisions are of economic significance only because they determine the inflows and outflows of income . The element of time precludes us from saying that the revenue decision governs the inflow of income and the budget decision the outflow . Saving out of current income occurs only because of a time horizon and then gives rise to assets which become available in the form of income at a future time ? income which is not determined by the revenue decision at that future date . A past budget decision ( itself influenced by a past revenue decision ) may thus give rise to current income , affecting both revenue and budget decisions in the present . ( If current job income is supplemented by income from past savings , more weight may be accorded to job satisfaction in the revenue decision , and in the budget decision expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Current revenue and budget decisions are thus affected by past revenue and budget decisions ( even by past decisions on the part of others , in the case of such vicarious satisfactions as lead to bequeathal or setting up a favored individual in business ) . But current decisions may also be affected by expectations of future income and expenditures . Present expenditures may be reduced or income emphasized where there is expectation of greater future need or smaller future income ; savings may be negative ( expenditures in excess of current income ) where there is expectation of a rising income . Thus past revenue and budget decisions interact , giving rise to assets and liabilities . Future ( expected ) revenue and budget decisions interact , giving rise to expected income flows . // Present revenue and budget decisions interact , determining the balance of inflows and outflows , but the level and manner of their balance is influenced by the past ( through assets and liabilities ) and by the future ( through expectations ) . These relationships suggest the analytical treatment which we shall adopt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from saying that the revenue decision ? over time ? governs the inflow of income and the budget decision ? over time ? the outflow , we can nevertheless say that any revenue decision in the present ( influenced by past decisions in the form of assets , and future decisions in the form of expectations ) , governs inflows , and that the budget decision in the present ( likewise influenced by assets and expectations ) , governs outflows . We shall explore this relationship between present decisions and assets and expectations more fully in a later chapter . There is , however , no escape from the proposition that , even in the present , revenue and budget decisions are mutually influencing . Income decisions are partially determined by outlay decisions , and expenditures are partially governed by the job choice . But neither wholly controls the other : income is adjusted , within limits , to satisfy consumption aspirations , and outflows are controlled , within limits , to satisfy producer 's aspirations for work satisfaction . When we speak of the concomitance of aspirations , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of producer and consumer satisfactions is sought ( and that each of these categories itself represents balanced choices ) , but also to the fact that past and expected ( future ) aspirations are merged with the present . But the significance of this concomitance lies , for economists , only in its determination of the inflows and outflows of income . // Bargaining Power IN seeking to further the achievement of their aspirations at the particular points where they stand in their time streams , individuals are necessarily drawn into relationships with each other . These relationships may be competitive or cooperative . The ability of individuals to achieve their aspirations through these relationships depends upon their bargaining power and how they exercise it . The concept of bargaining power emerges from an examination of these economic relationships and the bargaining process . COMPETITION AND COOPERATION A competitive relationship exists when the attempted achievements of two or more individuals are incompatible with each other . It is this relationship which has preoccupied the attention of economists . The basis of competition is scarcity ? that more for some must mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives other than the satisfaction of consumption wants are admitted , competition is bound to persist , since it is an inevitable product of the urge to compare oneself with others . As long as prizes and distinctions are sought , if only pieces of ribbon or buttons or the favor of others , there is competition . There is an absolute scarcity when there is only one first prize , one foreman 's job to be 74 // won , one union steward to be elected . There is scarcity whenever groups of workers seek to top each other in the wage gains which each makes or when businessmen seek to better each other 's rate of profit . There is scarcity whenever occupational prestige is at stake or personal performances are compared , wherever relative ranking is significant . Scarcity and competition are of concern to the economist , however , only when they affect the use of scarce resources . Competition is not the only type of relationship which is evoked by an individual 's pursuit of his economic objectives . Specialization of function , division of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The resulting functional dependence of an individual on others establishes as necessary a basis for cooperative relationships as scarcity does for competitive relationships . ' A cooperative relationship is necessitated whenever an individual 's objectives are unobtainable through his own unaided efforts , requiring the collaboration of others . Despite the common connotation attaching to the word , cooperation does not imply willingness but only the joint pursuit of a given objective . Cooperation may be forced , when the common objective is imposed by some on others , as in a military organization or a master-slave relationship . In the system of economic relationships through which aspiration is linked to achievement , then , competition arises because of scarcity , and cooperation arises because of interdependence . Cooperation , based on interdependence , is no less fundamental a rela-Footnote // tionship than is competition , based on scarcity . Except in a Robinson Crusoe economy ( a situation with less interest to the social scientist than a community of ants or a swarm of bees ) , interdependence is as pervasive and unavoidable an influence as is scarcity . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic relationships characterizing society . ' The same individuals may be competitive in some respects and cooperative in other respects , since their relations involve both scarcity and interdependence . In a master and slave relationship , for example , joint production objectives are compulsorily imposed by the former on the latter , establishing a forced cooperation in which the achievements of one ( the master ) depend on the achievements of another ( the slave ) . In the division of the product , however , even though the master is privileged to take whatever he likes without any possibility of protest by the slave there is still a competitive relationship between them ? more for one means less for the other . Between the two there may also arise at times instances of voluntary cooperation , as for example in the erection of a church for the worship of a common god . In order to establish more explicitly the nature of the connection between competition and cooperation , let us adopt certain terminology . If we identify any individual with some economic function as we do when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lender , a seller , and so on , there are always other individuals who are similar to him in the respect identified ? other similarly skilled or similarly situated workers , employers , lenders , sellers . All individuals who are alike in the given respect , so that one might be substituted for the other ( with similar but not necessarily identical results , as one machinist might substitute for another even though he can not do the job so expertly ) we denominate commensals . Footnote // In contrast , there are others who stand in a complementary relationship to these same individuals : the employer is a complement of the worker , the worker of the employer ; borrowers complement lenders , and buyers complement sellers . Such complementary pairs are linked together in a cooperative relationship in which each makes some unique contribution . The relationship is sought because the functional contribution of one is different from that of the other . These functionally interdependent relationships we denominate symbiotic , and the complementary types we call symbionts.3 All exchange relationships are instances of symbiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trade of goods ( or titles to goods , such as money ) , where each is able to supply something that the other needs or wants . All situations where production specialization occurs are instances of symbiotic cooperation , since each specialist 's services carry meaning only when joined with the efforts of other specialists . We are now in a position to arrive at certain interesting conclusions . Because functional interdependence is unavoidable and in a modern exchange economy is completely pervasive , the objectives of competition can be won only through symbiotic cooperation . A number of workers compete for a job opening , but the prize can be won by any of them only through an ultimate cooperative relationship with the employer . One firm competes with other firms to dominate some market , but the objective can be gained only through cooperative relationships with a number of customers . A consumer wishes to obtain some product which is also desired by others ( or which embodies resources which others desire in different commodities ) , but his wish is fulfilled only when he establishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceive of a situation in an organized exchange economy , with its division of labor , where objectives calling for the use of limited resources can be achieved independently of others . Even so simple a project as the growing of vegetables on one 's own Footnote // land requires implements ( which even if self-made are seldom made without nails or use of a knife ) , water ( which even if obtained from a stream or spring is seldom conveyed by means not involving some good manufactured by others ) , and customarily the payment of a property tax ( for one 's share in the benefits of government ) . If competition depends , for the achievement of its objectives , on some symbiotic relationship , it is no less true that the symbiotic relationship depends on competiton . Since a symbiotic relationship is one of cooperation , it can exist only by decision of all those who are party to it . That decision depends on the terms of cooperation , terms which must be reached through agreement , whether implicit or explicit . A union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbiotic cooperation , only after a contest over terms , a contest which may include strike or lockout . A symbiotic relationship between housewife and grocer in the form of purchase and sale takes place only when each is satisfied with the terms of the sale . An agreement between svmbionts on the conditions of cooperation involves a competitive relationship since the element of scarcity is present . In arriving at terms , more for one necessarily means less for the other . The resolution of this competitive relationship is a precondition of cooperation ? inescapable regardless of the good will of the cooperants . Wherever a scarcity relationship exists competition is unavoidable . This dependence of cooperation on the competitive resolution of the scarcity problem is fundamental to all economic theory . Its prevalence can be emphasized by examples which involve economic relations usually judged insufficiently important to incorporate into systematic analysis . A cooperative relationship between church and devotee ? economic if involving the use of scarce resources to foster the work of the church ? depends first on the settlement of the competitive relationship between the church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter to the former invokes a competitive relationship in the economic sense that more for the church // means less for the giver , even though the latter may feel adequately recompensed in terms of spiritual satisfaction . Similarly , a cooperative relationship between parent and child to further the child 's development , perhaps through piano lessons ? again economic if requiring the use of scarce resources ? can be undertaken only after a prior determination of the terms of cooperation , involving a competitive relationship between parent and child because a greater use of family resources on behalf of the child necessarily means less of the family 's resources which can be spent on the behalf of the parent , however great the joy of the parent in the child 's ad vancement . Thus symbiotic cooperation is sought as a means of achieving one 's objectives , but cooperation depends on agreement as to the conditions of cooperation . This competitive relationship between symbionts over the terms of their cooperation is resolved ( necessarily so , as will become evident ) by a bargaining process , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own interests . With two primary exceptions ? withdrawal of one 's productive power ( time ) from the market in the case of the revenue decision ( that is , self-employment ) and withdrawal of one 's purchasing power ( money ) from the market in the case of the budget decision ( that is , saving ) , with these two exceptions economic actions run in terms of cooperation by agreement . Previously we spoke of the inducement to act as though it constituted an array of alternative courses of conduct , each carrying its own gains and risks to the achievement of aspirations , based on terms that were given to the individual . We spoke of the inducement to act as though it involved a unilateral decision only : the individual 's choice was determinative of the course he pursued . We now wish to emphasize that since actions depend on agreements with others , two ( or more ) parties must be induced to act before any action can be taken , so that an individual 's course of conduct is dependent on another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alternative courses confronting the individual arc not fixed but are subject to // his influence , an influence which depends on how important his cooperation is to the opposing party . The influence which a person has over another , in the setting of the terms of their cooperation , is his power to withhold the gains that his cooperation would make possible , thus imposing on the other a cost of disagreeing on his terms . But the amount of the gain ( as well as the amount of the risk ) attaching to his cooperation is itself dependent on the terms which he sets . A bargainer who sets a high price on his cooperation thereby lessens the gains and increases the risk attaching to cooperation with him . By modifying the terms which he asks he modifies the gains and risks which the other faces in agreeing on his terms . BARGAINING To emphasize the dependence of economic action on agreement , let us convert our expression for the inducement to act into an expression for the inducement to agree . The inducement to agree may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms ( = the gains from cooperating with X that must be given up ) the cost of agreeing on X 's terms ( = the risks presented by agreeing with X that can not be avoided ) In the case of either agreeing or disagreeing with X , the gains and risks are relative to other possible bargains or to no bargain . We are interested in the achievement of aspirations made possible by cooperating with X , in contrast to the achievements made possible by cooperating with Y or Z. We are interested in the risks to one 's aspirations accompanying agreement with X in contrast to the risks accompanying agreement with Y or Z. Each bargainer will seek to propose terms of cooperation which are as favorable as possible to himself and yet sufficiently favorable to the opposing bargainer to win his affirmative response . Each will seek the advancement of his own aspirations , and hence will // propose terms on which he himself is willing to cooperate with another ; but each seeks agreement , and hence will propose terms which offer an inducement to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this relationship two different sets of proposals are likely to be advanced , one by each of the bargainers , since each may be expected to favor his own interests over the other 's . Such initial differences do not necessarily preclude ultimate agreement , however ; since each seeks cooperation with the other he may make concessions to secure it . The effort to win the consent of the other constitutes what we call bargaining , and a successful outcome of the bargaining process involves a movement of one or the other or both parties toward the terms offered by the bargaining op-ponent until there is finally agreement on some common set of terms . The outcome of the bargaining process ? whether agreement is reached , and if it is on what terms ? depends on how much one or the other or both can be led to move from some preferred position which favors itself toward a less preferred position which is more favorable to the other party . The degree of influence which one possesses over the other , to force such concessions , is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defined as the capacity to effect an agreement on one 's own terms ; operationally , one 's bargaining power is another 's inducement to agree . If X and Y are in a contest over the terms of their cooperation , X 's bargaining power is represented by Y 's inducement to agree ( the cost to Y of agreeing on X 's terms relative to the cost of disagreeing on those terms ) , while Y 's bargaining power is X 's inducement to agree ( the cost to X of agreeing on Y 's terms relative to the cost of disagreeing on those terms ) . The terms proposed are sometimes understood rather than made explicit , but the principle is not thereby vitiated . And the costs , both of agreement and disagreement , must be re-garded as the subjective estimates of the parties , the expected probabilities of the consequences which are expected to affect the realization of their aspirations . If for both parties the cost of agreement is greater than the cost // of disagreement on the other 's initial terms , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . In order for a bargaining agreement to be concluded at least one of the parties must find that agreement on the other 's terms is less costly than disagreement on those terms . As a condition for any agreement , then , we can say that the ratio of the inducement to agree must be 1 or greater for at least one of the parties . ' There is no reason to conclude , however , that whenever a party finds its inducement to agree equal to 1 , it will thereupon consent to the other 's terms . Depending upon the nature of the relationship , it is also possible that that party will simply offer more favorable terms to its bargaining opponent , perhaps making repeated concessions , in a continuing effort to find some terms short of those to which it is prepared to agree where the inducement to agree of its bargaining opponent is also equal to 1 . As the party with the weaker bargaining power ( greater inducement to agree to the other 's terms ) gradually moves toward the other 's position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the other 's inducement to agree on its terms . The union which demands a 20-cent wage increase may be ready to agree to the 10-cent offer of the employer , sooner than strike ; its cost of agreeing on management 's terms may be less than its cost of disagreeing . But sooner than settle at once for 10 cents , it will lower its own demands , first to 15 cents , then to 12 cents , in the hope or expectation that at some point above the employer 's 10-cent offer the employer will also be placed in a position where it will be cheaper to agree on the union 's terms than to disagree on those terms . By its progressive lowering of its terms , the union will have increased its bargaining power . When for both of the parties the inducement to agree is equal to Footnote // 1 , an area of indeterminacy is created . At any point within this range each would prefer to settle on the other 's terms rather than not settle at all , but the terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which separates them involves a continuation of the same bargaining process in which they have been involved all along , each trying to win the advantage . In this game of bluff and persuasion relative bargaining power is important . Whichever party has the lesser inducement to agree will be relatively the stronger in bargaining power . It may therefore be inclined to carry ? its bluff a little farther than the other , conveying the threat of a disagreement which it itself wants to avoid , in an effort to compromise the difference to its advantage . If the other party believes that only bluff is involved , however , its refusal to agree involves no actual cost of disagreement , since it can expect that its continued disagreement will only cause the other party to reduce its demands further . It is here that the uncertainty of the bargaining process becomes most apparent . Neither party can ever be sure of its own bargaining power , since this depends on the subjective estimates which the other has made , the nature of which can only be surmised . X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depends on his calculation of the costs of agreement and disagreement on Y 's terms , laid alongside his estimate of Y 's estimate of the costs of agreement and disagreement on his own ( X 's ) terms . Because of the high degree of uncertainty involved here , as each party tries to gain the advantage in the final terms of settlement , it is possible that if one 's bluff is called a disagreement may be precipitated which neither wishes , involving both in expected costs greater than if they had conceded the whole difference between their respective demands to the other . In many cases an individual faces not simply one bargaining opponent but a number , each of whom stands as a possible alternative to the others . An employer interviews half a dozen applicants for a single job opening , with each of whom some bargain might be made . Each of the applicants likewise is negotiating with other // possible employers , with any one of whom an agreement may be reached . Whether an agreement is arrived at between A and B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and D , depends on the relative inducement to A to agree on B 's terms or on C 's terms , and the relative inducement to B to agree on A 's terms or on D 's terms . Only if the terms offered by A are more favorable than those offered by D will B be induced to agree with A. Only if the terms offered by B are more favorable than those offered by C will A be induced to agree with B. B faces A and D , offering its cooperation on stated terms and considering their offers of cooperation on their stated terms . A similarly faces B and C. B may move only a short way toward the position of A , because D is willing to move much farther toward its ( B 's ) own demands . If A then seeks agreement with B it must make even greater concessions than D , perhaps wholly accepting B 's last terms . It will be unwilling to make such concessions , however , if in the meantime C has moved closer to its position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved the relationships are even more complex . Nor are they made any simpler by the fact that bargainers standing as alternatives to each other are sometimes unaware of the terms which their commensal competitors are offering or that they are sometimes played off one against the other ? whipsawed ? by the bargaining opponent . Cooperation between two parties thus depends on whether the terms on which agreement can be reached between them offer each the greatest inducement to agree of all the alternative bargains which each faces . ( This is equivalent to our earlier proposition that an individual will pursue that course of action which offers the greatest inducement to act . ) ' If , however , the cost of agreement is greater Footnote // than the cost of disagreement for all bargains faced , no agreement will be forthcoming . The consequence is withdrawal from the production process , in the case of the revenue decision , and liquid saving , in the case of the budget decision . As we have already seen , the budget and revenue decisions are continuing decisions , continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now see require ( 1 ) agreements or self-employments and ( 2 ) agreements or liquid saving . THE BARGAINING RELATIONSHIP Since relationships of symbiotic cooperation are essential to the achievement of competitive objectives , and since bargaining relationships are essential to the establishment of symbiotic cooperation , it follows that the bargaining relationship must be viewed as in some sense fundamental . It is the relationship which joins the scarcity and interdependence conditions , owing its existence to both . In contrast to this view of the basic importance of the bargaining relationship , however , there are many who contend that bargaining is not economically significant , since it rests on a power by the bargainer to exclude suitable alternatives , a power which is not commonly possessed in an exchange economy , where alternatives are normally available ( other employers , other workers , other buyers , other sellers ) to stop anyone from seeking to exact a greater price Footnote // for his symbiotic cooperation than his commensals are willing to take . This argument is not without merit , but it has one great defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks a symbiotic relation may explain many exchange transactions more or less satisfactorily . But if , as economists , we are concerned with the allocation of all the limited resources available to a society , there are many types of transactions which do not fall into the same pattern and can not be so well explained by the principle of large numbers of alternatives . Most taxes paid to governments ( city , state , and federal ) , contributions to churches , the allocation of resources within the family unit , the expenditure of funds upon military establishments , the provision of economic assistance to develop foreign countries , and so on , in an impressive list which includes all nonmarket transactions , can hardly be explained so readily in terms of exchanges where numbers of equally satisfactory alternatives are available . Before we accept the conclusion that the bargaining relationship is essential to all symbiotic relationships ( where the use of limited resources is involved ) , however , we shall want to examine six special cases which raise questions concerning that conclusion , the answers to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining as an economic relationship . These are : ( 1 ) the case of perfect competition ; ( 2 ) the case of perfect cooperation ; ( 3 ) the case of unilateral imposition of terms ; ( 4 ) the case of terms imposed by outside authority ; ( 5 ) the case of commensal agreement for individual bargaining ; and ( 6 ) the case of commensal agreement for collective bargaining . 1 . The case of perfect competition . As we have seen , because of interdependence one 's aspirations can be achieved only through relationships of symbiotic cooperation . The perfectly competitive price analysis recognizes this condition : although its explicit emphasis is on competition , underlying the whole theoretical fabric is a conviction of the need for economic cooperation . Adam Smith opens the first chapter of his Wealth of Nations with a discussion // of division of labor that leaves no doubt as to the importance of cooperation in his system . Perfect competition is the condition of large numbers of homogeneous economic agents ? homogeneous not in the sense of being similar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the symbionts with whom cooperation is sought . Workers may be short or tall , young or old , colored or white , blonde or brunette , of Irish or German descent , and so on , but if the employer is interested only in their skills as machinists or lathe operators or bench hands or salesmen or in some other functional capacity , these personal differences have no bearing on their homogeneity or nonhomogeneity . Among such homogeneous agents ( commensals ) there occurs competition to become party to some desired symbiotic relation , a relationship desired because it is the key to achievement of their economic aspirations . This competition takes the form of a bidding process , with the best bids winning the desired relationship . No individual can hope to win the desired relationship with any bid less favorable than that made by one of his fellow commensals , since all stand as perfect substitutes for each other . Bidding is a species of competition ? not between symbionts but among the commensals seeking to be party to some symbiotic relationship , not between workers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance lies only in its effect on the terms of symbiotic cooperation , however . That effect is to reduce to zero the bargaining power of any commensal who seeks to win the desired relationship with an offer less than the most favorable bid of his fellows . Under such circumstances the cost to the other party of disagreeing with the bidder 's terms is zero ? alternatives are available at better terms ; no gains that would come from cooperating with that bidder are sacrified by cooperating with another bidder . Perfect competition actually involves a double bidding process , in which each would-be party to some type of symbiotic relation bids against its own commensals ? employers bidding against em88 A GENERAL THEORY OF ECONOMIC PROCESS ployers ( the high bid winning ) and workers against workers ( the low bid winning ) to become parties to the employer-worker relationship . Identical bids by employer and worker ( a coincidence of high employer bid and low worker bid ) represents agreement between the two parties on the terms of their symbiotic cooperation . This double bidding process puts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers to bid lower than employers bid , or for employers to bid higher then workers bid , since when identical bids are entered by workers and employers ? by the symbionts ? there is agreement between them . This double bidding process , no less than the customary auction bidding , is significant only because related to symbiotic bargaining . The bargaining power of both parties is reduced to zero , since if any commensal ? on either side of the relation ? seeks to exact terms more favorable than his fellows are offering , the cost to the other party , the symbiont , of disagreeing on those terms becomes zero . We conclude , then , that bidding , like bargaining , is a competitive process . There is a general scarcity condition present , a scarcity of the symbiotic relationships which represent access to limited resources , a limitation on the number of workers , of employers , of sellers , of buyers whose cooperation will aid in the achievement of economic objectives . Bidding becomes an element in the determination of the terms on which cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement , that is , by affecting bargaining power . Bidding does not occur only in cases of homogeneity . Competitive offers may come from some who stand not as precise substitutes for each other but who are nevertheless interchangeable . The real estate pages of any metropolitan newspaper carry columns of advertisements of houses for sale at a variety of asking prices ; none of the houses is precisely the same , but each competes with the other and affects the terms of the bargain which is ultimately struck between the buyer and one of the many sellers . There is no doubt that in such a case the bidding process is supplementary to the bargaining // process , an element affecting the bargained outcome . The situation is changed when the rival bids come from perfect substitutes for each other only by the fact that bargaining power is affected in a particular manner . Competitive bidding by perfect alternatives to each other is most uncommon . It is least to be expected when the performance of some service is called for , as typically in the production process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite the same as those of another , and personal characteristics unrelated to functional performance become important in the social contact . All the elements of personal discrimination , some of which we approve and others which we tend to disapprove , become relevant considerations. ? Homogeneity is most likely to be found in the product transaction , though even here the prevalence of product differentiation drastically reduces its incidence . The best examples are perhaps provided by the organized stock and commodity exchanges . Perfect competition is thus a relatively uncommon form of competitive bidding ( commensal competition ) which has significance in the economic system only because it is related to another form of competition , symbiotic bargaining . It is a case where bargaining power is at its minimum limit , becoming zero because the cost of disagreement on the other 's terms is zero . 2 . The case of perfect cooperation . Let us consider now the situation where not only would symbionts effect a cooperative relationship but each desires the same apportionment of costs and benefits resulting from the relationship . We may refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sense is such cooperation a bargained relationship ? In instances of this sort the terms of cooperation are usually implicit . They are , however , the same for each party . Since the terms Footnote // which one seeks are precisely those which the other offers , there is a cost of disagreeing on the other 's terms , but no cost of agreeing on the other 's terms instead of one 's own terms . We have here , then , a situation complementary to that of perfect competition , with bargaining power for each of the symbionts at the opposite limit , being infinite . This is not the same thing as saying there is no cost of agreement at all . Any economic relationship implies a cost , since it is the necessity of choice between alternatives ? imposed by the scarcity condition ? which creates the economic problem , and as soon as choice is necessary there is a cost ? the cost of that which must be sacrificed by choosing this . In the case of ' perfect cooperation , however , the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other terms of cooperation which either party would prefer . Two examples of this type of cooperation have already been provided , one involving a contribution by a religious devotee to the church of his persuasion , the other an expenditure by a parent for the training of his child . That these two instances are not commonly considered in economic analysis does not deprive them of their economic nature , since both involve an allocation of scarce resources , though with consequences that are usually of more interest to the sociologist than the economist . We are not here interested in them for their significance or insignificance to economic theory , however , but only for their illustration of the case of perfect cooperation . In both instances a competitive relationship is present , as we have seen : the general scarcity condition applies , in that more for the use of one means less for the use of the other . In the case of the religious association , we may assume the implicit terms of cooperation to be the member financing , to an amount of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case of the family association , the implicit terms of cooperation are the child 's adherence to a parent-financed program of study . That the bargaining relationship is actually present , with an exercise of infinite bargaining power by each of the symbionts under the given circumstances , is demonstrable . Suppose that the religious // follower offered to make a contribution only on the condition that the church modify its program in some respect . Perhaps the minister had been active in his efforts to inject Christian principles into industrial relations , offending either an employer or a union official who was affiliated with the church and who offered to maintain his contribution to the church 's work only on condition that the minister confine the application of his religious beliefs to nonindustrial affairs . The bargaining relationship would immediately become apparent . For the minister there would now emerge a cost of agreement on the other 's terms ? a denial of his ethical convictions and perhaps the loss of the support of others ? against which must be weighed , as cost of disagreement the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those whom the member might influence . Or suppose that in the family situation the child desires to pursue a course of musical study but only on condition that he be allowed to take lessons from a more expensive teacher who is also patronized by his friends . The parent would now face a cost of agreement on the child 's terms where previously there had been none , involving a greater expenditure than he wishes to make , against which must be laid a cost of disagreement in the form of giving up the musical training which he desires his child to have . In neither of these two cases would the bargain now be assured , since what had previously been an infinite bargaining power on both sides has now been converted into a situation in which the desires of each are in conflict and must be resolved by a contest of necessarily limited bargaining powers . 3 . The case of unilateral imposition of terms . ' We distinguish two types of situations here : ( 1 ) unilateral imposition of terms but discretion as to acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition of the relationship on dictated terms . These two situations which appear distinct on first encounter will be found , on reflection , to blend imperceptibly into each other . Footnote // Both raise the question of whether terms which are coerced by one of the parties can be construed as bargained . Symbiotic relationships which are optional to us but which can be elected only on conditions fixed by the other party are common . Most retail stores in the United States operate with posted prices which the customer is free to accept or reject but not to modify . Employers sometimes complain that union agents confront them with demands which are already written into a collective bargaining agreement , ready for signature , and a statement that " That 's all we 'll listen to ? take it or leave it . " Can such " take it or leave it " demands be called bargaining ? Bargaining does not require negotiation . A bargaining relationship exists whenever symbiotic cooperation is contemplated ( as when any purchase or sale is considered ) in the furtherance of one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satisfactory terms are not necessarily terms which are regarded as " fair , " in any sense ; they are satisfactory only in the sense that the cost of disagreement on those terms is greater ( or no less ) than the cost of agreement . For the manager who is confronted by a union ultimatum , backed by threat of strike , the cost of accepting the union 's terms , however strong his dislike of them , may be less than the cost of the alternative of not accepting the terms . For the shopper who compares the offerings of a number of merchants , the cost of paying the price demanded by one store may be less than the cost of refusing to meet those terms , costs which consist of going without the desired object or paying a higher price elsewhere or being subjected to inconveniences in marketing . In both cases a bargaining relation is present , even though negotiation may be absent . Moreover , the party to whom the demand is made is not always without the bargaining power to force some modification in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disposal of convincing the union leader that the latter 's disagreement on his terms is more costly than agreement , opening an area for compromise settlement . If a customer threatens to buy elsewhere , the merchant may deviate from his posted-price policy and make a // " special offer " ; in any event , if enough customers turn away he may be induced to lower his price . We are not accustomed to thinking of cooperation as a relation forced by some private individuals upon others , but less than a hundred years ago the master-slave relationship still existed in the United States . In that instance the symbiotic relationship itself was forced upon one of the partners to it , on terms which were dictated by the other . Perhaps the most common existing area of such economic cooperation compelled by one of the parties on his terms is in family life . Children are frequently subjected to parental authority , at times involving physical coercion , to compel cooperation on dictated terms , in the performance of household tasks . These situations still embody the bargaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be compelled . The party subjected to coercion can always accept the penalties of refusal to cooperate , however drastic these may be . Such penalties enter into his calculation of the costs of disagreement , and must be laid alongside the costs of agreement before it can be determined whether the coercing party possesses sufficient bargaining power to attain his objective . These situations are fundamentally no different from the case of " take-it-or-leave-it " terms , except in the harshness of the penalties associated with disagreement . The history of union-management relations in the United States , for example , contains numerous instances where one or the other of the parties sought to compel agreement on its terms by resort to violence in a ruthless effort to make the alternative to agreement excessively costly . 4 . The case of terms imposed by outside authority . The same two types of situations may be distinguished here as in the case of unilateral imposition of terms : ( a ) The relationship is discretionary but if entered into the terms are fixed : compulsory arbitration , minimum wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( b ) The relationship itself is compelled on terms laid down ; examples here are tax payments and military service . Again it may be asked , Where terms are so fixed by force or authority , // how does bargaining enter as a necessary preliminary to the rela-tionship ? Again , these two types of situations , apparently dissimilar , represent only a range of similar situations . Where authoritative terms of cooperation are imposed , the terms may or may not include penalties for noncooperation . Where it is intended to compel cooperation , penalties for noncooperation are provided and become part of the cost of disagreement on the terms imposed . Military service may be avoided if one is willing to pay the price for disagreeing on the terms of symbiotic cooperation laid down by his government . Bargaining , as we have noted , does not imply negotiation but only a calculation of the cost of agreement and disagreement on the terms proposed ? terms which , it is true , are in this instance not proposed by the other party to the relationship but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensal agreement for individual symbiotic bargaining . Here agreement is sought not between the symbionts themselves but among a relatively small number of commensals who are competing with each other to become party to some symbiotic relationship . The agreement may be overt , effected by negotiation ( though in the United States this is usually illegal ) ; an example would be industry collusion in the submission of bids , or any price agreement among competitors . The agreement may simply be understood , developing out of the learning process ( quasi agreement ) , as in the case of oligopolists , as Professor Fellner has so lucidly demonstrated . In either case the agreement relates to the terms which any one of the group is free to offer in bargaining for the desired symbiotic relationship without evoking retaliation from his commensal rivals . The agreement is thus a form of cooperation designed to strengthen the position of each member of the commensal group in his bargaining with symbionts . To the extent that rivalry among themselves is reduced , the bargaining power of all of them is increased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost to any firm of disagreeing on the customer 's terms is reduced when that // cost does not include the certain loss of a sale to some competitor offering more favorable terms . By thus reducing the cost of disagreement on the customer 's terms , each firm increases its bargaining power . Such commensal agreement depends on commensal bargaining ( quasi agreement on quasi bargaining ) . It can be assumed that the terms which the commensals agree among themselves that each of their number can offer to those for whose symbiotic cooperation they are all competing do not equally favor them all . One ( a highcost producer , for example ) would be benefited if the common terms were set higher , another ( who hopes to expand its markets ) if they were fixed lower . These disagreements among themselves can be resolved only by bargaining . The terms which are finally accepted depend on the interplay of their bargaining powers , the determination by each of the costs of agreement and disagreement on the terms proposed by each of the commensal group . Commensal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as does symbiotic cooperation . But commensal cooperation has significance only in so far as it aids the cooperants in their bargaining for symbiotic relationships . Each of the small number of commensals stands as an alternative to the others in the symbiotic relationships which all desire , a condition which , if allowed to stimulate competitive bidding among them , would weaken the bargaining power of all . Agreement among themselves as to the limits to which any of their number will push his bid , without evoking retaliation from his fellows , is a means of strengthening the position of all in their symbiotic bargaining . Such agreement can normally be effected when only small numbers are involved , however . 6 . The case of commensal agreement for collective symbiotic bargaining . This is similar to the case above , except that here the agreement is not on the terms which each individually will offer , with each continuing to stand as an alternative to the other in symbiotic relationships which all desire but which only one can have ; here the agreement is on the terms which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes them all . The // purpose of agreement is less to prevent competitive bidding by commensals within the group than to forestall competitive bidding by commensals outside the group for the positions of each one in the group . When the group acts collectively , the only alternatives facing its opponent are a symbiotic relationship with another similar group , or noncooperation . Because whole groups can be replaced only with more difficulty than individuals , the cost to the other party of disagreeing on the terms proposed by the group increases , strengthening the latter 's bargaining power . Agreement on the terms which will be collectively offered to the other party requires bargaining among the commensals themselves . The terms which appear most advantageous to some may not satisfy others . In labor unions , for example , skilled members may wish to hold out for a higher wage increase than unskilled members are willing to settle for , and before agreement on common proposals can be reached concessions will have to be made , based on relative bargaining power . If it should happen that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is simply the limiting case of infinite bargaining power , since the cost of agreement to all , on the others ' terms , is zero . In the course of negotiation , however , differences are likely to emerge within the group over the concessions to be offered to secure agreement . In any event , such commensal cooperation has significance only in being an instrument of bargaining power in the effort to effect a symbiotic relationship with others . We have now examined six special cases , in each instance finding that the bargaining relationship is fundamental to the symbiotic relationship , the bridge between the two inescapable conditions of scarcity and interdependence . We should remind ourselves , however , that all agreements do not involve rational choice any more than do all actions . Agreements may be effected from routine or chance or sudden inclination . As we know , such decisions ( agreements ) are commonly referable to some higher level of specificity of objective , however , which gives them their reasonableness if not their rationality . The cost of agreement may simply be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and budget decisions , so that the terms of one party are willingly accepted by the other , with a result approaching perfect cooperation . Figure 1 suggests the connections between the various types of relationships which we have investigated . Because of general scar-city and interdependence , particular symbiotic relationships are Figure sought which will satisfy the demands of both conditions . These cooperative relationships can be attained only through bargaining . In addition , in most ( but not all ) instances such competition among symbionts is influenced by competition in the form of rival bids by commensals , which sometimes leads to commensal cooperation ( a bargained relationship ) . We thus have the picture of a society whose scarce resources are distributed in accordance with the relative bargaining powers of its constituent members . Each individual is the manager of his own scarcity and interdependence position , a management which takes // the form of making day-to-day bargains , through the exercise of his bargaining power , which are both a reflection and a determinant of his continuing revenue and budget decisions . The results of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and an outflow of resources from him , whether those resources are actually embodied in goods and services or constitute a command over goods and services in the form of money . Each individual stands as the focus of a large number of symbiotic relationships , arising out of his bargained transactions . Each of those with whom one individual has a symbiotic relationship in turn is the center of a similar web of relationships , and so on , with every individual 's web interconnected through some chain with every other individual 's web in the economy , a connection which may be immediate or very remote . The changes which an individual makes in his system of bargained relationships are influenced by his aspirations . The nature of his drives ? their direction and intensity ? helps to determine how he administers his position of scarcity and interdependence , whether he initiates changes to which others respond or whether he responds to actions initiated by others , how he reacts to modifications in the general conditions of scarcity and interdependence such as are brought on by changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aspirations ( in so far as they require scarce resources for their fulfillment ) , they can be sought only by bargaining for terms on which the facilitating symbiotic relationships can be erected . In a world of interdependence , the effort to achieve one 's objectives can only be met by effective management of one 's bargaining power . SUMMARY Let us now summarize the principal findings of this chapter . 1 . Because of a scarcity of the resources available to all aspirants for their use , for whatever purpose , all individuals in a society are // competitive with each other . More for some means less for others . I his is the general scarcity condition . 2 . Because of functional interdependence , the objectives of competition ? the aspirations of the individual ? can be achieved only by symbiotic cooperation . This is the general interdependence condition . 3 . The general interdependence condition can be resolved only through particular interdependence ( symbiotic ) relationships . Establishment of such particular symbiotic relationships requires agreement between the symbionts on the terms of their cooperation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached through a competitive process , since the costs of cooperation ( which must be met from limited resources ) and the fruits of cooperation ( which are necessarily limited ) must be apportioned among those competing . More for one means less for the other . We call this competitive process bargaining , and any agreement eventuating depends on relative bargaining power ( the other 's inducement to agree on terms proposed ) . A bargained agreement is the particular scarcity relationship which resolves the general scarcity condition . 5 . The achievement of aspirations involves one 's management of his position of scarcity and interdependence through bargains which simultaneously effectuate and mold the fundamental revenue and budget decisions on which inflows and outflows of income depend . // The Determinants of Bargaining Power A PERSON 'S bargaining power consists in his ability to effect agreements on his own terms . Its measure is another 's inducement to agree on his terms . Whatever affects another 's costs of disagreement and agreement on one 's own terms thus determines one 's own bargaining power . In this chapter we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , second , its determinants . THE MEASUREMENT OF BARGAINING POWER There are two approaches to the calculation of the costs of disagreement and agreement , either of which is satisfactory and both of which arrive at the same result . Clarity will be served if we understand the differences and similarities in these approaches . Let us begin with one which differs slightly from the formulation with which we are already familiar , and end with that which we previously encountered . In this first approach the calculation of the costs of disagreement and agreement on the terms of any possible bargain incorporates the costs of disagreement and agreement on the terms of all other possible bargains . The cost of disagreement is the sacrifice of those special advantages for the achievement of one 's stream of aspirations which flow 100 // from the prospective relationship . Although as economists our touchstone remains the use and allocation of scarce resources , we can not fail to be concerned with the impact of the transfer of resources on a person 's whole goal structure . The benefits accompanying the relation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and yet be as determinative of the special advantages of this bargain , which would have to be given up if some other bargain were made , as the scarce resources which accompany it ( as represented by a wage rate , for example ) . The special advantages which are given up by not agreeing on another 's terms include advantages both of the quality of what is offered and the terms on which it is offered . If two identical products are offered on different terms , the cost of disagreeing in one case involves only a price advantage . If two products of differing quality are offered on the same terms , the cost of disagreeing in one case involves only a quality advantage . If two products of differing quality are offered on different terms the cost of disagreeing in one case may involve a quality advantage , a price advantage , or both a quality and price advantage . The cost of disgreeing on another 's terms is whatever gains in the achievement of one 's aspirations are foregone by giving up this symbiotic relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the adverse consequences to the achievement of one 's aspirations accompanying this bargain which could be avoided if some other decision were made . These are the disadvantages associated with this agreement ? what other objectives must be sacrificed to this one , what risks to present or future achievement are incurred . The disadvantages which are accepted in agreeing on another 's terms are disadvantages both of the quality of what is offered and the terms on which it is offered . Advantages and disadvantages are , however , only relative . A quality advantage possessed by one product in comparison with another may be considered a quality disadvantage in comparison with a third , and the same is true of price comparisons . Or one product may be superior in one respect and inferior in another . // Since the cost of disagreement consists in the special advantages offered by a particular bargain , the cost of agreeing on some other bargain must be equivalent to the sacrifice of the special advantage offered by the first . Since something can be considered of special advantage only with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing of this aspirational achievement involves not only a cost of disagreeing on this bargain but a cost of agreeing ( a consequence adverse to the achievement of aspirations ) on some other bargain . Let us suppose that a young man is considering the choice of a college . He is faced with the possibility of going to ABC College , which has a reputation for scholarship which would he highly advantageous to the achievement of his career ambitions but which has little social life , or of going to XYZ College , whose scholastic standing is good but not superior , but which is noted for sponsoring an extraordinarily full extracurricular program . The cost of agreeing with the authorities at ABC on the terms of his admittance thus carries , as one ingredient , the giving up of good times outside class hours , while the cost of agreeing with the authorities at XYZ carries as one cost of agreement the foregoing of a superior training . The special advantage which characterizes one choice thus becomes something which must be given up by making another choice , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs of disagreement and agreement approximates the notion of opportunity cost which we encounter in the price analysis ? the cost of a good or service is what must be given up in order to obtain it , the opportunities which one necessarily foregoes by making one decision rather than another . There has been some tendency , however , to regard opportunity costs as involving only scarce resources ? the cost of a course of action is the goods and services which could have been obtained through alternative courses of action . No such connotation applies in the present analysis . The special advantages which are given up if this bargain is not made ( the cost of disagreement ) and the special advantages which are given up if this given bargain is struck ( the cost of agreement ) relate to a person 's total stream of aspirations . // Some flow of resources must be involved , but it is not only the resources acquired or given up which determine whether this bargain or that bargain will be made , but the total effects on one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product or service which is involved , but agreement on a personal relationship , and the advantages and disadvantages which are relevant are those pertaining to the relationship , not just to the good . This relationship between the cost of disagreement on one bargain and the cost of agreement on another follows inescapably from three conditions which we have already established : ( 1 ) the number of alternatives is limited ; this is the scarcity condition ; ( 2 ) some alternative must always be chosen , some decision must always be made , in consequence of the ongoing nature of a person 's activity ( his time stream of aspirations ) and the condition imposed by interdependence ; ( 3 ) individuals in the pursuit of their aspirations make rational ( or reasonable ) choices among the alternatives presented ; this is the condition imposed by the compulsiveness of personality integration . In necessarily choosing among the limited alternatives which are presented at any moment , the rational individual must inescapably weigh the relative advantages and then sacrifice what is less important to that which is more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of disagreement on one bargaining proposal and the cost of agreement on another bargaining proposal can be made clearer by illustration . Suppose we are comparing two products or jobs . In the first instance , we have : Table In this instance it is clear that the advantage of one offering ( its cost of disagreement ) constitutes that which has to be sacrificed // when the individual chooses the other ( its cost of agreement ) . Consider a second instance : Table Here A has advantages both of quality and price which would have to be given up by choosing B. But B has no special advantages , hence offers nothing which has to be sacrificed by choosing A. ( This zero cost of agreeing with A is only in comparison with B ; because scarcity of resources prevents the satisfaction of all aspirations , there must always be a cost of agreeing on any bargain , in the light of the whole range of available alternatives . ) This method of calculating the costs of disagreement and agreement involves a consideration of the special ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action . The calculation is made with direct reference to the alternatives . Because the cost of disagreement is the special advantage offered by this bargain , any improvement in the alternatives which incorporates the advantages of this one reduces the cost of disagreement . Because the cost of agreement is the special advantages of other bargains , any unique improvement in the alternatives raises the cost of agreement . The relative costs of disagreement and agreement of the several alternatives are thus incorporated in the calculations , and from the calculations there can emerge only one bargain where the cost of agreement is less than the cost of disagreement ( that is , where the inducement to agree is 1 or greater ) . There is another method of estimating the costs of disagreement and agreement which arrives at the same result but by a different // procedure . The estimates are made independently of the alternatives , with reference only to the structure of aspirations . The cost of disagreement is the measure of the aspirations whose achievement must be sacrificed if this bargain is rejected , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must be risked or sacrificed if this bargain is made . It is not the special or unique advantages and disadvantages of each bargain which enter into the calculations but the total advantages and disadvantages . The relative costs of disagreement and agreement are thus not incorporated in the calculations but are ascertainable only by laying the ratios of all bargains alongside each other . A change in the character of the alternatives to any given bargain does not affect its costs of disagreement or agreement . Any number of bargains ( rather than just one ) may have costs of agreement which are lower than their costs of disagreement , but if choice is rational only one bargain will be chosen ? that which offers the greatest inducement to agree . This second method of calculating the costs of disagreement and agreement has certain advantages . It carries no connotation that the rational individual will in fact consider all possible alternatives , only that from among the alternatives which he does consider he will choose that which is most compatible with his aspirational structure . Moreover , it avoids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be made : in some instances the alternative is not another bargain but only no bargain ( as in the tax relationship ) , with whatever penalties disagreement entails . The cost of agreement may not be only the special advantages of other bargains which must be foregone ; in some instances the cost of agreement may be the advantages of disagreement on this one bargain , which must be laid alongside the advantages of agreement ( the costs of disagreement ) in order to determine whether the advantage lies with acceptance or rejection of the other 's terms . ( Such considerations must have motivated at least some of the American colonialists in their resistance to certain royal taxes , for example , // where the cost of disagreeing with the King 's collectors involved threat to family security but the cost of agreement involved loss of principle . ) It is this second method of calculation which we employed in deriving the inducement to act , in an earlier chapter . Nevertheless , either method of estimating the costs of disagreement and agreement is satisfactory in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because confusion is possible if one moves back and forth between these two approaches without an explicit awareness of their differences . We should remind ourselves that the costs involved , by any method of calculation , include anything which is relevant to the person 's stream of aspirations . For the economist , however , the only significance of costs lies in their influence on the flow of scarce resources , or income . ASPIRATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES It is now time to pin down the determinants of the costs of agreement and disagreement , changes in which lead to changes in bargaining power . Costs of agreement and disagreement depend on the interaction between the aspirations and alternatives of all those in the society . Changes in others ' aspirations or in the nature of the alternative which an individual constitutes to them ( an alternative worker , an alternative employer , an alternative seller of groceries , an alternative lender , and so on ) make him a more or less desirable symbiont , affecting the cost to others of agreeing or disagreeing on his terms . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own aspirations make others more or less desirable symbionts , affecting his cost of agreeing or disagreeing on their terms . It is this interaction between an individual 's aspirations and alternatives and the aspirations and alternatives of others which determines for him his position of scarcity and interdependence , which both establishes his bargainTHE // ing power at the moment and which he must manage through the exercise of his bargaining power . As we shall see , the effects of changes in aspirations and alternatives differ as between buyers and sellers . But because the analysis presented here is designed to apply to a broader category of transactions than is normally encompassed in economic theory , it is necessary to establish what is meant by buying and selling . If all transactions consisted simply of an exchange of goods or services , the terms buying and selling would not distinguish the transactors . Each would be both buyer and seller , each selling some good or service in order to buy some good or service . We would more commonly designate such a transaction as " trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or services , however , we can distinguish the transactors in terms of who gives money and who gives goods or services . The former we designate the buyer and the latter the seller . It is in this basic sense that these terms are used here . In this sense , buying and selling extends to the tax relationship or the charitable relationship or the church relationship , for example , the buyer being the taxpayer or the donor or the tither , all givers of money , the seller being the government or the beneficiary or the church , all givers of some service or satisfaction . It is as between buyers and sellers , in this more comprehensive sense , that the effects of changes in aspirations and alternatives differ . Changes in aspirations may be of four general types . 1 . We have already encountered one influence of the movement of time in a previous chapter , when we noted how the ongoing nature of a person 's life stream affects the integrated bundle of aspirations which he holds . We now note a different effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label the cultural time stream rather than a personal time stream , influencing not a person 's position in his life span but the society 's position in its evolutionary stream . Cultural change influences the aspirations which can be said to characterize a society , in the sense that there is a statistical probability of their occurring in any of its members . // Changes in culturally encouraged aspirations occur unevenly among individuals , however , so that there are always those who refuse to accept the objectives which are commonly pursued within the society . We can describe the culturally induced aspirations as the modes , and individuals ' aspirations may change by being more or less identical with the modes . At present we have little more than an impressionistic basis for establishing the cultural patterns which affect the use of economic resources , for identifying the changes in family life ( as exampled by apartment living ) , the conception of the role of the state ( as in relationship to individuals , groups , and other nations ) , the differing place of religion in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and so on . The economist is concerned with cultural changes of this nature only in so far as they affect the flow of resources , but he should be unconcerned with them only to the extent they do not affect the flow of resources . 2 . In addition , people 's aspirations may be modified by a movement along the comparative-achievement scale . Such a change is likely to be a reflection either of a shift in personal income flows or of identification with a different social group . Linder either of these influences , a family may shift its sights upward , aspiring to higherquality goods and services , or alternatively , it may be reconciled or satisfied to adopt lower material standards . 3 . A shift in the time element of the stream of aspirations is also possible . Material goals may be advanced or delayed . 4 . Finally , there may be a shift in personal taste or inclination , the idiosyncratic element of style and preference , in which color and model and shape and size ( not related to levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level of specificity of objective halfway between rational and reasonable . Changes in aspirations can come by any of these four routes . Wherever any change in aspirations occurs , it has a potential effect on the distribution of bargaining power within the system as a whole , since it potentially increases or decreases the number of indiTHE // viduals seeking certain scarce goods or the intensity with which they seek them . Changes in alternatives likewise fall into four major categories . 1 . Innovation involves the creation or introduction of something categorically new . The invention of new products for the direct satisfaction of wants or of tools for making existing products more efficiently or more satisfactorily are examples . So too is the development of new fo , ms of social organization , such as the modern corporation . So too is the introduction into one society of the products or practices of another ? cross-cultural fertilization. 2 . Imitation consists in the proliferation by others of the fruits of the innovator . The imitations need not be identical but may consist of differing species of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we commonly associate with product differentiation . 3 . Alternatives may change through discovery , which differs from innovation in that it does not involve the creation or introduction of any new product or process but the uncovering of more of something which is already familiar to us . Natural resources are the principal subject of discovery ? new lands , fresh mineral deposits , additional water resources , virgin forests , better transportation routes . 4 . Changes in the population composition involve changes in numbers , age distribution , functional skills , intelligence , sex , and location . Such changes carry a differential impact on various groups within the society , some of which are now subjected to relatively more or relatively less bidding competition from their commensal rivals in effecting symbiotic relationships either for the satisfaction of aspirations or for the provision of their own services . Let us consider for a moment this last type of change in alternatives ? changes in the composition of the population . Wherever the number of commensals increases , the relative bargaining power of each one within the group declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute increase in the number of those whose aspirations are competitive with his own ; ( 2 ) there is no increase in the num110 A GENERAL THEORY OF ECONOMIC PROCESS her of those who offer alternative means of satisfying his aspirations ; ( 3 ) there is an absolute increase in the number of those offering services ( alternatives ) similar to his own ; ( 4 ) there is no increase in the number of those whose aspirations his services satisfy . In either buying or selling the cost to the other party of disagreement on his terms declines . To the extent , then , that individuals are commensal competitors ? either in their aspirations or in the alternatives which they constitute to others ? on the basis of age , skill , function , intelligence , sex , or location , a change in the numbers or quality of these characteristics in the population affects their relative bargaining power in the particular symbiotic relationships which are relevant . An increase in the number of lawyers and a decrease in the number of engineers , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , in the absence of other change decreases the bargaining power of the former and increases the bargaining power of the latter . Alternatively we might say that such changes increase the relative bargaining power of those on whom lawyers depend and who depend on lawyers ( their symbionts ) , as , for example , the suppliers of office space in law buildings , law books , legal secretaries , and the users of legal services . Similarly , the relative bargaining power of those in symbiont relationship to engineers declines in those relationships . Such a straightforward case of " supply and demand " is readily enough incorporated within the price analysis . But other types of population changes have their similar repercussions which we are sometimes more inclined to disregard . An increase in the age group 50-59 , relative to other age groups , for example , increases the commensal competition for those jobs which ( because requiring less exertion or adaptability ) are more suited to older workers , and thus reduces the bargaining power of all in the group . A relative decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employments may raise the bargaining power of this group relative to their employers . Initially the change in age composition may also increase the commensal competition for certain types of goods or services which are sought // by older people , decreasing the demand for the goods or services more suited to younger persons . The bargaining power of those supplying the former services ( let us say geriatricians ) rises , while the bargaining power of those supplying the latter type ( let us say tennis instructors ) declines . Moreover , if we recall the time stream of aspirations which appears to characterize major groups within our society , we will remember that with increasing age the revenue and budget decisions are otherwise affected . The proportion of income saved increases as retirement becomes more imminent , and job security takes on added importance . The bargaining power of this older-age group relative to all sellers of goods and services thus rises , with heightened awareness of the risk of present expenditures to the postretirement future ( cost of agreement ) , while bargaining power relative to the buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement . If the increase in the older-age group represents a relative decline in the group of , say , 20-29 , then further consequences are likely to follow , since it is this age group which is most risk-minded , most willing to migrate to new areas , to try out new jobs , to adjust to technological innovations . This shift in the aspiration structure of the population will affect the alternatives available to others and hence the relative bargaining powers of certain groups within the society . These population changes which have just been discussed illustrate how changes in alternatives ( by any of the four routes enumerated above ? innovation , imitation , discovery , population changes ) have the immediate effect of modifying the number and quality of the alternatives available for the satisfaction of aspirations . More specifically , if the number and quality of the alternatives to some particular symbiotic relationship increase , the cost of disagreement on the terms of cooperation laid down by that symbiont declines to the extent that the special advantages which previously characterized it have been incorporated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbiont rises to the // extent that the modified alternatives offer further advantages not characterizing that particular relationship . Suppose , for another example , that Company X offers better working conditions but lower wages than any other firm in town . As between other firms and X , the worker 's inducement to agree on X 's terms ( that is , X 's bargaining power ) is given by cost of disagreement = the greater job satisfaction at X cost of agreement = the higher wages at other plants Now Company Y moves into town , offering working conditions which , while poorer than those at X , are superior to those at all other firms , and wages which are higher than are offered by any other firm . The worker 's inducement to agree on X 's terms ( X 's bargaining power ) now declines : cost of disagreement = the greater job satisfaction at X , but not greater by so much as formerly cost of agreement = the higher wages at other plants , now even higher at Y There are , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms which we have considered ) , coupled with the possibilities of change in alternatives ( also in four forms , which we have considered ) . It is the interaction between the changes of a person 's aspirations and the alternatives which he offers to others , on the one hand , and the changes in the aspirations of others and the alternatives which they provide for him , on the other hand , which defines his bargaining power in the society , and which ( considering all individuals ) distributes bargaining power among all those in the system . Our personal aspirations ( conditioned as they are by the culture ) define the existing alternatives which others offer to us , at the same time that the particular kind of service which we supply to others ( the alternative which we constitute to them ) is defined by their aspirations . It is equally true that the existing alternatives define our personal aspirations , and that the kind of alternatives we offer to others defines in part their aspirations . These are the conditions of // personal interdependence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in limited quantities will satisfy our special wants , what goods or services which we provide will satisfy the objectives of others , what jobs provide the conditions we consider important to our well-being , what kind of personal attraction we have for others that promotes an exchange relationship ? these are all aspects of scarcity and interdependence as we encounter them at the personal level . ) But the distribution of aspirations among all members of the society defines the extent to which others seek the same relationships which satisfy our personal aspirations , as well as the extent to which is wanted by others the kind of services ( alternatives ) which we offer . The distribution of alternatives likewise defines the degree to which others offer services which are similar to ours , as well as the degree to which others can satisfy aspirations similar to those we hold . These are conditions of general interdependence and scarcity . ( How many others want and how many others supply the same goods or services or satisfactions which we offer  --  these are aspects of scarcity and interdependence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these personal and socially distributed aspirations and alternatives which determines bargaining power . It is the degree of coincidence between one 's wants and offerings ( the individual component ) , on the one hand , and the extent to which these same wants and offerings are wanted and offered by others ( the social component ) , on the other hand , which measures the relative inducements to agree . If a person 's aspirations can be satisfied by numerous alternative relationships which the culture encourages , his bargaining power improves through this interdependence condition , except as this effect is offset by a competitive coincidence between his aspirations and the aspirations of others ( a scarcity condition ) . Similarly , if the services or advantages which a person offers to others in his relationships satisfy aspirations which are widely shared in the society , his relative bargaining power improves through this interdependence condition , except as this is offset by a competitive coincidence be114 A GENERAL THEORY OF ECONOMIC PROCESS tween the services he supplies and the alternatives offered by others ( a scarcity condition ) . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bargaining power is , then , strongest as buyer when he is seeking from others some service or advantage which is in general supply but which no others want , and as seller when he is offering some unique advantage ( of quality , of price ) satisfying some general aspiration . As yet there has been no systematic exploitation of the statistical data already available , let alone collection of data obtainable but not gathered , sufficient to permit a description of the aspirations and alternatives confronting the major commensal groups within our society , on which over time depend the definition and distribution of our society 's scarce resources . It is the characteristics of the interrelated budget and revenue decisions of people in common circumstances which we need to know in order to define the symbiotic relationships which are relevant to their integrated bundle of aspirations . It is the alternatives which they face ( as defined by their aspirations ) and which they oppose to others ( as defined by the aspirations of others ) which we need to know to establish the relative bargaining powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected . It is the interplay of changing aspirations and changing alternatives , over time , which we need to // know in order to give concreteness to the process by which bargaining power is redistributed within a society . INCOME AS A DERIVED DETERMINANT Changes in alternatives and aspirations affect an individual 's bargaining power in particular bargains . An increase in the number and quality of bargains affects an individual 's bargaining power in those particular bargains to which the number and quality of alternatives have improved . A shift in a person 's aspirations affects those particular bargains which are now valued more or less than formerly . As we have already seen and as we shall see again later , the effects of such changes in particular bargains may be generalized through the interrelationship of the revenue and budget decisions . But this is to say that the generalized effects work themselves out through the medium of changes in income flows . We shall find it useful to examine changes in income as a determinant of bargaining power , one which is a derivative of changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more generally in the sense of affecting whole classes of bargains . Income obviously does not change autonomously . Income movements can themselves be traced back to changes in a person 's aspirations or alternatives or in those of others with whom he is in a commensal or symbiotic relationship . Consider , for example , the revenue decision . If one 's job alternatives improve , and his aspirations incline him to take the benefit in terms of wages rather than job satisfactions , then his income will rise . A similar result may follow from a change in aspirations which prompts him to work longer hours or to prepare himself for a better job . A rise in the aspiration level of those for whom he constitutes an alternative may likewise lead to a change in income , either greater or lesser , depending on whether he constitutes a more or less desirable alternative than formerly . Or consider the budget decision . A change in a person 's aspirations ( as perhaps through contraction of a malignant disease ) may reduce his estimate of the special advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reduce his efforts to earn an income out of which he formerly had regularly set aside some sum . An increase in the demand by others for the goods which satisfy his objectives may turn the terms of bargains adversely to him and lead to efforts to augment income so that he may retain the level of his past achievement . The provision of new alternatives by others , satisfying his aspirations more fully but at a greater outlay , may have a similar effect . Income may also come from past investments , but such investments are themselves attributable to the person 's stream of aspirations at positions in the past ( inducing saving ) and the alternatives then available both in his revenue and budget decisions , including alternative investments . Thus changes in income are ultimately derivatives of either past aspirations and alternatives or present changes in aspirations and alternatives . An increase in income , so attributable to past aspirations and alternatives or to changes in present aspirations and alternatives , exercises a general effect on a person 's bargaining power . In all buying transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decline , since the risk to one 's income position attributable to any particular purchase diminishes with the increase in either money or real income . In all selling transactions ( except that responsible for the increase in income ) the cost of disagreement will fall , thus tending to increase relative bargaining power , since there is less risk to a person 's income position in rejecting the terms offered by any buyer of his goods or services . ' Let us examine these general effects more closely . Let us assume that in a relationship where X has been buying Footnote // some good from Y , Y lowers the price he is asking . This suggests that Y 's bargaining power on his original terms , relative to X , had been shown to be weak . His lowering of his terms strengthens his bargaining power by reducing the cost of agreement to X. The effect of this reduced cost of agreement is to increase X 's real income . This increases in real income then causes a reduction in the cost of agreement on other bargains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of a threat to the achievement of one 's bundle of aspirations than formerly , raising the inducement to agree and thus improving the bargaining power of those with whom X contemplates buying relationships . This is not true , however , with respect to buying transactions which would replace Y , since the cost of agreement on their terms would now include additionally the sacrifice of the real-income advantage accruing from agreement with Y. Now assume a relationship in which X is selling some good or service to Y. Y raises the terms of his offer , implying that his bargaining power relative to X had been shown to be weak ; by improving his offer he strengthens his bargaining power relative to X. X , with his improved income position , now need rely to a lesser extent on income from other sources , so his cost of disagreement in other selling transactions declines . This is not true of selling relationships which would replace that with Y , however , since in their case the cost of agreement must include additionally the sacrifice of the income advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement is reduced or cost of Footnote // agreement raised , however , the effect is to increase relative bargaining power . ' Similarly , a drop in one 's income raises his cost of disagreement in selling bargains ( since disagreement constitutes a greater threat to his level of achievement ) and raises his cost of agreement in buying bargains ( since agreement has a like effect ) . We can then generalize that in selling transactions bargaining power tends to move directly and in buying transactions inversely with changes in income . ' THE INFLUENCE OF THE PERSONAL TIME STREAM ON BARGAINING POWER The individual , in his economic activities , may be regarded as managing his inflow and outflow of income . He does this through his revenue and budget decisions , which take the form of agree-Footnote // ments with others reached on the basis of relative bargaining powers . His income flows through time , and the element of time is present in all decisions which he makes . The past makes its presence felt through the specific medium of assets , the fruits of past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The future makes its influence felt through expectations , the judgments about future bargaining power on the basis of which present choices are made . The yesterdays and the projected tomorrows are thus represented in decisions which are reached today . The inflows and outflows of the past and the expected inflows and outflows of the future thus govern the current stream of inflows and outflows . All this is ground which we have covered before . We wish now to explore how assets and expectations influence bargaining power . Assets are held in various forms , ranging from goods which are stocked for consumption in the imminent short run ( such as food on the shelf ) through goods which are used for current consumption but which have longer life expectancies ( such as household appliances , automobiles , homes , and office buildings ) , from savings which are held for specific , assigned purposes ( such as payment of the month 's bills ) through liquid funds or investments set aside for less specific but nonetheless assigned purposes ( retirement , sickness contingency , a safety reserve ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn on as opportunity dictates . As far as their effect on bargaining power is concerned , all these forms of assets have one characteristic in common : they act as a potential supplement to current income . Assets which are held in the form of goods for future use can have their usefulness extended , thus in a sense adding to income . Though provision is made out of current income for their ultimate replacement , the fact that the life of the washing machine or the adding machine has been extended by two years means that replacement costs are spread over a longer period , freeing some portion of current income for other uses . Assets which are held in the form of savings assigned for
