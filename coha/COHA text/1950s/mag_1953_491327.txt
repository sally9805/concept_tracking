We Made the Impossible Voyage By LYDIA DAVIS There were 4500 miles of open sea still to cross , and food supplies were running out . Then the Mini hit a cyclone , stood on her beam ends for days . After a month and a half , the voyagers had sighted no land , were left with nothing whatsoever to eat . PART TWO N the ninth of July the Mint was ready for sea again . In our two weeks at Kept ' Island we had plugged her many Leaks and stowed our own  --  and the Miru 's  --  belongings firmly in their places after the havoc wrought below decks by the stormy three-week passage from New Zealand . With Neil and Bill  --  our unpaid crew  --  stationed respectively on the crosetrees and the bowsprit , and with my husband , Tom , at the tiller , we worked our forty-five-foot ketch through the reef without the aid of a pilot . Old Ails-a. our temperamental auxiliary engine , chugged along happily and we negotiated the coral heads in creditably neat fashion . Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave one heart-rending shriek and stopped dead . To our great good fortune we were just outside the coral , and with the wind coming offshore , it was possible to put all sails up and race out of reach of the hungry rocks behind us . And we could n't really blame Old Aliso for letting US down at such a moment . After all , not long ago Bill had mistaken a can of water for one of Diesel oil and , before discovering his mistake , had poured in quite a large portion of the wrong brew ; Ailsa does not like water . But as we would not be using the engine for some thousands of miles  --  until we raised South America  --  Tom did not rush to drain the fuel , postponing this messy operation until we reached some cairn water . Outside Rape there was a steady breeze waiting to blow us in the right direction . As usual , however , the sees were confused and coming at us from three sides at once . so that , although now we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unsteady motion . And although the ship was dry again , the storage lockers were rattling with alarming emptiness . We had been able to get only a minimum of fresh food at Rape and for two weeks had been obliged to live on the rapidly dwindling ship 's stores . We had intended sailing straight across the Pacific from Now Zealand to Peru , so I had originally bought stores to last only eight weeks . The Yard went her and the long detour to Itapa for repairs were more than I had bargained for . It was unlikely that we could cover the 4500 miles at ill ahead in lost than six weeks , and that made eleven weeks for the whole crossing . It became uncomfortably obvious that we should have to go on rations , and to avoid this as long as possible , we cut down to two tneala each day . All the Same , wo were feeling rather smug and pleased with ourselves at the neatness of the boat when an unusually large beam-on wave tipped over the can of disinfectant wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night , and in the morning I found that the strong carbolic solution had sloshed all over our seagoing bathroom to the full height of is feet . All the paint was burned off the floors and walls , while the dark and sticky mess had run out under the sliding doors and into the main cabin , and was there merrily trickling info our shwa and socks . We had not , up till then , suffered any feelings of seasickness , but the permeating smell of carbolic soon made each of us feel very delicate indeed . John . our older son , suffered the moist , as he slept opposite the head and received the full benefit of the healthy germ-destroying odor . That smell soaked into the wood and , though we scrubbed and mopped and developed the habit of breathing through our mouths , carbolic was with us to stay . Since we had such a long run ahead of us , I made it a rule that John do his lessons every day , no matter how had the weather . Having done no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up , but he was always reluctant . Whenever he got halfway through a sum , someone on deck would about that there was a bird flying near us . In case it was something different from the usual albatross , up John would go  --  then conveniently forget to come back . When I went to inspect the results of the morning 's work , I would find that he had got exactly nowhere . I do n't know whether it was more trying for John or for me . With a great deal of shouting . smacking and protesting tears , we at least managed to finish the year 's assignment before reaching the United States . Tim also had a neat parcel of lessons put away for him . Being only five years old , he had not yet had any schooling and , after an enthusiastic first two days . during which he showed an alarming tendency to the Chinese method of reading , he decided that he did nottka lessons , would never go toschool as long as he lived and would make his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not press the point , but presented him with several packets of sticky , highly colored modeling clay and left him to work out his own salvation . Each morning I had to scrape the floors with a knife to remove Tim 's works of art of the previous day , but for the peace and quiet it brought the rest of us , it was well worth it . I could do no writing myself ; even if the boat had been steady enough for me to use it , my typewriter had hewn shut in the clothes locker for the first , or submerged , part of the journey , and although the clothes could be dry-cleaned from the rust and mildew they had collected , the poor typewriter had lost several of its parts through sheer corrosion . As David S. Davies , assistant dean of the Harvard School of Public Health , had been doing sterling work arranging magazine contracts for me , I felt thoroughly exasperated at not being able to do my share . But after all , if Harvard had n't invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail to Boston , we would n't have been here in the first place ; so perhaps it was n't entirely my fault . While at Rape , Tom had tested his radio transmitter , which had hitherto been useless because of bad weather . The radio expert there assured us that there was nothing wrong with the transmitter ; yet only one day off Raps we could not even make contact with the island , so Tom shrugged his shoulders , said rude words and blamed sun spots . We had hoped to keep contact ( Gintinticd on Page 60 ) 60 Metlgtlixed Iltra and Marled to %WPM , heettaled , and pulled at his ear . " Give you a lift ' ? " Chip called out . Well ? " An brightened .

" Huh ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I get a little extra work out here , make a little extra dough , taking tickets at the Ferris wheel . See you at the pool when I finish up . " He ambled off , and Chip squinted after him in growing bewilderment . He turned and peered at Polly . She seemed extraordinarily still standing beside the car and her face looked white , drawn , and the only movement was at her lips , the faintest quivering . " Coming ? " he said . They walked in silence , side by side , through the looping sounds of horns , bells , whistles , the muted thunder of the roller coaster , the busy clamor of a calliope , the beehive hum of the crowd . " Poll , " he said , taking her hand as they walked on . She squeezed his hand , held on to it . Her voice was small , stifled . " I do n't know , Chip . I  --  I do n't know . " " I 'll go away , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to ? ? he said . " Yes  --  no . I do n't know . I  --  I just do n't know .

Tile%TUMMY " We 'll emit , " he said , ' ' and me . " He looked down nt her and Haw in her harn14842ll eyes ? her trembling lips , all t he innovenee in the world .

Polly would come there from the five-and-ten where she worked , and they would share one of the tilled wall desks , scribbling aimlessly , while they talked . Their dates were always after dark . Sometimes they drove for an hour in the car or parked at a drive-in theater . But whatever they did , the time was always short . It was stolen , precious ; there was no lime in it for grave discussion , and as if by mutual consent . they never mentioned Art . They were waiting , seeing .

" Ca n't you read when it says No Parking ? You wan na ticket , buster ' ? " Chip could say nothing . Ordinarily he would have grinned and made some flip remark . But not that night . His throat was shut tight . He could feel himself shaking all over . " Get a move on , " the cop said . " Behave yourself . " Chip drove off carefully , waiting for the shaking to stop , and angry because he had shaken at all . The incident ballooned in his mind out of all proportion to its significance . He struck the wheel with his fist . El'ENING PoST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polly touched his arm . " I know ; I know how you feel . " " You know ! " he shouted .

It was a strange sensation , this humility ; cool , muted , of great depth . It went along with him to work , sus- ? taining him when he weakened , when the impulse to throw up everything , walk out , go away , jerked at him like a tortured nerve . Helen and Lee , he supposed , must have gone through something like this . They had wanted to tell him , but they had n't known how ; and they had put it off . Only they had n't been lucky .

He picked up the phone on the parts-department desk and called upstairs , the accounting office . " Art , meet me out front al twelve . " Art was there ut twelve , out front , his forehead wrinkled with quizzical concern , Chip walked toward him , feeling the hones in his face ache , know-ing how he must look , but not caring . " What 's wrong , Chip ? You look sick . You sick ? " " Maybe . A little . " He wished he did n't have to look at Art . He was going to hate to see Art told up , pull in his ears and slink away .

He rubbed Chip'e shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Chip who turner away , abruptly , with a blindness in hit eyes like tears . In the washroom , he shoved his head under the faucet , held it there ; blew and coughed and choked . He dried up and sat for as long as it took him to smoke a cigarette , to calm down . He felt beat up , washed out . But he got up and walked the four blocks to the general post office . " You know something , Poll : h 'm ? " he said , taking hold of her hands . " We 're going to live in Bennett Falls . " You lived and learned , all right , about people . And if you were lucky , you learned about yourself . " Home , " he said .

" WE MADE THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE ( Continued fmm Page 35 ) with America all the way , but there was so much to do aboard that any spare time was better used for catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A week out of Rapa we were becalmed for three and a half days . a calamity indeed , since for all that time we had to keep on eating into our precious stores while still getting no closer to our destination . It was too cold on deck to enjoy the spell , and in desperation Tom got Ailsa running again . We chugged along for fifty miles , using up the precious Diesel oil , on which we were relying to get us into the next port . The sea , as mad , was deserted . Only an occasional albatross or stormy petrel , inexplicably touring out in midocean , cast us a disinterested glance as it passed on to wherever it was going . Fish there were none . Once a school of whales came alongside , and we saw half a dozen porpoises . That was all . Remembering Kon Tiki 's plenitude of fish , we were disgusted , but not too surprised . Thor Heyerdahl 's balsa-wood raft had sailed west from Peru in the warm currents . We were in colder waters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas . The calm ended as calms usually do , this time with a cyclone of complicated technical formation referred to by the experts as " inverted . " It took us about ten minutes to reach the center of the storm and a full two days to move out of it , so once again we hove to , lashed the tiller and sat things out below . By this time we were rather bine &; about gales and spent the time hanging onto our bunks and read ing detect ive novels . When we finally sailed into a more reasonable breeze and had mopped the spellings - rom the galley floor , we surveyed the damage . This time it was not serious . The sail track on the mainmast was badly bent , rendering our mainsail utterly useless . We should have to wait for another calm before this could be mended , and OH , in the whole run , we had had only eight days of calm weather , we resigned ourselves to a long wait of our sugar and porridge . We were 800 miles west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we should delay further by putting in there , on the chance that they might be able to supply us with additional stores , or whether we should continue on with strict food rationing . After our experience in the lack of ship 's stores at Rape , we all decided that it was better to hurry on , so my husband lined up all the remaining stores , counted them carefully and then issued me enough for each day 's menu . For breakfast , one cup of horrible powdered soup or one scone and tea or coffee , of which we had plenty , sweet-ened with jam , as long as the jam lasted . For lunch , tea orcofl'ee as before , but this time with a teaspoon of condensed milk for each person , and a suspicion of veg-etable extract ? to be eaten smeared on the finger , as there was nothing else to put under it . For dinner we were al-lowed a feast : one third of a can of bully beef , one sixth of a can of vege-tables , one sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custard and one teaspoon ( Gonfininel on Page 62 ) ' I'llE SATE Rimy EVEN INC POST ( Gontimml frnm Page 60 ) of cummts  --  as long as the currants lest 1.41 . The children were not rationed , hut . we adidts were everlastingly hungry . unearthed n pricele:s treasure in the form of a head of goal's-milk cheers . It was forest green in color and literally crawling with livestock , but we held our breaths and nibbled pieces of it whenever we felt that we could not last another minute without food . Nleanwhile , our attitude toward t he children changed . We jostled for a place beside them at the table , in case they left anything on their plates . but the wretches knew we were short of food and savored the last crumb . We gained a respite on the first of August This was John 's tenth birthday . to be celebrated by the eating of carefully hoarded food and by our entrance onto the third and last 2000-mile chart of the Pacific . John 's birthday presents were a credit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He received a pair of laboriously constructed bathing togs from Neil , a slightly moldy but nonetheless nourishing fruitcake from Bill , two jerseys from me , half a packet of modeling clay from Timothy and a whole five-dollar bill from Tom . That day we ate splendidly , virtually emptying the freezer . Three whole chickens , green peas , the last of the potatoes , pears , and ice cream with caramel sauce . We knew that the next day we would be back onto bits of cheese again , but we were everlastingly grateful to John for having a birthday in the middle of the Starve . Our sailing during this period was only fair . In an attempt to avoid the continuous rough seas and the cold . we cut north a few degrees , but this took us straight into calms , so we had to turn right around and head back south . We wasted six days ' time  --  and food  --  in the process . The sail elide had been taken off the mainmast now and replaced with loops of rope around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail was tricky to hoist , but it came down very easily , and that of course is the operation that requires the greatest speed . We were getting easterly winds now , so the Miru was sailing herself . In other circumstances this would have been ideal , hut , having no work to do , the men spent most of their time thinking how nice it would be to have a decent meal again . That ' net chart was the longest for us . Each day Tom marked off another inch , and little by little we came closer to that wonderful parcel of land occupying the eastern side of the map , South America . About the middle of the chart Tom suddenly and mysteriously developed a case of blood poisoning , a recurrence of an old island ulcer . Given penicillin , he was soon in action again . Apart from the measles epidemic and Neil 's habit of knocking small pieces off himself , this was our first casualty in 5000 miles . On the 20th of August our food supply was down to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO we started t he 0110110 to motor the rest of I hO wiry before we were reduced to eat ing one another . Visibility had linen nil for a full 500 miles , nna it was impossible for Toni to give any position except by dead reckoning , so we all gave whoops of joy when it dead pelican floated past us . Since there are no pelicans in Western Pacific waters , we were sure now that a new country lay just behind the clouds . As usual when things started to look brighter , another emergency arose . Old Ailsa had gulped down the best of the Diesel oil . With no wind at all , our sails were flapping uselessly , but Tom , never at a loss , helped himself to the kerosene I used in the stoves , gave Allan a long drink , she said , " Thank you , phut , phut. " and on we went . As we were in the Humboldt Current now , it was bitterly cold on watch , but I scrubbed out bepw decks , scrubbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunks and started to look for land , hungrily . On the morning of the twenty-second we said good-by to the last can of bully beef at breakfast , eking this out with some appalling buns made from the debris at the bottom of the cocoa and dried-milk tins . Now our cupboard was totally bare . Being altogether without food proved a little unnerving , particularly as we did n't really know how far from land we might still be . I think we were all starting , privately , to feel a bit appalled by our situation when suddenly two Peruvians in a fishing boat sailed up out of the mist and came alongside , the first other human beings we had seen for forty-five days . We were no end cheered . In a mixture of Italian , French , Latin and Polynesian , we made them understand that we wanted to know where was Callao , the seaport which serves Lima . They waved airily to the east , gave us a fish and went on their way . That fish was in the pan almost before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks the children were fed last . At about midday , while I was below , the cockpit bell announced our landfall ; Bill and I ran a dead heat to the hatchway in our impatience for the first sight of South America . Tom , Neil and Rill solemnly shook hands all around , the children executed a war dance out on the bowsprit and I rushed below to mix cocktails for the first fools to cross that darned ocean from New 7. eala.nd to Peru . Tom swore he would get us into Callao in time for a meal that night , and we approached the coast relaxed on the deckhouse and sipping Martinis which made us sillier and more excited every minute . Tom 's dead reckoning proved to have been excellent : we were just fifteen miles south of our destination . That alone should have told us that something would shortly go wrong . Having no harbor charts of the port , we were still using the ocean chart , which gives only the coast line ; and we were just outside the port when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of breakers . Neil flew forward with the lead line , heaved it over and we gasped . The Miru draws seven feet six inches , and the lead showed only eight feet of water . " I do n't care ! " shouted Tom . " We 'll eat tonight , reef or no reef ! " Expecting every minute to hear a loud scrape and see part of our keel float out astern , we inched our way ahead . Our luck held ( Continued on Page 6-1 ) I TOE SalTIMM ( EN'ENING POST ci ' ant limed teem Page 62 ) and see were soon in the herhor , run-ning around in circles waiting for twine-one to lake notice of us . At last a tiny scull rowed up and two young men ? who turned out to be if iirvard stu-dents , of all things  --  asked if they e could please borrowit runt eh ! If he.y had asked for anything else , we would have had to decline them , but since matches are iedible , we had plenty . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destimition. they directed us into the yacht basin , where we lied up at the small wharf and prepared for our first battle with customs officials and the Spanish language . At first it seemed that . we might be chased as unwanted aliens , but the production of a letter of introduction from New Zealand 's Minister of External Affairs , the only credential we poseessed , worked miracles . We thereupon borrowed some Peruvian money from the two Harvard boys and , without stopping to change into shore clothes , made a beeline for the nearest cafil . That evening , among the six of us , we demolished four bottles of wine , six chickens , eleven peach melbas and ninety-two slices of toast , the first bread we had tasted for nearly three months . Our stay in Peru was a case of " hurry , hurry . hurry . " After her long voyage , the Miru badly needed scraping and painting as well as radical repairs to Ailsa To our consternation , we found that we were unable to change New Zealand sterling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had just 300 among us . Our spirits were therefore colt . ndingly low when , on our third evening in Lima , we went to the American embassy to took for mail , which we knew must be waiting for us somewhere . The first envelope we opened announced that the Burroughs Wellcome Drug Company , a world-wide concern with headquarters in London , had granted Tom a fellowship of $3000 to study in America . We immediately adjourned to the nearest caf ? and drank several toasts to Burroughs Wellcome . Tom was determined to go as far as possible without touching this nest egg , so we cut down our expenses and the men did practically all of the repair work themselves . This meant that we saw very little of the fascinatingly different city of Lima , which is a mere fifteen minutes ' ride by tram from Callao , since we were always either hard at work on the boat or rushing around trying to buy engine parts and paint . All the same , we soon made several friends whose hospitality was quite embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Lima , insisted on taking the children into his home for a whole week end . As they had literally not been out of my sight for four months , be will never know what a wonderful respite that was  --  for them as well as for the rest of us . And Gordon Berry , an Australian who runs a string of excellent restaurants in Lima , took the matter of provisioning ship completely out of my hands by- loading us down with luxuriously delicious food , most of it as a gift . I do n't know what we would have done without him , for the high food prices in Peru had almost driven me to distraction . Two weeks in Callao found the topsides of the Mini painted and varnished , but very little done below . However , it was then September fourth , and the School of Public Health in Boston opened on the twenty-eighth We had to move on .

From Callao we heeded for Warn in the extreme north of Peru , where we would lop off our water tanks and pick up enough fuel to take us on to Pa mime . Despite the cold wind coming off the Humboldt Current , we jogged up there without incident . Nothing crashed around , no pieces fell off the engine , non of the rigging parted . At Talara we learned that the Standard Oil Company , which owns the town , had written , inviting us to move into a furnished house and enjoy their supply of clean beds , hot water and perfect service while we were in Peru . We had missed their letter in Callao , hut , as they had taken so much trouble on our behalf , we decided to steal just one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to us . There on the edge of the desert . Standard Oil has built a model , though rather unprepossessing , town , shifted the peasants into pleasant brick bungalows and given them the same facilities as the gringo employees , an experiment that bus proved a success and a model to other employers of native labor . Much as we would have liked to stay in this onsis , our consciences were pricking over that one day off , so on we went again , still becalmed , al ill running by courtesy of Olcl Allen . Despite her seventeen years , she was putting on a good performance , although there were disturbing thumps and bumps coming from her innards and we knew she would need attention soon . We did not dare turn her off , as it was most unlikely that she would ever start again , and there was no hope of enough wind to sail into Balboa . Now there were more birds about , and plenty of fish  --  though not , for us . We kept a line out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the log , ticking off the miles astern , was too close by . We had almost reached the stage where we would have been insulted had anyone produced something sporting a fin or a scale , However , we were constantly seeing porpoises and having heard of the edibility of porpoise steaks , Tom improvised a harpoon . This gave the men all the excuse they needed to put the boat off her course , steam round in circles and ' yell their heads off every time we passed a school . But even with the aid of the .303 rifle , we never once had porpoise for dinner . On the twelfth of September we crossed the equator . Except for Neil , this was a first time for all of us , including the Miru , so Neil had spent the evening of the eleventh creating our certificates . Unfortunately , a choppy sea had developed while he was at this task , and with the increasing motion of the Miru the certificates had become progressively less artistic  --  though no Wee precious for all that .

For the children , his advent was more exciting than that of Father Christmas , and they cheerfully submitted to their duckings and emerged from the ordeal proudly brandishing their " certificates . " As we sailed north , the thermometer rose , and in addition to the porpoiseg we began to see a number of giant manta rays . One huge swordfish also put in an appearance , looming up suddenly about a yard from where I was dangling my feet in the water and permanently discouraging me from that practice . Passing by Ecuador and Colombia , we gazed longingly at the jungles that came down to the water 's edge and wished we had time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we must hurry on , and on the sixteenth , after a singularly undisastrous 1300 miles from Callao , we reached Balboa , at the Pacific end of the Panama Canal . For us , Panama was a nightmare of red tape . We could change our New Zealand money here , to be sure , but all we received for one pound note was a paltry two dollars , so it was still a cam of strict economy and a hasty cable for a little aid from Burroughs Wellcome . As we could not afford taeis , we traveled everywhere on busses , always taking the wrong one . By " traveling " I do not mean that we spun around seeing the sights of Panama . On the contrary , we toiled from one consulate to another , from the port offices of the Canal Zone to the customs office of Panama , back to where we started and then on again . Maybe it is the climate , but no one seemed to know quite what he was doing and , as we were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific to the Atlantic , this apparently raised a new set of rules with which no one seemed familiar . In New Zealand we had been advised to wait until we reached Peru before securing American visas . In Peru we were advised to wait until we reached Panama . In Panama , by e series of wrong busses , we shuttled back and forth between the Canal Zone consulate and the Panamanian consulate , where tired and disinterestedly important vice-consuls gave us no help whatever . Quite the reverse , for it now seemed that we might well lose our crew . The gentlemen in authority , while agreeing that theDaviefamily might just possibly be allowed to enter America , were quite sure that the United States could easily do without the presence of our two perfectly respectable and well-behaved offeiders . The only alternative we could choose was to ignore the muddling of the consuls and have allot US enter as the crew of a foreign ship ; ( Continued on Page 66 ) THE SATUIMAY EVENING t't 1ST , 1953 . from Vow MI we decided to risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soil . It was now the hurricane season , and everyone we met filled our ears with liair-raising stories of what would happen to us if we dared venture nut al . this I hoe of the year . Under no illusion ris I o what wort ahead of us , we were nervous about it , too , but we must hurry on . And at the moment we had a more immediate worry . We knew that the passage through the locks could he disastrous for a small boat , with the artificially agitated wit-tore pul ling her in constant danger of being smashed against the sides of the locks , so we decided to wait until the baminn hoots went through and tie up alongside one of them . Tuesday was ( heir day , and it took us until then to undo all the lovers ' knots in the red tape that had been bound around us . Furthermore , the port . authorities regarded with acute suspicion our crew of three men , one woman and two infants : so we invited a young couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . Joe Hecht was large and hefty and would impress I he pilot , while Yvonne , his wife , was so blond and beautiful that she would impress everyone . We were due to take on our pilot at 7:30 in the morning , and at that hour we started up Old Ailsa . Tom and Neil had spent perspiring hours bolting her tired old limbs more securely and giving her a general face Lift . But after waiting more than an hour there was still no sign of the pilot , and in desperation Neil rowed ashore and telephoned the port office . Though reluctant to admit it , they had forgotten about us , and it was not until nine o'clock that a senior pilot arrived aboard , rather grumpy at having been pulled out of bed to escort the somewhat down-at-heel Miru . He looked us over sourly . The men flexed t heir muscles and Yvonne smiled sweetly . The way I looked , the best I could do was to offer him breakfast . " Had breakfast , " he muttered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth to say something rude , when Neil , ever the appeaser , stretched his small height a further two inches and assured the pilot that we could take her through anything . " Might as well get along . I s'pose , " grouched our guardian angel , and Old Ailsa pulled and blowed at her six-knot best , almost bursting in her efforts to keep up with the smelly but speedy banana boat . Miraflores locks are just a few hundred yards ahead of the Balboa yacht basin and once Ailsa had caught up with the Delphia , our floating chaperon , we phutted into the locks behind two Grace liners and three fruit boats . They had all been waiting for the Miru . The trick for a small boat transiting the locks is to let a bigger boat get alongside the lock wall , then tie up to her other side , holding off with tire fenders and keeping several lines taut to her cleats , thus allowing the bigger boat to take all the humps as the water flows in . By the time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , having lost them all during the Pacific hurricane , and we had been able to acquire only two for the lock transit . The pilot stared at our equipment . " That all you 've got ? " he inquired , knowing perfectly well that it was . Never at a loss , Joe Hecht and the two boys hastily manufactured extra fenders out of old sails tied up with stray bits of rope . They cheerfully Loaned these over the rails and looked to the pilot for approval . He was not =premed . Staring enviously Fit the six beautiful fenders belonging to the Delphia , we armed Joe with a deck mop and gave him strict instructions to keep it firmly pushed against the banana hoot until told to stop . Yvonne kept smiling bravely and , early in the morning though it was , I handed our pilot n whisky while we waited for the plug to be pulled . The Miru never lets us down . With perfect dignity she rose as the water gushed in , quite putting the liners to shame as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal of unnecessary full . Neil and Bill handled our lines , Tom juggled the tiller to keep the Miru 's howe straight , and Joe pushed the deck mop with all his might and main , feeling quite one of the boys . The water swirled in fierce little whirlpools all around us , but the Miru ignored it all . As we rose inch by inch we remembered the tales of other yachts that , breaking their lines , had swung out to the middle of the locks , crashed their cross-trees first on one wall , then on the other , and finally limped out in small pieces . The pilot brightened considerably . He was obviously surprised that Tom was so willing to obey his orders . No doubt his initial grouchiness was based on a suspicion that , having already come such a long way . we would think we knew more than he about transiting the locks . But we were well aware that all Panama pilots hold master 's certificates and Tom had no intention of risking his boat for an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first lock , the pilot had changed his clothes and was happily drinking coffee and nibbling a second breakfast while chatting with his charges . Once through the three locks and into the Pedro Miguel cut , we prepared to enjoy our run through to Gatun . Just as I served dinner , however , the good Panamanian rain came down in torrents , but the pilot stuck sternly to his post on deck and spooned water out of his pork chops while Alas chugged on at her usual snail 's pace , quite oblivious of the fact that the Hechts and the captain had a train back to Balboa to catch . Just as darkness was falling we drew up to the Gatun locks , prepared to make the difficult descent out into the new ocean . As the banana boat had long since passed us , we would go down on our own this time . Another liner was on the way down ahead of us , and the pilot ordered Tom to reverse and wait until we got the " go ahead " signal from the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  nothing happened . Neil and Joe shot down into the engine room and found that something was wrong with the control shaft . There was no hope at all of going backward . Meanwhile the Miru was going around in circles , while the pilot was again getting purple in the face . Being unused to the calamities that invariably follow the Davis family , Yvonne had stopped smiling and started to bite her nails . " Well , captain , " I chirruped heartily , " if we ca n't go backward , we 'll just have to keep going forward , wo n't we ? " The pilot 's expression became more pained than ever . " Go forward you will , " he said , " but , lady , concrete s awful hard . "
