txt BUS ADVISERS URGE DELAY ON FARE RISE FOR PRIVATE LINES Rate Under 15 Cents Indicated , but Board of Estimate Is Not Expected to Act - for Month TAX ESCROW IS SUGGESTED Fact-Finders Put Cost of the Wage Award , at $2,000,000 Below Companies ' Figures By LEONARD INGALLS The Board of Estimate has been advised by the . city 's Transit Advisory Commission to delay for at least a month any decision on the appeal for a 15-cent fare by nine privately operated bus lines . It also was indicated that when the board ultimately acts it might set a fare of less than 15 cents for the private lines . The present fare is 10 cents on all but the Fifth Avenue line , which charges 12 . Acceptance of the recommendation by the board , which is exH pected at a meeting Tuesday at City Hall , would leave it up to the companies to pay the initial costs of a recent arbitration award of the forty-hour week to their 8,000 employes without the extra financial help they expected from a fare increase . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city continue to hold in escrow most of the franchise tax payments by the companies . Should the board decide to do so , this money could be refunded to the companies to help them meet the additional costs of the arbitration award . The arbitrators also awarded the employee on Nov. 18 a 26%-cent hourly pay increase and a bonus ranging from 5 to 10 cents an hour retroactive to Jan. 29 , when a four-week strike for the fortyhour week ended . The companies estimate the award will cost them $7.000,000 to $9,000,000 more a a year . Fact-Finding Agency Copies of a special report by the Transit Advisory Commission on , the situation were sent Wednesday to the eight members of the Board of Estimate . The commission is a fact-finding agency established by the board in August , 1952 , to help it in fixing fares on private lines . Its members are Edward C. Maguire , a member of the Board of Water Supply and former Deputy Commissioner of the Board of Transportation , , chairman ; Corporation Counsel Denis M. Hurley , and Daniel Kornblum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The commission told the board also that the companies first should try to cut their operating costs by reducing service before any consideration is given to their ' petition for a higher fare . In the recent arbitration award , the companies received the right to prepare schedules of bus operation without union interference . Thus unhampered , the board was told , the companies should be able to make substantial cuts in weekly man hours , which would reduce their operating costs and bring service into line with passenger volume . The Transit Advisory Commission recommended that before the Board of Estimate acted to fix a new fare for the private lines it direct them to submit an outline of economies and their new operating schedules for inspection by the commission . The commissions recommenda // tions to the board are understood to be based on an estimate that the cost of the arbitration award would be less than $5,000,000 a year tol the companies rather than their estimate of $7,000,000 to $9,000,000.1 The Board of Estimate was urged not to be hasty in deciding what fare to grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' month of December to examine the ' , facts . Since the possibility of reduction of state taxes paid by the companies also is involved , it was indicated that a decision on the fare may not come until some time early next year . State taxes paid by the companies total more than $3,000,000 a year . They also pay about $3,000,000 a year to the city . In their petitions to the city for financial relief some of the companies have asked for forgiveness of all but a token payment of the $2,000. - 000 in franchise taxes paid each year for use of the city streets . With such inexact factors involved as economies and tax relief , it was indicated that a fare of less than 15 cents could provide the necessary revenue to pay higher costs and yield a profit to the companies . The companies , on the other hand , have argued that the Transit Authority , which pays no taxes and depreciation charges , has found a 15-cent fare necessary to meet operating costs on the cityowned lines . Franchise Surrender Threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare above 10 cents on the private lines were made to the city , the companies often have hinted darkly about surrendering their franchise unless financial relief was promptly forthcoming . Action by the Board of Estimate to postpone again a decision on the fare is expected to revive these threats . To mollify the companies , the Transit Advisory Commission proposed that the Board of Estimate place in escrow all but one-half of 1 per cent of the franchise taxes to be paid by the private lines in December . This would be added to more than $500,000 already in escrow from payments of the franchise tax since last April . These funds could be returned ' to the companies to help them pay the first installment , due Tuesday of the " fetroactive hourly , ' bonus . The forty-hour week and the ** hourly wage rise , which carry with them heavier increased costs , do not become effective for any of the companies until the first week of January . Another factor that is expected to lead to an insistence within the Board of Estimate on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the campaign pledge of Mayor-elect Robert F. Wagner Jr . that he would try to bring transit fares below the 15-cent level established by the Transit Authority ' in Jab/ .

East Broadway Transit Company , Inc. , Jamaica Buses , Inc. , the Triboro Coach Company , the Queens-Nassau Transit Lines , Inc. , the Steinway Omnibus Corporation and the Queensboro Bridge Railway Company , Inc.
