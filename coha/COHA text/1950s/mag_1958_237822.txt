With short , precise kicks , the five forwards tied up the goalie with a network of passes , then finished him off with low , whistling boots . When the intracity mismatch in St. Louis , Mo . was over last week , the Kutis Undertakers had routed the Jadrans , 13-0 , and the experts were guessing that Tom Kutis had again dug up the best soccer team in the nation . <P> Last year the amateur Kutis Undertakers were good enough to win both the national amateur and open titles . This year , lively as ever , they have won all 16 of their regular season games . Short , mild Tom Kutis , a St. Louis undertaker who gets his mind off his work by sponsoring athletic teams , could not be happier about his boys . " I 'm 55 , " says Kutis , " and association with these younger fellows has kept me feeling a whole lot younger . " <P> Home-Town Boys . The Kutis Funeral Home first became a soccer patron 15 years ago when some boys asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his father gloomily agreed , saw their stark pessimism confirmed when a boy broke his leg before even a ghoul was scored . They dropped the team , but five years ago Tom Kutis decided to try again . He built his championship team exclusively from home-town St. Louis boys , although at times he has hired a European coach . " We do n't import players , " says Kutis . " St. Louis boys fit in better with our aggressive , open game . " Luckily for Kutis , St. Louis is one of the strongest American centers for a game that is Europe 's No. 1 sport , has leagues in both the parochial and public school systems . <P> To feed talent into his championship club , Kutis has a farm system of three teams ( one for adults , one for teenagers , one for youngsters from seven to ten ) . Branching out , ex-Amateur Infielder Kutis also sponsors 41 bowling teams , six baseball teams , two girls ' softball teams , and one girls ' basketball team . In all it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer team alone is worth the price , even though none of his Undertakers undertake . Best of the lot is Center Forward Bob Rooney , 27 , a beat-pounding St. Louis cop . who was a crack high school football player and for five seasons a baseball farm hand for the Cardinals . Soccer , says Rooney , gives him the biggest boot : " It 's the speed and the pretty pass work and the extra little amount of roughness . I 'm talking about really topnotch teams , though . Most people in this country see sandlot games that just look like a lot of people kicking each other . " <P> Local Equivalent . With Rooney directing the attack , the Kutis Undertakers have held their own against such jonker-teering German clubs as Augsburg and Nrnberg . " We 've been told that we 're the equivalent of a first-division professional team in Europe , " Kutis reports .
