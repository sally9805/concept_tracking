Waking up at last to an opportunity that had been knocking loudly for weeks , the U.S. responded to Soviet Russia 's vitriolic germ-warfare propaganda . The U.N . Security Council took up a U.S. resolution proposing an on-the-spot International Red Cross investigation of Communist charges that the U.N . forces had waged germ warfare in Korea . U.S. Delegate Ernest Gross challenged : " If what we say about the campaign of hate is not true , the Soviet government can show us up with ... an impartial investigation . " <P> Russia , of course , wanted no such thing . Soviet Delegate Jacob Malik used all the familiar stalling tactics-he demanded priority for an entirely different subject ( new U.N . members ) and was voted down ; he insisted that representatives of Red China and North Korea be invited into the debate , and got voted down again . Then he strolled out to the delegates ' lounge while the Council discussed the U.S. proposal . <P> When the vote came , however , Malik was quick to put his newspaper down . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malik killed it with Russia 's sist U.N . veto . Then the U.S. bounced right back with a second proposal : a resolution roundly condemning " the practice of fabricating and disseminating " the germs of untruth . Malik announced that he would veto that one , too .
