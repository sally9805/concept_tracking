BEYOND THE DREAMS OF AVARICE ( 339 pp. ) - Russell Kirk-Henry Regnery ( $4.50 ) . <P> Like a lot of intellectuals who worry professionally about the state of the world , Historian Russell Kirk does not much like the shape of things . In The Conservative Mind ( TIME , July 6 , 1953 ) , he made it plain that American conservatives had found a gifted and sorely needed spokesman . He is young ( 37 ) , he can write hardhitting prose , he is not ashamed to range himself on the side of God , custom and character , and he believes strongly in such old-fashioned virtues as duty and responsibility . His book of essays , Beyond the Dreams of Avarice , ranges in subject matter from censorship to the ugliness of British welfare-state housing , but it has a sense of unity nevertheless . Kirk has a line and it is simply this : no political nostrum can cope with the unease of modern life . Modern man must keep what is best from the past and leaven it with personal integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary , is in fact considerably more liberal than many self-proclaimed liberals . But he is rightly impatient with those intellectuals who assume " that we were all born yesterday , and that a vulgar pragmatism ought to supplant the bank and capital of traditional wisdom . " Like most honest thinkers , he values the best of man 's past and rebels against the notion " that the end of man is gratification of carnal appetite . " He is convinced that the " social order now exhibits the symptoms of advanced decay " and is moving into " an Age of Gluttony . " Who is to check the deterioration ? Not , thinks Kirk , the materialistic liberals who , like the old Russian intellectuals , thought they were emancipated when " they were merely unbuttoned . " He thinks it is a job for conservatives , and that the U.S. is the strongest bastion of conservatism left in the world . <P> Ideologies are anathema to Kirk , but he is also disturbed by the U.S. habits of " getting and spending . " Here he becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the good and full life can at the same time be a prosperous life . But he is most irked by the whining sort of U.S. intellectual who sets himself apart , " a species of dilettante who prides himself on being different , for no particular reason and with no particular duties . " The men of this breed must find Kirk a very peculiar intellectual indeed . Can he mean it when he writes that " for the Christian , freedom is submission to the will of God " ? Kirk does mean it , and this is no paradox . " We are free in proportion as we recognize our real duties and our real limitations . " <P> Kirk is too well aware of the imperfect nature of man to suppose that the world 's happiness is just around the corner . He can hardly be called an optimist , and he suffers from the built-in defect of all who distrust specific programs-he has none of his own to propose . But he has faith in the accumulated wisdom of the past , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and man that will give life a meaning it can not otherwise have .
