After two years of exchanging glares and stares instead of goods , the U.S. and Argentina finally came to a working agreement last week . For both countries the new understanding meant a major change in policy . Said Secretary of State Dean Acheson at his press conference : it is " entirely natural " for the U.S. to be considering a loan to Argentina . <P> Before the new understanding , the U.S. had steadfastly refrained from offering help to the tottering Argentine economy , in the pious hope that the need for assistance might persuade Peron to restore full civil liberties and stop acting like a cut-rate dictator . For better or worse , the new U.S. policy would be to help Argentina get up on her feet first , and worry about internal reforms afterward . <P> Architect of the new policy is Assistant Secretary of State Edward G. Miller Jr. , who conferred with Peron in Buenos Aires in February ( TIME , March 6 ) . " We hope that once Argentina is on her feet , civil liberties , as we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Meanwhile ... we 've got to do something positive . . . We 're going ahead with it . " <P> Miller 's " something positive " would probably involve the underwriting by groups of U.S. banks of Argentina 's piled-up commercial dollar debts ( about $100 million ) , plus the grant of credits to American farm-machinery manufacturers to finance badly needed exports to Argentina . Selling the new policy to bankers and the <P> Department of State was made easier by the work of brisk , friendly Argentine Treasury Minister Ramon Cereijo , who came to Washington a month ago for the purpose . <P> Cereijo assured U.S. businessmen that Argentina would welcome private U.S. capital and would treat it fairly . To demonstrate its change of heart from the old yanqui-baiting days , his government had already taken steps to : <P> Allow Pan American Airways and Panagra to transfer a backlog of profits earned before October 's devaluation of the peso into dollars at pre-devaluation rates . <P> Grant U.S. oil companies dollar exchange for enough crude oil to keep their Argentine refineries going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Allow new U.S. movies to come into the country again . <P> Argentina 's willingness to give quid pro quo was the decisive factor in convincing the State Department that Miller 's , new policy could work .
