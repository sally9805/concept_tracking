In tropical climes , an indispensable rejuvenator to hard-working British colonials is gin &; tonic . The tonic has always meant Schweppes , a bitter , effervescent quinine water supposed to ward off malaria &; malaise . Last week Schweppes took steps to colonize the U.S. It made a deal with Pepsi-Cola Co. giving Pepsi sole rights to bottle Schweppes in North America , and Schweppes will buy Pepsi 's plants in England . Within a few months , Schweppes hopes to ship its concentrate to the U.S. , cut its price from 40 to about 15 for a 10-oz. bottle , and be selling as much quinine water in the U.S. as its entire competition combined ( about 1,000,000 cases ) . <P> Besides providing needed dollar income for Britain , the deal will help Schweppes ' sales at home . Said Managing Director Frederick Collins ( " Eric " ) Hooper last week : " The world 's palate is getting sweeter . . . Where in some classes it used to be only beer , and in others spirits , now they are drinking more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplorable-but commercially it 's wonderful . " Schweppes , which does 46% of its business in tonic and the rest in a variety of mixers &; soft drinks , thinks Pepsi production will give it a big new product to satisfy Britain 's craving for sweeter drinks . <P> Old Remedy . Swiss-born Jacob Schweppe first began making soda water in his Bristol chemist 's shop in 1794 . Quinine water , which Schweppes concocted in the 1860s , so appealed to British taste that by 1903 Schweppes had factories all over the empire . World War II cut off sugar supplies and stopped production ; when the factories started up again in 1948 , sugar rationing kept sales flat . <P> The man who put the fizz back in is effervescent Eric Hooper , 60 . Trained as a botanist , Hooper " wandered about for a time , " met Department Store Magnate Frederick James Marquis , now Lord Woolton , and went to work for him without knowing what business Woolton was in . " When I showed up and found it was a shop , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Schweppshire Lad . By 1940 Hooper had succeeded Woolton as managing director of Lewis 's , Ltd. , Woolton 's chain of department stores in northern England . In 1942 Hooper quit . " It was very rejuvenating , I thought , to chuck it all in the bag at 50 and start something new , " Hooper explains . The something new was to mix in Tory politics ( at which he still worked closely with Woolton ) . He became public-relations director for the Ministry of Works , and later boss of Britain 's veterans ' resettlement program . He started his own firm of business consultants and , with Julian Huxley and C.E.M . Joad , was on the panel of BBC 's famed Brains Trust program .
