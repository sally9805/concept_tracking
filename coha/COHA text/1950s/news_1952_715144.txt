txt Mr. Eisenhower met recently with a committee he appointed to try to reorganize the executive branch of the government . We believe that efficiency comes first from efficient men , a view we have expressed in these columns before . But we also believe that efficient men can do a better job when they are n't harassed by too much red tape , duplication of effort or foggy planning . A lot of evidence of foggy planning and duplication effort  --  as well as doubling of the burden on the taxpayers ? can be found in our overseas aid pro-grams ? Here 's one example : The Technical Cooperation Administration , an arm of the state department , draws funds from the Director of Mutual Security . The Mutual Security Agency draws funds from the same source . Both of these agencies are spending funds in grantaid programs for the hire of technical experts for the procurement of millions of dollars worth of commodities  --  consumers ' goods and capital equipment . In a general sort of way , their objects are the same : To strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't a single agency do this double-job better ? Let us take another example . The Export-Import Bank makes loans in the Philippines simultaneous with MSA grants and with grants from various United Nations agencies , to which the United States is a heavy contributor . Of course a case can be made that these include both loans and grants and that MSA and the U.N . do n't make loans and the Export-Import Bank does n't make grants . But a different case can also be made . and that is that most of these funds come from United States taxpayers and that they are entitled to efficient expenditure . The fact is that efficient expenditure can not be come by when two or three or more agencies are doling out aid funds for the same purposes . If Santa Claus came down the chimney three or four times on Christmas Eve , he 'd leave a lot of duplicate presents and when he later checked his books he would find that it had been ayery costly procedure . But even Santa comes down each chimney only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
