It seemed to be a victory for everybody . Iran regained its main source of revenue ; Britain salvaged a handsome reward from what once seemed a total loss ; the U.S. found itself participating for the first time in one of the world 's richest oilfields . More than that , a strategic chunk of the globe 's surface was made safer from Communist penetration . Last week , in the cool garden of Elah-yeh Palace outside Teheran , Iran 's Finance Minister and a U.S. oil negotiator put their initials on a settlement of the vexed Anglo-Iranian oil dispute . A formula had at last been found by which a combine of eight of the world 's largest oil companies ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) will operate Iran 's nationalized oil industry , splitting the profits on a 50-50 basis with the Iranian government . " Indeed gratifying , " said President Eisenhower . " A major contribution , " said the British government . <P> Mossadegh 's Folly . It had been more than three years since the wild man of Iranian politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started his country on the road to economic and political ruin . Undoing the mischief and getting the disputants back together took skilled diplomacy . Iran 's young Shah and his strongman Premier , General Fazlollah Zahedi , had to operate in an ugly , xenophobic climate created by demagogues and Communists . Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. ( owned 53% by the British government ) was unwilling to assent to any agreement that seemed to reward illegal seizure , for fear of the effect it would have on other Middle East rulers . <P> Mediators , led by Engineer Herbert <P> Hoover Jr. , found a happy solution . Last week 's pact in effect recognizes the transfer of full title of the British-built billiondollar industry to the Iranian government , at a cost to Iran that is a fraction of its real value . This should mollify Iranian nationalists . For giant Abadan , the world 's largest refinery , and its huge network of affiliated production facilities , the Iranians will pay Anglo-Iranian a mere $70 million in compensation . <P> Britain 's Reward . But in fact , Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real compensation to Anglo-Iranian will be borne by the other seven oil firms joining the consortium . For the privilege of a share in exploitation of Iranian oil , the seven ( including America 's Jersey Standard , Gulf , Texas , Socony Vacuum and Standard of California ) will pay Anglo-Iranian about $600 million . In addition to this compensation , Anglo-Iranian , with a 40% interest in the new consortium , will still be the dominant oil operator in Iran . So Anglo-Iranian has cause to be reasonably content . <P> When Abadan shut down , there was a world shortage of oil . Since then , other producers have more than made up Iran 's loss , and currently there is a market surplus of oil . Some of the nearby oil-producing countries will have to cut back production to make room for Iran . Most of the Iranian production will go , as it did before , to Asian markets , not the U.S.
