txt The ' chairman of the Federal Corn-i munications Commission told Congress today that his regulatory agency was powerless to take action against rigged television quiz shows . John C. Doerfer , the chairman , branded the fixing of the , shows as fraudulent , but he said that neither the commission nor the District Attorney 's office in New York had been able to " pinpoint any legal violations . " Mr. Doerfer told the House Special Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight that the major ' barriers to action by the commission were the constitutional guarantee of free speech and the ban in the Federal Communications Law against censorship by the F. C. C. F. C. C. Attacked Subcommittee members were sharply critical of what they regarded as the commission 's failure to undertake an independent investigation of the quiz shows and its failure to warn Congress that the American public was being deceived . Representative Oren Harris , Democrat of Arkansas , the subcommittee 's chairman , said he regarded the F. C. C. testimony as the " most pertinent part of our hearings . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out their jobs as Congress intended and whether new enforcement legislation is needed . As the three-and-a-half-hour session ended , Mr. Harris told ' reporters that he still had not ' had " any contact or word " from Charles Van Doren as to whether he would appear before the subcommittee . Investigator Sent Here It was learned that the subcommittee had sent an investica tor to New York to look for Mr. Van Doren , who won S129 , - 000 on " Twenty-One . " one of the quiz shows mentioned in the inquiry . A subcommittee source said the staff investigator had been searching for Mr. Van Doren , a Columbia University English instructor , in several places , including the Greenwich Village home of his father , Mark Van Doren , educator and Pulitzer Prize poet . Mr. Harris declined to say today whether the subcommittee had issued or would issue a // subpoena for the young Mr. Van Doren . Asked whether he thought Mr. Van Doren should testify before the subcommittee , Mr. ' Harris said , " Personally , yes . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all the public and private testimony he had heard , on whether Mr. Van Doren 's quiz questions had been fixed . He responded : " I might . but I 'm not stating : it . " He said he felt Mr. Van Doren should appear " because he went to the grand jury in New York and made a denial , and sent us a telegram and the committee has invited him to explain further . " Mr. Van Doren , in his telegram to the House panel last Wednesday , reiterated previous denials that he participated in any fixing and asked an opportunity to be heard . The subcommittee wired an invitation for him to appear Thursday or Friday . Last Thursday , Mr. Van Doren was relieved of all his work assignments by the Na- ' tional Broadcasting Company. , He has a $50,000-a-year contract with the network as a consultant technician commen- ' tator . Mr. Harris also said that Dan Enright of Scarsdale . N. Y .. an ; originator of several quiz shows , including " Twenty-One . " would return on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Harris declined to amplify the statement . Some Testimony Secret Mr. Enright testified yesterday that he had approved the giving of questions and answers in advance to contestants on an-I other of his shows . " Tic Tac , Dough , " but there was no testi-I mony from him on " Twenty-1 One . " He had talked of " TwentyOne " in an executive session requested by him under a House rule that permits secret sessions , for testimony that might tend to defame , degrade or incriminate individuals . The subcommittee has not voted to release the secret testimony of Mr. Enright and that of Albert Freedman , producer of the now defunct " TwentyOne . " Mr. Harris said it probably would do so later . The subcommittee meeting scheduled for Monday is for - officials of the Federal Trade Commission . which has told the House investigators it believed it had no jurisdiction over the ' quiz shows . It said its power . extended only to the advertising and that no violations had been : found in this area . Mr. Doerfer told the subcom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conclusions on : how to solve the problems raised by the fixing of quiz shows or what . if any . legislation should be developed to meet the situation . Law 's Limits Noted " There are many things that are fraudulent . deceitful and reprehensible that the law can not reach , " he said at one point . in an exchange with Represent-I ative Walter Rogers , Democrat of Texas . " I think that for the commission to intimate to the , American people that it has the ; power to deal with a situation that is beyond its power is as much a deceit as what has been . going on . " Sometimes you have to en-1 dure evils : you ca n't have ' everything perfect . " Mr. Rogers demanded to know whether he thought the F. C. C. had a " blanket to permit the American people to he deceived , " and why the commis- ' sion had not gone to Congress : when it learned of the quiz show ' rigging . " To tamper with our cherished freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I would never recommend adoption of a law that wouk ' surpress something by unconstitutional means . " Mr. Doerfer modified a position he had previously held that it would be " vain effort on the ' part of Congress " to try to . write a law that would cover ' the current situation . He said that he was " inclined to consider very carefully " a Congressional effort to rectify tile ' situation in light of the quiz , scandals . He said he had felt earlier that the commision could reach the deception such as practiced ! on some quiz shows through the ' stations it licensed , because the F. C. C. would consider their i records when they applied for cense renewals . Under questioning , . he noted the difficulty of getting at pro-i ducers of the shows because ' many producers were not connected with the stations or net- ? works . He also noted that the networks had denied knowing of . the rigging but had acted quick-. y after the scandal had broken . " But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensee station : were a part of the deception , I would say that the licensee was in very serious trouble . " In this connection , he said he was ready to consider the licensing of networks that fell under the jurisdiction of the ; commission only because they ; also held licenses for individual ! stations . To a suggestion that the TV I programs be required to stats ! at the outset of each program that no deceit was involved as a protection to the viewing public Mr. Doerfer responded : would detract from the enjoyment of the public if someone stood up every half hour , raised their hands and said , ' We solemnly represent to the public that this program is what it purports to be and no deceit is involved . " " It 's ridiculous , " he added . Representative John E. Moss , Democrat of California , challenged Mr. Doerfer 's statement that action against TV programs might be similar to censoring newspapers , novels and magazines . Mr. Moss asserted that Congress had no authority ' o license newspapers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the licensing of the . airways . He also said the Securities and Exchange Commission protected the public by passing on prospectuses that described the issuance of stocks and - other securities . ' Derelict in Its Duty ' After the hearing , Mr. Moss ' asserted that the commission ihad been " derelict in its duty " to police the quiz shows and that Mr. Doerfer 's testimony had been " shocking . " It showed , he said . " a reluctance to regulate , where regulation is required . " Mr. Moss also suggested to Mr. Doerfer that the commission could " insure standards of conduct " on TV shows by rules and regulations . " And I 'm not talking about censorship , " he added . Mr. Doerfer acknowledged that the commission had not undertaken to sample contestants ' of the quiz shows that had been fixed . He said it had written letters to the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System when the fixing came co light . " We went to the sponsors , the producers , " he said , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're trying to get a complete picture . " This position drew the fire of subcommittee members , who commented that the study might take a long time and that the conditions shown by the quiz show fixing could continue to deceive the public . He said the commission ' had declined two requests front the New York County Grand Jury for a member to testify . He said the grand jury was told last February that the commission had not concluded its own inquiry and had no answers that would be " meaningful " to the grand jury . The F. C. C. chairman also cited court cases that he said had " bedeviled " the commission in its efforts to get at lotteries by TV . In 1954 , he said , the Supreme Court had ruled that participation of a " home owner by simply listening to a broadcast " did not constitute the " consideration " element of a lottery . And in the quiz show rigging . he said , " the most important legal element was missing . " That element , he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property from somebody and caused harm to somebody . " Mr. Doerfer read a prepared statement in which he related how the F. C. C. first became aware of any fixing , in an affidavit received on July 31 , 1958 . It regarded questions and answers given to a contestant on " Dotto , " a show taken off the Columbia . Broadcasting System ITV network by the sponsors because of the fixing .
