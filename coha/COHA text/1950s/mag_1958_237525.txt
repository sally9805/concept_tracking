Most unfortunate feature of the moon 's climate is its airlessness , which will always be hard on humans who try to colonize the moon . Last week Dr. Peter A. Cas-truccio , director of Westinghouse Electric Corp . ' s newly formed Astronautics Institute , pointed out one way to turn the moon 's lack of atmosphere into an asset . Manufacturers of electronic tubes , he said , go to pains to pump air out of them so that the air will not interfere with the electrons . On the moon this is not necessary . The whole moon has a better vacuum than any manmade vacuum tube . <P> One of the major needs of a lunar colony will be electric power . Importing chemical fuel would be prohibitively expensive . Even a nuclear power plant would be an almost impossible cargo for earth-moon transportation . But the moon 's vacuum , says Dr. Castruccio , makes conventional power plants unnecessary . The essential parts of a photoelectric tube , which on earth must be enclosed in vacuum-tight glass , can be laid out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity whenever sunlight hits them . <P> Castruccio 's lunar power plant ( which he calls an " electron farm " ) is nothing but a thin plastic sheet coated with cesium or some other material that gives off electrons when struck by light . On earth these electrons would get nowhere ; they would be captured immediately by atmospheric atoms . On the airless moon the electrons could be collected by a wire mesh . Flowing out of the mesh , they would form a direct electric current . <P> According to Dr. Castruccio , a one-acre electron farm will produce 1,200 kilowatts , enough to run 20,000 60-watt light bulbs . The plant will weigh 1.7 Ibs. per kw and cost ( on earth ) $3.50 per kw . Since the farm can have any desired acreage , Dr. Castruccio feels that power supply should not be a principal problem for a lunar colony .
