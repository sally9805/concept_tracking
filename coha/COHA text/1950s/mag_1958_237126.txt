Medicine is growing ever more efficient in curing the ills of the human race . But is it simultaneously weakening the race by ensuring the survival of the unfit ? The question , largely academic in Nietzsche 's day , is being raised anew by a man who has done as much as anyone to help human survival : Rene Jules Dubos , pioneer in microbiology , whose discoveries opened the era of antibiotics . <P> " For the first time in the history of living things , " said Dubos in Omaha , " we are allowing the survival of large numbers of biological misfits , many of whom will become a burden for society . . . All kinds of hereditary defects that used to be rapidly eliminated by evolutionary selection are now being reproduced in our communities . In other words , we are allowing the accumulation of defective genes in the human stock by providing a type of medical care that permits those suffering from hereditary disease to live longer and to have children . This policy may constitute a step toward racial suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our religious convictions and present-day ethics . " <P> Retorted President Holland T. Jackson of the American Academy of General Practice : " Who are we as doctors to say who shall survive and who shall be left by the wayside ? We should not try to play God , ever .
