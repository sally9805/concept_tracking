The President of the U.S. hoisted the signals for a reappraisal of one of the fundamental policies of his Administration : the longstanding U.S. quarantine of Communist China . Last week , reflecting his own personal convictions , mounting pressure from such trade-strapped allies as Britain and Japan and the pleas of some elements of U.S. business , he made it clear that he believes that present tough trade restrictions on Peking are not realistic for the long pull . <P> He said as much at his weekly news conference in reply to a double-barreled question about 1 ) the " durability " of U.S. relations with the Chinese Nationalists on Formosa , and 2 ) the " possibility " of reopening U.S.-Red Chinese trade . U.S.-Formosan relations , said the President , " are unchanged as a result of the Taipei riots as of this moment , and so far as I know , no one has suggested any change . " As for trade with Peking , the embargo against it is a matter of " law " and " so long as that law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " * Correspondents quickly noted that he did not exclude a reconsideration of the U.S. embargo . Declared Ike . after briefly summarizing the arguments for and against relaxation : " Frankly , I am of the school that believes that trade in the long run can not be stopped . You are going to have either authorized trade or clandestine trade . " <P> The Important Front . The President 's remarks were anything but spur-of-the-moment observations . To begin with , he had been surprised that both Congress and the press had taken the unilateral British decision to resume nonstrategic trade with Peking ( TIME . June 10 ) with such equanimity . Since he is personally more or less in sympathy with the British position that the European front is the really important one in the cold war , he deemed it reasonable that trade restrictions on Red China-growing out of the Korean war-need no longer be tougher than restrictions on Russia . Said one White House staffer : " Let 's face it . Behind the President 's remarks is his very real thinking that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water downhill . Every dam must have its outlet . " <P> The President 's remarks gave an enormous boost to some of his advisers who believe that the U.S. should join in Red China trade . Leader of the pro-trade forces is Chicago Industrialist Clarence Randall , chairman of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy . Among his most potent arguments , as Ike summarized it at his press conference : " Trade in itself is the greatest weapon in the hands of a diplomat . " Ike 's chief economic adviser , Gabriel Hauge , sympathizes with the Randall view . There are also followers of this line of reasoning within the State Department itself ; e.g. , Under Secretary of State Christian Herter and Deputy Under Secretary Douglas Dillon accept it , at least in theory . CIA Director Allen Dulles , brother of the Secretary of State , is also in favor . Among Allen Dulles ' reasons : even a trickle of U.S.-Red China trade would give his agents great intelligence opportunities in Peking .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
