txt Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden left London today on a threefold foreign mission that will keep him abroad for two weeks . During his absence Mr. Eden will : 1 . Speak to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on Britain 's relations with the supranational organizations now taking form on the Continent . 2 . Hold extensive conversations with Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia . 3 . Visit the Austrian Government . As he was leaving London , Mr. Eden was confronted with a new situation in Western Europe that seemingly had not been anticipated some months ago when he proposed that the Council of Europe should provide the legislative framework for tlA Schuman coal and steel pool and the embryonic European Defense Community . ? His idea was that nations such as Britain that will join the Schuman pool and the defense community might be associated with them through the Council of Europe , that the Council might embrace in one association both sovereign nations and those banded together . in supranational enterprises . Yesterday , however , the Parliamentary Assembly of the six Schuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg  --  decided to start work immediately on a federal constitution for a political union among themselves , a project more advanced and concrete than anything , hitherto undertaken in Europe . In its resolution the Parliamentary Assembly of the Schuman plan expressly declared that it was " inspired by the British proposals advocating links as close as pos- sible between the future political community and the European Council . " Mr. Eden will address ' the Assembly tomorrow evening s.ndspresumably offer some ideas ? on the problem of harmonizing the relationships of the federalist and nonfederalist nations . He was accompanied on his night to Strasbourg , France , by Anthony Nutthig , cUnder Secretary for Foreign Affairs , who will lead the British Government delegation at the European Assembly . On Wednesday , Mr. Eden , . accompanied by officials and advisers , will fly on to Belgrade for his first meeting with the Yugoslav Premier . The Foreign Secretary will be Marshal Tito 's guest for two days , and they will conduct a general- review of problems of mutual interest . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgrade with any formal proposals ; his object is simply to exchange views . The two statesmen will- discuss Yugoslavia 's relations with the North Atlantic Treaty nations , her needs in the way of arms equipment and financial aid from the West , her mutual defense discussions with Greece and Turkey and of . course her quarrel with Italy over Trieste . Thus far , Britain , along with the United States and France , has contented herself with admonishing and exhorting Italy and Yugoslavia to get together and settle the future of the disputed Trieste territory by negotiation . There is no reason to suppose that Mr. Eden has any other policy at the moment . He particularly does not want to give the impression to Rome that he is going to Belgrade to cook up a deal with Marshal Tito . Mr. Eden will inform Italian Premier Alcide De Gasperi of his intentions at Strasbourg and listen to Signor De - Gasperi 's views before meeting Marshal Tito .                    @
