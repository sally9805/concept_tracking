Teak was the name of the first of two high-altitude H-bombs set off by the U.S. over the Pacific near Johnston Island last summer . Lifted 40 miles above the earth by a Redstone missile , the bomb was detonated a few minutes before midnight . Out of the blackness came a fireball that grew to eleven miles in width in less than half a second and could be seen in Hawaii , 700 miles to the northeast . Its multicolored aurora was observed 3,000 miles away in Samoa . Some nights later a similar device , called Orange , was fired from 20 miles up . <P> Finally releasing details last week , the Department of Defense and the AEC called Teak and Orange " by far the most spectacular shots ever fired by the U.S. " They were also the first megaton ( i.e. , equivalent to 1,000,000 tons of TNT ) bombs ever exploded by the U.S. in the stratosphere . <P> The results were awesome . One objective was to measure the capacity of the highenergy , high-altitude explosions to cause " eclipse blindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have most often happened to people who watch eclipses of the sun without protecting their eyes . Rabbits were chosen as the test animals . AEC scientists found that an explosion the size and height of Teak delivers its thermal energy in less time than a rabbit ( or a man ) can blink . Said the report grimly : " Retinal burns were produced in the rabbits at distances up to 300 nautical miles . " This tended to support earlier Army research indicating that an atomic fireball bursting over a battlefield at night could produce mass blindness in soldiers scattered over a vast area . <P> Data on the electromagnetic effects of the blasts showed that the upper atmosphere was so disturbed by ionizing radiation " that some radio waves were absorbed or scattered " for hours afterward . Result : communications were upset or blacked out over an area " at least " 3,000 miles in diameter . Obvious conclusion : a megaton bomb exploded high overhead just ahead of an all-out missile attack could disrupt vital defense communications for a few crucial hours . <P> A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the even wider possibilities suggested by Project Argus-the series of bombs exploded late last summer 300 miles above the South Atlantic that sent a shell of charged particles racing round the world . A nuclear bomb exploded over the Indian Ocean , Pentagon officials told the committee , could theoretically disrupt radio communications in Moscow , some 7,000 miles away . Similarly , a blast set off high over the tip of South America could interfere with communications in the Washington area . But to make such interference effective , bombs much larger than Project Argus ' relatively small 1.5 kiloton bombs would be required .
