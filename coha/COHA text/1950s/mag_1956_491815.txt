The Wolves in Our Tent By day , Lady and Trigger were playful pets . But at night they became bloodthirsty hunters , causing the author and her husband to wonder , When will they turn on us ? By LOIS CRISLER My husband , Cris , and I went to the Brooks Range , the wild , uninhabited mountains of Northern Alaska , to make a motion picture of caribou . During our stay there we adopted two wolves and tried to raise them as pets . It was quite an experience . Eskimos had taken the wolves from their den when they were puppies three weeks old , and given them to us . We penned them at night , but never tamed or trained them . By day , they roamed the tundra with us , a boundless expanse flowing for thousands of square miles , uninhabited except for a few Eskimo families camped ninety miles away . Here the little wolves began to teach us wolf nature . They disappointed us , because they were not submissive like dogs ; and charmed us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , They became our pals . Still , there was a question in our minds . Would they turn on us someday without warning ? When Trigger and Lady were pups , and we were the stronger ones , all was well . But by October , when they were more than half grown and weighed about sixty-five pounds each , we began to feel uneasy . Trigger especially mystified me . He was a lordly , handsome gray wolf , but there was something sidelong about him . His sister , Lady , a black wolf , was gay and fearless , and utterly straightforward . No shyness hid her native intelligence . Lady was nobody 's wolf ; she chose when she would play with us . Trigger was Cris ' wolf . A rare , strange companionship grew up between these two males , but no day passed when Trigger did not growl at me. camp . We shouldered our final back packs , put leashes on the wolves and went toward the lake . To our surprise , the wolves fed easily . A high bank concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the alien activity . Taking Trigger , Cris went down to help thc pilot load our pile of dunnage . Lady strained against the Ieash to escape . If I had fallen , she would have dragged me . Then she stood still , staring over the tundra and the bright mountain world that had been her home . Here she had leaped with Trigger in play ; here they had dug for the mice called voles . Wild with delight , they had shoveled their noses in the first srunv and found treasure to race with  --  the dropped eagle 's feather , the shed caribou antler . Lady whirled and leaped despairingly at my face . I shouted for Cris . He put Trigger 's leash in the pilot 's hand , and came . He dragged Lady to the plane . Meanwhile , Trigger had bitten the pilot twice . Our wolves had turned  --  how deeply and permanently we did not realize . On the flight out , Lady lay motionless , her face in a corner . Trigger crouched by Cris ' knee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waited there a few days for a plane to Point Barrow , where we were to winter . The two wolves refused to eat , refused to let us touch them . At Barrow , Cris chained the wolves in front of our wanigan , one of a row of four or five wanigans beside the airstrip . A wanigan is a narrow shack on runners ; it can be drawn by tractor across snow or tundra . Ours had been the cook 's galley . One end was nearly filled by the cookstove , the other by an improvised bed . A counter stood between bed and stove . There was a narrow aisle ; tight quarters these , for two people and all their gear . Outdoors there was constant activity during the " day , " which was dark except for a few hours of twilight . Eskimos from Barrow village four miles away , working at the airstrip , snow weasels roaring , on some days a plane or two landing  --  all terrified the wolves . Cris said , " Lois , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves , one at a time , toward the open door . They shot under the bed , seeing it in a flash as it den . Cris , talking quietly to them , ventured a hand and unsnapped their chains . The two hostile wolves were at libcrtywith us in the wanigan . They lay quietly under the bed , except that each time we sidled past , Trigger bit our ankles . The den had become his property , and he resented encroachment . Cris hung a tarp over the side of the bed , giving the wolves and our ankles more seclusion . The next night we were awakened by cold noses touching our faces . There was the smell of wolf fur , like the smell of clean hay . Shadowy forms prowled about our bed . " Is that you , Lady ? " we quavered . " Is that you , Trigger ? " Cris got the light on . The wolves , thoroughly recovered from the horrors of their plane ride , were prepared to take thc wanigan to pieces . Trigger stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped over Cris ' cameras , reared almost to the ceiling , paws on the counter , and looked purposefully into the kitchen end of the wanigan . Then he burrowed his chin in the softness of our sleeping bag . One leg , then all four legs snuggled on top . Trigger , always a luxury lover , had found new luxury . At first we were amused . Cris got up and fed the wolves ; for the first time in days they ate . Trigger , with his bloody bone , leaped onto the bed , He felt me move inside the sleeping bag and lunged at my face , snarling . His eyes flared black and brilliant . There was no time to think . I instantly began to talk " wolf . " In Lady 's brilliant , complaining voice , like that of a peevish woman , I said , " Do-o- n't , Trigger ! " The wolf 's clear , intelligent eyes brushed mine . Cris took the cue . He began to coax . Trigger caught on . He got off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was for us alone . Another eerie adventure occurred at Christmastime . I had received several bottles of perfume . Before retiring , I stroked some on my forehead . I was awakened in the night by a hard , hairy jaw stroking my forehead . Then a wolf 's chest began rolling over my face . Cris got the light on . It was Trigger , in ecstasies over the perfume . Cris was interested . " Get some of that stuff for me , " he said . We perfumed our hands and let the wolves roll on them . Their eyes flashed , their white teeth showed . " I like to see them enjoying themselves , " Cris said . " Let 's get a pint for the wolves . " One morning Lady was in the wanigan when Kobuk , a white dog she liked , came by . She darted out after him , into the blackness , dragging her short chain . We were not much concerned , knowing she would not desert Trigger . What we did n't know was that Kobuk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile off , where other dogs lived . Lady did not return . After some hours , Cris put on his parka and went to search for her . When he came back , he said , soberly , " I did n't realize the Eskimo fox traps were so near . They 're lined up all along the airstrip and the lab area . " He searched again , returning once in a while to see if Lady had come home . He looked tired and white . At noon he telephoned a fifty-dollar reward notice to Barrow village . At four o'clock , when darkness had come again , he raised it to seventy-five dollars . I bathed my eyes and resolved not to cry any more , If only she died quickly end cleanly , I thought . Dean , our only neighbor , came over in the evening . He said , " A wolf is worth eighty-five dollars dead in the village . " Cris raised his offer to a hundred , and Dean went home to telephone the new February 4 , 1956 price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came back . " A native boy saw a ' big black fox ' in a trap , " he said . " The boy does n't speak English . Art Eskimo is bringing him here in a snow weasel . " The two Eskimos , with Dean and Cris , set nut into the night , riding the weasel . I waited , and prayed . If it really was Lady in the trap , when she saw the yellow headlights of the weasel rolling toward her in the night . she might tear her leg loose and escape , injured , never to return , After a while , Dean 's rosy face appeared at the door window . " Do you want to come , Lois ? " " Is she badly hurt ? " " No . " Outside , the snow weasel stood at Dean 's door . Cris , in the back , pushed a dark mass toward me . " Can you take Lady ? " I wrapped her chain around tits wrist of my leather-and-wool mitten . For an instant I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Lady rushed me along the row ofernpty wanigans , lunged uncertainly at the first one then recognized ours . The powerful wolf leaped at the small window , smashing it . I dragged her down , wrenched open the door , and Lady shot in and under her bed . Cris told me what had happened . In the beam of the weasel headlights , they had seen the black wolf standing , one paw held in the trap . Her chain was wrapped around it . Cris went to her , talking gently . He lifted the trap and foot to his knee , The trap was too strongly set for him to open . He called an Eskimo to help . The man was afraid to approach , so Dean came up and tugged the trap open while Cris held Lady . " Site never whimpered or uttered a sound , " Cris told me with pride . " A dog would have gone crazy . " The wolves still seemed uncanny to me . Would they ever turn on us violently , unpredictably ? Up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been under pressure and understandable . At the end of January the sun rose . Change was ahead again for us and the wolves . We flew back to our old camp in the Brooks Range , where we had adopted the wolves as pups . The chartered plane set down our supplies on the snowy tundra . We penned the wolves while we back-packed the supplies to the tent . On the day we fin-bard this work , Cris opened the gate of the pen . In the genial gruff voice the wolves had always seemed to like , he sang out the old question , unused since November : " Want fo go for a walk ? " It was a radiant arctic spring day , twenty below zero , The hummocks on the tundra and the marble mountains around us cast azure shadows , The free , collarless wolves raced around us . As the four of us proceeded , happiness purred in me . But would Trigger and Lady come back to camp with us ? They did . Then one day on a walk they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took part of our life with them , " Cris said . Two days later , when he had gone out at twilight for one more long sad look over the tundra . I heard him speaking gently , " I ! ere , Lady . Here , Trigger . " The wolves had come home . A week later Cris propped open the gate for good ; we lived with free wolves . Trigger came home sometimes with his tawny face and long legs tinted with blood . They had made a kill . But they came home ! " A wolf has more authority after he has killed a caribou , " Cris said . Two Eskimos with a dog team pitched camp half a mile from our camp . They killed a caribou and threw the meat down near their tent , Trigger dissevered it ; it was now ' " his " meat . We saw him toiling up a distant ridge with a caribou leg in his mouth , seeking to cache it . When we went down to the tent , followed by our wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second caribou he 'd shot His dogs were eating the old meat . Trigger 's meat ! The wolf was enraged . To him , those dogs had become enemies . Cris and I ran to stand between Trigger and the dogs . As the dog team started to move , Trigger rushed in to attack . Cris , fending him off , said , " Get sticks ! " I brought slender willow branches . The scared driver held the dogs to is walk so we could keep up . Trigger had gone crazy . He uttered strange half howls . Again and again he circled to evade us and rush the dogs . We ran to intercept him . His eyes flashed . measuring me and my little willow stick . When the dogs were tied at camp once more , Cris said , " Mk if they have a rope I can try to lead him home with . " Ibrought the rope . Now began a strange , unequal struggle . On one side was the man , armed only with love for this animal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a killer . His fangs were twice as long as a big dog 's . His jaws could open to encompass a caribou 's throat . The wolf avoided Cris . Cris followed . Finally he got his hand on Trigger . He snatched for Cris ' hand as the rope went swiftly around his neck . Cris gripped the rope at the nape of the wolf 's neck to make it harder for him to bite his hand . Holding the wolf this way , he patiently led him over the snow and bare tundra . speaking to him in a friendly voice . Cris brought the wolf to camp and waited while I ran to get meat . " Co into the pen with the meat . " he said . The wolves followed along , In the cabin at last , Cris clung to me for a minute , " Trigger is so jealous of those dogs ! " he said . " lie nearly burned up when he saw them taking ' his ' meat . " Then , solemnly , with an inward look , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to bluff me . " It was true . Trigger had actually been half permissive ; he had pulled his punches . I never mistrusted the wolves again . If Lady growled at me , 1 hugged her . The margin of mystery was gone . We felt that we knew our wolves to their hearts , that they would never be hostile to us except under pressure of circumstance . One evening several days after the Eskimos had Kt , a strange wolf psw-d camp . uttering a mournful cry . Lady ran to her ; Trigger followed . The stranger bit both on the flanks ; wolves have little courtesies and ceremonies , and Trigger and Lady had omitted them . Then the wild wolf courted Trigger and Lady . She was the most beautiful well we had ever seen , with a wide silver cape . black-edged . We gave her a name  --  Silver-mane . By night she hunted with Trigger and Lady ; by day she lay on a low ridge overlooking camp , a quarter of a mile away . Wolves do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start choosing mates when a year old . Silver-mane , an older wolf . chose Trigger . But Lady wanted Trigger too . She chased Silver-mane , who ran  --  at first . Then Ludy played with Trigger , leaping over him as wolves do , easily and gracefully . Trigger rejected her one evening just as they started the night 's hunt . Leaving camp , they sang the deep hunting call together . It turned out to be Lady 's death song . Silver-mane answered from the ridge . That night Lady and Silver-mane fought . In the morning Trigger and Silver-mane came home alone . Lady lay dead on the tundra , a patch of torn fur . Now Silver-mane and Trigger hunted nightly on the arctic slope . Each morning on their return , she uttered grieving howls as he left her for the camp , and trotted off to her old vantage point . She went with Trigger and use on walks , a hundred yards or more to the side , III stopped and looked at her , she scratched defiance at me with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal parts of his family together . I followed a short way in the evening sometimes , as the wolves left for the hunt . When I stopped to go hack , Trigger would glance around , expecting me toconti nue with them . " All of them ? " " Only one . Those arc some of his titlei . " She considered it . " Sort of a dictator type ? " He looked at her again , a trifle more sharply this time . " You do n't say things like that  --  not aloud , " He put the car in gear . " Nosy the market . " " You married ? " " No . " " Engaged ? " " No . " " Antifemale ? " " Only on occasion , " Bill said . She nodded , pleased . " You bite , too , or at least show your teeth . " The pleasure faded . ' ' But when A.P . says ' frog ' ? " I jump , " Bill said . He looked at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out anywhere . I 'll get along . " " This is the market , " Bill said . " The country people come down from the hills with their produce . And the local merchants have stalls . " He had stopped the car . " Maybe you 'd like to walk around . " " Oh , sure . " Agatha said . A.P . regarded Jefferson , who squirmed . " It is nothing I have done , A.P. , " Jefferson said . " I promise you that . it is ? " " Facts of life , " A.P . said " I 'm it hotelman . This was a hotel , It was run-down ; it had n't made a nickel in fifteen years . It belonged to the state and it was n't doing them any good at all . So we made a deal . " Jefferson looked somewhat relieved . " I got the hotel for  --  peanuts . I put money into it , modernize it , make it attract tourists . Good for them , good for me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidinte , from what I hear ? " " If you listen you can hear all sorts of things . He 's smart . He knows when not to be too greedy . We 'll get along . " " But ? " A.P . raised one large hand . " If he wants a small bite for himself , out of profits ? " He shrugged . " We 'll go along . Cost of doing business . " He paused . " I 'll take care of policy . You just run the hotel . " He stood up . " Anything else ? " Jefferson opened his mouth and then shut it again carefully . " No , A.P . " " Hoedown tonight all set ? " " Yes , A.P . I have made all arrangements . " He hesitated . " El Praidenk has accepted our invitation . " A.P . nodded . " Good . Looking forward to meeting him . " The market was crowded . " This is the big fiesta , " Bill said . " Tonight , tomorrow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He stopped , nodded as a man walked past . " Er buena el die " the man said . " El din es buena , " Bill said . " Now over here arc the silversmiths ? " Agatha was translating laboriously . " He said , ' Is the day good ? ' did n't he ? " Bill nodded . " Something like that .... " " And you said the same thing back , only reversed . But the guidebook says you say , ' Burnes dias . ' " Early on the morning of July thirtieth we saw Trigger coming home . Waiting , we called softly to him . In another five minutes the big , gray wolf would have his bowl of warm , powdered milk and be stretched out to sleep . Suddenly we realized that he was not alone . Out on the tundra , following him , came Silver-mane and three other wolves . At last the two had found companions , He had stopped . He was looking at her , and he was smiling . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She decided that it was snore of a grin . " Guidebook ? " he said . " You ? " " Your point . " She said it easily , without pain . And then , " What were you before you went to work for Fitch Hotels ? " " Newspaperman . " " And before that ? " " Child . " She nodded . " That 's where I want you to begin  --  right at the start . " " Silvenvork , " Bill said . " You pick out the souvenirs you want . I 'll haggle for you . " " I 'll bet your hair was curly , " Agatha said . " And that 's why you wear it short . " Bill said firmly , " Bracelets ? Rings ? " " Just one . Through my nose . Then you can lead me around . " She paused . " I have a funny feeling about you . " " I wear trousers , " Bill said ; " if that 's what you mean . " His hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up to the nearest stall display . " Pick , Miss Fitch , " The man of the stall came forward . He smiled at Bill " Es bum , d dia. ? " Bill nodded . " El dia es buena . " It was not a good day , but if everything went well , the night would be better . Fifteen years was a lung time , lie thought , and the waiting was almost over . They left the market . " You , " Agatha said , " arc sort of like an onion . " Her elbow was a trifle tender where his hand had gripped it ; it felt good . " A layer peels off , and there 's another one right under it . " Bill said nothing . " Where new ? " " Food . " She smiled at him . " Your date ? " " My date , " Bill said . Johnny O'Higgins already had a table , in a corner , set for two . He stood , tall and lean and graceful . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . He smiled . Bill said , in Spanish too fast for Agatha to follow , " I 'm stuck . I could n't get out of it without attracting attention , but it will be all right . I have the money . " And then , " She 's a brat . " Johnny said , " Impolite , old boy , speaking Spanish in the lady 's presence . " And his smile deepened . " And such a charming lady . " " Say it again , " Agatha said ; " slower this time . I think he missed it . " Bill said nothing . Johnny popped hii fingers for a waiter , ordered swiftly . " You have been seeing our city , Miss Fitch ? " " Every nook and cranny . Columbus and I " ? she held Up two fingers ? " like that . " " And this afternoon ? " She looked at Bill , He said , " I thought maybe a swim at the hotel . " " The hotel , " Johnny said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country ? Out to my place , perhaps ? You can swim there . " Agatha said " Sounds wonderful . " Bill said , " I think the hotel . Miss Fitch is tired from the plane trip , and there 's the  --  ball tonight . " His hesitation supplied emphasis , ever so slight . and Trigger had brought them home , The wolves saw us , and froze . Then they sped westward , away across the vast bright tundra . Trigger paused and glanced back at them . The wolves were fleeting away ; Silver-mane too . We saw him make his decision . He stood motionless , his side toward C.1.3 , his jaw firm , choosing . Then he was gone , following the wild wolves . We never saw Trigger again . There was more silence . Johnny said slowly , " Perhaps you 're right . Another time . " " Maybe tomorrow , " Agatha said . " Tomorrow ? " Johnny began . He stopped . He and Bill looked at each other , " Perhaps tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And now , let us eat . The food here is good . I suggest ? " They were in the ear again . " I have freckled , " Agatha said . " See ? " Bill nodded . His face was thoughtful . " There arc those who like freckles , " Agatha said , " and those who do n't . You might declare yourself . " " I 'm neutral , " " That I doubt . I think you 're crawling with convictions . " She watched him turn to look at her , and his eyes seemed to have taken on an almost wary look  --  which was ridiculous . Or was it ? She said , " You 're probably knee-deep in the antifreckle movement . " He had turned away again , and she could no longer see his eyes . " On you they look pretty good . " " I have other attributes . " " I 've noticed . " " This , " said Agatha , " is living . " " You 're young and  --  attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And rich . " " Do n't let that bother you . You sort of get used to it , like having red hair . " They were into the hotel drive , among the lawns and the flaming tropical trees , only these in his memory unchanged . He stopped the car in the parking area , got out , walked around to open her door . " And spoiled , " he said . He held her elbow as she got out . " Shall we have our swim ? " ? The pool was new and vast , It was surrounded by lawn and tables and umbrellas and chairs . Agatha lay on her stomach , her chin propped in her hands . " That onion again , " she said . " I get a layer peeled off and think I 've hit the soft part , and what do I get ? Onion juice in my eye . " He was sitting on the grass beside her , hands clasping his knees . He nodded . " You 're consistent . " " I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow ball . You use it to catch the batter off-stride . " She nodded , " For example , what was it " Do you ? " you gave Johnny O'Higgins just as we left ? It was an envelope . " She watched his smile disappear . " Sec ? " she said , " A clean strike . " And then , " What was it ? He paid the check , and he does n't seem to lack for money . You were n't just paying my share . " She waited . And then , behind her , A.P . Fitch said , " How 's it going , kitten ? . . . And you , young fellow  --  bearing up ? " Bill stood up . Agatha rolled over . She said , " We 're getting along fine . He 's a spkareptntierar:l : He looked at BilL gooAdps paloorrkinedg He said , " You have evening clothes ? " " Yes , sir . "                 @ @ @ @
