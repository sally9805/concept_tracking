txt The Senate Labor subcommittee rejected the Eisenhower Administration 's labor reform bill today and approved a similiar but somewhat lessdrastic Democratic measure . By voice vote , the bill was moved to the full Labor and , Public Welfare Committee in substantially the form it was introduced Jan. 20 by Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts . The chief cosponsor is Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr .. Democrat of North Carolina . Both the Administration bill , introduced Jan. 28 , and the Kennedy-Ervin bill are designed to promote union democracy and to curb racketeering and union busting . Provisions to achieve these aims are much the same in both . Controversy has arisen , however , over the Kennedy-Ervin hill 's omission of the major union-curbing amendments to the Taft-Hartley Act proposed by the Administration . Secondary Boycott Covered One of these would extend the Taft-Hartley Act 's secondary boycott prohibitions to cover additional situations where employers are coerced . Another would restrict picketing in support of union organizational drives . President Eisenhower told his news conference today that those questions " should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 14 . It was not clear , however , whether he meant that they should not be left for possible inclusion in a subsequent bill , as Senator Kennedy proposes . The Senate Labor subcommittee , of which Mr. Kennedy is chairman , has commissioned nine outside experts to review the Taft-Hartley Act and recommend revisions . The Senator wants to g6t their report before tackling such controversial issues as secondary . boycotts and organizational picketing . At today 's subcommittee meeting , Republicans lost by voice vote an attempt to - substitute the Administration bill for the Kennedy-Ervin measure . Demo'crats have a 4-10-3 majority on the panel . Changes Also Voted A number of changes were made in the Kennedy-Ervin bill , also by voice vote , but all except two were minor . In one relatively important change , unions having less than 200 members and less than $20 , - 000 in annual gross receipts would be covered by the bill 's requirements for detailed financial reports to the Secretary of Labor . The Secretary could have exempted them under the original draft . The amended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller unions . The other notable revision was in a provision to require the election of international officers of unions every four years and of local officers every three years . This was changed to five years for international and four for local officers . The subcommittee rejected by voice vote a proposal to delete a section " caninb e. for pro-labor amendments of Taft-Hartley Act . Union leaders have said they would not support the bill if these provisions were omitted . One of the Taft-Hartley amendments would permit strikers , although replaced by their employers , to vote in representation elections . Others would ease restrictions on compulsory unionism and bargaining in the building trades industry . The measure is a modified version of the 1958 KennedyIves bill , which was passed by the Senate , 88 to 1 , but was killed in tile House . It calls for detailed and comprehensive annual reports , open to public examination , on union financial operations . Criminal penalties are prescribed for violations . Paid officers would have to reveal various specified types of financial transactions . Ex-convicts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of union funds would be a Federal crime . Members could bring suit to recover misspent money . The Labor Department would be required to inspect records for violations . Penalties would range up to a year in prison and a $10,000 fine . Extortion ( shakedown ) picketing would be subject to Federal court injunction . Senator Kennedy announced the subcommittee vote on the bill as unanimous but made it clear later that this did not mean the Republican members approved it . He and Senator Barry Gold- ' water , Republican of Arizona , explained in subsequent interviews that the vote signified agreement only on sending the bill along to the full committee . A. long fight is in prospect there , with Republicans pressing for stiffening amendments . Senator Kennedy said he hoped the full committee would report the bill to the Senate next week . However , he did not seem to be optimistic . Others looked for several weeks of argument and preliminary vot.1 ing in the committee .                  @ @ @
