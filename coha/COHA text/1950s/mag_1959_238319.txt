Acknowledged shrine of modern architecture was the famed Bauhaus school in Dessau , Germany , and Architect Walter Gropius was its high priest . The boxy building with flat roofs and ribbon-glass windows that Gropius built there in 1926 laid down the line architecture was to follow for the next three decades . An exile from Hitler 's Germany , Gropius introduced his methods as chairman of Harvard 's department of architecture , revolutionized architecture in the U.S. , became so firmly planted in architectural history that people were sometimes amazed to find him still a part of the present . <P> But today , at 76 , seven years after his retirement from Harvard , Gropius has launched into a new burst of creativity . The Architects Collaborative ( TAG ) , a group of keen younger architects he gathered around him at his Cambridge , Mass. headquarters , has all the commissions it can handle . The old Lawgiver has displayed an unexpected flexibility in design . " I was possibly too Puritan , " he reflects . " Too much storming against the old traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope , a more subtle , more delicate expression . " <P> Tigris in the Gardens . Prime case in point is Gropius ' new plan for Iraq 's University of Baghdad . The $70 million project seemed a lost cause when General Abdul Karim Kassem swept to power last summer . Never one to give up easily , Gropius last January flew to Baghdad himself with plans and models , found , to his relief , that Premier Kassem was enthusiastic. * Kassem 's only cavil : the university was not big enough . Gropius promptly agreed to increase the size by one-third ( from 8,000 to 12,000 students ) . <P> Nothing could look less like stripped-down Bauhaus architecture than Gropius ' exuberant plans for Baghdad . The university , divided into colleges , is gathered in clusters of air-conditioned buildings , set close together to provide shade in the blistering 120 summer heat . Concrete shells will cover the combined theater auditorium and mosque . Water from the nearby Tigris will splash in garden courts . <P> Working with TAG , which operates on an equal-partner basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gropius is also kept busy with a new synagogue in Baltimore , the U.S. embassy in Athens , and is acting as a consultant on Manhattan 's $100 million , octagon-shaped Grand Central City-a massive , 55-story structure adjacent to Grand Central Station , which will be the world 's largest commercial office structure . <P> " Technical Dam-Burst . " Taking time out this week , Gropius will go to New Orleans to receive the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects , the profession 's highest award , given in the past to such men as Louis Henri Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright . It will also give Gropius a chance to get some long-brooding concerns off his chest . Says Gropius : " We have now amassed such a tremendous arsenal of techniques that their bristling display has nearly robbed us of our sense of balance . "
