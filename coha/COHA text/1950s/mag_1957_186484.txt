Citizens of the U.S.S.R. were urged to avoid the sinister practice of fasting for the 40 days before Easter- " especially damaging because it coincides with the time of spring sowing , and it decreases sharply the labor productivity of the collective farmers . " <P> A related danger : the practice of confession , which turns the church in capitalist countries into a smoothly working espionage organization against the " revolutionary feelings of the people . " No one knows how many Russian backsliders are observing Lent , but Pravda deplored the fact that " a considerable number of believers in the Soviet Union still observe the cult of confession .
