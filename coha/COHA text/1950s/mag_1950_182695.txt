The slimy , unattractive sea lamprey , which spends its life gnawing holes in fish , has practically conquered the Great Lakes . Since the first invasion of lampreys by way of the Welland Canal ( TIME , June 16 , 1947 ) , they have almost wiped out the lake trout and are now going after the whitefish . The loss in trout alone , according to the U.S. Fish &; Wildlife Service , is costing fishermen some $3,200,000 a year , and the lampreys have only begun . <P> Last week came the first good news for fishermen , the first bad news for lampreys . The Cook Electrical Co. of Chicago announced that it had developed for the Government a lamprey-killing electric fence which works fine on laboratory lampreys and shows promise of killing them in the wild . <P> The approved way to attack a pest is to study its life cycle in hope of finding a weak spot .

In April , when the young lampreys are on the move , the water is still so cold that no baby fish are abroad . The observant Cook Co. designed an electrified fence to throw across the rivers . Neophyte lampreys passing between its meshes are electrocuted . If the fence is taken away before the water gets warm , baby fish are unharmed . <P> Killing the neophytes headed for the Lakes might eventually wipe out the lampreys , but Cook is also trying to figure out a way of dealing with adult lampreys headed upstream to spawn . The trouble is , lampreys move upstream at the same time as valuable spawning fish . The Cook people are looking for something that will annoy and delay lampreys .
