A tall , gaunt man in a wide-brimmed hat , accompanied by his Russian-speaking daughter , climbed aboard a Soviet DC-3 in East Berlin one day last week and was whisked off to Moscow . There the Russians rolled out the Red carpet for their guest : 60-year-old Pastor Martin Niemoller , head of the German Evangelical Church in Hesse , World War I U-boat captain , onetime Hitler follower and then for eight years Hitler 's personal prisoner . Niemller 's mission to Moscow was clothed in strictly clerical garb . He simply wanted , he said , to confer with leaders of Russia 's Orthodox Church " on matters of relations with Christians in Russia . " <P> But Pastor Niemller had already said enough to give the trip sharp political significance . For nearly three years , he has been speaking contemptuously of West Germany 's Bonn government ( " It was conceived in the Vatican and born in Washington " ) and using platform and pulpit to oppose West German rearmament and integration with the West . It was no surprise that the Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in West Germany so honored since war 's end . <P> What was surprising was the reaction it set off in West Germany , where Pastor Niemller 's odd convictions are usually rebutted gingerly because of his prestige . West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was , not unexpectedly , angry . " I deeply regret , " he said , " that a German national in the position of ... Niemller has chosen this moment to stab his government in the back . " Protests exploded from other places . Said a spokesman for the Social Democrats , the fiercest opponents of German rearmament : " The pastor plays the Russian game . " Snapped Welt der Arbeit , newspaper of the West German trade unions : " Niemller seems to labor under illusions that he can convert Stalin . " <P> Mindful of the more than 80,000 German soldiers and 27,000 German civilians still in Soviet prison camps , the German Young Democrats advised the pastor : " Stay in Moscow . Your return is unwelcome before the last German prisoner has been released . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
