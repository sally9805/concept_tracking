Midshipman William A. Kennington , coxswain of Navy 's unbeatable ( 29 straight victories ) crew , was a man with a past-four scholarly , nonathletic years at Vanderbilt University . Normally , no one would care . Last week , egged on by the Eastern College Athletic Conference , Annapolis authorities gave Kennington 's past more than a passing look , and learned that they had made an embarrassing mistake . <P> Said Academy Superintendent Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy : " Although Kennington did not participate in intercollegiate athletics at Vanderbilt , he was ineligible for varsity participation at the Naval Academy* . . . Proud as we are to win championships , we do not want victory at the expense of the rules or at the cost of good sportsmanship ... " The trophies won by the Navy crew this season , seven in all , will be returned to the E.C.A.C. for the legal winners , if they want them . Coxswain Kennington will go on studying to become a naval officer . <P> <P> *No student is eligible for intercollegiate athletics for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bachelor 's degree also means the end of eligibility . Kennington was out on both counts .
