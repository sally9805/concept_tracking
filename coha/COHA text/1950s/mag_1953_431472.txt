 | The Mystery Man of the Bomb By John Gunther Author of " Inside Europe , " " Inside Au , " etc . ONE DAY IN 1941 an American colonel representing our then top-secret atomic project walked into the New York office of a Belgian mine operator named Edgar Sengier , and asked if Sengier could help America to get some uranium ore from the Belgian Congo . The request , the officer said , was vital to the Allied cause . Monsieur Sengier listened politely , and asked to see the colonel 's credentials . When he was satisfied , he said that , yes , he would be able to deliver a sizable quantity of the precious ore . When did the colonel need it ? " We need it at once , " the colonel said . " I realize that 's impossible , of course . " on the contrary , " Sengier said . " Tile ore is here in New York at this moment . One thousand tons of it . I have been waiting for you . " And thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Edgar Sengier is one of the most important unknown men of our time . Although he has visited tilt United States 40 or 50 times , he ha ' always come and gone without no lice from the press . This anonymity is remarkable because , without Sengier , there would have been no atomic bomb ? at least not in the summer of 19.45 , when the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs ended the war against Japan . Not only did Sengier produce the deadly and essential uranium for those firs atomic bombs but , until comparatively recently , every atomic bomb made in the United States , ever ' one we have tested in Nevada o the South Pacific has been mad out of uranium from the mine hi company operates in the Congo . Edgar Sengier 's story has never been written before ? for seven reasons . First , Sengier 's own sell effacement . Recently I had limn with him in Paris . When the evening  | was over , he said , " If you are going to write about me , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , that I should n't stress his personal importance , or make him sound vain , which he is n't . The second difficulty is security . Many details about Congo uranium are still top-secret . If it were not for security , Sengier might long since have been a household name . Sengier is a Belgian engineer , financier and captain of industry , aged 73 . Quite aside from his connection with the bomb , he is one of the most powerful men in the world . He is chairman of the executive committee of the Union Miniere di , HautKatanga . High Katanga , in the southeastern Congo , has uranium and vast reserves of the richest copper ore on earth . The Mining Union does an annual business of 5200,000 , - 000 , and produces seven percent of the world 's copper , 8o percent of its cobalt and five percent of its zinc , as well as many other minerals . It is the main wheel in the Societe Generale de Belgique , an enormous holding company which combines financial and industrial power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The General Society , together with four other large Belgian financial groups , has enormous influence in the economic life of the Congo , and has indirect political influence as well . If one wished to oversimplify , one could say that the Mining Union sparks the General Society , which in turn runs the Congo . Hence , Edgar Sengier , who runs the Mining Union , runs the Congo . He would deny this , though . 1.1e would say that the Belgian people , electing their own government , run the Congo . I began hearing about Sengier when , in preparation for a book on Africa , I started to do research on the Congo . I discovered that he was born in Belgium , and was educated to be an engineer . lie spent five years in China with a Belgian company that had tramway concessions there . He was adventurous , tough , willing to take responsibility and extremely bright . When he was about 30 years old , he decided to move on to Africa , and that continent has played a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was founded in 1906 . The Congo itself became a Belgian colony in 1908 . Elisabethville , capital of the Katanga region , was founded in 1910 . Sengier arrived there in 1911 . He , the Mining Union , Elisabethville and the Congo itself have all grown up together . At the museum in Elisabethville I saw a block of pitchblende , uranium ore , on display . As big as a pig , its color was black and gold , and it looked as if it were covered with a green scum . It came from Shit Itolobwe , which is the mine , and a sign said : " Attention . Bloc radioact ' ! " Photographers are warned not to get too close , or the film in their cameras will be spoiled . Sengier had been producing pitchblende from the Shinkolobwe since @#  | 1921 . But in those days no one thought the uranium contained in the ore had any value . All the interest then was in radium . In 1938 , however , things began to happen . Sengier was approached in circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told him of the work German scientists were doing in the field of atomic fission , and of the possibility that an atomic bomb might be made out of uranium . It was of the most critical importance , he said , that no uranium should get into enemy hands . Sengier , on his own responsibility , then arranged for the shipment of more than 1000 tons of rich pitchblende ore from the Congo to the United States . " I did this , " he told me , " without telling anything to anybody . " The ore reached America in 1940 , and was stored in steel drums in a New York warehouse . Between its arrival and its eventual use by the Manhattan Project , however , some quaint episodes occurred . Sengier , in dead secrecy , announced to the proper American authorities that the uranium vas there . The State Department was so impressed that it wanted to move the deadly stuff to Fort Knox for safekeeping . But there was much delay , and a year passed before the American Government acted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such was the veil of secrecy ) some people had apparently forgotten ? or never had known  - -  where the ore actually was . Then in 1940 the American colonel paid his historic call on Stingier in his New York office . Within an hour the officer walked out with a memorandum quickly drawn up on a piece of yellow paper , and signed by Scngicr . The uranium essential to the success of the atomic project was now the property of the United States . When Sengier visited the United States in 1946 , Gen. Leslie R. Groves , in President Truman 's presence , awarded him the Medal for Merit . He is one of the few nonAmerican civilians to receive this esteemed honor , and naturally he is proud of it . The reason for the bestowal was kept secret ; the record was impounded in the White House . The language of the citation is purposely not specific . I have seen the text : it merely mentions Edgar Sengier 's " . wartime services in the realm of raw materials . " Stingier is not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deed proud . A new ore ( composed of uranium , vanadium and copper ) was recently named sengicrite.
