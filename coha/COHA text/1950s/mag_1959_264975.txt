Sometimes , in dogged quest for the meaning behind the meaning , the Washington press corps finds top-headline news where there is none . This happened at Secretary of State John Foster Dulles ' press conference last week , and before the over-interpretation and overextension were through , the press-created fantasy had reverberated round the world . <P> Most of the Dulles conference was devoted to discussion of the German reunification problem . The Secretary had characterized as " brutal " and " stupid " the latest Russian proposals for reunifying Germany , had restated his adherence to U.S. policy on Germany : " We believe in reunification by free elections . ' ' Late in the conference ( the 26th question ) , the Newark News 's able Reporter Arthur Sylvester spoke up . <P> Q. Mr. Secretary , is it our position that free elections are the only method of reuniting Germany ? In other words , do we say , " no free elections , no reunification ? " <P> A. Well , we never have said that . The formula of reunification by free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a natural method . But I would n't say that it is the only method by which reunification could be accomplished . <P> Headlines v. Facts . The U.S. Secretary of State , anxious to avoid the appearance of keeping his mind closed to new avenues toward peace , had made a logical answer to an " or else ' ' question . What he said was not new : in the Sept. 30 note to Moscow , the U.S. had offered to discuss " any other proposals genuinely designed to insure the reunification of Germany in freedom . " But what Dulles said in his news conference last week was presented in much of the press as a positive statement suggesting an important change in U.S. policy . <P> DULLES SAYS VOTE NOT ONLY WAY TO UNITE GERMANY , boomed the Page One headline in the New York Times , above a story beginning : " Secretary of State Dulles said today the United States and its allies were trying to find new proposals for solving the problem of Germany . " Elsewhere in the same issue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before predicting just such a shift in U.S. policy , reported world reaction to the press conference over interpretation , quickly threshed by Timesmen abroad . From London : SECRETARY 'S VIEW DISTURBS BRITISH . From Bonn : BONN is SHOCKED BY DULLES ' WORDS . <P> <P> At first , the big press services played down the Dulles-Sylvester exchange-or skipped it entirely . United Press International ignored it in its first story ; the Associated Press put it in paragraph three , later moved it down to the sixth paragraph . But soon nearly everybody was following the imaginative lead adopted by the Times , the New York Herald Tribune , and several other papers . Said Walter Lippmann : " Mr. Dulles opened the door to negotiations on the future of Germany . " Growled the New York Daily News : " It seems to us that Mr. Dulles has dropped a king-size brick . " <P> Echoes &; Repercussions . Because of the worldwide repercussions , both President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles took pains to explain that there had been no change in policy . At that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaming it all on Dulles ( he was " maladroit , " tch-tched the Times ) , and charging that he was backing away from his press-conference position .
