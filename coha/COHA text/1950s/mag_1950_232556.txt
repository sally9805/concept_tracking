Ever since they first went into action in Korea , U.S. troops had prayed for weapons powerful enough to pierce the heavily armored , Russian-made tanks of the North Korean Communists . The first successful new weapon against the Red tanks was the 3.5 inch bazooka ( TIME , July 31 ) , which quickly proved its worth . Last week , the Army took the wraps off a new artillery shell guaranteed by ordnance experts to " kill any tank in the world as far as a gunner can see it and hit it . " <P> The new shell is a 90-mm. projectile which gets its deadliness from the same " shaped charge " that is built into the bazooka rockets . But the shell , designed for the 90-mm. guns of the U.S. 45-ton General Pershing tanks , has much greater velocity than the bazooka rockets , and an effective combat range of 1,000 yards , ten times that of the bazooka . <P> Long familiar to ordnance men , the shaped charge* is a mass of high explosive with a conical cavity in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thin metal . When the charge explodes , the wave of detonation starts at the rear of the shell ; when the explosive waves hit the point of the metal liner , the metal comes under immense pressure and acts like a thin fluid . Like a jet-propelled stream of toothpaste , the fluid metal spurts forward , at speeds up to 30,000 feet a second . The jet of liquid metal and gas can pierce more than eleven inches of armor plate . Shaped-charge shells are also equipped with rocket-like fins to give a steady flight without the spin of the standard artillery projectile . <P> The new shells will arrive in Korea this week but they will not be available in heavy supply for some time to come . <P> <P> * Also known as the " Munroe effect , " after Charles E. Munroe ( 1849-1938 ) . Munroe , who also invented indurite , the first smokeless powder used by the U.S. Navy for large guns , noted the principle of the shaped charge in 1888 , while chemist to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
