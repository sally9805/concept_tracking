MEG ( 242 pp. ) - Theodora Keogh-Creative Age ( $2.75 ) . <P> Meg is the story of a little girl , but it is not for little girls . Nor is it for grownups whose memories of childhood have been identified with their memories of Little Men and Little Women . <P> Meg at twelve is a puzzle to her schoolmates , a trial to her teachers , a constant irritant who sends her unsympathetic father 's blood pressure zooming . She lives on Manhattan 's fashionable Beekman Place , but she runs wild with a gang of dead-end kids on the banks of the East River . The other children at Miss Drew 's School for Girls are delivered and fetched by governesses ; Meg comes clattering up on roller skates , a tense , skinny gamin who wears a big hunting knife and dreams of being suckled by a lioness . When a furtive little man makes advances toward her in an automat one day , she goes right on eating her raisin bun , looks him square in the eye and asks : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three lives simultaneously : one in her febrile imagination , another in her socially correct school and home , a third in the brutal world of poverty and degradation that begins just around the corner . Before she is 13 , Meg is raped by an older boy , manages to pass her history examination by threatening to expose her teacher , whom she has caught in a Lesbian relationship . Meg 's parents know nothing of her life in that lurid world : few adults could hope to understand her much better in the other two . <P> Author Keogh is no exception . A granddaughter of Teddy Roosevelt , she now lives in Paris with her painter-husband , but she used to live on Meg 's East Side . In her first novel she has ventured into one of fiction 's most difficult areas : the amoral , grotesquely furnished mind of childhood . Few writers have explored it successfully ; Meg is not in the same class with Richard Hughes 's Innocent Voyage or A. L. Barker 's Innocents ( TIME , March 22 , 1948 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outside , and her startling little novel seems more like random notes for a better one .
