txt It is not often given to a King to leave a profound sense of personal grief among his people and a feeling throughout much of the world that a good and true light has gone out . George VI was beloved and respected , not because he was a monarch who bore in his veins the blood of the Saxons and Normans , the Plantagenets and Tudors , the Stuarts and Hanovers , but because he was a man who lived a good life and who performed a heavy task bravely and well . There were those who slightingly said that King George 's career was the triumph of mediocrity , but they were wrong . It was the triumph of goodness , simplicity , courage , devotion to duty . These are not the mark of mediocrities . What the critics were reaching for was the absence of any brilliance of intellect and of what the French call panache , a kingly flair and color that his elder brother had to no avail . George VI possessed the qualities that were needed in the gravest moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mediocrity ? His people wanted an anchor in the great storm and Ile stood steadfast . They sought comfort and sympathy in their distress and he gave it to them . They wanted someone to share symbolically their own hardships and dangers , and this he did within the limits possible to oxe in his position and with his responsibilities . When in the dark days of the Second World War the Cabinet made plans to send him and his family to Canada , he made it clear that nothing short of invasion and defeat could get him away . He and his Queen stuck it out in the London of the blitz and the V-bombs , and their children remained throughout the war in near-by Windsor Castle . Above all , his people  --  even before the war  --  had sought the embodiment of their own homely virtues , Their ancient monarchy had been endangered by a King who sought to stray too far from the beaten path . Prince Albert , the Duke of York , was nothing so much as a simple , normal , happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British people wanted to see in their ruler . He did not want to be King . He was not trying to set an example when he devoted every moment he could to his home , his wife and his children . He was not acting when the camera caught pictures of a happy , gay father and husband . Those virtues were Nature 's gift and they endeared him to his people to an extent that certainly was unique in the line of the Hanovers and WilidsOrs . When George VI was crowned at Westminster Abbey on May 12 , 1937 , he was " by the Grace of God , of Great Britain , Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King , Defender of the Faith , Emperor of India . " Ireland is now a republic ; the Dominions have loosened their bonds still further ; the Indian Empire is gone ; the meaning of that grand old title Fides ; DefentorDefender of the Faith  --  has long gone into history . Yet George VI left his throne far stronger than when he ascended it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many kingdoms , has turned its corner with the British crown resting firmly on the fair head of an immensely popular young Queen . The British monarchy stands , a symbol of unity and tradition , a political institution above party politics , an emotional , glamorous outlet in drab lives . For the uneasy head ' that wears the crown , life is often i heavy burden , an incredibly grinding , . biging task  --  end less state papers- to sign , innumerable functions to attend , speeches to make , I , receptions to give , and all under the pitiless glare of modern publicity . King I George bore that burden with grace and devotion . If his life in these last fifteen years had been nothing else than to be the benevolent institution of an English King one could have pitied him . But it was so much morel It was a time of faith and glory in which George VI played an honorable role . It was a time when two healthy little girls grew to womanliood in a happy home . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parent , already assured of the loyalty of her subjects and of the sympathy and warm-wishes of many peoples , not the least from those who live in the onetime colony of the British Throne , the United States .
