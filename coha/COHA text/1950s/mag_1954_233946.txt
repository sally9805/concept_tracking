The most critical natural resource in the arid Middle East is water . Israel needs water to support a population doubled in the past five years . The Arab states need it to settle and feed 900,000 Palestine refugees . But there is not enough for both . Today , only 5% of the Middle East 's land is cultivated ; the rest thirsts . Meanwhile , the Jordan River , which meanders part of its course between Israel and Jordan , wastefully pours 44 billion cu.ft. of fresh water annually into the salty Dead Sea . <P> Last September the thirsty , aggressive Israelis struck out for water . They moved bulldozers north to the upper Jordan at Lake Hula , bordering Syria , and began constructing a nine-mile-long , parallel canal to divert part of Jordan 's waters into a hydroelectric station , from there to be spilled back into the Jordan . <P> Syria , which opposes any project that might benefit Israel , bristled that the canal was an armistice violation ; from U.N . Truce Supervisor Major General Vagn Bennike came a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis , who believe in fait accompli , put their bulldozers on three shifts . But when the U.S. suspended aid to Israel for its defiance of U.N. , Israel capitulated and agreed to let the Security Council decide the dispute . <P> Last week , after three months , the Council voted . A majority agreed to let the Israelis resume work on the canal , providing that General Bennike found the project endangered no legitimate Arab interest . This was sure to madden the Syrians , and gave the Russians a chance to curry Arab favor . Russia cast its 57th Security Council veto , its first in a Middle East dispute and its first against Israel . Warned Britain 's Sir Gladwyn Jebb : " This is a melancholy and sinister occasion-melancholy . . . for future international cooperation ; sinister , because of its implications for the cause of peace in the Arab world .
