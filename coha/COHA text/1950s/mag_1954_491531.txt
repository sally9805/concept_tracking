PART THREE NE of the theatrical hotels where my vaude-0 ville partner , George Byrne , and I put up in 1927 was t he Somerset , just off Broadway . It would carry you even if you did n't have any dough . But George and I were n't reduced to cuffing it We were just about making it . We could play club dates , and , as I 've already said , we land Ai nice-looking wardrobe . There was a lot of work around . We were n't getting much of it . but it was around . Pretty soon we got lucky and sliced off a piece of it . We auditioned and were selected for the cast of a musical show , The Sidewalks of New York , put on by Eddie Dowling and Jnines Hanky , with Eddie 's wife , Ray Dooley , as de star . Also in it were Ruby Keeler ; Smith and Dale ; an old-time vaudeville monologist , Jim Thornton ; and Dick Keene , half of the vaudeville team of Keene and Williams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in such high toned company . The show had a nice run , but George and I find trouble getting our specialties in . In fact , after the opening they never were in . After that we just worked one singing and dancing number with Ruby . and did a few small parts . But we were n't important enough even for that . and sifter eight weeks in New York , the man who handled the Cupv  --  Iphi 14:1 I. , Furii ? salaries for Dowling gave us the look with the ax hanging on it , and we were back on the Palace beach looking for jobs . We killed time while sitting around the Somerset lobby exchanging vaudeville stories with other variety performers . Whenever I get together with another ex-vaudevillian , I Hull trade anecdotes with him . One of my favorites mahout the vaudev ille art ist whose act was wrestling an alligator in a tank . Bookings had been thin for a long time , but he finally got a date in Paterson , New , Jersey . He did such n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestler 's agent In ask if he could lie held over for the last half of the week . " Certainly , " the agent said . " I do n't have him booked anywhere else . " On Friday night the manager called the agent again . This hole he said , " I 'm sorry I held your boy over . He 's not giving rue the same net he gave me at first . Business is falling elf . " " I 'll come over , " the agent said . He hotfooted it over to Paterson from New York and watched the act . Sure enough , it was dull . No action . So he went backstage to talk to the alligator wrestler . " Charlie , " he said , " yen had a clinece to go places here . You were big ennugh for the manager to hold you over . Now he wmplains that you 're not giving him the same excitement you did in the first half of the week . He 's very disappointed . " " He 's disappointed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I feel ? The alligator died Wednesday n igh t " Another one I like is about the two hoofers who played the Palace in the Deuce spot . They put ix , much moxie into their stuff they almost killed themselves doing over-the-tops and slides , and after taking their one Isle , they collapsed in the wings and lay there pulling and gasping . There was 0 burst of music and Ethel Barrymore stepped over their prostrate bodies on her way to the stage . She was no sooner on than the audience gave her a cheer and tossed lowers at her . She read a couple of lines and the applause was deafening . One of the hushed hoofers nudged the other and said , " Listen to that , will ye ? Me for that hake next season . " To me , such stories are the essence of elbow business . Joe Laurie , Jr. , the vaudeville historian , told me one about a bird act that killed me . Bookings were so scarce for the artist who had trained the birds that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the birds just Hew around above his house nut in Flushing on Long Island . They did n't leave , because he 'd put his head out of his attic window and say , " Do n't fly away . Just be patient . We 'll get work . " Finally he got a Cleveland booking . He rushed up to the attic and said to his birds , " I do n't have any cages , and I do n't have any money , but we 've got a Cleveland date . I 'll hitchhike . You fly . " He thumbed a couple of rides with the birds flying overhead . At last he got out around Albany . He was two days alma of schedule when all it once he heard a bicycle hell . Looking around , he saw his agent , Sam , from New York . " I 've got qwq tough news for you , " Sam Raid . " They 've decided to hold over the show in Cleveland that 's already there , so you wo n't be playing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " After I 've got ill the way nut here too ! " the bird man Raid . " Oh , well , that 's life . " He shrugged , looked up at the birds , waved his HMV toward the south and yelled , " Baltimore , Baltimore ! " As tasty as such stories were when they flipped across the Somerset lobby . George and I could n't eat them . So I said to George , " We 've got the wrong-type act . We ought to do more comedy and lees dancing and singing . With all this dancing we 're doing , we can wind up wind-broken and with varicose veins all over our bodies . " So we assembled a few japes like : " Where do the bugs go in the wintertime ? " " I do n't know ; you can search me . " And others like : " You know George Riley ? " " What 's his name ? " I " What 's whose name ? " " George Riley . " " I never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonder we were n't tarred and feathered . Milt Lewis , who was then my Now York agent , got a date for us at B. S. Moss ' Franklin , a big-time , eight-act house , and George and I opened on No. 2 . The headliners were Dooley  --  no relation to Ray Dooley  --  and Sales . This pair were so famous for stealing bows that the management of the theaters where they played put up signs : No ONE ALLOWED TO TAKE Moue THAN Two Bows IN Title Tirtwreti . When Dooley exited , he left one foot hanging on stage in view of the audience . His idea was to let them know he was still there , ready to come on again if they applauded . Naturally , they applauded . and Dooley and Sales came bounding back , wearing surprised looks which asked , " Can you he ranking all that noise for little us ? " It 's known as a " milking routine .

We rushed to the railing and yelled back , " Yea ? " The mainiger shouted , " You two could at least put on mane make-up and look good . " It was the lowest spot in our career . George and I had been hoping that a talent agency like the William Morris Agency would get interested in us and guide us to bigger and better things . I called the Morris office and ' irked Johnny Hyde , one of their operatives , " Are you coming up to see our act ? " No , " Johnny said . " Why not ? " I asked . ? " I heard about it , " he told me . " You did ? " I asked weakly . " You ought to go West . change your act and get a new start , " Johnny said . " Thanks , Johnny , " I said . It was the only thing I could say . Little did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a conference with George . " We 've got to go to Chicago , get going all over again and break in a new and better comedy act , " I told him . " That 's where the money is . Big laughs , big money . " George nodded and we started . I 'd wired Mike Shea . a Cleveland booker who specialized in breaking jumps for acts en route to Chicago from the East . He wired he could get us three days at New Castle , Pennsylvania . at fifty dollars . We were the third act on the bill . It had only three . Before the show , the manager of the theater said In me , " When you finish . would you mind announcing the show that 's playing hem next week ? " At the end of our act I said . " Ladies and gentlemen , next week Marshall Walker will be here with his Big Time Revue . Marshall is a Scotchmnn . I know him . He got married in the back yard so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next show I added another Scotch joke . That got a laugh too . For the next show I added two more . The manager came back and said , ( Continued on Page 78 ) THIS IS ON ME ( Corti imoll from Pug , ? 21 ) " Hey , that 's good . Keep it in . " Thesecond night I told so many Scotch jokes announcing Marshall Walker 's arrival that I was doing four or five minutes . One of the fellows in 1 he orchestra took me aside and said , " You two guys are doing the wrong kind of thing . That double act with that dancing and those corny jokes , that 's nothing . You ought to be a muster of ceremonies . " I thought it over ; then called George in . " I know what you 're thinking , " he said . " You 're going to try a single . I do n't blame you .

" I went home to Cleveland , ate one of mom 's good meals ; then , feeling brave on lemon pie , I went down to see Mike Shea in the Erie Building . " I want to do a single , " I told him . " I 've been fooling around with a single here and there . Try me , Mike . I can do it . " " What kind of an act ? " he asked . " Singing , dancing , talking , " I told him , " and ' , corking in blackface . " I threw in that " blackface " for no reason . Just nervous , I guess .

" I went out , bought a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cigar and a small derby which jiggled up and down when I bounced onstage . I 'd picked up some new material here and there , plus a few things I 'd thought up myself . For an encore I did a song and a dance , and I scored well , even if I was scoring in a minor league . ate and slept at home and took the streetcar to whatever theater I wee playing . The fourth night I missed the streetcar and reached the theater so February 27 , Mil " How 'd you like to play the West Englewood Theater on Decoration Day ? " Hogan asked . " Would twenty-five dollars be all right ? " I gulped and just managed to say , " I 'll take it , " without bursting into tears . The West Englewood had three shows daily . I emceed them and did my act . After the second show , the manager Raid , " You 're to open at the Stratford , Sunday . " " How do you know ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He asked me how you were doing . told him you were O.K. , and he told me to tell you bee putting you in as master of ceremonies at the Stratford . " The Stratford had had an emcee who 'd been such u local favorite that he 'd been held over for two years . He had a wonderful personality and they hated to give him the heave-ho . But , unfortunately , he 'd become hard to work with , so finally they 'd had to wrap him up and cart him away . After that. , they 'd tried a lot of emcees , but nobody had caught on . I stuck my jaw even farther out than nature had stuck it , went out there and did my stuff . After the second day , Hogan told me they wanted me to stay two weeks . To cut it short , I stayed there six months . From twenty-five dollars a day I went up to two hundred a week , then to two hundred and fifty . Al the end of my iitint I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . To me , it was like a job in a mint with toting privileges . The Stratford was a folksy place and I went right clown into the audience to sing . My hit number was If You See Me Dancing in Some Cabaret , That 's Just My Way of Forgetting You . I gut material anywhere and everywhere , since I had to come up with a fresh line of pat ter twice a week for six months . If a new act played the house , I asked them for fresh jokes I could use . Usually they gave me a few and 1 tried them out . And I clipped jokes out of College Humor and switched them around . 047,1111:14V Miat I teemed a lot , about gutting laughs and ways of handling different types of jokes at the Stratford . I 'd lead off with subtle joke , and after I 'd told it , I 'd any to the audience , " Go ahead ; figure it out ... " Then I 'd wait till they got it . Sometimes I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for telling it , and say , My brother writes my jokes . Someday I 'm going to go up into the attic and loosen his strait jacket . " Or I 'd say , found that joke in my clocking . If it happens again . I 'll change laundries . " I had another routine lintied an some of Frank Tinney 'm material . In it I used the orchestra lender its a straight man . I 'd say , " Charlie , would you mind helping me with a joke ? I 'll say . ' I went to the dentist this morning , but I only hod a dollar , ' and you say , ' What happened ? ' Then I 'll ( ell the funny answer which will convulse the audience and they 'll roll in the aisles ; then we 'll have the audience put back in their seats and everybody will be real happy and ha-ha-ba ; here we go . " I 'd walk off , come hack and say . " Hello , Charlie ! " and he 'd piny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I went In the dentist this morning . I only had a dollar . " And he 'd way , " Where 'd you get t hit dollar ' ' " " Wait a minute ! " I 'd complain . " You 're not supposed to Any that . If you do n't mind . Let me get the laughs . I 'm the comedian around here . Just ask , ' What happened ? ' and I 'll tell the joke . Alter all , they 're paying me to he funny . You just wave your stick , Charlie . Understand ? " So I 'd walk off again , come back on and say , " Here we go , Charlie . Helln , Charlie . " He 'd say , " Hello , Lea , " and we were ofE " I went to the dentist this morning , " I said , " and I only had s dollar . " Charlie said , " What happened ? " and I said , " I had to get buck teeth . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosened them up . They thought , This man fins plenty of gall rum if he does n't have much : Went . It sounds corny , but it was the kind of buffoonery the audience liked . I can still loosen ' em up with it . When I 'd been at the Stratford six months I began to run out of material . Dying to get laughs with nothing to get them with was valuable experience , but wealying . However , after I quit the Stratford , it was a cinch to put an act together , using material culled from my stay there , An a partner , I 'd signed up a girl I 'd met around Chicago . Her name was Louise Troxoll . I developed her into a foil . She was real smart , real intelligent , but I trained her to conceal that . All she had to do was to walk on end stand there looking beautiful white I told a story , or let me feed her lines . She 'd come out holding a little ling and may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What do you have in your little bag ? " and she 'd Kay . " Mustard . " And I 'd say , " What 's the idea ? " and she 'd Imagine ME adding a new room mycelf ! and here 's ' how dd raM " You can never tell when you 're going to meet a ham . " As anyone can see , that eit.nrted the routine off in sophisticated fashion . Then she 'd say , " I just came hack from the doctor . " " Well , what about that ? " I 'd ask . And she 'd say , " Well , the doctor said I 'd have to go to the mountains for my kidneys , " and I said , " That 's too bad . " " Yes , " she said , -I did n't even know they were up there . " Then . believe it or not , we were paid for those jokes . After each of them , I 'd look at the audience like a man in pain who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will I do with a dumb broad like this ? " That luseinees of letting the audience in on my problem was the whole secret of the act . I put a lot of such things together and the Keith-Western Time  --  a junior Orpheum circuit n little below the big time  --  signed us . We opened in St. Nut , then went to South Bend . I was still wearing a brown derby , and had J4 big cigar stuck in my kisser . When 1 walked out on the stage in Snot h Bend , there was a roar of applause . When I told my first joke , they screamed . I could n't figure it . Finally it dawned on me . I had a Notre Dame audience , Al Smith was running for President and a brown derby and a cigar were his trade-marks . Years Inter , I went back there , wore the mime wardrobe and pulled only a ripple . After that we played around in the Western Vaudeville Circuit for a while , ! nuking such towns as Sioux City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interstate Time in Fort Worth , Texas . I did the same act . I 'd done in Chicago . I worked fast , snappy and impish . In effect , I was telling the audience , " You 've got to get my stuff fast because ( hat 's the way I sell it . " With this tempo I 'd been a show stopper . In Fort Worth I was on next to shut . " Shut " is closing . " Next to taste " means a featured spot on a vaudeville bill , usually reserved for at big comedy sock act . I walked out before my line Fort Worth audience with my Fast talk , and I might as well have kept on walking to the Rio Grande . Nobody cared . I could n't understand it . I came offstage , threw my derby on the floor and told the unit manager , " Get me a ticket back to my country . " A fellow walked into my dressing room and asked , " What seems to lie the matter , fancy pants ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " That 's all that 's the matter . " " Why do n't you slow down and give them a chance ? " this fellow asked . " These people are n't going anywhere . They came in here to be happy . It 's summertime . It 's hot . This in Texas . Let them understand you . Why make it a contest to keep up with your material ? Relax and you 'll he all right . " " Thanks too much , " T said car-erratically . After he 'd gone , I asked someone , " Who was that ? " " That 's Bob O'Donnell . " I was told . " He 's the head of the Interstate Vaudeville Circuit , " Bob is now one of the ringmasters of the International Variety Club .. and one of the country 's greatest all-around showmen . But all I 80 thought ( hen was , Now much nerve can one ' man have ? However , I did slow down for the next show as much as my stubbornness would let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the next show , I slowed down even more , and during the Punt show of the night , I was alincest n hit . Before I moved on to Dallas  --  thanks to Bob O'Donnell  --  I was a solid click . Bob did another thing or me . Without telling me , he wired the 13 . P. Keith office in New York to Ray that when I hit town they ought to look me over and sign me . In the meantime . I 'd been cornotponding with the New York vaudeville agents Morris and Fed . I 'd sent them my photon and they 'd sent me a series of form letters urging me to drop in and see them . Only I did n't know they were form letters . I thought they bad me practically set for the Ziegfeld Follies% When I got to New York in 1929 , 1 dropped in all bright-eyed and eager to see them , and announced , " Here I am . " " Who 're you ? " they asked . " Who am I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd changed it again , this time from Lester to Bob . I thought Bob had more " Hi , ya , ( elk 's " in it .

And you wrote me rill those letters . - lust give me my photos , " and 1 took them and walked out . This reception did n't shake my confidence . I was even surer than Bob O'Donnell that I was " ready . " At I he B. F. Keith office , I met Lee Stewart , wire real name is Lee M uckenf use . " Keith wants you to show your act to us , " he said . " Bub O'Donnell says you 're good , and they want to see you . " " Where do they want me to show ? " I asked . " At the Jefferson . " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its audiences were tough and boisterous . I asked scornfully , " You do n't think I 'm going to show there , do you ? I 'll show uptown at the Hamilton , or at I he Riverside , or at the Coliseum . And if you want me , do n't fool around . H Larry . " " I 'll have to talk it over with Keith 's , " he mid . " You 're sure you do n't want the Jefferson ? " " No , " I said , " I do n't want any Jefferson . " In the meantime I 'd been Ialking about my act to the William Morris Agency . The Pulpits Circuit was also thinking of giving me a deal . So I said , " And do n't call me with any con offer . " A few days went by . Then Lee Stewart called me and said , " I 've got you a spot . " " Where ? " 1 asked . " Proctor 's Eighty-Sixth , " he said . " Who 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy , the movie star , " Lee said . " She 's doing a personal appearance . " I did n't know that the Eighty-Sixth Street was a barn . I took it that it was a small , intimate house , So I said , " There 's not much money , " Lee worried me . " Tell your office I do n't want any muney , " I announced . " Are you crazy or something ? " he asked . " 1 just want them to see the act , that 's n11 , " I told him . " Publix is after me , but I 'm willing to let Keith 's see the act too . If they do n't like me , O.K. But I do n't need money . " What I was doing was throwing a bluff to give the Nt ; rosT idea that trifling sums were of no interest to me . I thought this remark of mine was a sign of independence , although secretly I was wondering if I had enough talent to live up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great . as I 'd indicated I was , I called a friend , Charlie Yates , who 'd handled me fur a few noncircuit independent vaudeville spots . " See if you can get me a little vaudeville date , Charlie , " I said . " I 'd like to break in a couple of ideas . " Charlie Yates got me on a No. 2 at the Dyker in Brooklyn . It was only it three-day date , but I was willing to make it to break in my material . I also took the money , which was twenty-five dollars , or $8.33 a day . I did n't go over too well at the Dyker , but that did n't bother me . I told myself that the audience was n't a quality audience , and that , after all , I was only warming up , like a golfer playing a practice round . Lee Stewart came over to catch my last show at the Dyker . Coming hack on ( lie subway from Brooklyn with me , he said thoughtfully . " Proctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he wits thinking that he was just about to be a midwife at an egg-laying , but I askeci . " Is that 130 ? " as if the size of Proctor 's was a piece of interesting information instead of it hazard . " Look , Lee , " 1 said , " I open there tomorrow , and if I do n't score , we wo n't talk to each other again . " That seemed all right with him . Just before I opened at Proctor 's , I went around there and asked the doorman , " How 's the audience here ? " " The toughest in New York , " he said . My Adam 's apple bounced against my shoes , I felt like a rat catcher trapped by his own cheese . I was n't I  --  eihruary r , arse worried about the fact that the Proctor was as big as a barn . That was in the days before stager ; were equipped with microphones , but my lungs were young and I could bash them over the head with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough audience too . That was another thing . I walked around the block twice to pull myself together . That afternoon I was standing in the wings at Proctor 's waiting to go on for the matinee . My cigar was wobbling up and down in my kisser the way a product named Jell-0 , which I was to shill for years later on radio and tele-. vision , shakes and quivers . I could see Louise Troxell looking at me as if she were running over the names of other comedians in her mind who might give her a job . I watched Lentrice Joy walk up and down in the spotlight . And thinking about how she had been having marital difficulties with her husband , John Gilbert , and also remembering that what happened in the next few minutes would probably be the most important thing in my life , I had an idea . As Leatrice finished and the orchestra speeded up and went into my music , I walked out with my brown derby on my head . They always laughed when they saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy nature was coming , or anyhow an attempt at comedy . I looked out into the audience and said , " No , lady , tine is not John Gilbert . " Tho Leatrice Joy-Gilbert heart problems were headlines in the papers ; Gilbert was the country 's biggest wheel in the great-lover and breast-heaving department , and I looked remarkably unlike him , so as it turned out it was just the right thing to Ray . That started me , and I stepped the show . For my exit I did two bows ; then dropped my left hand as a signal to the electricians and orchestra leader . I 'd arranged that signal in advance . It meant that the orchestra would stop playing my bow music while the applatfsie still at its peak , and the spotlight would go black , leaving the audience with nothing . It worked the way I hoped it would . They could n't switch off their applause that quickly , so they kept on clamoring . It also gave them that " they ca n't do this to us " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing . Other acts have used the notion . In fact , it had become almost standard technique if you ever got that much applause worked up . I stood there in the wings for a full thirty-five or forty seconds and let them applaud .

" And I let it roll for fifteen seconds more , Then I said , " Spotlight , " they put the spot back on , I came out , did an encore dance , and walked off , the Mister Big of that particular show . When I got back in my dressing room , the door burst open and Lee Stewart rushed in . He wrung my hand and said , " I knew you had it . I could tell . This is it , is n't it ? How about that audience !

They had somebody catch first shows , especially ( l:mil 1 on Tugs 83 ) ( Continund front Paw . SU ) if there was any new talent around they might want to sign . The Morris man came backstage and said , " Would you like to come down to the office I ter the next show ? " " I ca n't , " I said . " How about after the last show ? " be asked . The last show went on at eleven o'clock . " Come down to the Bond Building . We 'll be wailing there for you , " he said .

This time Sid and his boys did n't play the overture before the vaudeville portion of the bill , as they usually did . The deeply moving film All Quiet on the Western THE SATURDAY Front was playing the house , so Sid and his boys did a musical finale which blended into the end of the picture . When the picture and the musical linale ended , the curtain went up on me . The situation could n't have been better calculated to ruin my net if it had been planned that way . All Quiet wound up with a young soldier being blown up . At the finish , all you /law were his hands clinging to a wire in no man 's land . It affected people so much that they did n't want to talk to anybody or have anybody talk to them for hours afterward .

I just ran out , fresh as paint , went into my act and laid such a blockbuster-size stink bomb that they had to take the seals nut and air them afterward . I could n't figure it out at find . But finally I got it . Then I got mad , and began to scream about the injustice of the whole thing and about how I was dying out there and how they could n't do this to me , when the phone rang backstage . It was Arthur Willis , the booker for the theater . " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me out there ? They tell me you are n't I rying . " I was so mad I spluttered . Then I heard him laugh . He knew what I was up against and he was ribbing me . It took some of the edge off the situation . I said a few unprintable words to Arthur , went on for the last few shows , and died peacefully without fighting . 1 told myself , After all , this will only last three days . After that I 'm going to Proctor 's 58th Street . Then be back in eaudeedle and out of the backwash of incase , But when I got to Proctor 's 58th and looked up at the marquee , it said , ALL QUIET ON THE WESTIMN So I had it for four more days . I called Arthur Willis up and said , " Fun 's fun ! I quit ! " But he said , " You 're getting paid , are n't you , so shut up and do it . " I shut up and took the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first time 1 went around the Orpheum Time with Louise Troxell , in the fall of 1929 , we traveled as far north as Vancouver . as far south as San Diego . We were with a stage unit built around Harry Webb and his orchestra . Before I came along , Ken Murray had worked with Webb . I took Ken 's place . I did my own act and also worked the afterpiece . The afterpiece was the big attraction . An afterpiece was supposed to be vaudeville 's answer to the talkies . It was a pocket-edition comedy revue featuring a comedian and a string of blackout sketches . It was played full stage . It involved a lot of slapstick and comedy hits , and it went on after the regular acts . The big wheel of the nfterpiece was the principal comedian , and the band was on the stage instead of in the pit . In abort , all of us who 'd bad anything to do with the regular show spread out and did a revue-type thing . There were many afterpiecee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful . About this time I picked up a writer named Al Boasberg , who began to turn out material for me . Boas berg had written many of the top acts of vaudeville , It was At who 'd whipped up the one called Lamb Chops , which made Burns and Allen famous . Lamb Chops was a Dumb-Dora act which eel the trend of Burns-and-Allen 's routines from then on . He also wrote for Jack Benny . I remember a joke he wrote for Jack when Benny was stopping at the Waldorf : " The Waldorf is so swanky you have to shave before they 'll let you into its : barber shop . " I do n't know how I met Al . That 's not important . But it was important that he started to work for me , for he was a great joke mechanic . He could remember jokes . fix jokes , switch jokes around , improvise on jokes- He could even originate jokes . When I was in New York I 'd take him to a Chinese restaurant , Lum Fong'e , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning while the waiters wearily poured tea for us . I 'd ply Al with questions and conversation , and when he crime up with a nifty during the course of our talk , I 'd jot it down on the back of a menu . For example , I 'd say , " I 'm afraid our show is going to close , " and he 'd say , " Well , I guess you 'd better recast the backers . " It might not sound like much , but there 'd be a time when I 'd find it a useful crack to have on tap . It was Boasberg who WAS responsible for my lint movie test , He wrote to a Hollywood agent , Bill Perlberg , about me . Perlberg is a successful producer nowadays . Then he was a ten-percenter , a flesh peddler . " Take a look at Bob Hope if he happens to he out your way , " Boasberg suggested to Bill . So , when I hit Los Angeles to play the Hill Street Theater , Bill called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a movie test ? " I was large about it . I said that , as it happened , we had a few open days before playing San Diego , after our Hill Street closing , so I thought l could work a test in . Bill did n't seem too impressed by my willingness to give the cinema a chance . " Get out to the Pattie lot next Thursday . " he said . At Pn the . when the camera began to turn , I did my stuff . Then Louise Troxell came on and worked with me . The stagehands and crew laughed , and I went away convinced that all the movie industry needed to put it on a firm basis was me . I went on down to San Diego with Louise , with my little pointed head tilled with such happy thoughts . On our opening Sunday there , 1 went to Agua Caliente and left 5600 in a gambling joint . I was philosophical about 83 it . I knew I 'd recoup that much many times over in the movie racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio would he sending talent heads panting to me to get my signature on a contract . When I got hick to L. A .. I called Perlberg and asked , " When do I see the test ? " " Do you want to see it ? " be inquired . " Why , of course , " I said . " Go out to Paths , " he told me . " They 'll show it to you . " " What do you think of it ? " I asked . All he 'd say was , " Go and see it . " When I walked in at Pattie , they said , " Projection Room 12-Z . " I had to find 12-Z myself . No one bothered to escort me to it . I smiled grimly and told myself , There 'll be a few changes made here when I 'm on the salary roll . I sat there waiting for me to appear on the screen and leave me speechless with my talent . Then the screening began . I 'd never seen anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mongoose and a turtle . I could n't wait to get out of the place . I wanted to run all the way to Salt Lake , our next booking ; clasp vaudeville to my bosom , and say , " Honest , dear , nothing happened . That movie wench did n't touch this precious thing we have . " I 've found out since that t he way I felt when I saw myself on the screen the first time is the way most people feel . You ca n't believe it . Your efforts to he funny make you actually nauseated . It 's much more of a ' stomach tree than a screen Wee You think you 're going to look like a cross between Tyrone Power and Robert Taylor , and you ca n't understand why the cameraman did n't give you that Taylor lighting . There 's n story shout a great movie actress who came back to Hollywood to make a film after an absence of eight years . She looked awful in the rushes and she blamed it on the cameraman . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very subtle thing to her , " If you do n't look as young and glamorous as you did when you made your last picture , do n't forget your cernentrnen is eight years older . " It wasn't. too subtle for her to get the point . She calmed down and stuck to acting instead of heeling about the way she photographed . As for me , when I came to work for Paramount seven years later , I had the same head , but by that time I had made a few movie shorts and was used to looking at it . Louise and I flapped to Salt Lake like a couple of homing pigeons victimized by overconfidence in a windmill . When we got to New York I decided to put on my own afterpiece . My youngest brother , George , was n't working . Later he developed into a script writer of some talent , but then 1 figured I could use hint and also a friend of mine , Toots Murdock , from Toledo . The Murdock family was a famous one in show business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great vaudeville dancers . Toots himself was a youngster with a talent for rambunctious comedy . I had an idea which involved stooges in the boxes on each aide of the stage . Not one stooge but two . If one stooge was good  --  and lots of acts with one stooge had gathered in a bumper crop of yaks and toffs  --  two stooges ought to be even better . AR it worked out , I was right . The trouble was at times it was a close decision as to who was atooging for whom .
