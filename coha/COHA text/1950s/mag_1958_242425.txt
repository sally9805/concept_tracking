Though the British colonials spread the color bar throughout their empire , at home the British have clucked over racism in South Africa , given a friendly welcome to Negro G.I.s and enjoyed a feeling of moral superiority over Little Rock . But last week England discovered for itself the queasy sensation of racial tension . <P> It had been coming on a long time , but while full employment lasted , there was no serious trouble . Some whites looked askance at the 130,000 West Indian Negroes who have poured into London and the industrial Midlands since the war , and complained of their un-English habits of nursing babies in public , living six and eight to a room , dancing and singing in the streets . But the Negroes , mostly Jamaicans , readily found jobs as laborers , furnacemen in foundries , dishwashers , transport workers-all the jobs that , as a Ministry of Labor official explained , " our people find too hot and dusty . " A few of the newcomers did well enough to buy small terrace houses and flashy autos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses openly proclaimed " No colored . " Hotels were " full " to Negro applicants . Restaurants often refused to serve them , some pubs segregated Negroes in one room , whites in another . Dance halls all over the Midlands would quietly bar any Negro who did not bring his own partner . Said a ballroom manager : " We 're not against them , we just do n't want any trouble . " <P> Foreign Scandal . Within the past year came the recession and layoffs . As the last hired , Negroes were the first fired . In Nottingham , a textile city of 312,000 , where Negroes constitute less than 1% of the population , they make up 20% of the unemployed . Fist fights between whites and Negroes have become a common Saturday night feature in Nottingham 's slum district around St. Ann 's Well Road , an area noted for petty crime , poverty and prostitution . Last month a gang of white Teddy boys jumped a West Indian laborer and beat him with fists and clubs . A few nights later , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The white wife of a colored man was jeered and spat upon by neighbors . Nottingham 's Conservative M.P. , Lieut . Colonel J. K. Cordeaux , told a mass meeting that it was a " scandal " that " foreigners " should come to Britain and drive up in cars to collect welfare benefits . <P> Emptied Pubs . The pubs on St. Ann 's Well Road last week were filled with edgy whites and Negroes . At Chase Tavern a young Negro drew angry mutters when he entered with a white girl . At closing time a band of Negroes came down the road . As they neared the pub , one of several white loungers called : " What are those black bastards looking at us for ? " With shouts of " Get them ! " the Negroes descended , knives flashing , left two white men writhing on the ground . Within minutes , as nearby pubs emptied , fighting became general . Negroes and whites smashed bottles , grabbed up sticks and bricks and anything else handy . Said one woman : " They knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp cut into my arm . My husband and his friend were on the ground with a pile of colored men on them . A taxi swerved onto the pavement and scattered the blackies . When my husband got up he was holding his back , and I saw there was a knife in it . "
