My wife and I will be married 50 years in March this year , " Paul Krichell said . " That gives you an idea how old I am . I been all my life in baseball . " The chief scout of the Yankees sat at his neat little desk in the backstage catacomb of Yankee Stadium and remembered : " When I was a punk kid catching semipro ball in the Bronx , one day a stranger was waiting for me outside the gate . He says to me , ' How would you like to go to Hartford ? ' I did n't wait , not in those days . I said , ' When does the next train leave ? ' Hell , this was my chance to move up , my chance for opportunity , and nobody had to offer me anything to make my mind up . But now .... " // He waved his hands in a gesture that took in what was too much to be put into words . " Now with the clubs it 's win , win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but ' How much ? ' " // If one had to engrave a summary of modern baseball on the head of a pin , these two sentences would serve to condense the most in the least . As described in SI last week , big league baseball has become a big industry , with the average team and its supporting organization representing a capital commitment of around $9 or $10 million . That amount of money demands a commensurately big income if there is to be any profit . And income , although stadium location , concessions , TV arrangements and several other factors are important , depends finally on the win-loss record . Except in exceptional and temporary cases , a losing team loses money . Therefore , as Krichell says , it 's win , win , win ! // Since the only way anyone has thought of so far to win games is to put good players on the field ( baseball has its own " gamesmanship , " but that 's another matter ) and since players good enough for big league competition are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale with the growing investments that have to be protected . The players ' response is a perfectly natural one . However well they may like the sport as such , the commercial emphasis that surrounds it  --  with breweries fighting fang and claw to sign TV sponsorship contracts , circus stunts in the infield and all the rest of it  --  has made them serious students of the baseball business . " Most of them know the business facts of life well  --  too damn well , " says one disenchanted general manager . Another official adds , " If there 's been one big change in the majors in the last 20 years , it 's been the ballplayer 's ability to take care of himself in the business world . " To alter Philip Wrigley 's well-known aphorism slightly from the players ' point of view , baseball is not too much of a sport to be a business . // THE FOUR HUNDRED OF 5,000 // At a given time in the major leagues , there are 400 of these players , 25 to a club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order reaching from Open Classification to D and encompassing nearly 5,000 players . These 400 share a payroll of around $5 million , which means average pay of about $12,500 for seven months ' work a year . Taking a comparable group of similar age and intellectual attainments , it would be hard to find any trade or profession that pays so well . And the opportunities for advancement are splendid . A rookie brought on to a team for as little as $6,000 , the minimum wage standard in the majors , can shoot up to $20,000 or $30,000 in no time if he has the ability ; and if he is a genius , like Ted Williams , he will move on into the area of $100,000. // Owners are in a constant fret about these high rates of pay . Every year , especially around contract-signing time , there are mutterings that the avarice of the modern players is insupportable and will send the clubs into bankruptcy . What did Larry Lajoie get ? $3,000 . How about Christy Mathewson and Honus Wagner ? $10,000 at their peaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb earn ? $15,000 . Who does Ted Williams think he is ? // The sympathy , however , would be entirely misplaced . For the fact is that the salaries of the players , upon whom everything depends , are far smaller in relation to total baseball income and expense than they used to be , and the decline has been consistent through the years . Toward the beginning of the century , team salaries accounted for some 50% of major league expenses . By 1929 they were at 35.3% ; by 1939 at 32.4% ; by 1950 they were approaching 20% ; and they are in that area today . How can this be ? The answer is that club income has increased vastly , and that expenses necessary to the swelling scope of business operations have increased too . A certain small fraction of the bigger expense reflects the growth of owners ' not entirely selfless interest in the comfort and psychological equipoise of the players . The teams now stay in fine hotels , for instance , and instead of doubling up in Pullman berths ( imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomettes and compartments . A very big share of it is accounted for by the growth of scouting , school , training , coaching and managerial functions , all designed to field a team that will win , win , win . At any rate , the player 's position has become subordinate to the complex mechanism that manufactures and merchandises him . // Thus , while big league players are remarkably well paid , it is equally remarkable that they are n't paid better . No doubt they would be  --  except for one thing . They are , in effect , the bond servants , the semiserfs , of the club owner . At only one time in their lives can they say " How much ? " with any real freedom of choice . That is before they begin to play professional baseball . Once they sign a professional contract with any club , they become commodities in the baseball market and have little more effective control over their rewards or , indeed , their performing careers than so many trained seals , which can yelp for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep them eager . This is because the contract contains something called " the reserve clause . " It is the keystone around which the whole baseball industry is built . // Stripped of its legal trimmings , what the reserve clause says is that the contract  --  which ordinarily is for a one-year period  --  can be renewed if the club wishes , and that it can be sold to any other club at any time . Elsewhere in the contract , the player agrees to abide by all the rules governing organized baseball , which are contained in interlocking agreements that bind the team to its league and the league to all the other leagues in a tightly knit code of " baseball law . " A feature of this law is its provision on " tampering , " which forbids any other club 's even having " negotiations or dealings respecting employment " with a player without the permission of the club which holds his contract . These two items combine to give the player no recourse . If he refuses to renew his contract for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum pay rates laid down in the law ) , no other club can offer him a job . His alternatives are to sign or to stop playing . What he ordinarily does instead , if he feels he is being undervalued , is to hold off signing , meanwhile invoking justice , honor , common decency and his informal guesses as to what other players are getting . If he is a star , he can cause the owners embarrassment both in the newspapers and on the field by holding out until after the season starts . Usually , before then , some reasonably satisfactory figure will have been hammered out . // The reserve clause , in one form or another , is almost as old as professional baseball and has been under attack on both moral and legal grounds during much of that time . To have survived , it must have a useful function . In 1950 a Congressional committee under Representative Emanuel Celler , in a monumental study of monopoly charges against organized baseball , went into the matter all over again and at length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the rule alone . The reason , which had an obvious persuasiveness for the monopoly committee , comes down to this : the essence of baseball is competition between teams  --  and , as we have seen , it has to be real competition , with the outcome in doubt , or the fans lose interest and the whole professional structure falls apart . But some teams have a financial advantage over others because of favorable location or rich backers . If players were free to come and go , such teams could and doubtless would hire all the best ones . There would no longer be real competition except among the top few , while the poorer clubs withered away . Under the reserve clause 's protection they can hold on to players they develop and , in a pinch , sell off enough of them to keep going . The logic is sound , the conclusion inevitable ; and the reserve clause is here to stay  --  until such time , perhaps , as the 16 teams become so many subsidiaries of big advertisers , and the competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Ted Williams may make as much as Jackie Gleason. // THE CASE OF LEFTY JONES // For the player , as well as the owner , the clause is the central fact of his business life , since it severely limits his opportunities . But it is not quite as severe as it looks , for attached to it are subrules having to do with such things as " drafting " and " waivers , " which are intended for the player 's protection and which sometimes actually work out that way . To see these in action and to see how the baseball business apparatus operates to keep the majors supplied with talent , it will be useful to invent a sample ballplayer . His name , naturally , is Lefty . His last name these days is apt to be Italian or Spanish , but for typographical ease it will be Jones . // Who is Lefty Jones ? He is , of course , a composite . Unlike Little Orphan Annie , who remains the same age despite the passage of the years , Lefty will age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  13 years in the context of baseball as it is now organized . // When first we see him , he is a fine , sturdy lad of 13 pitching for his school team and dreaming , boylike , that some day he will be another Johnny Podres . As a matter of fact , several big league scouts are having this same dream . Already  --  at 13 ? Professional baseball has not quite yet infiltrated maternity wards in its search for healthy boys , but the trend is in that direction . There are two reasons for this . Sandlot play , while there is still plenty of it , has given way increasingly to organized play in 14,000 Little League teams for boys aged 8 to 12 years , 2,700 P-O-N-Y League teams for boys 13 and 14 years old , 900 Babe Ruth League teams for boys 13 to 15 and some 17,000 American Legion Junior Baseball teams for ages 15 to 17 . Their yearly state , sectional and national tournaments give scouts the opportunity to see a talented boy in the earliest stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in response to the mounting competitive pressure within the baseball industry , has increased tremendously . Thirty years ago the Yankees , for instance , had three full-time scouts ; today they have 18 in addition to a network of part-time ones , called " bird dogs . " These are men in all walks of life who are always on the alert for prospects for the fun , prestige and possible commissions involved . // So Lefty , who has a fine fast ball and a pretty good curve and who pitched his Little League team to runner-up position in the state tournament , has been looked over by a dozen or so scouts already . They have measured him for size , endurance and temperament , as well as skill . They , no less than his parents , hope that he will grow into a tall , strong young man ( 6 feet 2 inches and 185 pounds would be about right ) with quick mental and physical reflexes and with an ambitious , tenacious , competitive ( but not argumentative ) disposition . One or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes just to shake hands and say what a fine boy he is , but often to look into Lefty 's environment and personality inheritance . Thus is laid the groundwork for an increasing intimacy if developments make that worthwhile . // Lefty makes progress right along , every year bigger , smarter , faster . He really cares about the game . And by now , with his age at 17 or so , the scouts really care about him . He will have been seen in action by scores of them , representing most of the big league teams and perhaps officials of the minor league teams in his part of the country . // The very day after he graduates from high school , Lefty may have his pick of half a dozen contracts . But he and his parents decide that he should have some college education . Lefty likes college and stands out on the freshman ball team . But in his economics course he learns that the average college graduate earns $4,800 a year , which certainly does n't look so hot compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be his time to become wealthy . So , after one year of college , Lefty quits and puts himself on the baseball market . If he has impressed the scouts enough , there is no telling the heights to which competition may drive their offers of a bonus to sign up with their team . The record so far is a reported $125,000 , paid to Pitcher Billy Joe Davidson in 1952 by the Indians . That year , the big leagues paid out more for bonuses to new players than they paid in salaries to all their regular team rosters . This extreme price has not been matched since , but bonuses of $50,000 and $60,000 have not been infrequent , with $100,000 considered well within reason . // The bonus babies  --  for most of them are simply teen-agers , like Lefty  --  are almost entirely a postwar phenomenon , and in the late 1920s and early ' 30s the idea of paying big sums in this way was undreamed of . " Once in a while , " Paul Krichell remembers , " you ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never gave more than $6,000 tops . You did n't give bonuses the way they use the word now . You might give a player $500 or something like that just to sweeten the deal . Why , the whole deal for Lou Gehrig came to $1,500 . Rizzuto did n't cost a cent  --  think of that ! " The change came because the war shut off the usual supply of rookies , and most of the clubs , operating in those years at a loss and nervous about the future , did little to assure themselves a future supply . The exception was Branch Rickey , then president of the Dodgers , who signed hundreds of young prospects , knowing that in a very short time they would have to interrupt their Dodger careers with war service . The result was that the Dodgers came into the postwar era in a very strong position  --  their great record since then is founded directly on Rickey 's foresight  --  and could cash in on the unexpected and unparalleled baseball boom of 1946-49 . Other clubs , having to restock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry , began the wild bidding that now has become a fixture in the industry . // After the first big outlay in 1946 , the owners reached an agreement aimed at protecting themselves from one another 's recklessness . A rule to limit bonus players was added to baseball law and remained until 1950 ; then it was abandoned , resulting in the great splurge of 1952 , after which it was remodeled and put back into force . The current rule says that a club can pay any amount it wants to as a bonus , but that if this is more than $4,000 the new player will have to be put on the team 's regular 25-man roster and spend two years there before being sent to a farm club for polishing . This crimped the spending for a time , but last year , as the first postrule crop grew past their two-year limit and became eligible for assignment to the farm system , the fever took hold again , and 20 boys were signed at fancy prices . // In the past two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonuses , with an investment of more than $700,000 . So far , there has been little return on it . John Bruce Swango , a $36,000 pitcher , was released before ever pitching a ball in a regular game  --  it turned out that crowds made him nervous . // Indeed , one of the most remarkable things about the whole remarkable phenomenon of the bonus babies is that , while a few have measured up as big league material ( Robin Roberts , Gil McDougald , Billy Loes , Andy Carey , Johnny Antonelli , Harvey Kuenn , for example ) , a good many of them have been almost total losses . Yet the big bonuses go on being paid . The situation seems incongruous , but there is a good and simple reason behind it . With farm , scouting , school and coaching costs as high as they are these days , it costs about $200,000 to develop a ballplayer from the time he enters a club system in the lower minors until he is ready for the majors  --  if he ever is . Accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , he will have been a bargain even at $100,000 . One Al Kaline , who signed with Detroit for $30,000 and shortly became one of the finest outfielders in the league , makes up for an awful lot of mistakes . And some of the bonus boys who have been sent to the minors may well turn out , after a few years of seasoning there , to be stars of the future . In today 's fiercely competitive baseball business , these are chances that owners are driven to take . // A CONTRACT WITH THE GREEN SOX // How now for Lefty ? He is a promising player . But the competition is rough : the scouting machine will have turned up a thousand or more prospects worth considering  --  the Yankees alone invite 900 boys a year to their tryout camps at the stadium  --  and hundreds of these will look good enough to be offered contracts . Unless Lefty can make an owner gamble on putting him on a big league roster , he is worth less  --  the rule says  --  than $4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How much ? " , the answer is $3,999.99 . However , there is a lively scurrying under the table , and in some remote way Lefty 's parents no longer owe the $6,000 mortgage on their house and are the pleased owners of a new color TV set . Lefty has a contract with the Green Sox organization . // It could have been worse . He could have been offered no bonus at all  --  as the really marginal prospects are n't  --  and he might have been assigned a worse place to start than Smithville , a pretty mountain town in the Green Sox system , even if it is in a D league and pays him only $37.50 a week . Perhaps he could have started in a higher classification in some other organization , but the Green Sox are temporarily well stocked with pitching material . Lefty is disappointed but not downcast  --  no system ever has enough good pitchers , and he is confident and ambitious . // Now , however , after the first flush of excitement at being a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to realize that the world can be a less obliging place than he had been led to believe . He is expected to get out and win ball games  --  and if he does not , he can be fired without notice , contract or no . In fact , now that he takes the time to study and fully comprehend his contract , he has a hard time finding anything the management has agreed to ; it all seems to be something he has agreed to . Not only can he be fired without notice or severance pay , but even if injuries received " while rendering service under this contract " make him unable to play , he is entitled to only two weeks ' pay as a settlement . At the end of the season , if he lasts that long , he may receive no travel allowance to get home from Smithville . During the four or five weeks of spring training , he gets room and board and laundry , but earns no salary and receives no spending money . He can be traded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fined or suspended for violating any of a number of rules . The contract says that , if any dispute arises between him and the management about his rights and obligations , he is entitled to take his case to the executive committee of the National Association of Baseball Leagues or even to the baseball commissioner . But older hands among his teammates put him straight about this . " If you ever want to work up to the majors , " they warn him , " do n't make trouble . Do n't be a clubhouse lawyer . " // Lefty spends his first season rattling around his D circuit in the club 's elderly Chevrolet bus , bouncing from one town to another and occasionally spending a hard night on the bus . The crowds are small , and there is n't much glamour , but he manages to win more than his share of games and that winter his contract is renewed . Not only that , he finds himself assigned to Brownville , a Green Sox Class B team . Brownville is in the Kansas prairies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not ordinarily have chosen to be . But this is moving up  --  he is raised to $60 a week . // We could follow Lefty through many adventures during the next year : military service ( it takes him almost a full season afterward to sharpen up his pitching repertoire ) , through various transfers in the Green Sox system , through that system 's baseball schools and the various managerial theories that converted him temporarily into a first baseman and finally into an outfielder . Since our concern is with Lefty 's business career , however , it is enough to note that as he rose in the organization he made $82 a week as an A-league player , $185 in the Double-A 's and over $200 when he climbed to the Triple-A 's . Now , a **25;122;TOOLONG veteran of many hundreds of professional games , he is ready for the Green Sox roster itself . He is 24 years old . That autumn , preparatory to this final advancement , he is transferred to the Green Sox Triple-A team at Cold Snap , Alaska , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by snowshoe . The reason for this is that he is eligible for the " draft "  --  not the government 's now , but baseball's. // THE RULES OF THE DRAFT // In theory , the baseball draft has two purposes : to help the weaker clubs obtain good players at prices they can afford and thus to keep intraleague strength relatively even and competitive ; and to insure that players will be advanced to higher league classifications as fast as their abilities warrant . Actually , it helps the players more than the clubs . The basic rule is that a higher league club can , for a certain set price named in baseball law  --  such prices range from $700 to $15,000 , depending on the league classifications  --  buy players from any league club in the rungs below it : moreover , that the clubs in the higher league get to do this in reverse order of their standing , so that the club finishing last gets first choice . However , as the rule goes on to say , a player can not be drafted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized baseball . A player in the B 's , C 's or D 's , for instance , ca n't be drafted into a higher classification for two years ; in the A 's the limit is three seasons , and in Double-A and Triple-A , it is four . In the " open " Pacific Coast League , it goes up to five . Thus , if the operators of a farm system wish to do so , they can hold a player back " in inventory , " so to speak , for several years , although his talent may qualify him for play in a higher league . // Furthermore , the rule says that only one player from Class A or higher can be drafted from a club each year . This gives owners a chance to reduce the hazards of the system to an absolute minimum . Before the yearly draft season comes  --  it lasts for only a few days each fall  --  they simply transfer all their eligible players temporarily to one club . From this roster , only one man can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another year . Thus we find Lefty , along with a dozen or so other eligibles from the high minors owned by the Green Sox system , suddenly assigned to the Cold Snap roster. // And as luck would have it , he is the one drafted . After all these years working up to his big chance with the Green Sox , he starts the following season with the last-place Buffaloes. // However , he at last is in the big leagues , and his working conditions are greatly improved . Now he ca n't be fired without 30 days ' notice . If he is injured , he gets his salary anyway for the full term of his contract . At the end of the season , he gets traveling expenses to return home . During spring training he receives $25 a week for incidentals . If he has a bad season , the club ca n't reduce his salary by more than 25% when and if it renews his contract the next year . He acquires free life insurance coverage for up to $10,000 , and he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 a month . He pays $1 a week dues to the Major League Baseball Players ' Association , which is not quite a trade union , but is heading in that direction , to press the owners for further advantages and to hire Lawyer J. Norman Lewis at $15,000 a year to keep a cold legal eye on the whole owner-player relationship . // The MLBPA 's current aim , incidentally , is to raise the minimum big league salary level from $6,000 to $7,200 and  --  more important  --  to see that the players have a voice in negotiating the price for the All-Star game and World Series TV rights . Their pension fund is supported chiefly by their 60% share of this money . The $1 million-a-year contract that former high commissioner Happy Chandler negotiated with the Gillette Razor Co. in 1950 runs out this year , and the new contract will undoubtedly call for an increase  --  Variety reports that the fee may be as much as $3 million a year . The players claim they were not consulted about the old contract and are understandably eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lefty spends the next few years with the Buffaloes and becomes their regular left fielder . He makes about $11,000 a year and is able to put aside several thousand a year of it to build up some capital ; for during the winter layoff time he has been working as an auto salesman , and he wants to save enough to buy into the agency as a partner . Practically all of his teammates have similar winter jobs and either own or plan to own an interest in some business . But , although he is doing well financially , he knows that he can never relax , not even for an inning : below him in the Buffalo farm system , as he has every reason to realize , are dozens of eager young players who hope to move up and take his job . It could happen any time . And one day toward the end of his fourth season a friendly baseball writer tells him the rumor  --  the Buffalo management has asked for " waivers " on him . // Since at any time the Buffaloes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " option " and then recalled him ( up to three times ) , this probably means that they have decided that someone else on the roster or on the farms can do his job and are thinking of using him for trading purposes . // Baseball law 's waiver rule would give Lefty some problematical degree of protection against the first of these possibilities . The rule says that before a major league club can send a player back to the minors they must offer him to all the other clubs in the league , who then have a right to claim him in reverse order of their standing ; and then , if none of these wants him , he must be offered to the clubs in the other league , also in reverse order . Only if all the majors waive their right to claim him at the standard waiver price of $10,000 can he be sent down to the lower leagues . In theory , at least , this insures that a player will never leave the majors so long as he is good enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , things may not work out that way . The clubs ' general managers are friendly competitors with mutual sympathy for one another 's problems . If one of them has a player whom he wants to send back to inventory , a few telephone calls may well produce a gentleman 's agreement and the necessary waivers . Moreover , the waiver rule contains an extra feature that protects the general manager if anyone defaults . He is entitled to withdraw his offer ; indeed , he can offer the same player twice in any year and withdraw him both times if the other clubs refuse to waive . // As a result of these oddities of the law , the waiver system has long since degenerated into a device for helping the managers engineer player trades . As Philip K. Wrigley testified at the monopoly committee hearings on baseball in 1950 , " Your waivers have always been trial balloons , or tests . You ask for waivers on your players , and then you check with the clubs who claim them , and that gives you a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // Lefty is a valuable player , not ready for the minors  --  yet . So it turns out , when the Buffaloes ask for waivers on him they are only testing , notifying the other clubs in the league that he is not indispensable to the Buffalo roster and that maybe , for the right kind of offer ... or again , maybe not . He is the opening card in what may turn out to be a Big Deal . // Bill Veeck , who has watched and taken part in many such deals , describes the process this way : // " Deals usually have their inception on the back of an envelope . You list your starting lineup . You look for the weaknesses , then start to fill in the ideal lineup that is within the realm of possibility . Next , you try and figure out what would be an agreeable exchange for the players that you 've decided would help your club . You try and figure the minimum that you hope the other club would be satisfied with and the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a deal is to be consummated , the answer has to lie somewhere between the two lists . // " As a starter , you might ask waivers on the players whom you feel might interest another club . They claim them . You call . Guilelessly , of course . Discuss the weather , the attendance , the schedule , anything but the player . When you run out of subjects , you just happen to mention casually that you notice the Blank Club claimed your pitcher . Obviously they could n't expect to get a player of his caliber for the waiver price . Your reason for putting him on the list ? Well , several clubs had asked about him and you were just curious as to how high they 'd go . Had n't any idea really of dealing him . He was much too important and valuable , the way pitching was . However , if they wanted to make an offer , you 'd be glad to listen . No hurry . No , you did n't have any ideas as to who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys like that . Sure , you 'll be at the winter meetings . // " That 's the start , and it 's amazing how many excuses for calling occur after that . At the meetings you agree to meet and discuss the merits of the various players who have entered so far into the various discussions . When you do meet , usually you go through the whole rigmarole again . Why ? Who knows ? I guess it 's a holdover from horse trading or something . In the meantime , you try not to let anyone else get the player or players you want in return for your pitcher . You kid , threaten , cajole and finally you make the deal and find out the other man knew just as much about his player as you know about yours . " // A DEAL WITH LARRY // On the other hand , as Veeck relates , he and Larry MacPhail made one of the most important deals in recent history in only five minutes . " At the World Series in Boston in 1946 , Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp but very truthful if pinned down on players , walked by my box on his way to his seat . I mentioned he had a second baseman I wanted , Joe Gordon . He also had an abundance of infield talent . I had none , but I did have some extra pitching . Larry asked whom I 'd give for Gordon . I told him either Allie Reynolds or Red Embree , but that if he took Reynolds I wanted the right to buy another infielder from their Kansas City team , Eddie Bockman . He went over and sat down , and later I walked over and sat on the step in front of his seat . Joe DiMaggio was sitting nearby , and unfortunately Larry had asked his opinion . Joe recommended very strongly for Reynolds . Larry told me it had to be Reynolds . I needed the second baseman . He needed the pitcher . We made the deal . Gordon won a pennant for Cleveland , and Reynolds won a couple for the Yankees . " // This , of course , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain . And such is often possible , for with the military draft and the attrition due to age and injuries , soft spots are bound to come up often in almost any team 's roster . Baseball legend is full of stories of how so-and-so outsmarted somebody else in a particular deal ; and some of the stories are true . But each club knows its own personnel and has detailed information on the strengths and weaknesses and needs of all the other clubs , and usually the result is a mutually beneficial commerce in which nobody manages ( try as they will ) to cheat anybody else . // Returning now to our sample player , Lefty  --  the following season finds him in the starting lineup of the Blue Sox , as the result of winter-meeting maneuvers that also involved a pitcher , a catcher , two outfielders , three infielders , $25,000 in cash and an autographed portrait of Marilyn Monroe . And here we can leave him  --  the typical ballplayer of the 1956 season . He is 29 years old , married , the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12,000 a year from baseball and a few thousand a year extra from the car agency , some public speaking engagements and endorsing cigarettes and bubble gum . He can count on having his salary raised to $15,000 or so before he is through in the big leagues , a time not far off . Bob Feller may go on forever ( 17 years so far ) but Lefty , being average , probably has only two or three left . After that ? Perhaps a place on the scouting or coaching staff , perhaps a manager 's job on the Blue Sox farm system or a desk job in the Blue Sox 's ever-expanding front office , where there is plenty of work for a man with baseball experience and a good business head . Or perhaps it will be a slow decline down the ladder that he came up , playing for the Triple-A 's , the Double-A 's , the plain A 's and finally leaving baseball before sinking to the ignominy of the C 's and D's. // STILL A HOMETOWN HERO // By that time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sell a lot of cars . Because back there in his home town , he will still be a hero . People will ask him to tell about the time the Blue Sox were playing the Yankees , it was two down , the winning runs on base , bottom of the ninth , and he came up to bat .... He will be chairman of the local committee for the Little Leagues , and he will serve on the park department athletic board . He will have prestige , enough money and a lot of memories . Not bad . Looking back , even to those days on the bus in the D league , and to all the times he felt victimized by baseball law , and to the raises he felt he deserved but did n't get , still a pretty good life , a pretty good business .
