Carnegie Hall was in a sweat bath of nostalgia : far-famed Italian Tenor Beniamino Gigli ( pronounced jeel-yee ) , 65 , returned for his first U.S. appearances in 16 years , and presumably his last . This week he sang the third of three Manhattan farewell recitals . The instant his heavily paunched figure moved from the wings , the crowd turned on the applause full blast . The tenor bowed , leaned firmly on the piano , spread his feet and bent forward from the waist as if to bounce his voice off the stage . <P> <P> The programs listed one old reliable after another ( Brahms 's Lullaby , Una furtiva lagrima from L'Elisir d'Amore , O Paradiso from L'Africana ) , but the cheering listeners evidently were in the mood for chestnuts . The music was just what Gigli always sang best , and he showed traces of his old vocal glory : a refined moment of color , a liquid pianissimo phrase , a ringing high note . More often , the voice was thin , unsteady , and unmistakably 65 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Opera 's star tenor in 1920 , audiences have applauded him less for artfulness than for artlessness . He sang and acted with his peasant 's gusto- " with the whole force of his body , " one critic wrote , " as naturally as a gamecock fights . " Vocal style usually went out the window when he saw a chance to prolong a honeyed mezza voce , a thundering high B-flat , a sob , a gulp or a tearful portamento . <P> Despite Gigli 's fortissimo reception , New Yorkers still remembered the hullabaloo when he failed to take a salary cut during the Depression as other Met stars did . In 1939 , back in Mussolini 's Italy , he denounced the Met as decadent , predicted " something like a civil war " in the U.S. ( he later denied everything ) . <P> Long a wealthy estate owner and patriarch in Recanati , near the Adriatic city of Ancona ( he grows grapes , cures hams and plays boccie ) , Beniamino Gigli had left his home only to bid goodbye to his audiences-particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for the money or the artistic success to myself , " he said , before taking off on a tour of major eastern cities . " I come for gratitude and for addio. "
