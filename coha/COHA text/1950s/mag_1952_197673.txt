Across the U.S. last week , air waves , nurseries and barrooms echoed with a song called / Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus . To a tune that is basically old reliable corn syrup , with occasional chorus and chime effects added , it tells the story of a child who does some Christmas Eve snooping when he ( she ) should have been asleep . Nothing else in the lyrics is quite up to the title-line . Sample : <P> She did n't see me creep Down the stairs to have a peep , She thought that I was tucked up In my bedroom fast asleep . <P> But record buyers are finding it irresistible ; in less than ten weeks , more than 2,000,000 records have been released by Columbia , Victor , Decca , Capitol and MGM . By all signs , it should be an even greater success than the 1948 hit , All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth . <P> Columbia got a head start on the others , and has already sold more than 1,000,000 copies to U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out of Columbia 's vocalist : a twelve-year-old freckle-patch named Jimmy Boyd , of Van Nuys , Calif. , who has had his own radio program in Los Angeles and is a veteran of five years in show business . <P> Jimmy is brighter than the boy in I Saw Mommy , etc . He knows who Santa Claus is . But even Jimmy was surprised by the success of the song . " I like it personally , " he says , " but I did n't think anyone would buy it . "
