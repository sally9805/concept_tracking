PUBLIC confidence in college basketball is shattered , and the fault is partly mine . Thirty-two players from seven schools have con  --  fessed that they took bribes from gamblers to throw games or rig scores . I was a " win-'em-all " coach who , by resorting to established practices , helped to create the emotional climate that led to the worst scandal in the history of sports . The lives of thirty-two boys have been blighted and no one yet knows the extent of the corruption . There are persistent rumors of further revelation  --  and for nearly a year the foulest rumors have been confirmed . The best team in the country in each of the last four seasons and at least ten All-American nominees have been implicated in the rotten mess . I shudder to think how many other players were susceptible to the temptation of easy money . Three stars of the Kentucky team that was part of the United States squad in the 1948 Olympics and that won two successive N.C.A.A. championships were paid to fix games . Seven C.C.N.Y. players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Invitation Tournaments in 1950 , played ball with gamblers . So did eight boys from Bradley , runner-up to C.C.N.Y. for both titles . Last year my L.I.U . team was undefeated in sixteen games and headed for No. 1 national ranking 26 ACNI : when the net began to close on three key men who had taken $18,500 for seven fixes during the course of two seasons . Plagued by guilty consciences , they went to pieces on a Western trip and lost four straight games that were strictly on the level . Later , five more former L.I.U . players admitted their complicity with gamblers to District Attorney Frank S. Hogan , of New York , whose investigations also involved Manhattan , Toledo and N.Y.U. With the exception of four years in the service in two world wars , this is the first year since 1912 that I 'm not actively engaged , as a player or coach , in some form of athletics . For the first time in my life I 'm looking at amateur sport from the proper perspective . Although basketball probably meant as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coun  --  try , President Tristram W. Metcalfe and William Zeckendorf , chairman of the board of trustees , banned the varsity team  --  a ruling still in effect  --  immediately following the scandal of the winter of 1950-51 . At the time , I thought that the action was too drastic , but 1 can see now that it was the only thing to do . I  --  every coach under the pressures of big-time sport  --  was so absorbed in the victory grail that I lost sight of the educational purposes of athletics . The basketball team of 1951 was supposed to he the big hooray in L.I.U . ' s Silver Jubilee , but the events of February 19 , 1951 , turned the silver into dross . They say ; the loudest psalm singer is a reformed sinner . I 'm not " singing " in the underworld sense . I have trouble enough putting my own house in or  --  der . Despite my shocking experience , I still believe competitive sports have a high educational value when handled properly . My purpose in writing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam , so that the same mistakes can be avoided in the future . I have certain recommendations  --  not all original with me  --  that must be adopted , I 'm convinced , to prevent school and college sports from degenerating into a racket that victimizes impres  --  sionable kids . The roots of potential corruption are deeper than any of us admits . On October 27 , 1951 , two boys were offered fifty dollars apiece to throw a football game between Danbury High and Greenwich High , ' a Connecticut . The same day Clark County High , In Winchester , Kentucky , reported an attempt to bribe three basketball players . Fans who have just seen a wildly exciting firehouse finish may be leaving arenas wondering whether the game was on the leveL Basketball is riddled with cynicism , and much of the blame falls on coaches obliged to produce winners . We sabotaged the public 's faith and our students ' loyalty by turning a game into a business . Why did thirty-two players sell out their schools ? The answer is painfully obvious . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many colleges to compromise their standards . The process appears innocent enough at the beginning . A few corners are cut to assemble a winning team for the local publicity and extra revenue every college can use . Everything is fine for a while . The team makes the headlines and attendance booms . Then some  --  one is seized by a bright idea . A better team will bring bigger gate receipts and national , instead of local , prestige . Now the college is in the big time and competition Is tougher , on and off the field . More concessions must be made to lure hot-shot athletes away from rivals . More and more money is spent to stay up thereat the head of the parade . Pressure is piled upon Pressure until there is an ugly blowoff . When college authorities pick themselves up off the floor and survey the wreckage , the damage is appalling . Publicity has turned into notoriety , the black sheep of the public-relations family . Alumni are alienated by shoddy practices that have cheap  --  ened their degrees . Gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been converted into deficits by mounting expenses . The net result of the conniv  --  ing and insane competition is an athletic program infested with so many abuses that the entire struc  --  ture must be rebuilt from scratch . There are four general abuses : recruiting by offering athletes ( 1 ) scholarships , ( 2 ) cash subsidies , ( 3 ) guaranteed passing grades in the classroom ; and ( 4 ) overemphasizing the importance of sports with extended trips , long schedules , year-round practices , postseason games and regular appearances in off-campus arenas . I have been guilty of two abuses  --  overemphasis and giving scholarships . I 'm completely in the clear on the two other charges . I never have given a player a dime for entering or remaining in college . I never have ignored his classroom deficiencies . I plead guilty on only one count , overemphasis , and I 'll give you chapter and verse in just a minute . First , let me say that I do n't believe that straight scholarships  --  free tuition , books and fees  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise could not get an education , a chance to improve himself by capitalizing on his athletic ability is the one defen  --  sible aspect of high-pressure sport . The benefits it has conferred on society far outweigh the evils that have stemmed from it .. Every athlete who matriculated at L.I.U . after 1933 received a scholarship . Although the earliest recipients have been out of school only fifteen years , their achievements are ample justification for the system . Jimmy Gladden , the first Negro boy who ever played for me , was a second-stringer on my 1936 team , but I 'll remember him long after I 've tried to forget last year 's stars who sold out . Last April , Gladden was the first Negro elected an active fellow in the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons . He is chief of orthopedic surgery at Freedmen 's Hospital , in Washington , ( Cunt ' ed on Page 76 ) 76 THE SATURDAY EVEN/NG POST February 2 , 1952 H M 'S ADVICE about colds that we think your own doctor will toll you is sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorten a cold , the first thing to do -- before you do anything else  --  is to take Bayer Aspirin . You should do this because a cold is almost invariably accompanied by muscular aches and pains  --  and a head  --  achy , feverish feeling . And for your own good , you need a medication that will relieve these distressing symptoms ? relieve them quickly . One reason why Bayer Aspirin tablets bring you this important relief ? and do it with amazing speed ? is that they start disintegrating almost instantly . This Bayer way of feeling better fast ? tested and proved by millions  --  is now being used by more men , women and children than ever before . So do n't experiment with a cold . Use Bayer Aspirin . And for sore throats due to colds , gargle three times daily with 3 Bayer Aspirin tablets dissolved in i of a glass of water . When you buy , always be sure to ask for Bayer Aspirin , not just for " aspirin " alone . he greeted with an outpouring of joy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ready with con  --  structive plans for a co-operative war on hunger , illiteracy and disease . " All this may be true , " the reader may protest , " yet in the end your hope will be shattered unless the Kremlin will agree . " I admit that . To obtain agreement is our supreme task . Log  --  ically , agreement could be had in terms of the true self-interest of the Kremlin at a time when war means unimaginable devastation . Stalin is not immortal . His successor will have internal prob  --  lems which may dispose him to see I KNOW WHY THEY SOLD OUT TO THE GAMBLERS ( Continued fr Page 27 ) and head of that section in Howard University 's medical school . Like 90 per cent of our athletes , Gladden came from a family too poor to pay for his education . He was the sort of kid who would have gone to college somewhere , somehow , but it 's a source of ever  --  lasting satisfaction to me that I gave him a lift when he needed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , is a senior psy  --  chiatrist at Bellevue Hospital , in New York . I 've had a hundred better basket  --  ball players than Ed Whalen , but none is doing a more humanitarian job than he in his work with subnormal children . Victor Perez , also an obscure sub  --  stitute , is a teacher in Puerto Rico , trying to raise the depressed conditions of his countrymen . I have chosen at random forty-eight former players who went through L.I . U. on scholarships . Among them are five doctors , fourteen teachers , two den  --  tists , three lawyers , three social work  --  ers and four career officers in the armed forces . I like to think those thirty-one valuable citizens , and the scores of others I coached , compensate for the eight boys who went wrong . Another point should be made . No player ever lost a scholarship for failing to come up to expectations as an ath  --  lete . In the twenty years I coached at L.I.U. , at least 100 boys who could n't make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuition for four years and the same jobs as my five All-Americans , Jules Bender , Iry Torgoff , Ossie Schecht  --  man , Dick Holub and Sherman White . The basketball team was abolished last year , but fifteen recruited players still are in school and will be carried on scholarships until they earn their degrees . One is Murray Tannenbaum , a seven-footer who never appeared in a varsity game . I realized that Tannen  --  baum , a sensitive kid who did n't have the temperament or the desire to play , never would have been badgered into going out for basketball had it not been for his extreme height , so I told him to forget it . I 've been a high-pressure sports guy all my life , but there are two things I never have tolerated : I never have paid an athlete for playing on my team or winked at failing marks . Now , I 'm all in favor of providing athletes with opportunities for earning pocket money . Devoting two or three hours a day to practice sessions leaves them no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict college competition to those who can afford it is to en courage the snobbish English tra  --  dition of the " gentleman " sportsman . It disarmament as in the Soviet interest . The drive for universal power may lose its force , as happened in the history of Islam . At the most pessimistic estimate of possibilities we have no right to say that no inclusive agreement for fool  --  proof disarmament can be reached until those who believe in it have tried for it with a patience , persistence and persua  --  siveness of which the Western Powers have heretofore shown no evidence . At Paris they have made a beginning . American public opinion in all our political parties and groups must see to it that this beginning is not the end of the world 's one hope . is perfectly legitimate to give athletes a chance to make a few honest dollars a week  --  and I mean a few dollars . At L.I.U. , job compensation for players and nonathletes was identical , ranging from fifty cents to one dollar an hour , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls of the five office buildings we occupy in downtown Brooklyn to keep out trespassers or assisted gym ' teachers if they were majoring in physical education . They averaged eight dollars a week . I 've given kids carfare and lunch money , lent others five dollars for a pair of shoes up to seventy-five dollars for a new suit of clothes . Those loans were meant to be repaid , and the great majority were . No athlete , however , was promised outright cash payments or any other inducement , except a schol  --  arship . Ten years ago Phil Rabin , a sensational freshman , came to me with a desperate problem . A brother was stricken with polio and his folks had no money for medical treatments . Hav  --  ing Rabin on my side was like owning the aspirin concession in Washington , but I advised him to leave college and play pro ball . The next season he was the highest-paid player and leading scorer in the American League . Twenty dollars a week could have kept Rabin in school , but , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy his skill . In 1947 two good freshman prospects who wanted to register under the GI Bill asked me to kick back the tuition fees the college would receive from the Government . I told them to clear out because they were more interested in chiseling a few hundred dollars than they were in getting an education . Not all players received free room and board  --  standard inducements at many colleges . We had no dormitories or facilities for a training table . Al  --  though 95 per cent of our athletes lived within a thirty-mile radius of New York City , many had long sub  --  way or train rides to their homes . Art Hillhouse , the mainstay of my first " big " team in Madison Square Garden , spent three hours a day commuting to Rutherford , New Jersey , until I got him a room with a private family in his senior year . Similar arrangements or accommodations in a Y.M.C.A. later were made for out-of-towners , but all local boys lived at home . We did n't provide meals after late practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basketball foundry , but the records show that we conformed strictly to the Eastern Col  --  lege Athletic Conference eligibility code . When I resumed coaching in 1945 after two years in the Maritime Service , my worst team in a decade was weakened further by the loss of Carl Meinhold , the No. 2 man , who flunked out of school . Do you know who busted him ? I did , in the absence of President Metcalfe , who was away on official business . Jack Goldsmith , then the best set shot in the East , flunked out in 1948 . Eddie /Comelier , a regular in 1947 , was dropped from the squad on the eve of the National Invitation Tournament for Playing semipro ball . Jack French , co-captain in 1949. was declared ineligible for the same reason . Dick Fuertado , a regular in 1950 , had another season left last year , but I advised him to quit and concentrate on his studies . Every coach in America would have given his eye teeth for Dick Ahrens , a six-foot , eleven-inch center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to me by Cliff Wells , his high-school coach . Ahrens Might have been another George Mi  --  kan , but he never proved it . He flunked lut as a freshman . All right . The way I tell the story , L.I.U . observed the letter of the rules . Then why are two former players in Jail , with suspended sentences hanging Over six others ? The letter of the rules Is not good enough . It attempts to regulate , rather than eliminate , com  --  petition for gate receipts . It is a poor B ubatitute for the personal responsibil  --  ities of the administration that a school adhere to the spirit of the rules , which holds that games are played for fun and u ot for financial gain . The L.I.U . story Is worth reviewing briefly to demon  --  strate how easily , almost naturally , a school and a coach go along with pre  --  vailing conditions in a normal desire to Win games and public support . Long Island University , founded in 1926 , had a serious morale problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football coach . I had been teaching and coaching at Rider Col  --  lege , in Trenton , New Jersey , which hardly was a plush setup , but it was the Ivy League compared to L.I.U . Classes were held in a bleak factory building , adjacent lofts and even over a howling alley in the industrial section of Brooklyn . There was no campus , no refinements associated with bright col  --  lege years . Educators recognize the Value of sports as a unifying factor , and football was launched with the Idea of stimulating school pride among our students , most of whom came from Poor families . It might have turned the trick in time . The first team won seven out of eight games , but football Was much too expensive in the depres ? ! Ion . When the sport was dropped , I Jumped at the chance to succeed Artie Carroll , the basketball coach , who re  --  e.Igned in 1932 to look after his business Interest &; I was a basketball man from 77 ' way back . At Rider , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East 's leading scorer in Lou Zara . There was no thought or hope of making money from basketball in 1932 . Ned Irish 's big-time promotions in Madison Square Garden were two years distant . Our home games were played in the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy gym , where a capacity crowd of 800 did not cover the rent , the visiting team 's small guarantee and our modest expenses . My first team was a pushover even in our mediocre class , winning seven and los  --  ing eleven games . Eyebrows were raised all over the place when we won all but one game in twenty-eight the next season . Maybe it looked fishy , but you 'll have to take my word that the startling im  --  provement was purely a series of lucky coincidences . Ben Kramer transferred from N.Y.U. when he did n't get the scholarship he needed to remain in school . I gave it to him after making one phone call to Tubby Raskin , a high-school coach . Archie Kameros , a predental student , was paying his own way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yankees , transferred from Brooklyn College to take our new physical-education course . The first time I saw Jules Bender and Leo Merson was the day they walked into my office with un  --  solicited applications for scholarships . Those five men were the nucleus of teams that won seventy-seven games out of eighty in three seasons . They were good , almost the world-beaters they seemed to be . Our home games on the Pharmacy court , which meas  --  ured seventy-five by forty-eight feet , hardly were genuine tests . The boys knew that short court and the back  --  boards as well as they knew the parts in their hair . In twenty seasons we lost three games of some 220 at Pharmacy . Few people , however , had ever heard of L.I.U . until February , 1936 . Playing our first game in Madison Square Gar  --  den , we defeated high-ranking Duquesne by two points and finished the season undefeated . The basic atti tudes of college boys do not change much in fifteen years unless their en  --  vironment changes radically . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance to L.I.U . brought an entirely new environment after 1936 . Having stuck a tentative toe into the big time , we jumped in with both feet , winning 140 games and losing 14 in six seasons against all corners . Timken Silent Automatic , Jackson , Michigan : Please moil illustrated literature . I am interested in : It was very pleasant being up there in the limelight . Students and alumni , who never had much to brag about , were happy to identify themselves with a team that met Stanford , California , Minnesota , Texas , Kentucky , Okla  --  homa A. and M. and other sectional champions . The players got a terrific kick out of licking the best teams in the country before 18,000 people in Madison Square Garden . It was flatter  --  ing to me to be acclaimed a master  --  mind . The young , struggling university did n't find it hard to take the publicity or those checks from the Garden . Each check amounted to more than we could gross in a full season at Brooklyn Pharmacy . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " belong  --  ing , " in that they were part of the American tradition which admires and strives for top ranking in any field . Basketball revenue was earmarked for badly needed improvements of fa  --  cilities , but somehow expenses kept two jumps ahead of income  --  and pros  --  elyting had nothing to do with it . Recruiting players came to no more than $100 a year , the cost of contacting metropolitan-high-school coaches who were the source of 95 per cent of our athletes . I did not see a high-school game after 1935 . My assistants , Sam Picariello , Buck Freeman and Buck Lai , scouted local teams occasionally , but practically all the ten basketball scholarships we gave annually were handed out on the recommendations of coaches whose judgment we trusted . It was an unscientific method , but more often than not , the kids lived up to expectations . The income from basketball doubled , then tripled , but expenses skyrocketed even faster . Where did the money go ? It went into the fancy trimmings a big-time operation inevitably sprouts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity , scouting and office overhead . The players certainly did n't get the money . Neither did my assistants nor I. In the last year I 've had to hold still for a lot of criticism , but no one can accuse me of exploiting boys for personal profit . My salary from 1931 to 1946 was $3500 a year . I think I earned it as director and teacher in the department of accounting , di  --  rector and teacher in physical educa  --  tion , director of athletics and coach of football , basketball , baseball and wres  --  tling . Two raises have been given me since the war expressly for the heavier administrative load I now carry . Bas  --  ketball helped to augment my income from radio , television , coaching schools and books , but the game hardly has made me a plutocrat . I 'm guilty of one accusation that no one has hurled against me . I 'm a lousy businessman . I must be ; the team lost approximately $25,000 last year . I should point out , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex  --  penses were higher by $9200 , the cost of taking the team across the continent for five games . About $10,000 in antici  --  pated income was lost when four games , including two in the Garden , and a postseason tournament were canceled after the scandal . Even during the postwar boom , though , when at  --  tendance and receipts hit all-time highs , the team lost money consist  --  ently . The only postwar year the university made a profit ( $763 ) was 1946 . Signifi  --  cantly  --  and ironically  --  that was the year I returned from the service and my operation was not in high gear . Then why did I continue to knock my brains out to keep up with the Joneses ? We had reached the point of no return We had to turn out top teams to keep up the students ' morale . We had to spend money to maintain our prestige for the students and with the public , and the more we spent , of course , the more we had to earn . The pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I added more games to the schedule to dress up our record . The urgency for developing winning teams forced me , like all coaches , to call for longer and more intensive training periods , until basketball became virtually a year-round activity . The drudgery of prac  --  tice took all the fun out of the game for the boys . Playing in the Garden a few times a year once had been a big thrill , but the bloom was taken off the peach as more and more Garden dates were accepted , until it was virtually our home court . Now the boys were exposed to the hard , brassy atmosphere of show busi  --  ness . They looked around the jammed arena and all they saw was the Broad  --  way crowd . Their own schoolmates were in the peanut gallery , temporarily out of sight and mind . They were sur  --  rounded by a sea of strange faces peer  --  ing at them as though they were live  --  stock exhibits . They were examined for what they could do , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people and playing my heart out for them , " the boys must have said to themselves . " Clair Bee is getting all the credit and Ned Irish and the college are getting all the gravy . Where do I come in ? " That attitude made the players re  --  ceptive to fixers who sold them a bill of goods based on an insidious system of gambling on basketball . All bets were predicated on the difference in the final score rather than on odds . Assume Siwash figured to beat Oshkosh by nine points . The " line " on the game would be a 10-8 point spread on Si-wash . People who took the favorite would collect only if Siwash won by ten points or more . Those who had Oshkosh would win their bets if Siwash 's final margin was eight points or less . If Si-wash won by nine points , the exact spread , nobody but the bookies won . Bribed players worked the racket so cleverly that the point spread was hit on the nose , I 'm told , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixers to approach players with propositions that seemed to take the curse off dis  --  honesty . " What 's the difference , kid , if you win by eight points instead of ten ? " they said : " You 're not letting down the school or the team . We 're not asking you to lose the game . Just ease up a little . Everybody 's making a good thing out of basketball . Do n't be a sucker . There 's a thousand bucks in it for you . " Boys who fell for that spiel were tragically wrong on two counts . There is no degree of honesty , of course . Shaving points was just as much a criminal offense , morally and legally , as throwing games . That , too , came inevitably when fixers forced players to go all the way by threatening them with exposure . Most players reached by gamblers started by manipulating points and wound up with orders to " throw the game . " Come the questions that put me and every coach whose team was corrupted squarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart basketball man . Why did n't I suspect that games were fixed ? Did n't I see things on the court that led me to believe something funny was going on ? Those are fair questions , and I only can answer them now as I did when February 2 , 1952 they were first asked . I never dreamed a boy who played for me could be crooked . Had I thought it was neces  --  sary to police his conduct off the court , I would have given up coaching . I 've studied the movies a hundred times and I can point out where bribed boys played harder and more spectacularly in fixes than they did when they were leveling . I still can give a valid tech  --  nical explanation for every question  --  able action or gesture in a game that I know now was fixed . I had every reason in the world for trusting my boys implicitly . Do you think I would have made a fool of my  --  self last February nineteenth if I had the slightest suspicion of their guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got the squad together , regularly and repeatedly , and warned them against associating with unsavory characters . Two days before the news of the arrests of three C.C.N.Y. play  --  ers hit the papers , I again had spoken to the boys , individually in my office and as a group at practice , telling them that the rumors were stronger than ever . I pleaded with them to tell me the truth . Each boy looked me in the eye and denied complicity with gam  --  blers . On Monday , February nineteenth , the same day the C.C.N.Y. scandal broke , I went to the weekly luncheon of the New York basketball writers and publicly denounced and offered to fight the no-good unmentionables who were whispering that L.I.U . was impli  --  cated . " You 've got to believe in your kids and you 've got to stick up for them , " I was quoted as saying . While I was saying it , the police were picking up three of my players . Sure , I was a naive chump  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to them . I had to trust Adolph Bigos , my captain , a combat veteran decorated with the Bronze Star and five battle ribbons . I had visited Bigot ; in his home , gone to church with him , cried with him at his father 's funeral . I had so much faith in Eddie Gard that I told the boys to look to him for leader  --  ship on the court . They did , unfor  --  tunately . Gard was the intermediary for Salvatore Sollazzo , the briber . Dick Fuertado and Lou Lipman were fre  --  quent guests in my home . I told Nat Miller , whose shoulder was banged up badly in the war , that I never had more respect for a player 's guts and spirit . I had so much confidence in Jack Gold  --  smith that he was the only player ever given permission to shoot whenever he pleased . Sherman White and LeRoy Smith had spent considerable time at my farm in Manorton , New York . When a restaurant in Oklahoma refused to serve Negroes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel a game one year when a hotel in Missouri wanted to put them in an annex . I went down to the street to fight a flannel-mouthed bum  --  he did n't show up  --  who blasted me over the phone for bringing Negroes into the hotel . I 'm not trying to prove I 'm a torch-bearing Liberal . All I 'm trying to establish is that my relationship with the players did not begin and end with winning basketball games . There was one false note in the en  --  vironment I tried to cultivate . We were playing basketball for money , and some boys followed the college 's example . That , bluntly , is the story of the ugliest black eye ever hung on col  --  lege sports . Something must be done before all sports are disfigured . Nothing will be ( Continued on Page 80 ) EVENING POST ( Continued from Page 78 ) accomplished until college presidents take aggressive action in cracking down on irregularities in their athletic departments . The absolute remedy for all the excesses and abuses is clear : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open wide the gates . I 'm not a starry-eyed reformer offer  --  ing visionary suggestions . Johns Hop  --  kins has been making pure amateurism work since 1937 with conspicuous suc  --  cess in eleven sports , including foot-ball , without collecting a dime at the gate . That 's right ; no admission has been charged to any sporting event at Johns Hopkins for fifteen years and its athletes are continuing to win their share of games . Teams are financed by a budget allotted the athletic division , the same as any other department of the university . The famous medical and engineering school in Baltimore , with a curriculum as difficult as any college 's in the coun  --  try , has gone a vital step further . It has made all coaches full-time faculty members with academic tenure , a plan adopted by a number of other schools , with enormous benefits to all parties concerned . A coach who has security , regardless of his won-and-lost record , is not subject to the pressures that might otherwise force him , often against his will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run with an as  --  sured income and a pension than the clay pigeon who is under the gun con  --  tinually to produce winners . Equally important , a coach with faculty status certainly gets more satisfaction from his work than the man for whom every game is a crisis that calls for scheming and straining as though it were his last day on earth . Few schools have Johns Hopkins ' en  --  dowment fund of $36,000,000 and , as a consequence , can ill afford the luxury of dispensing with gate receipts . Granted . Yet , with one slight modifica  --  tion , every school can adopt the same policy . It even can be done at L.I.U . under the unfavorable conditions posed by a small student body and lack of facilities . Assume that each student is assessed a modest ten-dollar athletic fee , in re  --  turn for which he is admitted free to all home games . At L.I.U. , with an en  --  rollment of 3600 , that comes to $36,000 a year  --  ample to support a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be fancy trimmings such as long trips , room and board for players , a training table , elaborate publicity and scouting of opponents . All coaches must be full-time faculty members with teaching assignments and paid , therefore , out of general funds . A limited number of scholarships  --  I still believe in them  --  can be provided for athletes who have the academic qualifications required of all candidates for grants-in-aid and make normal , steady progress toward degrees . Bear with me for a moment while I estimate out loud the necessary basket  --  ball expenses based on past costs , but remembering we 're operating on a re  --  duced scale . Equipment will run about $2000 , medical care $1500 , laundry $500 , office supplies and part-time per  --  sonnel $750 . Pay a student $500 to handle publicity . Set aside $800 for meals after games , $1000 for one two-day trip a year and $3000 for traveling expenses to nearby colleges . Earmark $5000 for guarantees to visitors ; they 'll be glad to come for home-and-home series , building up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep all their home receipts . Rental for the Pharmacy gym will be $1000 for a February 2 , 1952 complete home schedule , and referees fees $750 . Add it up . The total is $16,800 . We have a balance of $19,200 for other teams  --  and a clear conscience . Most colleges will be in a more advanta  --  geous position than L.I.U. , since they already have gyms that eliminate rental charges . The ten-dollar student fee can be reduced gradually by selling season subscriptions to alumni for ten dollars . What about the general public ? If we have room , come in free as our guests . Football , admittedly , is more expen  --  sive . All right . Charge the public an admission of one dollar for football alone and I 'll guarantee that the budget can be balanced . Old blues among the alumni and re  --  actionary coaches will scream that I 'm advocating de-emphasis of sports . Of course I am . Perfectionists will com  --  plain that the caliber of technical per  --  formance will decline . Johns Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so  --  and ; ? and if it is ? All things are relative . Carnes will be just as close , and maybe contested more spiritedly . The perfectionists never are satisfied , anyway . As one who has learned through bitter experience , I know a losing team is better than no team at all . Anything is infinitely better than waiting beside a telephone at four o'clock in the morn  --  ing while kids in a police station down  --  town are signing confessions that will brand them as long as they live .
