The Argentine government made a cagily indirect answer last week to reports that Juan Pern had arrested Ronald Richter , his " atomic scientist " ( TIME , May 28 ) . Newspapers announced that Professor Richter and his laboratory associates would observe a national holiday by working 24 hours straight . <P> But Richter made no public appearance . Instead , Juan Pern issued a decree placing the entire Huemul Island atomic energy program under his own direction . On top of that , Professor Cornelius Jan Bakker , a leading Dutch nuclear physicist , arrived at Huemul Island under a dense cloak of secrecy . He was apparently brought in as a result of recent talks between Pern and The Netherlands ' good-will ambassador , Prince Bernhard . <P> Was Bakker in Argentina to run a check on Dr. Richter ? That was what Netherlanders surmised . Their theory : suspicious of Richter , but leary of getting involved with atomic experts from the U.S. , Britain or Canada , Pern asked Prince Bernhard for a qualified Dutch scientist to audit Richter 's books .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
