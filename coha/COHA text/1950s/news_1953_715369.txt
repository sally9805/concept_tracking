txt G. 0 . P. ELECTS HALL AFTER HE PLEDGES AID IN PATRONAGE National Committee Members Ask and New Chairman Gives Assurances He Will Help PRESIDENT URGES UNITY ' Team ' Has No Room , He Says , for ' Eisenhower Republicans ' or Any Other ' Kind ' on It ' By W. H. LAWRENCE Special to TEE NEW Yams Tu-tr.5 WASHINGTON , April 10 ? Leonard Wood Hall of Oyster Bay , L. I. , was elected unanimously today as chairman of the Republican National Committee and immediately summoned its members to " man the dikes for Ike " in the crucial 1954 mid-term Congressional elections . He succeeded C. Wesley Roberts of Kansas , whose resignation was accepted " with the utmost reluctar ce and deep regret . " Mr. Roberts quit March 27 after a joint committee of the Kansas Legislature unanimously had censured his alleged influence-peddling activities for private profit during the 1951 legislative session . President Eisenhower pledged his " complete loyalty and sincer ( cooperation " to the new party chairman and , pleading for complete party unify , declared : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party for Eisenhower Republicans or any other kind of Republicans . We are a team . " Speaking to the full membership of the National Committee assembled in the Rose Garden of the White House grounds , the President commented on the astonishing degree of cooperation his Administration " team " had received from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill , and said this was a good omen . A Last-Minute Hitch Although Mr. Hall had been endorsed in advance by all top Republican leaders , including Piesi ' dent Eisenhower , there was a lastminute hitch in the machinery set up to elect him . Members of the National Committee 's nominating committee summoned Mr. Hall before them to ask and receive assurances that he would seek to give committee members a greater voice in clearing patronage appointments of the Eisenhower Administration . Many members of the National Committee privately expressed dissatisfaction with the small number of jobs given to Republicans thus far . Several were resentful that they had been called all the way to Washington to " rubber stamp " the selection of Mr. Hell and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talk among some Western delegates of attempting to put another candidate in the field , but this sentiment failed to win substantial zapport in premeeting conferences , and no other name was put in nomination after J. Russel Sprague of New York put up the name of his fellow Nassau County resident . Mr. Sprague , a National Committeeman , has been the Republican leader of his county since 1935 . Mr. Sprague , himself , recognized the antipathy of many Midwesterners to the selection of any New Yorker as national party rheirman . He declared in support of Mr. Hall that while Oyster Bay // was near in miles to New York City and " The Great White Way " it was , in spirit , as remote as any prairie village . The choice of Mr. Hall was a victory for a Republican Congressional group , led by Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , and underlined the concern of party leaders over the possibility that the Democrats might capture control of one or both houses of Congress in the midterm elections nut year . Resigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post as Surrogate of Nassau County and announced he would serve as party chairman without salary , also sounded a warning note about the difficulties of retaining Congressional control in the next elections . " The American people know Ike can do the job , " he said , " and you and I know that if he is to do the job he must have a Republican Congress in 1954 . If perchance that should not happen it would be like tying one of his hands behind his back . " Democrats greeted Mr. Hall 's selection as Republican chairman by circularizing among Washington correspondents , in advance , comparison of his voting record in Congress with the announced campaign pledges of President Eisenhower . They cited twenty instances wherein they said Mr. Hall differed with the President on important policy matters . Mr. Hall was a member of the House of Representatives from 1939 to 1953 , and served for some years as chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee . The first business before the National Committee today was the acceptance of the resignation of Mr. Roberts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as chairman only three months less seven days . " Unjust and Unfair " %ttacks In his letter of resignation thel Kansan said : " The present status of the personal and political attacks on me in my home state , however unjust and unfair my friends and I may consider them , have made my decision to resign the right and proper course for the best interests of the party . " No one mentioned the unanimous report of the Kansas legislative committee that charged Mr. Roberts had deliberately violated the spirit of the Lobbyists ' Registration Act when he received an $11,000 fee in 1951 for negotiating the sale of a hospital building to the state for $110,000 . Mrs. C. Y. Semple of Baxter Springs , Kansas National Committeewoman , told the committee that " at least 90 per cent of Kansas Republicans have the utmost faith in Wes Roberts " and Wayne Hood of Wisconsin offered a resolution approved by the committee which called the retiring chairman a. " friend of integrity whom we hold in high esteem . " Mr. Hall 's election had beconlei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his acceptance speech was mimeographed in advance , and he was ready to announce appointment of a special three-member committee of outsiders to study and report to him on the structure and staff of party headquarters . Members of this group are . kis .. rry Hoagland of Boston , assistant . secretary of the American Research and Development Corporation ; A , David Baumkart of Vermillion , Ohio , former Ohio House , member and an executive of the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation , and William J. Casey , a New York lawyer . Before going to the White House to meet with President Eisenhower , the National Committee adopted a resolution approving the " Magnificent record " made by the Eisenhower Administration in the first seventy-five days in office . Miss Bertha Adkins of Maryland , head of L .. e women 's division , announced plans for a conference of Republican women in Washington April 23 and 24 . She said she expected abovk1,200 women workers to attend the session . The President will address a luncheon on April 24 , she said . The committee formally elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conn. , and Mrs. Raymond W. Wheeler of Massachusetts . Both had been nominated by state party organizations . TEXT OF PRESIDENT 'S TALK I am delighted to get a chance to bring a word of welcome from this Administration . I am delighted with your choice of a National Chairman . He is going to get my complete loyalty and sincere cooperation . There is no longer any room in the Republican party for Eisenhower Republicans or any other kind of Republicans . We are a team . You people have elected a man to take over the administration of the Republican party . Let 's give him our loyalty . . Let 's do n't go back to our own places and start chopping him down . I will say to everybody here that I will work at this business as hard as I can , just . as everyone of you should . If anybody finds anywhere along the line that they think I have failed they are at perfect liberty to get on the phone or send a wire or come here and tell me where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been of the head and not of the heart . You have electerLsomebody who has got the savvy to keep mistakes of the head down to a minimum . There has been a whale of a lot in the papers about differences between the Administration and ether elements and leaders of the Republican party here in Washington . Of all the exaggerations . I know about this is almost as great as the one applied to Mark Twain 's death . All the Cabinet officers are astonished at the degree of cooperation from the Hill received from our party and often from members of the opposing party . There have been some errors and some differences . We would be less than human if there were not . It is my idea that it is important to us in this Administration to give you people a splendid governmental record that you can take as your own and carry to the people of the United States ? not only the registered Republicans but all the people who helped win the victory of last Noyember and others who have never been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of record and leave it up to Len Hall , the organization of the Senate and House will be in safe hands in 1954 . This is what we are after , not for ourselves but for the United States of America , and that 's our platform .
