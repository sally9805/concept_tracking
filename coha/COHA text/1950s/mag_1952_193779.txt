The nominee settled down last week in a three-room log cabin in the Rocky Mountains . Seventy-two miles northwest of Denver and two miles from a paved road , Dwight Eisenhower fished for trout , made flapjacks and did some thinking . <P> Some thinking was needed . The wisest of Ike 's supporters know that he will have to improve his performance if he is to stall the Democratic machine in November as he ditched the Taft vehicle in July . Once the campaign gets rolling in September , Ike may not have much time for thought . Between now &; then , Ike can win or lose his battle depending on his ability to dredge up a convincing campaign out of his own wide experience and his own deep convictions . <P> He Must " Know . " Ike loves meeting people , talking to them , hearing what they have to say . He is much less enthusiastic about long hours of reading , study and concentrated thought . <P> When he said " I do n't know " at his first press conference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere smogged with panaceas . But from now on , as the party 's nominee , he can not say that he does n't have any prescription for Korea , that he does n't know much about Farm problems or , in fact , that he " does n't know " about any important issue . Now , he must know . <P> Knowing should improve the Eisenhower speeches , which have been marred by too many hollow notes , too many platitudes , too many superficialities . The difficulty lies not in speech writing , but in speech thinking-in the content of the speeches . Good speech writers can help a candidate to say what he wants to say ; only the candidate can find out what he wants to say . <P> The pre-convention campaign left no doubt about Eisenhower 's fundamental political convictions or about the political effectiveness of his personality . Between conviction and personality , however , lies the . wide gap that Candidate Eisenhower must fill with program , argument , and decision on practical issues . <P> Ike can not repeat the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's greatest industrial centers , he did not mention labor . Ike has to take a hard look at the labor-management situation in the U.S. and at Government policy toward same , and he must develop a fairly specific attitude toward what needs to be done or undone . <P> Staff Position . To be his good right hand , he needs a staff and a chief of staff , the political equivalent of General Alfred M. Gruenther , his brilliant chief of staff at SHAPE . Last week Ike was said to be seeking just such a man . The staff chief would not have to be a skillful political tactician like Herbert Brownell , but rather a man used to dealing primarily in issues . Among the names being mentioned in some Republican councils last week-not necessarily as the top prospect , but as the kind of man who is needed : Minnesota 's scholarly Representative Walter Judd . Whoever he picks has to have the stature of a collaborator , not a subordinate . Eisenhower 's military staffs have been characterized by " strategy " men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same kind of staff works in politics .
