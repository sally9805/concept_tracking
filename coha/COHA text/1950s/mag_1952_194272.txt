THE ILLUSIONIST ( 250 pp. ) - Franoise Mallet-Farrar , Straus &; Young ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Some of the most striking French fiction comes from precocious teenagers writing about teenagers . In Devil in the Flesh , 17-year-old Raymond Radiguet showed a boy drawn into a love affair with an older married woman and swamped by the first rush of passion . In Awakening , Jean-Baptiste Rossi , 16 , told a startling but sensitive story of a love affair between a youngster and a Roman Catholic nun . In The Illusionist ( written three years ago ) 22-year-old Franoise Mallet , a Parisian housewife and mother , tells perhaps the strangest tale of all , that of a 15-year-old girl who falls in love with her father 's mistress . When the book appeared in France last year , the weekly Le Peuple spoke for most of the critics when it said : " The Illusionist is not , strictly speaking , a masterpiece , but it is not far from one . " <P> Innocent Eye . Hlene Noris is a lonely , wide-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . Her widowed father is a stuffy businessman parceling his time between his shops , his stocks and his political ambitions . When Hlene wanders to the kitchen for companionship , the maid shoos her out , tells her : " Masters are masters and servants are servants ! Society makes these rules . " To give her life a dash of drama , Hlene pretends , when in school , not to know her lessons-just to hear her classmates titter and her teachers upbraid her . Down deep she is convinced that , except for a miracle , " nothing will ever happen to me in all my life ! " <P> Hlene 's miracle takes the form of a chance meeting with her father 's Russian mistress , Tamara . To Tamara , who has lived precariously for most of her 35 years , Papa Noris is an anchor of security , though he never guesses how often and strangely she drags anchor . For Tamara is a Lesbian , too neurotically selfish for anything but a perverted counterfeit of love . But to the innocent eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her low voice " rough as a cat 's tongue , " her disordered flat , a jungle den of cigarette smoke and weird African masks , has all the magnetic pull of an adolescent daydream come true . <P> The den into which Tamara gradually draws Helene turns out blacker than any jungle ; it is a total eclipse of the soul . As their strange relationship progresses , both shame and secret jealousy prevents Hlene from telling her father that she even sees Tamara . One day Tamara demands that she tell him , and slaps her viciously when she fails to do so . In a sobbing flare-up of independence , Hlene cries , " You 'll never see me again ! " and leaves . <P> Her revolt is short and bitter . Humbly and penitently , she returns . From then on , Hlene is made to suffer for every moment of pleasure . Tamara finally takes her to a Lesbian nightclub and abandons her to the pawings of a frumpy rival . <P> Is Everybody Happy ? Up to this point , Author Mallet saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a style as spare as a fine Japanese print . When she tries to save her characters with a conventional happy ending , the effect is more pat than palatable .
