Coconut Planter Rufino Flores Velez was riding along a Mexican trail near the isolated village of Rio Grande in the southwest corner of Oaxaca state . When his horse kicked the corner of a stone sticking out of the dust , he hopped off , investigated , and gathered a gang of peasants to dig up the stone . It weighed about three tons , but at last the peasants managed to turn it over . The underside was covered with elaborate carvings that looked to non-archeological eyes like a man and woman embracing . <P> Hill of the Toad . Flores duly reported his find , but nothing was done until two novice archeologists , Robin Mills and Morgan Smith of Florida , heard about it in Oaxaca City . By airplane , jeep and saddle horse , Mills and Smith worked their way to roadless Rio Grande , where proud villagers showed them the stone . Part of the stone was covered with hieroglyphics , and five square miles of ground around it was full of exciting traces of an ancient civilization . <P> That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grande 's Mayor Adalberto Cuevas , the young archeologists tramped through a jungle full of screaming parrots to a steep slope called Cerro del Sapo ( Toad Hill ) . Overlooking the blue Pacific was a second slab with two Picasso-like figures carved on it . Locally called Los Reyes ( The Kings ) , the stone is still revered as a miracle-working idol . The people of the vicinity make pilgrimages to it to pray for rain , and the carvings show traces of wax from their votive candles . Near it is another carved stone , badly eroded , whose local name is " The Queen . " <P> Familiar Symbol . Mills and Smith photographed all the stones and reported to Professor Ignacio Bernal , one of Mexico 's top archeologists , at Oaxaca City . Bernal recognized the style of the first stone . It was Zapotec , a relic of a high culture that centered around Oaxaca City and reached its peak during the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. Until now , said Bernal , there has been no evidence that the Zapotec culture ever extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols on the stone are probably dates , and they may be a help toward deciphering the hieroglyphic writing of the Zapotecs . <P> The other stones , " The Kings " and " The Queen , " were even more exciting archeologically . Bernal had never seen anything like them . Only the big square symbol on the two figures was familiar to him . It has been found elsewhere in Mexico , in ruins as old as the 5th century . Bernal believes that further digging on the Hill of the Toad may tell what people lived in the secluded Rio Grande region before the Zapotecs came .
