In Manhattan 's elegant St. Regis Hotel last week , a waiter carried two tomatoes on a tray into the suite of Mrs. Tillie Lewis of Stockton , Calif . She was aghast at the bill ( $1 ) . " You tell Vincent Astor , " * said Mrs. Lewis as she signed the check , " that these tomatoes cost him no more than 5 apiece , that 's 1,000% profit . " Said the waiter : " I guess you know your tomatoes . " <P> The waiter did n't know it , but he was indulging in an understatement . In her late 40s , Brooklyn-born Tillie Lewis likes to say she is the world 's tomato queen and one of the nation 's largest independent canners of fruits &; vegetables . She began her Manhattan holiday last week as the 1951 packing season ended . At its close , her Flotill Products , Inc. had turned out 150 million cans , including some 75 million cans of tomatoes and tomato products . This year , she estimates she will net some $1,300,000 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lot of Tomatoes . At the age of 15 , Tillie , who was born Myrtle Ehrlich , was married to a Brooklyn wholesale grocer who imported the firm-bodied , pear-shaped Italian tomatoes which make the best spaghetti sauce . She later divorced the grocer , but she remembered the tomatoes , even when she went to work selling securities in Wall Street . In 1934 , when a tariff sent the price of Italian tomatoes skyrocketing , Tillie began to think of growing them in the U.S. Everybody told her it was impossible ( " the soil is n't right " ) . But on a trip to Italy , she got seed and talked an Italian importer into staking $50,000 on a project to grow them in California . There , she persuaded farmers to undertake the experiment . It succeeded ; pear-shaped tomatoes now make up about 10% of California 's crop . To can the tomatoes , Tillie talked Pacific Can Co. into building a small plant at Stockton , with an option for her to buy . In 1935 , her first year , she lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; once , when the boilers failed , she got a railroad to move in a locomotive , used its steam to complete the canning before the tomatoes spoiled . She designed a conveyor-belt feeder which is now used by other canners . <P> In 1937 , when Flotill was beginning to show profits , Tillie 's backer died . She borrowed more than $100,000 to buy out his interest , paid it back from earnings in ten months . As sole owner , Tillie added spinach and asparagus to her line , and built new plants . When an organizing strike threatened in 1940 , A.F.L. Organizer Meyer Lewis sat down with Tillie , settled the problems in an hour . Impressed with Lewis , Tillie hired him as general manager , seven years later married him . <P> The Feminine Touch . Tillie has learned every trick of the canning trade , and played them all to the hilt . Her methods have not always endeared her to other canners . Like almost every other canner , Tillie Lewis lost money in 1948 &; ' 49 ( reason : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wangling two RFC loans for a total of $1,600,000 ( has paid off all but about $600,000 ) . Tillie chose this poor time to launch another venture-a Texas company to import and can Mexican pineapples . Tex-Mex went bust , and Tillie says she lost $600,000 on the deal . But Flotill kept on growing .
