President Lee A. DuBridge of Caltech is no man to deny that the U.S. needs to turn out many more scientists and engineers . But , he warned last week , that does not mean that the country should be so " hysterical over reports that the Russians are ahead of us . " Said DuBridge : " It is true that in Russia more men and women received degrees in science and engineering than in the U.S. So what ? Maybe that is because in the past 100 years they have so neglected their technical strength that they must now exert strenuous efforts to build it up . If this is true , then our rate of production should not be determined by their weaknesses-only by our own . Let us ask how many engineers we need to do our job , and not take over their figures or the numbers they require to do their job . "
