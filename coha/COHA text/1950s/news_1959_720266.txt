txt An intensive search for new city taxes as substitutes for an off-track betting levy or a sales tax increase . is under way in case neither of these two taxes is - found to be feasible . Asked last night what the substitutes might be , Mayor Wagner said : " As in times past , I have explained that we are exploring a number of avenues . I have no intention of disclosing them at this time . " Attention was drawn to the city 's search for substitute taxes as the result of Mayor Wagner 's comments in Albany earlier in the day after discussions on the city 's financial needs with Governor Rockefeller and the Republican Senate leader , Walter J. Mahoney . Sales Tax Outlook Changes It was apparent from the Mayor 's comments and from developments both in Albany and here during the day that the likelihood of any sales tax increase was fading . In Albany , the Mayor made it clear that he was still clinging to the hope that the city would be rescued from its fiscal troubles by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This levy ? called by the Mayor a service charge ? is his first choice for a " big tax " needed with seven smaller new taxes and rises in existing levies . His aim is to close the $141,000,000 gap between income and outgo in the city 's budget for the fiscal year beginning next July I. The proposed sales tax rise from the existing 3 per cent to 4 was submitted by Mr. Wagner to Albany as a second-choice big tax to be used only if the offtrack betting proposal failed . Yesterday the Mayor said in Albany that he recognized the drawbacks of a higher sales tax and would " explore every avenue to avoid it . " The Mayor also said city services might have to be curtailed far more sharply than was planned at present to help close the $141,000,000 gap . Mr. Wagner told Albany reporters that " we are going to put on a real strong drive ? even a stronger drive than we have so far  --  for off-track betting . " He said he expected the Board of Estimate to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , and also from the proposed payroll tax . An intensification of the efforts for off-track betting , he indicated , could be attributed to the growing opposition to a sales tax increase . Asked last night on his return from Albany about reports that he had completely abandoned any sales tax increase , Mayor Wagner said : " We 'd like to abandon it if we can .. We have been seeking ways to abandon it . I do n't like the tax . " Earlier in the day the proposed sales tax rise came under new atttack here . Manhattan Borough President Hulan E. Jack became the second member of the Board of Estimate to express flat opposition to increasing the sales impost . Queens Borough President John T. Clancy announced last Friday that he would not support the increase . The Mayor went to the capital yesterday to appear in favor of the proposed $500,000,000 school construction bond issue . Also at the capital , Senator Mahoney reported that his staff was making a study of ways the city might bridge its fiscal gap . Senator Mahoney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palatable to me . " Asked whether he thought the city should enact a payroll tax , Senator Mahoney replied that it was a decision for Mayor Wagner to make . Mayor Wagner said on a radio broadcast Sunday that the city might be forced to accept a payroll tax , which he has called " the worst possible tax , " to avoid cutting services . The city has had the authority to impose a payroll tax since 1953 . The Assembly put off until today or tomorrow the debate on a Democratic motion to discharge the Ways and Means Committee from further consideration of the off-track betting bill . No motion to release a bill from committee has prevailed since 1907 . Asked earlier whether the defeat of the motion would be construed by him as the final defeat of the off-track betting proposal , Mr. Wagner replied : " We 'll never concede defeat until we go down for the third time . " Jack Discusses Sales Tax In opposing any increase in the retail sales tax , Mr. Jack said : " Manhattan wears the mantle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vital importance to the community and the City of New York that its role as the financial capital of the world be maintained . " Ten days ago City Council President Abe Stark asked the Legislature not to " force " the city to increase its retail sales tax . But he did not completely close the door to voting for such an increase if other proposals failed . The Legislature was called upon last night by the Protestant Council of the City of New York to defeat in the Senate and the Assembly any motions to bring to the floor Mayor Wagner 's proposal for legalizing and taxing off-track betting . " In this deadly hour of peril to our national security , " the Council said , " it is perilous selfdeception to build up our ma. terial defenses against enemies without , while corroding from within the moral fibre of our citizens and our governments by sending them into rampages of gambling destructive of the very sense and basis of thrift , industry and spiritual integrity .
