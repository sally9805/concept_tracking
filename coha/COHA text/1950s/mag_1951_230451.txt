In the 18 months since the 26-million volt betatron was installed at the University of Illinois ' College of Medicine in Chicago ( TIME , Sept. 5 , 1949 ) , researchers have found it a valuable and promising weapon against some kinds of cancer . Twenty-three patients have been given a full course of treatments . Of these , reports the Illinois Division of the American Cancer Society , " a few are without evidence of the disease so far as can be ascertained . " <P> The only patients accepted for the betatron were those with cancers so far advanced that no other treatment offered any hope . Yet only four of the betatron patients are known to have died of cancer ; eight have died from other causes not directly related to cancer . Doctors feel that the betatron has shown remarkable promise in brain cancer ; of six cases treated , only one has died . More apparent is the effect of the betatron 's massive doses of high-voltage X rays on a less common malignancy called Pancoast 's tumor . This type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both the patients treated got quick relief from pain and they are now back at work . Their affected ribs have grown back . <P> Too Soon to Say Cured . The betatron 's first patient , Fordyce Hotchkiss ( TIME , Dec. 19 , 1949 ) , died last month of a coronary thrombosis . The cancer in his throat appeared to have healed completely . However , Hotchkiss ' cancer had started to spread before he began the treatments , and the areas affected later could not be treated by the betatron because of the danger of overdosing his neck . Nevertheless , Hotchkiss got back his appetite , ate three full meals a day until the secondary cancers appeared , and dressed himself every day until his death at 73 . <P> Despite these hopeful signs , the Illinois doctors refused to talk about the possibility of cures . A case must go at least five years without any recurrence , to be considered medically cured . <P> Electrons in the Raw . Meanwhile , the doctors are trying something new with the betatron . Previously they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platinum target , which produced X rays , and then aiming the X rays into the patient 's cancer . The new technique is to use the electrons in the raw . The advantage : whereas an X-ray beam keeps going after it has passed through cancerous tissue , and may cause " exit burns " where it leaves the body , the electron beam can be focused to hit the cancer site and then dissipate itself . <P> In the last five weeks , a cancer of the breast , one of the jawbone , and a case of malignant , blackish moles ( melanotic sarcoma ) have received the first experimental treatments with a 20-million volt electron beam . So far , the doctors will say nothing about results . But they are sufficiently encouraged to go on trying the raw electrons.
