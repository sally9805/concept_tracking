 | The Tex Rickard Story:Gold is for the Taking WHEN TEX RICKARD , the sports promoter , died in Miami on Jan. 6 , 1929 the newspapers could not have devoted much more space to his career if he had been President . In itself this was not too puzzling . Every move Rickard had made for years had been front-page news . Before creating the " million-dollar gate " with Jack Dempsey , Tex had been , successively , a cowboy , a town marshal in Texas , a prospector in the Yukon , a gambling-saloon owner in the Klondike and Nevada gold rushes , a fortune hunter in South Africa and a cattle baron in Paraguay . More difficult to explain than the tremendous press coverage of Rickard 's death was the widespread emotional reaction of the public . Thousands of men and women who never had known Tex personally mourned him as though he had been their lifelong friend . This curious phenomenon first became apparent as Rickard 's body was being taken to New York . In death as in life , George Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15,000 solid bronze casket that weighed 2,200 pounds ? was shipped north in a private railway car hooked onto the end of the Havana Special . Wherever the train stopped , and at whatever hour of the night or early morning , crowds of men and women were at the station to see the private railway car that Tex Rickard was going home in . The day that train ended its 35-hour journey in New York 's Pennsylvania Station , a front-page headline in the New York Times read : COLD NUMBS CITY ; TO CONTINUE TODAY Yet , outside , thousands waited for a look at the casket . All along the route crowds lined both curbs of the 16 blocks to Madison Square Garden . The temperature did not rise above 25 ? that RICKARD 'S FUNERAL brought thousands to line route of cortege from Garden .  | day , but a crowd started to gather outside the Garden early in the afternoon , and by 4 o'clock there were 700 persons in line .

" But they came , the people who had been waiting , and they were of every sort and degree . ... " It was a bizarre sight ? Rickard lying in his bower-covered coffin in that high , bare auditorium under the brilliant arc lights he had used on fight nights , and 15,000 persons slowly filing past in two lines , one on each side of the bier . The next day 10,000 more people attended the funeral rites . Rickard for years had not been much of a churchgoing man , and after considerable discussion it was decided that a Baptist clergyman , an Episcopal clergyman , a Catholic lawyer and a Jewish judge should in turn recommend him to the safekeeping of God . As Columnist Dan Parker observed at the time , " If Tex could have sat up in the bronze coffin that is to be his resting place for eternity , yesterday at the Garden , he would have exclaimed : ' Gosh , I never seed nothing like it ! ' " WHAT DID Tex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers that they should feel a sense of personal loss ? What had brought him so close to them ? The curious fact is that , despite this astonishing tribute and the millions of words that had been written about him , Rickard was one of the least understood of New York 's great army of celebrities in his gaudy era . This was not because of any neglect by the press . Such great reporters as Westbrook Pegler , Damon Runyon , Paul Gallico and Hype Igoe attempted to analyze the enigmatic Texan . Most of them , including the acidulous Pegler , @# agreed on one thing : Rickard was a " square shooter . " Some saw him as open and almost ingenuous . " Rickard in high glee was a picture , " wrote Paul Gallico . " He was capable of the most joyous and inoffensive gloating I ever saw . " Others suspected guile . W. O. McGeehan , who had been observing Tex since he put on his first major fight in Goldfield , Nevada back in 1906 , insisted that the promoter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boxing being the most competitive of professions , it was not strange that two of the best-known managers of the period ? Jimmy Johnston and Jack ( Doc ) Kearns ? should have hated and distrusted the king of promoters . But Jack Hurley , who knew more than both of them , insists that , though Rickard was hard to pin down , " his word was always the only contract one needed with him . " Jack Dempsey agrees . " His eyes were MEN OF DESTINY , Dempsey and Rickard , were a million-dollar team at the gate . his bond , " says Rickard 's greatest star , " and he was so great a showman that he always contributed 50% or more of the draw with his own personality . No matter who they were , the two fighters never contributed much more than the other 50% . " Most of the champions who worked for Rickard share Dempsey 's opinion , though one claims that the promoter was " an evil man who would stop at nothing to get the power he craved . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean up on the betting . " The truth is that no matter how long one searches , some of the secrets of Rickard 's character remain a mystery . And this is maddening in a way , because it is refreshing even now to borrow some of the excitement that was in the part of Tex that never grew up , and also to admire the side of him that was all solid rock and raw courage . Nobody loved crowds more than he did . No man ever worshiped a building as he did the " new " Madison Square Garden which he built as a temple to sport . But often he seemed a lonely figure there . And he needed the fine clothes , the Havana cigar and the elegant cane to give him confidence . Essentially , Tex Rickard was a very shrewd man , but all of his early scheming had been done in a different and more freewheeling society . Out where he came from ? Texas , Alaska , and Nevada ? as Rickard sometimes said , men did n't drink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trim and doublecross you . And out there the things a man did were always more important than anything he said . FROM THE BEGINNING , Tex lived in the midst of violence . It started the instant he was born . The date was Jan. 2 , 1871 , although Rickard always continued 63  | claimed that it was a year earlier . The place was the cabin of his parents , Robert Woods and Lucretia Rickard , in Clay County , Missouri , on the turbulent Kansas-Missouri border . Mrs. Rickard said later she never heard George Lewis ' first cry because of the racket being made on the road outside by a 26-man posse that was chasing Jesse James and his brother Frank into hiding . Their mother , Mrs. Zerelda Samuels , lived on the farm next to the Rickard place , and the James boys had been visiting their family over the New Year 's holiday . The Rickards apparently moved twice in young Tex 's first four years , first to Sherman in northern Texas and then to Cambridge , about 100 miles west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rickard thereafter referred to as his home town . His father , a recurrent invalid , could do little to support his family ( he died when Tex was 10 ) , and at 7 George Lewis was shining cowboys ' boots to help out . Some four years later he quit school , after finishing third grade , to join a trail-riding outfit that was taking thousands of cows to Hunnewell , Kansas . It was a rough , tough job , days on end in the saddle in all conditions of wind and weather . There was n't much future in it , except in young Rickard 's imagination . Often while on the trail the 11-year-old boy would think about getting rich . " The hard side of life , " Rickard wrote years later in his memoirs , " was an old story to me long before I became 21 . I never had a boyhood in the sense that the ordinary boy does today . Circumstances forced me into cutting out my own way at a time when most boys are out flying kites . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they read a dime novel . " Rickard remained a cowboy for about 12 years . Close to half of this time he was a range rider on ranches near Henrietta . His mother got him to quit the business after he was trampled by a herd he was guiding across the Big Wichita River . In 1894 he ran for town marshal of Henrietta , and was elected by a whopping plurality over two opponents . The same spring he married a sweettempered girl , Leona Bittick , who was the daughter of a local physician . Rickard loved being town marshal , arid he often said that that year , 1894 , was the best and happiest one he 'd known as a young man . But all the joy went out of his life the following year when Leona had a baby boy who lived only a week . Not long afterward , Leona also died . Thus , when the news of the first big Alaska gold strike got to Henrietta a short time later , it was all the excuse Rickard needed . He persuaded Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1899 and something of the town humorist , to join forces with him , and departed for Alaska . The two Texans arrived in Alaska late in the fall of 1895 , well ahead of the horde of reckless gamblers who began racing north , side by side with the Klondike gold rushers , two summers later . Before that desperate crew could get into the action , Tex had made and lost his first fortune , had taken over and lost his first couple of . gambling houses ? and had learned the score . Rickard , from the moment he landed , plunged into Alaskan life with zest . He spent most of his time playing poker and faro , making expenses both for himself and Willie Slack . Willie had a hard time adjusting to Alaska , particularly to the climate . Usually Rickard ignored Willie 's complaints , but when news of a big strike at Circle City came , Rickard almost forcibly dragged the reluctant cowboy out on the t .

When they had completed all trips and had dumped in the sn everything they owned , they faced most agonizing challenge of the whole journey : the job of scaling the pass self ? again and again . It was imp ble to drag a sled over those terrible 1,250 feet , which were on a 45% , uphill grade . A man could only get over with what he could manage to carry on his back . Rickard himself considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves into a spiration , " Tex said , " we would n ly freeze when we stopped , to rest . " Over the pass at last , the pair started across the string of frozen lakes which led to the headwaters of the Yukon River . Overwhelmed by the cold and the winds , Slack became so miserable that for whole days he could n't summon enough strength even to speak On reaching the Yukon 's headwaters ? 340 miles from Juneau ? Willie took one long look at the open water and groaned something about not caring to turn boatmaker at his age . Then , abruptly , he held out his thickly gloved hand . " George , " he said , " this is where I say goodby . I may be dumb , but I ai n't no fool . " Without another word , he turned his sled around and headed back toward Juneau . Rickard never saw Will Slack again . That poor cowboy managed to make it all the way back to the Mexican border , only to be shot to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tex was stone broke when he finally stumbled into Circle City , a town of sod-roofed log huts which the miners had built . After the trek over the pass , he was ready for a little indoor life , and he quickly got himself a job in Sam Bonnifield 's gambling shack . Rickard told Bonnifield that he intended to go SPORTS ILLUSTRATED  | out prospecting for gold as soon as he got together a decent-sized stake . Sam Bonnifield , the Yukon gold rush 's most famous gambler , was then 30 , a tall , slim , handsome , quietspoken man . He was originally from West Virginia , but had worked for a few years at his trade in the Kansas cowtowns before going on to the North . Westbrook Pegler , who met him 31 years later in Chicago at the second Dempsey-Tunney fight , described him as a " quiet , almost deferential old man . . . . His eyes were fascinating ... so blue and clear and unfaded . " For better or for worse , Rickard accepted Bonnifield as his model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession , an honest man . To be this sort of gambler requires other qualities besides the gift for sensing ahead of others the ever-changing tides of luck . The gambler must have the oxlike sort of patience to wait for the rumble inside his head that calls the turn . He has to peel off emotion from his thinking , to concentrate as though there were nothing on earth but these cards or dice or spinning roulette wheel , and the men around him . A gift for all that Tex Rickard had . But Tex also had something more ? the conviction that most men were honest . In Circle City that might have seemed a curious idea , but Rickard 's own convictions were bolstered by Sam Bonnifield 's honesty , and by the way another Circle City businessman , Jack McQuesten , ran his trading post there . McQuesten , a huge and hearty man with a large blond mustache , had been trading with Indian fur trappers up and down the Yukon for a quarter century when Tex first met him . He gave credit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before would come to his trading post to explain that though he had enough gold dust to pay off he had not been on a spree for months . Jack always understood that . " Go have your spree , " he would say , " and pay me whatever you have left . " Working in Sam Bonnifield 's Circle City shack , Tex began getting his basic training in high-powered gambling almost immediately . During his first week there he did everything from running the crap table to sweeping up . He also watched the West Virginian deal a card in a faro game on which $10,000 was riding . The card came out , Bonnifield lost $5,000 to Louis ( Goldie ) Golden and he did not even look up . " Tex , " he called over to Rickard at the table , " if Goldie is quitting , pay him off . Five thousand dollars comes to a little over 19 pounds and a half in dust . Oh , hell , give him an even 20 pounds ! " " Who 's quittin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the payoff in yellow hundred-dollar chips . Before he left , at 4 o'clock the next morning , he had lost the $5,000-and $17,000 more . Three nights later Tex saw Bonnifield lose $72,000 in gold dust , and the gambling shack as well , in a poker game . Sam was about to turn over the premises to the winner when a friend came in with a couple of heavy gold pokes which he put at Bonnifield 's disposal . In six hours Bonnifield had his fortune and his shack back and also had cleaned out the customer . If Rickard did not bring Sam Bonnifield good luck , the West Virginian thought he did . Within a month after Tex started to work for him , Bonnifield had enough gold dust on hand to buy the biggest , flashiest-looking place in town . In a typical gambler 's gesture he turned over to Tex his old shack , its crap and roulette tables , chips , cards and stock of liquor . When the astonished Rickard asked why Bonnifield was doing that for him , Sam said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 'll stay an honest one . " And he held out his smooth-assilk hands , adding , " Look at these hands , my young friend . They are my tools . When you first came to work for me you said something about going FROb1 JUNE ; 1 TO NOME . RR'KARIYS NORTHE1 APRIL 22 , 1957 prospecting after a while . I got only one thing to say about that : either be a gold miner or a gambler . You ca n't be both . No man 's hands can do rough work and handle cards or dice as a gambler has to . " For the rest of his life Tex Rickard gambled as though Sam Bonnifield were looking over his shoulder . But he did n't yet know his percentages as well as he thought he did . In less than two weeks he lost the gambling house Bonnifield had given him . Tex shook hands with the customer who had won it and wished him luck . Then he put on his fur parka , walked down the street to Sam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again . Sam put him behind the bar . The old sourdoughs agree that Rickard was a good man behind the bar , but a better man in front of it . " Great talker , " they say . " Sure had the gift of gab , that feller . " What they mean , of course , is that Rickard had a genius for listening . Eddie Borden , Tex Rickard 's office boy in Madison Square Garden , later a New York sportswriter , boxing manager , promoter of fights on two continents and presently the editor and publisher of a new magazine , Weekly Boxing World , is incensed when people call Rickard a great conversationalist . " I hung around him nights for at least five years , hoping to hear him say one word that would IN TRAVELS DOCUMENT NINE RIGGED YEARS 65  | teach me something about the boxing business , " says Eddie . " I figured that sooner or later he would have to give out with a secret . But Tex was a man who never had two sentences to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in January , Arthur Walden , who carried the mail through the valley by dog sled , brought into Harry Ash 's saloon a letter that told of the most exciting event in the Yukon 's history . As he read the letter , Ash 's eyes almost popped . " Big strike on the Klondike ! " he yelled . " They 're getting more than $60 a pan down there ! " With that , he jumped over the bar and told everybody , " Boys , help yourselves to the whole shooting match . I 'm off to the Klondike ! " Harry Ash went straight to Rickard 's cabin , woke him up to tell him the news and asked him to make the trip with him . Two days later Ash and Rickard , with their dog team , led the way to the Klondike . They traveled over the frozen river , followed by the other prospectors with full eleven-dog teams , then by those with successively smaller teams . Some prospectors had only one dog . Last to hit the trail were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a handful of people , Circle City became a deserted town within 48 hours . Each man on that unprecedented trek knew he would be unable to get any more food for seven months , when the river ice would break up and the steamers could get through with fresh provisions . Arthur Walden , the dog driver , pointed out that it was theoretically impossible for a man to haul enough food to live on for seven long months . " How they got through .. . God alone knows , " he wrote of the men who made the trip . " They were the pick of the pick , and that counted . " When Rickard and Harry Ash reached Bonanza Creek , many of the best claims had already been staked by men out of Fortymile . But Tex managed to acquire a piece of two claims , and worked them for long grueling months that winter . The miners had to excavate the ore-bearing rock 20 feet down . To reach it , they first had to thaw the frozen ground . This was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to loosen it to a depth of about two feet . This earth would then be shoveled away , after which the whole process was repeated until the hard shale 20 feet or so below the surface was uncovered . If the diggers were lucky they hit a pay streak . If not , they either started tunneling from there or began burning out another deep hole . On hitting pay dirt , the gold hunters brought the ore-bearing rock to the surface in buckets and dumped it on the frozen earth . It lay there until the spring thaw , when water became available for sluicing out the gold . Tex did n't enjoy this backbreaking work any more than the other prospectors did . When he got his chance to sell out his share in the two claims for $60,000 to Major Neville A. D. Armstrong , a British investor , and another man , he jumped at it . Hearing that Circle City was waking up once more , he went there to have a little fun . When he arrived he ran into one Tom Turner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink together , he told Rickard that Dawson , which he had just left , was booming like nothing he had ever seen before . " Even now you can see it 's gon na be a much bigger place than Circle , " said Turner . " Anyone with money enough to start a real good gambling house and saloon down there will have a gold mine . " " You 've got yourself a partner , Turner , " Tex told him . And they sealed their deal with a handshake and a round of drinks for the house . When they got to Dawson , at the junction of the Klondike and the Yukon rivers , Rickard and Turner found a booming tent town that was already bigger than Circle City . In a few days they had their place up , furnished with gambling equipment and supplied with liquor . Tex named it The Northern . From the day The Northern opened , the partners did tremendous business . After four months they had $155,000 in the till . But one night a gang of prospectors came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Nos. 17 and 23 , and also played the middle column . They could n't seem to do any-66 thing wrong . It was just one of those nights . " If they won , they simply piled on more dust and told us to roll , " Rickard said later . " At the same time others of the gang were taking us good at faro . I 'd put the $57,000 I had left over from my Bonanza-strike money into the place , along with plenty of Turner 's dough . That night we lost the whole joint and every nickel we had in the world . " Rickard spent the next 15 months working as a bartender , faro dealer and front man in various Dawson pleasure palaces . Though he was drawing down $20 a day , he often went to bed hungry . Even in a red-hot boom town like Dawson this is not easy for anyone except a professional gambler to do so frequently . But Rickard stubbornly kept betting every grain of gold dust he was paid ? there was no other currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards kept refusing to be good to him . Rickard left Dawson in the fall of 1898 and headed for Rampart , another just-born gold-boom river town . But the Rampart boom proved to be a fast bust . Along with most of the other gold rushers there , Rickard spent a dismal winter chopping wood in the frostbitten wilderness . In the spring he sold the wood for $15 a cord to the steamers that came through after the river opened up . One day a deckhand told him : " I heard on the river that they struck it rich around Nome . A whole lot of ' em are packin ' and gittin ' out to the mountains around there . " Rickard did n't wait for confirmation . He hurriedly paid his debts in Rampart and got a steamboat ticket to Saint Michael ( he had $35 left ) . On the boat he met Jim White , who had been a nightly customer in Tex 's short-lived gambling saloon in Dawson . White also was going to Nome , though he confessed he was getting discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better luck in a gambling saloon like that one you ran in Dawson . The miners always liked to go there , Tex . They said it was like a club . " Out of that conversation grew a partnership . White , too , had only a few dollars , but he also had a tent . " All we 'd need is wood enough for our floor and the land to set it up on , " White told Rickard . " You 've dealt me in , Jim , " Rickard answered with a grin . Nome was about as disagreeable a place as Rickard had ever imagined . Without a harbor and completely unprotected from the sea , its beach was SPORTS ILLUSTRATED  | battered most of the year by everything from driftwood and ice floes 30 feet high to an occasional tidal wave . Even during the ice-free months of summer torrential rains drenched it almost daily , turning the whole area into a quagmire . Yet it was here that Rickard made his first great parlay of luck and opportunity . His first bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few dozen tents up . If he and White had arrived a few weeks later they would have been unable to get a good lot for their tent . As it was , they were able to buy one for $100 on Front Street , Nome 's pleasure-house and business street , with a few dollars ' option money . Then , the day after getting to Nome , Rickard went down to the beach to see if he could find wood for the tent 's floor . Incredibly , he saw a man unloading planks from a raft . When Tex asked if he could spare enough for the tent floor , the man looked him over , rubbed his chin and said , " Well , I am going to leave this wood here . Suppose you just pick out what you want and use it ? You can pay for what you use or return it later . " Tex thanked him and got Jim White down there in a hurry . In two days they had hammered together a good solid floor . Tex told Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beach again . Might find another friendly feller who has his helping hand out . " That day he saw a boat unloading whisky , wine and brandy . As Tex explained to his partner later , " When I told the feller we had a tent with enough room to store them he seemed mighty grateful . ' If you want to use any of it , ' he said , just keep tab on it , and we can settle next time I come back to Nome . " ' The next man Tex met was George Murphy , a cigar salesman . He was taken in as a partner on the strength of his panatelas and a modest bank roll . Five days later , on July 4 , Rickard staged his grand opening of The Northern in Nome . " We sold whisky at 50 a drink , " said Tex , " and the roulette wheel and the faro bank opened under proper auspices . Miners came in from miles around . That was a gala day in my life and also a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts , at the bar alone , were $935 on opening day . " I was working behind the bar , and one of my first customers that day was an old fellow with long whiskers . He came up to me and said , Fill ' em up , boy ! ' and he waved to the crowd . The old man slapped a small poke on the bar and untied the string . ' Weigh her up , ' he said , ' and let 's have another one . ' The tab for them two rounds came to about $50 . I weighed his poke for him . He had close to five pounds of gold dust in that little poke , which came to nearly $1,200 . When that prospector went out , he said , ' Put the rest of it away for me , boy . ' Now he had never seed me before , remember . That was the way we did business up there in Alaska . " Business kept on being so strong during that week or two that White sold out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we opened . " But that old man , the first to leave his poke with me in my Nome place , he never come back . He went into the mountains , or up some creek . We never heard of him again . Very few prospectors ever left an address . Sometimes they did n't ever leave their names on their pokes . " Rickard took as much pride in the trust the miners placed in him as in his gambling saloon 's success . And The Northern was the only saloon never to be held up in that lawless town . As the cynical Wilson Mizner , in recalling his own years at Nome , remarked : " You must realize that there were many desperate and vicious men in Nome that winter . Yet , in these surroundings , Rickard was a man who could be trusted under all conditions . His back bar was always piled with miners ' pokes . No other place parked so many pokes for miners , but Rickard never was raided while the others were held up right along . Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . In fact , Rickard was Nome 's banker . " It was also Tex Rickard 's luck to have set up his gambling tent only a few days before gold was discovered lying on the Nome beach only a few steps away . According to one account , two men found the gold simultaneously . One of them was John Hummel , a miner who was bathing there , hoping to find in the water a cure for scurvy . The other was a soldier from Saint Michael . He went into The Northern and handed Rickard a torn envelope in which he had dropped the grains of gold dust he had picked up on the beach . " Weigh that for me , will you ? " he asked Tex . In the corner of the envelope Rickard saw a small amount of pure flour gold , which is the finest of all golds . Tex put it on the scales , and it weighed out at 600 . " Where did you get that ? " Tex asked . A RARE PHOTO SHOWS RICKARD 'S FAMOUS SALOON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , down on the beach , " the soldier said . " I was fooling around and saw some of it on the clay bedrock . Just for fun I washed it out . ' Mount to anything ? " In no time at all a dozen men were crowded around him , looking at the pinch of flour gold . Then they all dashed out and headed down to the beach . Within two days Tex had lost his bartenders , his roulette stick men and his faro dealers . The soldier 's news also stripped every other business establishment in Nome of its employees . Before long , 2,000 prospectors were working the beach . The luckiest of them found it easy to pan out between $20 and $100 daily . During the first two delirious months that summer a million dollars in gold was washed out of those sands . After that the beach became the poor man 's El Dorado and last chance . An additional million in gold came out of it in further digging , including $40,000 that was produced on a single claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach stopped being lush , miners resumed chasing each other all over the Seward Peninsula , which is about half the size of New York State , looking for a prospect . And the real wealth proved to lie back there in the gulches of those barren , craggy , tundra-covered hills . The U.S. Assay Office reported that $2,400 , - 000 worth of gold was produced in the Nome area in 1899 , and almost twice that the following year . This rose to above $7 million in 1906 , when efficient machinery replaced the pioneering prospectors ' picks and shovels and rockers . The Nome rush ranks among the most productive of the century . Figures vary , but it has been estimated that during the first two years of the boom there $7,500,000 worth of gold was produced on the peninsula , and $34,247,000 up to 1906 . The Klondike was bigger ? $40 million during the two banner years between 1898 and 1900 , and , over the decade including those years , $118,725,000 ? but Nome , if only because of its extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushes ever . By 1901 Rickard was serving on the Nome City Council and had the biggest gambling house in town . It was in a building 60 by 40 feet that he had put up in May 1900 . This place ? named The Northern , of course ? had one floor and a second-floor false front , @# a piano on a platform , crystal chandeliers and a long mirror resplendent behind the bar . Six bartenders worked there day and night , the favorite drink being the boilermaker ? whiskey with a beer chaser . The place was jammed at all hours by the miners , officials , bankers , gamblers and girls from the nearby dance halls . The games included roulette , blackjack , faro , bridge , solitaire and poker . On the Fourth of July that year , to celebrate the first anniversary of the opening of his Nome gambling tent , Tex threw an open-house turkey dinner at a Nome restaurant . The owner of the restaurant asked him , " How can we tell which men are customers in your place ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man does n't have to be a customer of mine to get this free feed ! " Everything kept breaking well for Rickard during his four lucky years in Nome . He was able to send home money to his mother , Lucretia , who had remarried after the death of her poverty-stricken first husband . She had moved to Seattle , and was bringing up another family by her second husbafid , J. L. Adams . Rickard was fond of telling newspapermen a story about a stud poker game in Nome which ? whether he realized it or not ? showed precisely at what point the ethics of an honest professional gambler stop functioning . " In this game , " Tex said , " another feller opened and I was the only one that stayed . I was n't fixin ' to stay , but this feller was nervous . He kept pullin ' the top card off his hand and shovin ' it under the bottom . I could just catch a look at the corner of each card as he pulled them off the top , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for me to move . " I stalled quite a while . I wanted to read his hand two or three times to make sure I had it right . Finally I was sure my hand could lick him . So I gave the bet a small hoist and he gave it a big boost . I kicked it a little more and he kicked it again . Then I gave it a hell of a kick , right through the ceiling . He called . I never told him how I licked him . " And Tex would conclude with the advice : " Remember , never fumble with your cards in a professional game . Keep ' em together , and if it 's a draw , be sure to keep the backs covered with your fingers . " In 1902 Rickard had a bad run of luck and decided to quit Alaska . Of the half million he had cleared in his four years at Nome , he had only $15,000 left to his name . But George Murphy paid him $50,000 for his interest in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to buy him the Texas ranch he sometimes dreamed of . He thought he might even get married again ? if he could find the right girl . IN LATER YEARS New Yorkers were to say of Rickard that there was no limit to his gullibility . The hardshelled Damon Runyon once remarked , " Tex must believe in miracles or he would n't buy a piece of so many exploding fire extinguishers and the Rube Goldberg-type contraptions . " One story , possibly apocryphal , concerning a trip that Rickard took to South Africa shortly after his arrival back in the United States demonstrates this trait on a grand scale . Rickard stopped off in Seattle to visit his mother . He had not been there a , NI , MpY.  | week before he heard of a young burglar in a Washington prison who was supposed to know the location of a secret diamond mine in South Africa . Rickard , so the story goes , got the authorities to release the convict in his custody and forthwith hauled the fellow off to Africa . In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Rickard seems to have been unperturbed by this . " What the hell ! " he said of his journey , " it was a wonderful trip . " It did gain him the acquaintance of two very entertaining fellow travelers ? Walter Fields and his brother W.C. ? and his friendship with Walter lasted all his life . Back from Africa with part of his $65,000 still intact , Rickard went to San F'rancisco . On the street one day he encountered Mrs. Flora Myers , a former actress whose pretty 18-yearold daughter , Edith Mae , had played the piano in a Nome saloon the previous summer . Mrs. Myers had chaperoned the girl on the trip . Rickard had been quite smitten with Edith Mae in Nome , but he had felt that she was both too young and too refined to be interested in a rough sporting man like him . That evening , when he called at the Myers ' flat , he was surprised by the warmth of Edith Mae 's welcome . Within a week he had proposed to her , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time now had come for Rickard to head for Texas . Edith Mae , friends reported in later years , was enthusiastic about the idea . But just as obviously , Tex Rickard , gambler and gold miner from the Klondike , was not the man for the comparatively sedentary life of a ranch . Instead he turned north to Seattle , where , he had been assured by an acquaintance , a perfect location for a gambling saloon awaited him . This was on First Avenue , ? in the heart of the town 's redlight district . Rickard took over the lease , summoned painters , told them he wanted the place decorated like an Alaskan gambling saloon and called his new spot The Totem . Just before he was ready to open , what present-day newspapers would refer to as a " prominent underworld figure " came to call on Rickard . He congratulated Rickard on the excellence of his taste in gambling equipment . " This is such a nice-looking joint I 'm only gon na ask 20% of your gambling take . " Rickard stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Off the top . " " Get the hell out of here , " said Rickard , " and do n't come back . " The evening before his grand opening two uniformed policemen appeared at the door . They were very polite . They told Tex that their superiors had become concerned about his personal safety , since he was a stranger in town . " Sometimes the going gets pretty rough down here , " one of them said . " One of us will stay at the door , the other will keep an eye on everything going on inside your place . " A THOUGH Rickard 's friend had warned him that something like this might follow his refusal to cut in his visitor for 20% , Rickard argued with the officers . He told them that he would put up any bond required by the authorities . " I 've never owned a place that was n't run orderly , " he said , " and I 'll have plenty of bouncers to help me run this joint . " The policemen were patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run a nice place that he sent us here to help you do just that . The idea is to protect you against the bums and roughnecks . " Rickard stopped talking . He knew he was licked . The next day he sold The Totem for a song to a stranger who said he had just got a mysterious hunch that Rickard might want to get rid of the place . With his wife and a newly adopted blonde baby girl , Bessie , Rickard took the next boat to Nome . On this trip he met E. S. ( Kid ) Highley , who had made a fortune running a gambling house in Skagway . The Kid was looking for another similar proposition in Nome . Rickard suggested he try to buy into The Northern . " Did n't know whether or not George Murphy would care to sell part of the joint , " Rickard said later , " but having my new friend 's cash ready for action , I knew , would n't hurt me none . " Actually , Murphy took in both men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to resume his job as the saloon 's front man . But the weather did n't agree with Edith Mae , and late in 1904 the Rickards left Nome for good . Rickard sold out his piece in The Northern to Frank Hall , who was short of money but promised to pay him off on the installment plan . Hall mailed the last payment to Rickard in 1906 , a few days before a storm leveled The Northern and wrecked practically everything else in the town . Rickard got the news in another Northern , his new gambling saloon in Goldfield , Nevada . For Rickard , Goldfield marked the beginning of a second , and decisive , era of his career ? a period in which he rose from obscurity to achieve a national reputation and become a worldfamous figure in the sport forever after associated with his name : boxing . In Nome he had staged small fights at The Northern or a nearby theater . In Goldfield a new opportunity suddenly appeared . Tex saw a chance to promote a fight between the two greatest lightweights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe Gans . He telegraphed Nelson , offering a purse which , for lightweights , was a real eyeopener , and sat back to wait for a reply . The message that came from Billy Nolan , Battling Nelson 's manager , was a fateful one for Tex Rickard and the sport of boxing . The events leading out from it were to open the way to a fight which literally rocked the nation , to a Golden Age which boxing has never since attained , a period in which Tex Rickard ? cowpuncher , gold miner , gambler and promoter ? was to reach the very pinnacle of greatness in the sporting world . @#
