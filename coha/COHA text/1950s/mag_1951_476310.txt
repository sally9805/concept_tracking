TODAY you drive southward from Aiken , South Carolina , toward the site of the future Savannah River hydrogen-bomb plant , you go a good many miles before you see anything that does n't belong to rural South Carolina . Flat fields , pine groves , an occasional farmhouse ? that 's all . But after a while , as the highway cuts through the pine-lands , you suddenly come upon a succession of trailer camps and garish trailer sales lots on both sides of the road , under the trees : an incongruous sight in this all-but-empty countryside . Then a moment later you reach the sign that announces that you are entering the vast Savannah . River reservation , and there are no more trailers . Nothing but woods and farms again . What you have been seeing briefly is the very beginning of the inevitable chopping up of the countryside around the site of a war plant . It is happening at Paducah , Kentucky , where the Atomic Energy Commission is building another plant . It is happening at Morrisville , Pennsylvania , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Steel Corporation is building a huge integrated works to use its new Venezuelan ores . It is happening at Wallingford , Connecticut , where United Aircraft is now clearing away a pig farm to make way for another factory . It is happening in Chicago , where Ford has taken over the wartime Dodge engine plant and will employ 25,000 workers , and where a proposal to establish a trailer park on the marshy shores of Wolf Lake within the southern limits of the city ? " a new Venice of the Midwest , " the promoters called it ? recently had Mayor Kennelly stumped . Chicago zoning permits trailers in industrial areas . All , this of course has happened before . It happened so dramatically nine years ago in dozens of officially recognized " congested areas " that it may be worth while to look back for a moment to learn what the billions of dollars now allocated to carefully planned defense factories may do to the unplanned areas surrounding them . Take the representative case of Pascagoula , Mississippi . BEFORE World War II Pascagoula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 population . To the east a few miles , across the state line , lay Mobile , Alabama , the metropolis of the region . To the west were Gulfport and Biloxi on the way to New Orleans . Woodivorking had been a flourishing industry until the forests were depleted . Shrimp fishing was a growing business . The two occupations blended happily in a small boat-building industry . The skills in this industry , vigorously touted by the state 's industrial promotion program , attracted the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation . In 1938 a shipyard went up on a site ceded by the town . This and two smaller industries brought a population growth of nearly 2,000 ? an increase of close to 50 per cent . Pascagoula went into World War II a little more than comfortably full . Then came almost $250 million in war contracts and a horde of workers from the pea patches and stripped forests of the hinterland . Before they started going home , Pascagoula had 40,000 people to take care of . Houses were built ? some 4,000 units in all . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents had to walk in water ankle-deep to get in and out of their doors . In another the gas pressure was too low to heat the 900 dwelling units . The sewage disposal plant could n't handle the load , so a new plant was approved by the Federal Works agency . It was designed for a population of 11,000 . By the time it was completed the population was 30,000 . Sewage overflowed in the street in front of one housing project . Oyster reefs in the nearby bays were contaminated . There was a milk shortage . Milk , when it was to be had , came from as far away as Minnesota . During one year of 180 school days , the school cafeterias had milk only eleven times . There were not enough telephones even for emergency calls , not enough street lights , not enough police . Ice gave out in the long hot summers . In February 1944 , water storage capacity was enough to supply two hours ' demand . There was only one doctor to every 5,000 people . Despite the discomforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to a coordination of federal , state , and local agencies provided by the Congested Production Areas Board , and thanks even more to funds provided under the Lanham Act , Pascagoula got new schools , paved streets , new water and sewage systems , and a modern county hospital . Pascagoula 's 1950 population of 11,000 found itself comfortably equipped . Now the bloat threatens to start again . WILLOW RUN was worse . There in the fields of Washtenaw County , near the small college town of Ypsilanti , rose a plant employing at its peak a daily production force of more than 42,000 . Neither management nor government made any plans whatever to accommodate the workers . They were supposed to get to work by car . When gasoline and tires were restricted after Pearl Harbor , the folly of planning only up to the factory fence became apparent . Yet natural forces and free enterprise were expected to take care of the problem . It was little realized that natural forces in any community always discriminate against the new arrivals ? in this case the much-needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole community even in the most favorable of times . Fortunately , the Willow Run nightmare has been made the subject of an intensive sociological study soon to be published as a book. * So the lessons at least of the last great congestion have duly been entered in the record . In that period , the country over , more than 8,000,000 people moved ? only about 5 per cent of the population ? but a devastating mass when piled up in a handful of places . What can we be said to have learned from this great migration ? First , that there are two measures which , taken in time , can reduce the over-all dimensions of the problem very markedly and can lead to great economic savings . Second , that reliance on Federal emergency powers can somehow get communities through the worst of their growing pains . Lastly , that no satisfactory solution of the total problem of community growth is yet in sight . Meanwhile cities are already reporting their housing needs , brought about by defense activity . St. Louis needs 50,000 units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , needs 20,000 more units now . Pascagoula , no longer a war surplus area , needs another 1,000 dwelling units . So do Huntsville , Alabama , and Bethlehem , Pennsylvania . Leesville , Virginia , needs 750 homes and Radford , Virginia , needs 300 . And so on . But housing activity is discouraged by the national production authorities and cities are told to cut down on their borrowing . What , then , are the practical measures for lessening the impact of the defense effort ? THE first of the two measures that can reduce the size of the problem is so simple that it is seldom thought of until circumstances force it . It is to take the jobs to the people rather than to require the people to move to the jobs . One reason why this solution is so seldom grasped is that most people feel there is something inevitable about industrial location that prescribes that a certain plant must be in a certain place . Generally speaking , this is true only of limited sections of industry . Basic producers of steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , must locate with a very careful regard to their supplies and their markets . Each of these industries has a characteristic pattern dictated by its own technologies . But other sections of industry are not so fettered by geography . Within very generous limits they can go where the labor is . The lighter fabricating and assembly industries find that it is often good business to take their plants to the labor . In such industries the capital investment per , job seldom exceeds $5,000 and is usually much lower . A quarter of the investment or less is in land and buildings . But the investment in houses , schools , stores , roads , water supply , and all the other facilities needed to maintain each worker on the job is anywhere from three to five times the total capital investment per job in the industry itself . If an industry fails to utilize this investment where it now is and instead causes it to be created around a new plant , then the industry pays at least in part through higher taxes , absenteeism , overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view of national policy the case for the labor surplus area is even more telling . If labor is moved to a crowded place , new facilities must be provided , and this provision puts an added strain on materials and manpower . If crowding is serious the federal government will be called on to pay a large share of the bill for new facilities . On the other hand , if industry goes to thelabor surplus areas , these areas become less of a burden on government for relief and make-work projects . There is no other way in which government can save the taxpayers so much money and speed up production at the same time . Savings can well run to hundreds of millions of dollars . For the places where industry can find surplus social plant ready to absorb increased employment are many , and many of these are well located with respect to supplies and market . Only two years ago these areas were the objects of the official concern of the Department of Commerce and were designated " emergency areas . cHMBERLAND , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains near the headwaters of the Potomac River . Its site is a classic one in transportation history . It was the terminus of the old Chesapeake and Ohio Canal , now closed . It is on the main line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , which there sends one fork through the Narrows to Pittsburgh and another across West Virginia to Cincinnati . It is on the old National Road ( now Route 40 ) , the first through wagon way to the West . Cumberland has a population of about 40,000 and the towns and small cities in its compact labor area add another 90,000 . The Cumberland area recently led the list of E areas ; 20 per cent of those registered for employment were jobless . There are two reasons for the unemployment . The first , a familiar one , is coal . The mines in the district are nearing the end of economic use . The second reason is less common . Cumberland is suffering from the country 's most spectacular case of technological unemployment . It is the first casualty of progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I the British managers of the company that became the Celanese Corporation of America were looking for a spot in which to make nitrocellulose . They particularly wished to avoid being bombed by Zeppelins . So they chose a secluded valley five miles up river from Cumberland . After the war they began to make rayon yarn . The company grew rapidly through the twenties and thirties , throwing off branch plants to other localities but still expanding its original plant . During World War II , while every effort was concentrated on production , work assignments and equipment became obsolete . A $20 million postwar modernization job created a plant that could turn out as much yarn with 5,000 workers as the old plant had turned out with 11,000 . Cumberland , saved from the depression of the thirties by Celanese expansion , had a 1949 and 1950 depression all of its own . The situation is well known in Washington , and industry has begun to pay attention , but so far Cumberland is simply a hunting ground for industries recruiting labor to go to other areas , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired . There are dozens of Cumberlands . Usually they will be found where natural resources in or on the ground have been mined out . The Maine woods are not the lumber source they once were . Their ports of entry , like the city of Bangor , have the people and the houses to absorb industry without strain . The coal fields of Southern Illinois have had an unemployment running as high as 20,000 in the boom years since the war . The copper , iron . and forest country of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has reported falling population and rising unemployment at the same time . The old lead and zinc area around Joplin , Missouri , has had workers to spare . Even Texas has played-out oil fields and dwindling population . One such area is within eighty miles of Dallas . There is much more man power available in these areas than current unemployment figures suggest . First , many , especially women , do not register for work when there is little chance of getting it . Second , and far more important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up . If there is work there , they want to come back . Recently an inquiry for tool and die workers was put on the grapevine in southern Illinois . Nearly five hundred qualified applications were received , most of them , of course , from men in Chicago , Toledo , Detroit , and Milwaukee , who had left home to find work . They were eager for the chance to come back . And these industrial returnees , as they will doubtless be called when Washington wakes up to the fact that its E area liabilities have overnight become assets , can find places to live much more readily than can migrant strangers . Many a native , especially the industrial worker , would like to return to the scenes and acquaintances of his childhood , and with good reason . III / HERE the job can not be moved to the worker , then perforce the worker must move to the job . As long as gas and tires permit , he will drive as far as forty miles a day to work and forty back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and eighty miles is not by any means unknown . When the labor draw of any location is exhausted , then the migrant appears , by trailer . Thus the second of the two measures that can relieve the housing shortage is that bete noir of the sociologists , the trailer camp . Please , says the Trailer Coach Manufacturers Association , directing a nation-wide housing campaign from headquarters in Chicago 's Opera Building , do not , if you can avoid it , call our products trailers . Refer to them as " mobile homes " or " mobile housing . " When ten or more of them are gathered together , asks TCMA , call it a " court " or a " park , " not a camp . There is more to the plea than a once-humble industry 's urge to euphemism . The modern mobile home is 8 feet wide and from 20 to 30 feet long , has twin beds , a bottle-gas cooking range , a water heater , a stall shower , and sometimes even a garbage Disposall . It can sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be kept warm enough to take you through the winter at Anchorage , Alaska , and with little fuel consumption . It costs from $2,000 to $4,000 . The park that accommodates the mobile homes is no mere pasture . It is a layout of lots , frequently measuring 50 feet by 50 feet and never less than 25 feet by 40 feet , each with water , electricity , and sewage connections laid on . Each group of lots is provided with a utility building containing showers , wash rooms , and laundry . The cost of preparing a park usually runs to about $500 per lot and lots usually rent for around $20 a month . There is no doubt about it , the trailer is as revolutionary a device socially as the automobile that whisks it from place to place . The mobile home has proved to be a solution for many of thc married personnel in the Armed Services , subject to moves from post to post . It is also the solution for construction workers on the big basic industry projects , especially those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to the fabricating industries just now discussed , is a high investment in plant , and quite a small employment once they are completed . Hence the construction crews greatly outnumber the final operating force . At Savannah River , for instance , construction labor is scheduled to reach a peak of 36,000 persons by January 1953 . Hardly any of these people will be required in 1954 , at which time the operating force will have reached its top level of about 5,400 . No need to build permanent homes for 36,000 construction workers and their families , but it is estimated that at least 15,000 trailers will be called for . Paducah is a smaller program , but will reach a peak sooner-12,000 construction workers by October 1951 . Nearly all will be gone by July 1953 , leaving perhaps no more than 1,600 in the permanent operating force . Which presents the field representative of TCMA in the Paducah area with a delicate problem in the encouragement of free enterprise . The TCMA man is on the job to see to it that parks and courts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are encouraged to build them . At Paducah the cost of each trailer court Iot was worked down to $300 , but still local enterprise hung back . At $20 a month , even at $40 a month , there was scarcely time to recoup the investment . get paid for time and effort , and make a dollar or two over that . Even the miracle of mobile housing can not deliver the field of shelter wholly over to free enterprise . There is always the cost of basic utilities to be carried the moment that housing is lifted , no matter how slightly , above the level of a camp . IV HIGH introduces the fundamental problem of any rapid community growth , so far unsolved except by emergency makeshifts ? how do you pay for all the housing , utilities , roads , schools , hospitals , and water systems that a community requires if labor is to be as efficient as you want it to be and if life is to go on as Americans have reason to expect it to go one The military might call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of military terminology would bring out the parallel to the " division slice " ? the proportion of rear echelon to combat personnel . Now the production army not only needs a rear echelon of merchants , professionals , and service workers , but it also carries its families along with it , as do the merchants and professionals . The division slice is inevitably large . The logistics problem overshadows the production problem . Every man or woman on the production line calls for anywhere from three to six people behind the line . By the same token , the investment in their maintenance , as already mentioned , is several times the investment in production plant . This is the investment that is only partially provided for . A house can be financed by monthly payments that the occupant can meet from wages . But the taxes paid by the home owner seldom pay for the services he requires . An estimate recently developed for a Chicago suburb showed that every house would have to cost at least $26,000 if it was to bear its share of the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb cost about half of that . Moreover , houses usually do not get on the assessment rolls until a year after they are built . If the new factory is not in the same taxation district as the housing ? and frequently it is not ? it does not contribute to the needed municipal services . If the merchants serving the expanded community do not have their assessments promptly raised to reflect their new business ? and it is virtually impossible to raise them unless the merchants expand their own physical plant ? then the added retail business does not contribute anything more to municipal services . The community is stuck . To see just how badly stuck a community might be , consider this hypothetical , but far from unusual , case . One thousand new dwelling units are added to a community and are normally financed . But ? there is a charge on the city of a thousand dollars a unit for roads , pavements , and water and sewer connections on the site . One million dollars there . Then the sewage disposal plant must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditto . Suppose that is all , except a new school at half a million , and more teachers , police , and firemen at maybe $150,000 a year . If the city can borrow at 3 per cent and amortize at 5 per cent , it will need $200,000 a year for debt service , plus the new payroll , or $350,000 a year in ail . But the new development is assessed at $10,000,000 ( $10,000 per unit ) and the city tax rate is 2 per cent on 80 per cent of that figure , or $160,000 , less than half of what is needed . Moreover , the city 's debt limit is 10 per cent of assessed value , and it is up to its limit already . So it can borrow only a million more , not the two and a half million it needs but can not service anyhow . This is where the federal government gets a distress call . And here , arguing military necessity and breathing logistics , is just where the federal government may step in , as it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , and pay most or all of the cost of schools , roads , water systems , and other needed facilities . It is an expensive operation . It is usually late in arriving . And it takes care only of the extreme cases . W HAT can be done ? A couple of universities are now undertaking a basic housing study " to develop , " in their own words , " a better understanding for further study of this subject . " Twenty or more universities now have planning schools . Most states and many cities have planning departments . Trained and experienced planners are currently in demand . Several jobs at more than $10,000 a year are going begging , and several dozen in the $5,000 to $10,000 range . But experienced planners are a rare and wary breed . It is hard to get experience when no one will let you operate . The planner is too often reduced to the position of a Major Hoople of officialdom , a character always busywith ingenious schemes , who never gets anything done . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then kept busy investigating and granting exemptions , or variances , as they are called . In one medium-sized city last year 600 variances from the zoning ordinance were granted . The planner 's puny dikes are overwhelmed by a chaotic rush of enterprise . He is further hampered by the multitude of entrenched local authorities ? cities , counties , school districts , park districts , and so on ? that crisscross the natural regions with which he must deal . One of the ambitions of the late Alfred E. Smith was to simplify the county system . He was defeated . Where the great Governor Smith failed , how can a lowly planner succeed ? He can succeed , if he can ever get public opinion behind him . What is needed to clean up the physical shambles of our growing cities is a continuing public interest , community by community , in a series of immediate public problems . The new defense activity makes the problems unusually sharp and urgent . It is a good time to get such interest aroused . And only through such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut through the bramble patch of overlapping and mutually exclusive public authorities and bring to the management of local public affairs some of the coherence that has made private corporate management so successful . Whether area authorities should be created , with powers of taxation and condemnation , whether a city should grow by establishing subsidiaries as a corporation does , whether community mer-. gers can be brought about more readily than is now possible ? all these are the questions that only an aroused public interest can answer In the meantime , the course of reason is to keep crowding at a minimum by directing industries from the overcrowded to the uncrowded regions , and to stop being horrified at mobile housing , provided that it is decently parked and courted.
