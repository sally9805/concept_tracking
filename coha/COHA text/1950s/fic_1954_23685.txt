A Soft Answer AT TILIO was just tall enough to peer ove-K the back of a full-grown goat when the foreigners first came to Voltrano . They wore short trousers , like small boys , and white helmets . They trudged up and down old Mailani 's olive grove , driving stakes in the ground and connecting them with lengths of heavy twine . " They are a harmless people , " Attilio 's father said . The foreigners hired the men of Voltrano to dig up the olive trees and haul them away . Although they had paid old Mailani for the trees , the foreigners neglected to have them cut up for firewood and sold . The women and older boys quickly took advantage of this oversight . They are like children , " Attilio 's father said ; and the people of Voltrano treated the foreigners with great courtesy and kindness , regarding them with something of the ancient awe accorded those touched by lunacy . Vineyards and almond trees were uprooted ; and stone walls , the work of many generations , were destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ropemaker , was bought for three times its value , then leveled and carted away . " We are being paid , ' Attilio 's father said when the people began to mutter against such senseless destruction . The clotheslines of Voltrano reflected the new prosperity . Pink silk underwear and A Story by John D. Weaver Drawings by Jon Nielsen bright cotton blouses floated alongside new work shirts and heavy wool socks and children 's dresses of gaily colored prints . Sheets of the finest white muslin hung above the cobblestones like banners proclaiming a new era of cleanliness and comfort . " It is the mercy of Providence , " . Attilio 's father said , " that the foreign people , with all their vast wealth , are not given the wisdom to hold onto it . " A great one for mimicry , Attilio 's father would imitate the daintiness of the foreigners in eating and their unnatural bathing habits . The foreigners washed themselves head to foot every day , scrubbing all the natural oil from their skin , and the Widow Donatti grew rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat and the village was amused when the animal ate the cotton drawers belonging to the bespectacled foreigner everybody called The Professor . It would have been even more amusing , of course , if The Professor had been in them at the time . The men of Voltrano forgot how to plow and the women , soft and scented with bottled creams and lotions , no longer bothered to gather olives , working all day on their hands and kneeS , their fingers raw and bleeding from the rocks . The men took to drinking northern wine from sealed bottles and the women spent more time brushing their hair , fiddlefaddling with lace and silk and colored beads . The children were fat and frisky , and people were often heard to laugh without reason . The foreigners , for their part , were equally happy with the ruins of the ancient city which had lain for centuries beneath the vineyards and the olive and almond trees . They exclaimed with delight over each new bit of bronze and broken pottery wrenched from the earth . They beamed at fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , and greenish coins . They sorted through huge blocks of stone , reconstructing a flight of steps , a column , the wall of a house , the stones of a narrow street . At the end of each day they seemed pleased . No one knew why . " They are not like real people , " Attilio 's father said . A TTILIO had just started working regularly with the men , drawing his wages every week and beginning to revise his outlook on girls , when the people of Voltrano awakened one morning to find the foreigners had vanished . They had packed hurriedly in the night and caught the late train out of Castehuore , taking all their belongings except the laundry hanging out of reach of the Widow Donatti 's goat . They had left behind an envelope with money for two weeks ' pay for each of the men . " They 'll come back , " the people kept telling one another all day , but intuitively they knew they would never see the foreigners again . That night the women stinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and the men sat in the village square , drinking and talking , as though wine and words might somehow fill the emptiness the foreigners had left . " If they were running away with no thought of coming back , they would n't have left money for us , " Attilio 's father said . Attilio was proud to be sitting in the square with the men that night , while the boys of the village played at soccer with a rubber ball no bigger than an orange . When it came his turn to buy wine , Attilio lit a cigarette and forced himself to walk slowly across the square , slouching , a man accustomed to standing treat . The rubber ball bounced in front of him . His every instinct was to block it with the side of his foot , feint , pick his opening , then send it scooting across the square for a goal , but , with great effort , he managed to ignore the ball . He blew smoke through his nose . Angela Bruscoli drew the wine for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed always on the verge of laughter . In the darkpassageway between the huge casks she stumbled . Attilio was there to catch her . " It 's funny how things work out sometimes , - Attilio thought afterwards , marveling at the happy miracle of Angela 's happening to stumble in the passageway she had walked so often and knew so well . The next morning the village heard about the war . Some said the foreigners were fleeing from it , others said they were hurrying toward it , but whatever the truth of it was , from that day on , life in Voltrano was like being driven from a pleasant and sunny valley , sheltered from cold and hunger , onto a wretched hilltop exposed to bitter winds which whistled through cracked walls , where there were no wool blankets or warm clothing , little to drink and less to eat , and certainly no perfumed creams and lengths of red silk for sashes and bows . " It was a cruel and wicked thing to do , " the men said when they looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreigners had left in place of fruitful vines and trees . The women were even more bitter . If it had not been for the weekly wages , they would never have got used to scents and silk , never miss them now . " They will come back someday , " Attilio 's father kept saying , but the winter rains gave way to the brisk chill of spring and the hot , cloudless days of summer , when the sun cooked the clay gullies dug by the draining hills ; and , when the rains came again , with still no sign of the foreigners , Attilio 's father drew on his savings to relieve the distress around him . 64 T 'S a loan , mind you , " the people said , and insisted on pledging their property as security , although they had no hope of ever being able to redeem it . The money , spent on bread and wool , was soon gone , and Attilio was sure his father 0 would never see it again , nor would he . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man said , and died believing he had done the right thing with his money . Being the kind of man he was he could have done nothing else . " What can we do to help ? " people asked , and Attilio thanked them and sent them away , but they kept coming to the door , each with a different story of some remembered kindness , and it looked as though every flower in the valley had been picked and brought to the house as to a market place . Attilio followed his father up the hill for the last time and stayed for a while after the others had gone . It was cool and quiet beneath the pine trees , and fragrant . A wind blew gently from the sea and the earth was soft to stand upon . Old Mazzoni , the cobbler , came to the house that night with his son , a young man of an age with Attilio . " We will never forget what he did for us , " the old man said and his son nodded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . 0 THER families followed , the Guardellos , the DiNovas , the Lambrettis , and afterwards , stuffed in a bureau drawer , carelessly , with no particular importance attached to them , Attilio found the legal papers his father had exchanged for his life 's ' savings . The papers gave him title to a sprawling infinity of empty shops , cube-shaped stone houses , and fields strewn with gray rocks which looked like sheep grazing . The next evening when he walked out with Angela ( the banns had been posted ) Attilio asked her if they should leave Voltrano , as so many young people were doing . Angela said it was for him to decide , and in the end they stayed . hoping rather than believing that someday the foreigners would return and the village would prosper again . " We will have plenty of work here , " Attilio said when Angela 's two brothers went north to look for factory jobs . It was talking against the wind . The people who stayed in Voltrano were , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the village by an ailing parent or mired in sloth . The houses they lived in and the fields they planted belonged to Attilio , but it was an empty kind of ownership , the meaningless holding of legal documents . " What are papers ? " Attilio said in a voice like his father 's . " Only something for lawyers to pick over for a fee . " From time to time old friends of his father would turn up at the door with wine or fruit , a turkey , a brace of quail , whatever came to hand as a token of rent which was neither paid nor expected . After a while everybody , even Attilio , forgot that a debt was involved in these occasional tributes of food and drink . It was done out of friendliness , and people went on living in the houses their families had occupied for generations with no thought as to who held the title papers . Attilio , Iike his father , had a natural bent for mimicry , and on winter nights when it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the fountain in the square , Attilio would stand in front of a neighbor 's fire , a glass of wine in his hand , and bring to life some small moment from the past , taking off all the characters involved . The people would exclaim , " Yes , that was just the way he talked , just so , with his eyes squinted shut , like a turkey hen 's . " Children who had never seen the foreigners would always beg for The Professor , and Attilio would start nervously fingering his left ear lobe , then mince about the room with short , slew-footed steps , stumbling over furniture , lifting an imaginary hat in apology . Another favorite was the Widow Donatti , long since dead . Attilio would recreate the Widow 's pride of ownership in her goat , a notoriously untidy creature which the Widow used to lead down the Corso on a leash , as though it were a foreign poodle . Her nostrils had been miraculously deadened to its odor . " Yes , yes , poor soul , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing she ever really owned . " A s - rut : years passed , Angela and Attilio , like all parents , dated everything by the children , the winter Carla was born , the time Peppino fell in the river . Certain holidays were remembered , a Christmas for its unusual dusting of snow , a particularly lush green Easter , and there were peak moments of memory , like the night the truck tumbled into the ditch north of town and spilled canned pork liver all over the road . Sometimes at night , stumbling over the cold floors by candlelight , Angela would think of her sister 's house in Castelmore , with its carpets and electric lights , and afterwards , lying awake in the darkness , she would wonder what her life with Attilio might have been if they had gone north like the others or perhaps to America . " In another place there would be other troubles , " she would tell herself , and with a shrug she would pad quietly around the house , seeing if any of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thirst or apprehension . Another war broke out and caught up the two oldest boys , Peppino and Rocco . They were gone for five winters , bleak winters in which Angela grubbed for food like a wild animal , living on nuts and fruit , boiled roots , an occasional rabbit . When the boys came home , she had only to look in their eyes to know they would never stay in Voltrano . " I ca n't blame them , " she thought , and , after kneeling for a while in the darkest corner of the church , she went home to roast a chicken so they would n't leave home hungry , Then suddenly one afternoon , completely without warning , three men came roaring into Voltrano in a government car , trailing a great cloud of dust and chickens and children . The government men marched down the Cm-so , brusquely hiring young and old , who were put to work tidying the ruins of the ancient city , where birds had long been nesting on the marble columns and small animals lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain . Honeysuckle was ripped from the brick walls . The narrow stone streets , grooved by chariot wheels , were weeded , and the mosaic floors cleaned and polished . " Who is moving in ? " . the people asked , tongue in cheek , and the government men left without answering . It was the first time anyone from the government had ever come to give money instead of take it , so naturally the wages received were spent in the proper spirit . " Big things are in the wind , " Attilio said when he staggered home that night . Angela helped him into the house . " Do n't ever forget that I 'm the man who owns this town , " he said , walking into a wall . Attilio hardly had time to sober up when , abruptly , the foreigners came back . They came by special bus from Castelmore and , of course , they were not the same foreigners whohad dug up old Mailani 's olive grove . These foreigners , too soft for digging , came only to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras in leather cases and the women walked the narrow streets with a look of pain and weariness , as though travel were some cruel punishment meted out to their middle-aged feet . " They seem friendly , " the people of Voltrano said , and set to work making things out of leather and linen and wool , selling them at prices which , a few months earlier , would have seemed beyond belief , and in summer , when the tourists came flooding into town like herring , the prices went still higher . Tony Lambretti , the butcher 's son , who had always been clever about fashioning things out of clay , began to make small figures and oil lamps like the ones in the government museum in Castelmore . They were sold furtively in remote corners of the ancient city , because by law all unearthed treasures of the past belonged to the state . It was astonishing how much the tourists would pay for something they thought had been stolen from the government . " There 's a streak of dishonesty in them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the prices they were getting for scarves and billfolds The clotheslines of the village again reflected the new prosperity , and thick soups were served in houses where meals had long been stretched to the thinness of the leather Mazzoni used for the soles of shoes . Children appeared in wool sweaters , and the same women who only a few weeks ago would have welcomed a scrap of clean cotton cloth now complained of the quality of silk in the Corso shops . Men who had walked all their lives , with no thought of ever riding anything more powerful than a burro , began to shop around for a serviceable secondhand motorcycle . T HE Mazzoni family was typical . A cob- bler , Mazzoni had scraped along for years on minor shoe and harness repairs for which he had been paid in food or , most often , promises . Now he employed two helpers , turning out leather sandals for the tourists . His three sons were working on the new excavations south of the ancient city and his oldest daughter was selling postcards and souvenirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home for one of the new tourist shops . " One manages to get by somehow , " Mazzoni would say if asked how things were going , and then he would complain about the price of bread , " A national scandal . " As his prosperity increased , Mazzoni , like his neighbors , began to worry more and more about Audio , who held title to Mazzoni 's shop , simply because Mazzoni 's father had once borrowed a little money from Attilio 's father , if that were really the case . Mazzoni hinted that his father 's mind had failed toward the end of his life and , in all likelihood , Attilio 's father had taken cruel advantage of the old man 's feebleness . His claims would never stand up in court , " people said , but no one wanted to risk his property in a legal test . Meanwhile , they stayed clear of Attilio who was preoccupied with other matters anyway . His father 's town property had been leased for the new cinema , the tourist shops , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge monthly income for Attilio ; and he had also sold two hectares of otherwise worthless land for a new hotel . Fear and envy of Attilio led to malice and slander . " The airs he puts on , " people said if Attilio bought a new suit , and if he did n't , they said he was too stingy to spend hismoney . Behind his back they laughed at him for walking when he could well afford to ride , and when he finally bought a car , they shook their heads and said , " You see , always showing off . " Children took to drawing obscene pictures of him on the walls of the village , as though he were running for public office . " Please , you 've got to do something , " Angela kept insisting , and Attilio would mumble a vague promise , then hurry off . He was always bustling from one place to another these days with a bouncing walk , as though treading on sponges . Outside of the title papers , which Attilio kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the grandchildren , and these worries were small and often groundless , colds and trifling cuts , croup , chickenpox , the usual thing . Rocco and Peppino had come home the first winter , bringing their blonde northern wives and three more grandchildren . The two wives complained about the dullness of Voltrano . They slept all morning , read film magazines , and played the radio . Angela took care of the children . " Why do n't you hire a girl ? " Audio would plead when he found her bent over a washtub . He tried to make her understand they had money now , but Angela insisted she was in the habit of doing for herself . The way he makes the poor woman work , " the people said , and when Attilio bought her a washing machine , they said , " Ah , he thinks he is an American . " A Tram begged Angela to take a bus to Castelmore and buy things for herself . He would drop a fistful of bills in her lap , then bounce out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bottomless pockets or in Carla 's waiting apron . Carla was married now , the mother of twin girls . Enrico was courting . " There must be something you want for yourself , " Attilio would complain when Carla turned up wearing the silver bracelet he had bought for Angela or the new winter coat . Angela said she was thankful the family was all together again , and in good health . She could n't think of a thing she really needed or wanted . " Except those papers , " she said . " I wish you would burn them or give them back , any-thing , just so long as you get rid of them . " Attilio said he would get around to the papers any day now . At the moment he was too busy with the building of a new house . It was laid out on a shelf in the hills , looking across the green valley floor toward the sea . Angela , preoccupied with the grandchildren , took little interest in the house , but every Sunday , to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what progress had been made . " You will never be cold again , " Attilio would say , patting a radiator , or , waving an arm around the huge kitchen . " Whatever you want to eat , all you will have to do is ask for it , and it will be brought to you , like in a hotel . " Angela would smile dutifully , but more than likely her mind would be on Rocco 's youngest , who was teething , or Carla 's twins , who were susceptible to spring colds . When she thought about the house at all , it was only to wonder what it was costing and to think how much good the money could have done in the old days . " So now he is building himself a palace , " the people said when they saw Attilio 's house looming above them on the hill . It was impossible to walk anywhere in or around Voltrano without seeing the place and it reminded everybody of the legal papers which , by piracy and cunning , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful visions of extortion and eviction , and although no one ever faced the thought squarely , each of them was tormented by the subconscious fear of what he might do to Attilio if the situation were reversed . F INALLY , when it was no longer bearable to live beneath the weight of such suspense , a delegation headed by Mazzoni , the cobbler , called on Attilio in his big new house . He seemed to be expecting them . " I 'll have some wine sent in , " he said , and while they were waiting , he insisted on showing them through the house . They had heard stories of the luxury of the place , but even so they were not prepared for the bright paper on the walls , the thick wool carpets , the profusion of brass and copper ornaments , the walnut tables , the tile bathrooms , and the white kitchen with a push-button stove . It was like something in an American film . " Most- of the furniture has n't come yet , " Attilio said when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee table where three kinds of expensive northern wine had been set out with crystal glasses . The delegation was grateful for the wine . Their throats were dry . 4 , G ow then , " Attilio said , when glasses had been clinked and the first draught of wine had dampened their parched throats , " what can I do for you ? " Mazzoni warmed his wineglass in the palm of his hand . " I ca n't help thinking of the old days , " he said , and with a dry laugh asked Attilio if he remembered the Christmas Angela was sick and Mrs. Mazzoni brought her a bowl of turkey soup . Attilio said he remembered . " What little I 've ever had , " Mazzoni said , " I 've always shared with my friends . " " Your generosity is well known , " Attilio said , with a straight face . DiNova , the cabinet-maker , took his cue from Mazzoni . ' ' Your family and my family , " he said , putting his hands together , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed anything , my father was always there to help him . " " It 's true , " Attilio said , and , with a disturbing smile , added , " My father was just as eager to help yours . " Mazzoni interrupted , annoyed by DiNova 's fumble . " We have gone through hard times together and now at last we are getting our heads above water , sonic of us more than others , of course , but we live among friends . We are not like the people in the great cities lip north who would as soon cut a neighbor 's throat as not . " Attilio smiled across the table . " You have certainly taken your time coming here , my friends . " " We were waiting for you to come to us , " Mazzoni said . " But why ? The debt is yours , not mine . " The word " debt " fell like a heavy stone into the lake of silence which had drowned the room . Attilio began to peel silver foil from a cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirmed in a chair too small for him . He rubbed his thick , black-haired hands on his trouser legs . " If we went to court , you would end up with nothing . " Attilio nipped off the end of his cigar , still calm , still smiling . " Do you want to go to court ? " Mazzoni took over quickly with a shrug and a laugh . " Old friends do not go to court . " " I base the rents of my Corso shops on a percentage of the net income , " Attilio said , dropping a still heavier stone into the sickly silence . Mazzoni glanced helplessly at the others , . none of whom was carrying his share of the burden . As usual , he was expected to handle everything . " As for myself , there is no profit in leather . Everybody knows that . " " Taxes eat up what little I make , " Lambretti said , and the other faces were equally long and pitiful to see . The DiNova family , it seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to what fish the boys could take from the river and a few berries in season . " But we want to do what 's fair , " they all agreed , and Attilio asked them what they thought would be fair . Mazzoni edged away from the others with a gesture of disgust and disavowal . " Unfortunately I am not as well fixed financially as the rest . " DiNova glowered at the cobbler . " Any man who has to buy shoes for four children has very little left these days , " he said , and Lambretti , nettled by what he considered an extortionate bill for a few new cabinets , suggested that DiNova was in no position to argue about the price of anything . Attilio walked with them to the door , shook hands all around , and told them he would be delighted to have them come back whenever they had something definite to discuss . " He means to rob us , that 's clear enough , " the men muttered among themselves that night , and rather than Iet Attilio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new rugs and to dress the children more simply , as befitted their humble station in life . Mazzoni was up half the night working on his hooks . He kept one set for himself and another for the tax man , and now , because of Attilio 's greed , he had to keep still a third set . Mazzoni rubbed his strained eyes , grumbling , " It only goes to show the impossible conditions a businessman has to operate under . " Next morning , when he walked down the Corso , Attilio was struck by the change which had come over the village during the night . The men were dressed in patched workclothes and the women were bare of ornamentation , even earrings . The children were in rags , their feet bare . " Ah , times are hard , " Mrs. Tremonte said , and , as he walked on , Attilio noticed that all the bicycles and motorcycles had vanished from the village . He stopped Paolo Albanesi whose red motorcycle had become a familiar threat to sleep at night and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said , shaking his head sadly . " Who can afford such things ? " " Money comes to town , " Guardello said , glancing out over his silver-gray olive trees , " but it does n't know the way to my house . " Attilio walked slowly back up the hill , dropping wearily in his new black leather chair . He asked Angela to bring him the rosewood box . He shuffled the papers absently , remembering the cruel winter when the documents had been pressed on his father with loud cries of gratitude and affection . " Give them back , " Angela said . " We have plenty for ourselves . " " You know what they would say . " Attilio mimicked the voice of Mazzoni , conveying all the guile and greed . " ' This proves what I have contended all along , my friends . Attilio stole the papers and now , out of a great sense of guilt and shame , he gives them back . ' " Attilio patted the papers neatly together , like a deck of cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , as Angela said , they had no need of the money now , but it was also true that certain things had been said about him and , worse , about his father , things a man is not quick to forget or forgive . Although he had no wish to make a weapon of vengeance out of something which represented an act of kindness , still he had a human desire to get some satisfaction from the power the papers gave him . " Some good should come from them , " he thought , and began to see a way out of his dilemma . T HAT afternoon , when the shutters were being rolled up on the shops along the Corso , Attilio walked back into town , carrying the rosewood box under his arm . Mazzoni saw him coming in time to conceal his new radio beneath a burlap sack . " Perhaps you would like to see my books , " he said , reaching under the counter . Attilio stopped him with a friendly flourish of his free hand . " They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Attilio accepted a glass of wine for which Mazzoni was quick to apologize . " A man of my means is forced to drink such swill . " Attilio praised the wine , then settling back in a chair , staring thoughtfully into his glass , lie said he was surprised that Mazzoni , with his keen head for business , had never invested his money . Mazzoni waited warily , trembling with the hope Attilio might be about to take him into some profitable new venture , perhaps to ease his conscience . " Now take olives , " Attilio said , and Mazzoni said there must be good money in olives , considering the outrageous price of oil . TTILIO wondered why Mazzoni did n't . A put some of his savings into an olive grove . He specifically mentioned the one across from the new hotel . " But it belongs to Guardello , " Mazzoni said , and Attilio opened the rosewood box and took out a legal paper . He set a price on the olive grove which was less than half what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount his father had lent Mazzoni 's father . " I think I might be able to raise the necessary capital , " Mazzoni said , trying to control the shakiness of his voice . He scurried into the back room , and later , when the deal had been concluded , he coughed and said , " Now about the title to my little place here , not that it is worth much , you understand , but . ... " " Do n't worry about it , " Attilio said , and left the shop with Mazzoni 's money in his pocket and one less document in the rosewood box . At the Guardello house , after another neighborly glass of wine , Attilio got down to business . " There is money to be made in leather these days , " he said , and Guardello said he was glad to hear it , because there was certainly no money in olives . Guardello , it developed , was short of capital , but once Attilio had mentioned his asking price on Mazzoni 's shop , Guardello excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could raise the money . " I 've always wanted to invest in DiNova , the cabinet-maker , invested in Albanesi 's orange groves , and Albanesi took title to the DiNova shop just off the Corso. w GG AS there any trouble ? " Angela asked when Attilio came home that eve- ning , whistling and walking from side to side . " Why should there be trouble between old friends ? " Attilio said , and opened the rosewood box to show its emptiness . His pockets were filled with hoarded bills which came to the same total as the savings his father had spread over Voltrano years ago . There was no interest involved , other than anticipation . After dinner that night Mazzoni sipped a small glass of French cognac , lit a cigar , and headed down the Corso toward the Guardello place . " We might as well come to terms now , " he said to himself , working out his rightful share of Guar &llo's; olive crop , then doubling it . Guardello , at the same time , was heading toward Mazzoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old swindler , " he said to himself , assessing what he took to be a reasonable rental on the property . They met in front of Lambretti 's b u tch er shop . Lambretti had just thrown a five-pound pork roast at Tremonte who had retrieved it from the gutter and was about to throw it back . Both Mazzoni and Guardello stepped aside to clear the target . Lambretti 's front window broke with a satisfying clatter . " Bandit ! " Tremonte shouted , and Lambretti began screaming for the police . " I was just on my way over to your place , " Mazzoni said , and Guardello , sniffing the French cognac , mentally raised the rent by 10 per cent . Mazzoni suggested they sit down at one of Mario 's new sidewalk tables and have a drink . They exchanged pleasantries , and passers-by , seeing them together , wondered which of them would pay the tab . When thedrinks were brought , they clinked glasses and saluted each other . DiNova , the cabinet-maker , suddenly came storming down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him march up the church steps to the wall where the banns had been posted for the marriage of DiNova 's daughter to Paolo Albanesi . DiNova ripped the white card from the wall and tore it to shreds . " Such a temper , " Mazzoni said , and Guardello said it was a pity . " A man should have more control over himself . " Then , with a slight cough , Guardello leaned across the table and said , " You will find me an easy man to do business with . " The police arrived in time to save most of Mario 's new sidewalk tables . Above the village , on a hillside lighted only by a careless scattering of stars and scented by a breeze drifting across plowed earth from the sea , Attilio stood with his arm around Angela , hoping his father might now be resting a little more comfortably beneath the green umbrella pines . " Look how far we 've come , " Angela said , and turned back toward the house where she had her family all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , so many of the things which had hurt her in the past could never hurt her again . Attilio looked across the ruins of the dead city built by dead conquerors to the lights of Voltrano , where his life was rooted , where he had been reared by his father to believe that whatever happened to the people around him , for good or evil , could never he a matter of indifference . By tomorrow night , after he had arranged for the title papers to be traded , so that each man ended up with his own property , the old debt would be canceled and there should be a little more of his father 's wisdom in the village , perhaps even a little more of his kindliness , and certainly a great deal more of his peace of mind .
