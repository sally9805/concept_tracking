Joseph Oliver Bowers , native of Dominica , B.W.I. , went to St. Augustine 's Seminary at Bay St. Louis , Miss , in 1928 because it was then the only Roman Catholic seminary in the U.S. that would accept Negroes . He studied for eleven years , there and in Wisconsin and Rome , then went to Accra on the Gold Coast as a missionary , where he learned three Gold Coast dialects to add to his fluent French and Latin and his working knowledge of Italian and German . With a year and a half off to become a licentiate in canon law , he stayed on in Africa for twelve years . <P> Last week Father Bowers , 43 , was back in Bay St. Louis . At the Church of Our <P> Lady of the Gulf , New York 's Cardinal Spellman consecrated him a bishop , in the first Roman Catholic consecration of a Negro ever to take place in the U.S. Whites and Negroes sat together during the ceremony and mingled in the yard outside . <P> Bishop Bowers will return this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the number of Catholics has risen in the last 14 years from 12,333 to 33,800 . But before he goes back to Africa he will visit Bay St. Louis again , to ordain two Negro priests . That will be another first for St. Augustine 's Seminary : the first time in the church 's U.S. history that Negro seminarians have ever been ordained by a Negro bishop .
