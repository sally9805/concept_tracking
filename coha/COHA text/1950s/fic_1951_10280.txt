" What the hell 're you doin ? " he bawled indignantly . " Why ai nt you out with the Compny ? Whats your name ? " The bellow had not made Prew jump and now he turned his bent head slowly above the cue . " Prewitt . Transfer from A Compny , " he said . " You know me , Warden . " The big man was silent , his sudden disconcerting indignation as suddenly and as disconcertingly gone , and ran his fingers through his wildly rumpled hair . " Oh , " he said , grinning slyly , then dropping the grin as suddenly as it had come . " To see The Man . " " Thats whats the matter , " Prew said , shooting another ball . " I remember you , " Warden said darkly . " Little boy bugle .... I 'll call you . " Before Prew could answer he was gone . Prew went on shooting pool , thinking how typical it was of Warden not to order him to stop , any other topkick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went on shooting , methodically , first one ball and then another , missing only once . The table clean . he racked the balls and hung up his cue , feeling how the thing had gone flat now . He stood looking at the table for a minute and then switched off the light and went out to the porch . They were still going strong in the Orderly Room . Maggio was still concentratedly peeling spuds . From the kitchen came the moist sounds of someone banging pots and pans around . The irregular clacking of the typewriter in the supply room had ceased . He seemed suspended in a void of bodyless activity , while G Company 's morning moved on ponderously and implacably all around him , indifferent to this transfer that was so monumental in his life , and of which he was not a part . He was , it seemed like , standing on a high place where all the highways met and there were signposts to all places , and where the variegated colors of the license plates whizzed by and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick him up . The cook , in whites , came out , his face still red . He went into the kitchen slamming the door after first telling Maggio to get the goddamhell out of the road with his goddam can of spuds and things began to move again for Prew . " What 'd I tell you ? " Maggio leered at him . He grinned and flipped his cigaret and exhaled , watching the smoke float into the sun where it suddenly became full-bodied , visible in all its unending swirls . That was G Company , he thought , deceptivelysimple yet in the light full of hidden complex designs , unendingmeanings , in which he was entangled now . Before the cigaret hit the ground Warden bellowed , " All right , Prewitt ! " out the window at him . With a grudging admiration Prew felt he had been subtly scored on . How could Warden know that he had left the dayroom ? There was an uncanny sardonic insight in The Warden that approached the supernatural . Prew slung his hat up on his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could steal it while he was inside , and entered . " Private Prewitt reporting to the Compny Commander as ordered , Sir , " he mouthed the formula , whatever humanness there was inside him falling out , leaving only a juiceless meatless shell . Capt Dynamite Holmes , who was a favorite with the Islands sport fans , directed his long , high-foreheaded face with its high cheekbones and eagle 's nose and the hair combed sideways across the just beginingbald spot , sternly at the man before him and picked up the Special Orders that announced the transfer without looking at them . " At ease , " he said . His desk was right before the door , and at right angles on the left was the First Sergeant 's desk , where Milt Warden sat with folded elbows leaning on it . As he moved his left foot and crossed his hands behind his back , Prew spared him one swift glance . Warden stared back at him , half-gleefully , half-foreboding ; he seemed to be poised and waiting for his chance . Capt Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window for a moment , offering Prew a profile of the jutting jaw , grim mouth , and sharp commanding nose . Then suddenly he swung back around , the swivel creaking , and began to speak . " I always make it a policy to talk to my new men , Prewitt , " he said sternly . " I do nt know what you 've been used to in the Bugle Corps , but in my outfit we run it by the book . Any man who fucksup gets broken  --  quick and hard . The Stockade is the place for fuckups until they learn to soldier . " He paused and stared at Prewitt sternly , and crossed his booted legs whose spurs jangled punctuation to the warning . Capt Holmes was warming to his subject . Here , said the long boned , eagle 's face to Prew , is a soldier who is not afraid to talk to his men in their own language , who does not mince the words , and who understands his men . " I have , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not allow anything to bitch it up . But  --  if a man does his work , and keeps his nose clean , does as I say , he 'll get along . Plenty of room for advancementhere , because in this organization there is no favoritism. 40 41I make it my business to see that each man gets just what he earns .. No more , no less . " You start with a clean slate , Prewitt . What you do with it is up to you . " Understood ? " " Yes , Sir , " Prew said . " Good , " said Capt Holmes , and nodded sternly . Milt Warden , at his own desk , was watching the progress of this conference that was not new to him with acumen . Crap ! cried the king , he thought , and twenty thousand royal subjects squatted and strained , for in those days the king 's word was law ! His face straight , he grinned at Prew with his eyebrows , and a devilish pixy peered out from behind his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Company , " Capt Holmes was saying sternly , " a man has got to know his stuff . He has to soldier . He has to show me he 's got it on the ball . " He looked up sharply . " Understood ? " " Yes , Sir , " Prew said . " Good , " said Capt Holmes . " Understood . Its always important for an officer and his men to understand each other . " Then he pushed his chair back and smiled at Prewitt , handsomely . " Glad to have you aboard , Prewitt , " he smiled , " as our colleagues in the navy say . I can always use a good man in my outfit and I 'm glad to have you . " " Thank you , Sir , " Prew said . " How would you like to be my Company bugler , temporarily ? " Holmes paused to light himself a cigaret . " I saw your fight with Connors of the 8th Field in the Bowl last year , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck you should have won it . I thought for a while in there , in the second round , you were going to knock him out . " " Thank you , Sir , " Prew said . Capt Holmes was talking almost joyouslynow . Here it comes , Prew told himself ; well , bud , you asked for it , now figure it out . Figure it out yourself , he thought . Better yet , just let him figure it out . " If I 'd known you were in the Regiment last December when the season started I 'd have looked you up , " Holmes smiled . Prew said nothing . On his left he could feel , not hear , The Warden snorting softly with disgust as he began to study a sheaf of papers with the elaborate I'm-not-with-him air of a sober man whose friend is drunk . " I can use a good bugler , Prewitt , " Holmes smiled . " My regularCompany bugler has nt the experience . And his apprentice only has his job because he 's such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . " He laughed and looked at Prew , inviting him to join it . Milt Warden , who was the one who had suggested Salvatore Clark for the apprentice bugler , after Clark almost shot himself on guard , went on studying his papers , but his eyebrows quivered . " A Pfc rating goes with the job , " Holmes said to Prew . " I 'll have Sergeant Warden post the order , first thing tomorrow . " He waited then , but Prew said nothing , watching the dry ironic sunlight coming through the open window , wondering how long now it would take him to catch on , unable to believe that they had not heard it all before , and feeling how his uniform that had been fresh at eight o'clock was damp and musty now with sweat , beginning to be soaked . " I realize , " Holmes smiled indulgently , " a Pfc isnt very much , but our TO quota of noncoms is all filled up . We have two noncoms who are shorttimers though , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Its too bad the season 's almost over or you could start training this afternoon , but the schedule ends the last of February . But then , " he smiled , " if you do nt fight Regimental this year , you 'll be eligible for Company Smokers in the fall . " Have you seen any of our boys in the Bowl this year ? " he asked . " We 've got some good ones , I 'm confident we 'll keep the trophy . I 'd like to get your opinion on a couple of them . " " I havent been to any of the fights this year , Sir , " Prew said . " What ? " Holmes said , not believing it . " You havent ? " He stared at Prew a moment curiously , then looked at Warden knowingly . He picked up a freshly sharpened pencil from his desk and studied it . " Why is it , " Capt Holmes said softly , " that you 've been in the Regimenta whole year , Prewitt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you would have come around to see me , since I am the boxing coach and since we 're the Division champions . " Prew moved his weight from one foot to the other and took one deep breath . " I was afraid you 'd want me to go out for the squad , Sir , " he said . There it is , he thought , its out now , you 've got it now . Now he can carry the ball . He felt relieved . " Of course , " Holmes said . " Why not ? We can use a man as good as you are . Especially since you 're a welterweight . We 're poor iii that division . If we lose the championship this year , it will be because we lost the welterweight division . " 4342 " Because I left the 27th because I had quit fighting , Sir , " Prew said . Again Holmes looked at Warden knowingly , this time apologetically , as if now he could believe it since he 'd heard it from the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " What for ? " " Maybe you heard about what happened with Dixie Wells , Sir , " Prew said , hearing Warden lay his papers down , feeling Warden grinning . Holmes stared at him innocently , eyes wide with it . " Why , no , " he said . " What was that ? " Prew went through the story for him , for both of them , standing there with his feet one foot apart and his hands clasped behind his back , and feeling all the time he spoke it was superfluous , that both of them already knew all about the deal already , yet forced to play the role that Holmes had set for him . " Thats too bad , " Holmes said , when he had finished . " I can understand why you might feel that way . But those things happen , in this game . A man has got to accept that possibility when he fights . " " Thats one reason why I decided I would quit , Sir , " Prew said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less warmly now , " look at it this way . What if all fighters felt like that ? " " They do nt , Sir , " Prew said . " I know , " Holmes said , much less warmly still . " What would you have us do ? Disband our fighting program because one man got hurt ? " " No , Sir , " Prew said . " I did nt say ... " " You might as well , " Holmes said , " say stop war because one man got killed . Our fighting season is the best morale builder that we have off here away from home . " " I do nt want it disbanded , Sir , " Prew said , and then felt the absurdityto which he had been forced . " But I do nt see , " he went on doggedly , " why any man should fight unless he wanted to . " Holmes studied him with eyes that had grown curiously flat , and were growing flatter . " And that was why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because they tried to make me go on fighting . " " I see . " Capt Holmes seemed all at once to have lost interest in this interview . He looked down at his watch , remembering suddenly he had a riding elate with Major Thompson 's wife at 12:30 . He stood up and picked up his hat from the IN file on his desk . It was a fine hat , a soft expensive unblocked Stetson , with its brim bent up fore and aft , its four dents creased to a sharp point at the peak , and it bore the wide chinstrap of the Cavalry , instead of the44thin strap authorized for the Infantry that went behind the head . Beside it lay his riding crop he always carried . He picked that up , too . He had not always been an Infantryman . " Well , " he said , with very little interest , " theres nothing in the ARs that says a man must be a boxer if he does nt want to . You 'll find that we wont put any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27th . I do nt believe in that sort of thing . If you do nt want to fight we do nt want you on our squad . " He walked to the door and then turned back sharply . " Why did you leave the Bugle Corps ? " " It was a personal matter , Sir , " Prew said , taking refuge in the taboo that says a man 's , even a private 's , personal matters are his own affair . " But you were transferred at the Chief Bugler 's request , " Holmes told him . " What kind of trouble was it you were in , over there ? " " No , Sir , " Prew said . " No trouble . It was a personal matter , " he repeated . " Oh , " Holmes said , " I see . " That it might be a personal matter he had not considered and he looked uneasily at Warden , not sure of how to approach this angle , but Warden , who had been following everything with interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat , but Warden did not get it . " Have you anything you wish to add , Sergeant ? " he had to ask him , finally . " Who ? me ? Why , yes , Sir , " exploded Warden with that suddenviolence . He was , quite suddenly , in a state of indignation . His browshooked upward , two harriers ready to pounce upon the rabbit . " What kind of rating you have in the Bugle Corps , Prewitt ? " " First and Fourth , " Prew said , looking at him steadily . Warden looked at Holmes and raised his eyebrows eloquently . " You mean , " he said , astounded , " you took a bust from FirstFourthto transfer to a rifle company as a buckass private , just because you like to hike ? " " I did nt have no trouble , " Prew said stolidly , " if thats what you mean . " " Or , " Warden grinned , " was it just because you couldnt stand to bugle ? " " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Compny Commander 's discretion to decide , " Wardencorrected instantly . Holmes nodded . And Warden grinned at45Prewitt velvetly . " Then you did nt transfer because Mr Houston made young Maclntosh First Bugler ? Over you ? " " I was transferred , " Prew said , staring at the other . " It was a personal matter . " Warden leaned back in his chair and snorted softly . " What a helluva thing to transfer over . Kids in the Army we got now . Someday you punks will learn that good jobs do nt grow on trees . " In the electric antagonism that flashed between the two of them and hung heavy like ozone in the air Capt Holmes had been forgotten . He broke in now , as was his right . " It looks to me , " he said indifferently , " as if you were fast acquiring a reputation as a bolshevik , Prewitt . Bolsheviks never get anywhere in the Army . You 'll find that straight duty in this outfit is considerably tougher than SD in the Bugle Corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Prew said . " In the Infantry . I do nt mind doing it again . " You liar , he told himself , like hell you do not mind it . How is it that people make you lie so easily ? " Well , " Holmes said , pausing for the effect , " it looks as though you 'll get a chance to do it . " But he was no longer jocular . " You 're not a recruit and you should know that in the Army its not the individualthat counts . Every man has certain responsibilities to fulfill . Moral responsibilities that go beyond the ARs ' regulations . It might look as though I were a free agent , but I 'm not . No matter how high you get there is always somebody over you , and who knows more about it all than you do . " Sergeant Warden will take care of you and get you assigned to a squad . " Nothing more was said about the Company bugler 's job . He turned to Warden . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , Sergeant ? " Yes , Sir , " Warden , who had been listening to this abstract con versa ion , said violently . " The Compny Fund Report has got to be checked and made out . Its due tomorrow morning . " " You make it out , " Holmes said , undisturbed by the regulation that says no one but an officer may touch the Company Fund . " Fix it up and I 'll he in early tomorrow to sign it . I havent time to bother with details . Is that all ? " " No , Sir , " Warden said vehemently . " Well , whatever it is , you fix it . If theres anything that has to go in this afternoon , sign my name . I wont be back . " He looked at Warden angrily and turned back to the door , ignoring Prewitt . " Yes , Sir , " Warden raged . " Ten-nsh-HUT ! " he bawled , bellowing it at the top of his lungs in the smallness of the room . " Carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hat brim and disappeared . A moment later his voice came in the open window . " Sergeant Warden ! " " Yes , Sir ! " Warden bellowed , jumping to the window . " Whats the matter with this outfit ? This place needs policing . Look there . And there . And over by the garbage rack . Is this a barracksor a pigpen ? I want it policed up ! Immediately ! " " Yes , Sir ! " bellowed Warden , " Maggio ! " Maggio 's gnomelike body bobbed up in its undershirt before the window . " Yesser . " " Maggio , " said Capt Holmes . " Wheres your goddam fatigue blouse ? Get your blouse and put it on . This is no goddamned bathing beach . " " Yessir , " Maggio said . " I 'll get it , Sir . " " Maggio , " Warden bellowed . " Get the other KPs and police the goddam area . Dint you hear what the Compny Commander said ? " " Okay , Sarge , " said Maggio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Holmes 's broad back move through the midst of Dog Company , called to attention by their duty sergeant . " Carry on , " Holmes thundered . After Holmes had passed , the blue-dressed figures sat back down to go on with their stoppage drill . " The hell fot leather Cavalryman , " Warden muttered . " Errol Flynn with fifty extra pounds . " He walked deliberately over to his desk and smashed his fist into his own rigidly blocked , flat-peaked issue hat hanging on the wall . " The son of a bitch 'd try to ship me down if I bent up my hat like his . " Then he went back to the window . Holmes was climbing the outside stair to Regimental Hq , going up to Col Delbert 's office . Warden had a theory about officers : Being an officer would make a son of a bitch out of Christ himself . And they had you by the nuts . You couldnt do a thing . That was why they were such ones . But beyond the Hq stairs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the truck entrance . And maybe right now , behind that unrevealing window , she was languorously undressingthe long flowing milk of that blonde body , garment by garment like a stripper in a honkytonk , to take a bath or something . Maybe she had a man in there with her now . Warden felt his chest swelling potently with maleness , as if a greatballoon were being blown up inside him . He turned from the window and sat back down . Prew was waiting for him , standing quietly before the desk , feelingworn out now and very tired , feeling the sweat still dripping slowly from his armpits with the strain of subduing his own fear and disagreeing with authority . The collar of the shirt that had been fresh at eight o'clock was wilted and the sweat had soaked clear through the back . Only a little more of this and you are through , he told himself . Then you can relax . Warden picked up a paper from his desk and began to read it , as if he were alone . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , as if wondering how this man had got into his office uninvited and without his knowing it . " Well ? " Milt Warden said . " What the hell do you want ? " Prew stared at him levelly , not answering , not disconcerted . And for a time both were silent , studying each other , like two opposing checker players taking each other 's measure before the game began . There was no open dislike in the face of either , only a sort of cold inherent antagonism . They were like two philosophers starting from the same initial premise of life and each , by irrefutable argument , arriving at a diametrically opposite conclusion . Yet these two conclusionswere like twin brothers of the same flesh and heritage and blood . Warden broke the spell . " You havent changed a bit , have you , Prewitt ? " he said sarcastically . " Havent learned a thing . Fools rush in where angels fear to re-enlist , as some great wit once said . All a man has to do is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own head in the noose for him . " " A man like you , you mean , " Prew said . " No , not me . I like you . " " I love you too , " Prew said . " And you ai nt changed none either . " " Put his own head in the noose , " Warden shook his head sorrowfully . " Thats what you did just now ; you know that , do nt you ? When you turned down Dynamite 's Boxing Squad ? " " 1 thought you did nt like jockstraps and SD men , " Prew said . " I do nt , " Warden said . " But did it ever occur to you that in a way I 'm an SI ) man myself ? I do nt do straight duty . " " Yeah , " Prew said . " I 've thought of that . Thats why I couldnt see why you hated us guys in the Bugle Corps so much . " " Because , " Warden grinned , " SD men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ai nt got what it takes so they ride the gravytrain . " " And make life a hellhole for every one they can , like you . " " No , " Warden said . " Guess again . I do nt make hell for nobody . I 'm only the instrument of a laughing Providence . Sometimes I do nt like it myself , but I couldnt help it if I was born smart . " " We cant all be smart , " Prew said . " Thats right , " Warden nodded . " We cant . Its a shame too . You been in the army what now ? Five years ? Fivenahalf ? Its about time for you to get over bein a punk ree-croot and begin to get smart , ai nt it ? That is , if you 're ever goin to . " " Maybe I 'd ruther not be smart . " Warden unfolded his arms and proceeded to light a cigaret , lazily , taking his time . " You had a soft deal as a bugler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Queer Houston hurt your feelins . And then you turn Holmes down when he wants you for his boxing squad , " he said , mincing the words . " You should of took him up , Prewitt . You wont like straight duty in my compny . " " I can soljer with any man , " Prew said . " I 'll take my chances . " " Okay , " Warden said . " So what ? Since when has bein a good soljer had anything to do with the Army ? Do you think bein a good soljer will get you a sergeant 's rating in this outfit ? after what you just pulled ? It wont even get you Pfc . " You 're the kind of soljer ought to be jockstrappin , Prewitt . Then you could get your name in all the Honolulu papers and be a hero . Because you 'll never make a real soljer . Never in God 's world . " When you change your mind and decide you might as well jockstrapfor Dynamite after all , remember this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of Holmes . " This ai nt A Compny now , Prewitt . This is G Compny , of which I am First Sergeant . I run this compny . Holmes is the CO , but he is like the rest of the officer class : a dumb bastard that signs papers an rides horses an wears spurs an gets stinking drunk up at the stinkingOfficers ' Club . I 'm the guy that runs this compny . " " Yeah ? " Prew grinned . " Well , you ai nt doin a very goddam good job of it , buddy . If you run this outfit , how come Preem 's the mess sergeant ? And how come O'Hayer 's the supply sergeant , when Leva does the work ? And how come most every noncom in your cornpny ' is one of Holmes 's punchies ? Do nt give me that crap . " The whites of Warden 's eyes turned slowly red . " You do nt know the half of it yet , kid , " he grinned . " Wait till you been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do nt know Galovitch , and Henderson , and Dhom , the duty sergeant . " 48 49He removed the cigaret from the corner of his mouth and knocked it with deliberate slowness on the ashtray . " But the point is , Holmes would strangle on his own spit if I wasnt here to swab out his throat for him . " He stuffed the burning coal out savagely and then rose languidly like a stretching cat . " So at least we know where we stand , " he said , " do nt we , kid ? " " I know where I stand , " Prew said . " I ai nt never been able to figure out where you stand . I think . . . " The sound of someone com- ing in the corridor made him cut it off , because this was a private argument , a thing between himself and Warden that rank , whether high or low , would not appreciate . Warden grinned at him . " Rest , rest , rest , " a voice said through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , " though both of them were standing . The voice was fol- lowed by a little man , shorter yet than Prewitt , who came walking quick-stepping with a ramrod back behind it through the door , dressed in dapper , tailored CKCs and sporting 2nd Lieutenant 's bars . He stopped when he saw Prewitt . " I do nt know you , do I , soldier ? " said the little man . " Whats your name ? " " Prewitt , Sir , " Prew said , looking around at Warden who was grin- ning wryly . " Prewitt , Prewitt , Prewitt , " said the little man . " You must be a new man , a transfer . Because I do nt know that name . " " Transferred from A Compny , this morning , Sir , " Prew said . " Ah , " said the little man . " I knew it . If I did nt know that name , I knew it wasnt in the Company . I spent three bloody weeks sweat- ing out a roster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name . My father always told me a good officer knows every man in his outfit by name , preferably by his nickname . Whats your nickname , soldier ? " " They call me Prew , Sir , " Prew said , still not acute , awake or cog- nizant before this swiftly talking blob of energy . " Of course , " said the little man . " I should have known that . I 'm Lt Culpepper , recently of West-Point-on-the Hudson , now of this Com- pany . You 're the new fighter , are nt you , the welterweight ? Too bad you did nt get here before the close of the season . Glad to have you aboard , Prewitt , glad to have you aboard , as the Old Man and his colleagues in the navy would say . " Lt Culpepper sprinted around the little room laying papers here and there in their different boxes . " You probably know of me , " he said , " if you have read the Regimental Chronicles . My father and his50grandfather before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both rose to command of this Company , then to command of this Regiment before they became general officers . I am following in their illustrious footsteps . Hear hear . " Hey , hey , " he said . " Wheres my golf bag , Sergeant Warden ? I have a golf date with Colonel Prescott 's daughter in fifteen minutes , then lunch , then more golf . " " Its in the closet there , " Warden said aloofly , " behind the filing cabinet . " " Ah , yes , " said Lt Culpepper , son of Brigadier Culpepper , grandson of Lt General Culpepper , great grandson of Lt Col Culpepper , C.S.A . " I 'll get it , Sergeant , do nt bother , " he said to Warden who had not moved . " I 've got to do my eighteen holes today . Big party at the Club tonight and I 've got to be in shape . " He pulled the golf bag out from behind the green art metal filing cabinet , knocking a sheaf of files off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and breezed out as swiftly as he had come , saying nothing more to Prewitt . Disgustedly Warden picked the files up and put them back where they had been . " Come on , " he said to Prewitt . " I 'll fix you up . I got work to do . " He walked over behind Holmes 's desk and stood looking at the chart of the Company 's personnel organization that hung there with little cardboard tabs containing each man 's name and separated into platoons and squads and hanging from screw hooks . " Wheres your stuff ? " he said . " Still at A Compny . I dint want to pack my clean uniforms . " Warden grinned his sly pixy grin . " Still the dude , hunh ? Havent changed a bit . Takes more than clothes to make a soljer , Prewitt . A whole helluva lot more . " He took a blank tab from one of Holmes 's desk drawers and printed Prewitt 's name on it . " Theres a machine-gun cart leaning up against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . Save you makin four five trips . " " Okay , " Prew said , surprised at the beneficence and unable to keep it off his face . Warden grinned at him , relishing the surprise . " I 'd hate to see you muss them uniforms , kid . I hate to see any kind of energy wasted , even if its been wasted once already . " We ought to be able to fix you up in a good squad , " he grinned . " Now how would you like to be in Chief Choate 's squad ? " 51 " What 're you tryin to do ? " Prew said , " kid me ? I do nt see you puttin me in Big Chief 's squad . I more likely see you puttin me ina squad that one of Holmes 's punchies runs . " " You do ? " Warden 's eyebrows hooked and quivered delicately . Hehung the tab up on the chart under Cpl Choate 's name . " There . You see ? I 'm probably the best friend you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . Lets go to the supply room and drawyour stuff . " In the supply room rawboned bald and wryfaced Leva stopped hisscribbling long enough to dole out sheets and mattress covers , shelterhalfand blankets , pack and all the rest of it and get Prew 's initials on the Form . " Hello , Prew , " he grinned . " Hello , Niccolo , " Prew said . " You still in this outfit ? " " You come to stay a spell with us ? " Leva said , " or is this just temporary ? " " He 'll probly , " Warden said , " stay quite a while . " He led him upstairs to the row of bunks that Choate 's squad inhabitedand pointed out the one for him to take . " You got till one o'clock to get straightened out , " The Wardensaid . " You fall out for Fatigue at one P.M. Just like us commonpeople . " Prew set himself to stowing all his stuff . The big squadroom wasvery still with nobody in it . His heels clacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and the banging of his walllocker was too loud , echoing deeply back and forth across the room . CHAPTER 5CAPT HoLMES , when he left the Orderly Room , was feeling good . He felt he had given a pretty good account of himself with the cook Willard , but particularly with the new man , Prewitt , the welter from the 27th . He had already heard the story about his quitting fighting and now , after the interview , he was confident Prewitt would come around and change his mind , before summer and the Company Smokerseason . Capt Holmes liked to climb the stairs to Hq Building . They did notlook like concrete , they looked like old marble streaked gray and black . Age had polished down the once porous concrete and roundedthe raw edges with rain and feet , and given it a smooth slick gloss . When the stairs were wet they always caught and perpetuated therainbow , like a promise . There will always be an Army , they said to him . Heavy concrete and mortared brick had been molded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His orderly faithfullysaddlesoaped and polished his riding boots once a day , it was the same thing . As he raised first one foot then the other to the step above the soft pliant leather bent in long smooth wrinkles , with noneof those crowsfeet that show poor care . Once a day , regular as the monthly pay voucher . His sense of accomplishment was though , just now , dimmed by a slight uneasiness at the prospect of meeting Col Delbert . Not that he disliked the Old Man . But when a man had the rank on you andheld your majority in the palm of his hand you naturally had to watch every word . In the middle of the upper porch a dumpy private in fatigues was expertly swinging a mop over the glazed floor , never lifting it , each stroke sweeping from wall to wall . Capt Holmes paused automatically for him to stop to let him pass , but the private was too intent upon his job to see him . When he did not stop Capt Holmes , still thinking about the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The beard of the mop slapped his heel , and the private looked up startled , then popped to a guilty wide-eyed Attention , the mop dangling from his hand . He looked down at it a moment indecisively , then jerked the stick up along his right side like a guidon and looked at Holmes . Capt Holmes gave him one disdainful look , disgusted atsuch chaotic and unreasonable fear of officers which always irritated him , and went on silently . Col Delbert was in his office . Behind the big desk and across the long expanse of gleaming floor , between the two tall flags , one the country 's the other the Regiment 's , he looked deceptively small . But he was a big man , big enough that the tiny irongray mustache he wore always embarrassed Capt Holmes , no matter how hard he tried not to judge . Outside of the black cocker that slept on the floor and two straight chairs the office was properly and soldierly bare . Everything went off as Holmes saluted coldly and impersonally . Even the cocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned it with the same precision , then everything came on againand the Colonel smiled . When he smiled he was really , truly almost fatherly. 52 53 " Well , " the Col said , pushing back his chair and slapping his handsdown on his knees . " Whats on your mind , eh , Dynamite ' ? " Capt Holmes smiled back and got one of the chairs from againstthe wall , wishing he could get rid of that ridiculous uneasiness . " Well , Sir . One of my old men ... " " We certainly looked had last Sunday in baseball . " The Col clippedthe words . " You see the game ? A rout . A veritable rout . The 21st ranover us roughshod , I say . It ' d ' ve been much worse if ' t had n't been for Big Chief Choate . Best firstbaseman ever saw . Really ought to transfer him to Hq Company and give him a Staff Sergeancy . " ColDelbert beamed and the short mustache bent sharply in the middle like a distant bird in flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team at allin baseball , but he 's the only thing we 've got . " Capt Holmes debated in the pause whether the Col intended togo on , or whether he could go ahead with what he wanted . He decidedit would be better to wait than interrupt him if he did go on . " We wont do anything in baseball this year , " the Col went on . Holmes chalked up a hit . " Your boxing squad was only athletic championshipwe won all year last year . Looks like the only one we 'll have a chance of winning this year . I 've taken some mighty strong ribbingabout our athletic prowess lately . " " Yes , Sir , " Capt Holmes said in the next pause . " Thank you , Sir . " " Every soldier knows , " the Col said , " that good athletics make forgood soldiering . Our Regiment 's athletic reputation has suffered badly this last year . Even the downtown newspapers were lampooning us . A thing like that is never good . You , my boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thank you , Sir , " Capt Holmes said , trying to figure what it wasleading up to . Col Delbert paused , sagely screwing up his eyes . " Do you thinkwe 'll win that championship again this year , Captain ? " " Well , Sir , " Capt Holmes said . " We 've got a fifty-fifty chance so far . We 're ahead of the 27th on points ; but not with enough marginto have a cinch , " he added . " Then you do nt think we 'll win it ? " Col Delbert said . " I did nt say that , Sir , " said Capt Holmes . " Well , " the Col said , " either you think we 'll win it , or you dontthink we 'll win it . Do nt you ? " " Yes , Sir , " Ilolmes said . " Then which ? " " What ? " Holmes said . " Oh , we 'll win it , Sir . " 54 " Good . Good , " the Col said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two years . " Capt Holmes considered carefully . " Yes , Sir , " he said . " But I think all we coaches did our best . " The Col nodded , emphatically . " Think so too . But we ' ve got to get results . Our S-3 training is all very fine , soldiers need to drill to keep them busy . But in peacetime we both know its our athletic programs that keep us before the public 's eye . Particularly here in the Islands where there are no big time sports . Have talked to the rest of our athletic heads , except for you ; your season isnt over yet . Am relievingMajor Simmons from football . " The Col smiled significantly and the little mustache became a chicken hawk . " Results . Results what counts . He has requested reassignmentto the Mainland , of course , " he added . Capt Holmes nodded , thinking fast . This was recent . Today . Or he would have heard about it . That left a majority open  --  unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the job was , and if a man got appointed to the job it would probably mean his own promotion would be recommended . The Col placed his big hands flat upon the serenity of his desk . " Well , " he said . " What was it you wanted , Dynamite ' ? " Holmes had almost forgotten what he came for . " Oh , " he said . " One of my old men , Sir . Came to see me a week ago . Wants to transfer up here with me . He 's at Fort Kamehameha , Coast Artillery . Served with me at Bliss . I wanted to see you about him so I could be sure it went through all right . " The little mustache flapped its wings slyly . " Another fighter , eh . We ' re little over strength , but it can be arranged . I ' 11 even write letter to Department on ' t . " Capt Holmes bent down to pat the Colonel 's dog . " Why , no , Sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good man , though . Best cook I ever had . " " Oh , " the Col said . " He served with me at Bliss , Sir . I 'll vouch for him personally . " " I ' 11 have it attended to , " Col Delbert said . " Tell me , how ' s that outfit of yours getting along ? Still balling the jack ? Your company interests me . It proves my theory : good athletes make good noncoms and good leaders ; good leaders make a good organization . Simple logic . Plenty of cattle in this world , that have to be driven . But withoutgood leaders nothing ' s ever accomplished . " Capt Holmes 's eyes went opaque and out of focus with his shyness .. " I flatter myself , Sir , " he smiled , " that I have the most efficient outfit in the Regiment . " " Yes . Now First Sergeant Warden is an example of my logic . An all around athlete before he  --  ah  --  took up the grail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I imagine he bitches a lot , " the Col said , " but a good soldier alwaysbitches . Good for him . Good soldiers are born  --  born wild and wooly , like Sergeant Warden . Only time to worry about a good soldieris when he stops bitching . My grandfather taught me that . " Capt Holmes nodded vigorously . " Yes , Sir , " he said , although this philosophy had not originated with the Colonel 's grandfather . It was widespread and he had heard it all before . But it was good . That about Warden , particularly , was so true . He was feeling better . Col Delbert suddenly brought his swivel chair back up level and scooted it up to the desk . He spoke sharply . " Now tell me , Captain : Just what are your prospects for next year ? You say you 'll win this year , so we 'll dismiss that . You 're as good as your word with me , sir . But if we are to win we must begin to plan early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winning this year is not enough . We must plan on winning next year . In this world it is the winner who gets spoils . I do nt know about the next world but I imagine it ' s the same thing there , in spite of what our skypilots tell us . Would you say we ' ve a good chance of winning ? " Capt Holmes felt suddenly hedged in . There was a condition attached to the majority , provided of course he won this year , and he was being pinned down for it . " Well , yes , Sir , " he said . " As good a chance as we have now ? of winning this year ? " " Well , Sir . No . I wouldnt say exactly that . " Capt Holmes racked his brain . " We 're due to lose three Class I boys , Sir , you know , asshort timers . " " Ah , " the Col said . " I know . But you still have Sgt Wilson andSgt . O'Hayer . Do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one new man who did fairly well this year in the Bowl . Pvt Bloom . I 'm thinking of grooming him for a shot at the middleweightnext year . " The Col kept staring at him and his eyes kept slipping out of focus off the Colonel 's face , hard as he tried to keep them there . His left cheek itched and he wished he had a stick of gum . But then he could not chew it . He wished he 'd never come up here in the first place. 56 " Bloom ? " the Col said . " Bloom . Great big Jewish boy with a flat head and kinky hair ? And that ' s all ? " " Well , Sir , no , Sir . I wanted to ask you about that . I have no heavyweightworth a damn . Corporal Choate was Heavyweight Champion of Panama not so long ago . I 've been trying to get him to go out ever since I came here . " " Ah , " the Col said . " He wont go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporal Choate is probably the best firstbaseman in the Islands . We do nt want to lose our firstbaseman , do we ? " " No , Sir . " " I ' m afraid you could n't count on Choate . " Capt Holmes nodded . The baseball team would lose out anyway , but they wanted you to win . They always wanted you to win . The winner gets the gravy . The Colonel 's goddamned dog was still boredly asleep , hind legs spread flat and belly to the floor , front legs crossed as nonchalantly as a male lead in morning trousers . Every officer in the Regiment had to coddle the little bastard . Why do nt you chuck it , Holmes ? he thought . And do what ? Go where ? " I have one new man , Sir , " he said , though he had meant to save this one back . " Name is Prewitt . Fought for the 27th . Runnerup in the welterweight division . He was transferred to my Company from the Bugle Corps . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ' s fine . You say he was in the Regiment ? in the Bugle Corps ? " Holmes was tired . " Yes , Sir . " That damned smug dog . " Been here a year . " Sleeping and eating and allowing himself to be coddled . " Ever since last boxing season . " Son of a bitching little fat dog with such a goddamned easy life . " Remarkable ! " the Col said . " In the Bugle Corps . Too bad we did nt know about it this year . Could have used him . But then no one ever knows who ' s in the Bugle Corps . You 've talked to him ? " " Yes , Sir , " Holmes said . Might as well give him all of it , now . " He refuses to go out . " If you had an ounce of guts , Holmes , you would have added , " too . " Col Delbert turned his head on stiff shoulders . " He cant refuse to go out . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an error . He did nt give a damn , to hell with it . Still , where would you go ? He refrained from mentioning the Company Bugler job. 57 " No , he did n't , " the Col said precisely . His eyes were curiously flat . " You just think he did . It ' s your job to see th't he does go out . " If he knew it was for the Regiment 's sake he would want to go out . All you have to do is convince him . Let him know how much the Regiment needs him . " The Regiment , Capt Holmes thought . Thats all . The honor and reputation of the Regiment . Col Delbert 's Regiment . And he does nt even want to know why he wont go out . At least I asked him that , he told himself . You already knew it , himself said . The fatherly smile lubricated the flatted eyes , creating a peculiarly imperfect picture . " If you ' re going to need the man , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me I gather you will need him ? " " I could certainly use him , Sir . " " Then convince him . I might as well be frank . We have got to win that next year . Because that is all we can win . Keep that in mind . I want you to keep your hand in . A few workouts now and then . You can have the gym afternoons now and then . Start building now . That ' s important : Plan Now . " " Yes , Sir , " Capt Holmes said . " I 'll start in soon . " But his voice was overwhelmed by the screek of an opening drawer , the traditional indication that the interview was ended . Col Delbert raised his eyes from the drawer and looked at Holmes inquiringly , but Capt Holmes was already on his feet replacing the chair against the wall . Anyway , he had gotten a green light on Stark 's transfer and that was what he came for . The wood noises woke the cocker and he rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrolling his pink tongue in an insolent yawn . He licked his chops and stared at Holmes accusingly . Holmes stared back , lost in sudden thought , his hand still on the chair , enviously watching the sleek black wellfed arrogance stretch itself back out on the polished floor and resume its interrupted meditation . He remembered his hand on the chair then , removed it , turned around for the impersonal ritual of saluting . With all its time-stopping associations of the Point , and God , it seemed to draw him in again to the Old Man , by its very deliberateness . But he knew it did not change anything . " Oh , " the Col said , as Holmes reached the door . " How is Miss Karen getting along ? She feeling better ? " " She 's feeling a little better lately , " Capt Holmes said , turning back. 58The Colonel 's eyes had lost their flatness and become deep , very deel with a little red light at the bottom . " A fine lady , " Col Delbert said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' party at the Club . My wife is giving a bridge part ) this week . She would like to have her come . " Capt Holmes forced himself to shake his head . " I know she 'd be delighted , " he said , " but I doubt very much if she 'll be feeling up to it , Sir . She 's none too strong , you know . Things like that excite her Sp . " Ah , " the Col said . " Too bad . Told my wife I was afraid of that . Ah , will she be feeling well enough by the time the Brigadier 's party comes up ? " " I hope so , Sir , " Capt Holmes said . " I know how badly she would hate to miss it . " " Ah , " the Col said . " Certainly hope 'll be able to come . We all enjoy her company so much . Charmin ' lady , really , Captain . " " Thank you , Sir , " Capt Holmes said , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepness . " By the way , Captain , I ' m giving another little stag next week . I ' ve secured the same apartment upstairs at the Club . You ' re invited , of course . " Holmes 's eyes went opaque again as he grinned , shamefacedly . " I 'll be there , Sir . " " Ah , " the Col said , opening his mouth and tilting back his head and looking at the other down his nose . " Fine . Good . Thats good . " He opened another of his desk drawers . Capt Holmes left . The stag made him feel a little better , in spite of the pinning down . How could anyone say positively who would win ? But at least he wasnt on the shitlist yet , those stags were exclusive , nothing but rank there . But down deep it did not change a thing and the porch and stairs , as he went down going home now to lunch , had lost their sense of permanence . Some day he would be reassigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where there was Cavalry again . What a wild idea this had been , this going in the Infantry just to do a tour in the Islands , the goddamned Paradise of the Pacific . Still , he told himself , it isnt as if you 're going to spend the rest of your life in Schofield Barracks . What can he do ? He would have to speak to Karen , though . The Colonel would want her at the Brigadier 's party . He would have to talk her into going , some way . If she would only consent to be nice to the old duffer , it might mean the majority even if the squad lost , this year or next . He did nt want her to sleep with him or anything like that . Just be nice to him . Walking out the truck entrance he returned the salutes of several privates coming from the PX without seeing them , and crossed the street to the house . CHAPTER 6 KAREN HOLMES was absorbed in the brushing of her long blonde hair when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes across the kitchen floor . She had been brushing it now almost an hour , rapt in the purely sensual pleasure of it that required no thought , free for once in this that did not make her think of freedom , alive to these long golden hairs that singly and in masses curved themselves about the stiff long bristles of the brush , until it had , as she desired , entranced her , away from all of it . Away where nothing else existed but this mirror in which she saw the rhythm of this moving arm that was herself . That was why she loved to brush her hair so . She loved to cook , too ; for the same reason . She was an excellent cook , when she felt like it . She also read voraciously . She could even enjoy the poor books , when she had to . She was not , accurately , of the stuff from which an Army wife is made . The slamming door broke the rapture , and she found that she was staring into the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood sucked out by a modern vampire called Embalmer , leaving only the gashed bloody wound that was her lipsticked mouth . It was urging her to hurry up and find the thing . Leave me , Mask , she said at it . If , replied the Mask , you shrink from evil when its cloak is flung upon your shoulders , the more closely will it wrap its suffocating folds around you . She laid aside the brush and covered with her hands the face that haunted her most of all with its futility of emptiness , hearing the footsteps of Military Doom coming swift across the dining room . Holmes barged into the room , his hat still on his head . " Oh , " he said , guiltily . " Hello . I did nt know you were home . I just came in to change my uniform . " Karen picked up the brush and went back to her hair . " The car is parked outside , " she said . " It is ? " Holmes said . " I did nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company this morning , " Karen said , " looking for you . " " What for ? " Holmes said . " You know I do nt like to have you over there , around the men . " " I wanted you to get some things for me , " she lied . " I thought you 'd be there . " " I had some business to attend to before I went in , " Holmes lied . He undid his tie and threw it on the bed and sat down with the boot jack . Karen did not answer . " That was all right , wasnt it ? " he protested . " But of course , " she said . " I have no right to inquire into your actions . That was the agreement . " " Then why bring it up ? " " Because I wanted you to know I 'm not as stupid as you maintain all women are . " Holmes stood the boots up by the bed and stripped off sweatdamp shirt and breeches . " Now what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of nothing , " Karen smiled . " Its no longer any of my business how many you go out with , is it ? But I wish for God 's sake you could just be honest about it once . " " Now , " he cried disgustedly , seeing the excitement of the riding date fading rapidly before him , " Now ! All I did was come home to change my uniform and get some lunch . Thats all . " " I thought , " she said , " you did nt know I was here . " " I did nt , goddam it . I just thought , you might be here , " he finished lamely , flustered at being caught up in the lie . " God damn , " he blustered . " Other women . What brings that on this time ? How many times do I have to tell you. I havent any other women before you 'll believe me ? " " Dana , " Karen said . " Give me credit for a little brains . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke off suddenly , shocked at the hatred that was on her face . " If I had them , " he said , self pity in his voice , putting on fresh socks , " do nt you think I 'd admit it to you ? Theres no reason I should try to hide it , is there ? the way things are between us now ? " he asked her bitterly . " What right have you to always be accusing me of that ? " " What right ? " Karen said , looking at him in the mirror. 60 61Under the indictment of her eyes Holmes cringed . " All right , " he said dejectedly . " That again . How long will it be , I wonder , before I am allowed to live that down ? How many times do I have to tell you , It Was An Accident ? " " That makes it all all right , I suppose , " she said . " That takes all the scars away , and we can just pretend it did nt happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes cried . " I know what its done to you . But how was I to know ? I did nt know it myself until too late . What more is there for me to say , except I 'm sorry ? " Looking back at her in the mirror he tried to be indignant , but had to drop his eyes . The uniform on the floor shamed him with the existence of the wet spots of his body water on its cloth . " Please , Dana , " Karen said shrilly , franticness in her voice . " You know how much I hate to talk about it . I 'm trying to forget it . " " All right , " Holmes said . " You brought it up . I do nt like to think about it either , but neither one of us will ever be allowed to forget it . I 've lived with it for eight years now . " He stood up wearily , walkingto the closet for another uniform , temporarily defeated . All the anticipation of this afternoon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So have I lived with it , " Karen called after him . " You got off easy . At least it did nt scar you any . " Furtively , on the side away from him , privately , she slipped her hand down to her belly , feeling with her fingers the thick ridge of the scar . There lies the evil , she thought hysterically , the grape torn open and the seed plucked out and left withering on the vine . All the foulness of all the soppy secret dampness , the sliding slippery airless dark came back on her now and overwhelmed her as the gaseous bubble burst in her mind , seeming it with the memory of foulness that she must escape . In the closet Holmes made up his mind to go riding anyway , whether he wanted to or not , because to hell with it and he 'd take a bottle . Under the unpleasantness he dreaded he grinned back at himself . When he stepped out in fresh underwear the change in him was already apparent . The dejection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had assumed the hangdog air of a synthetic plaintiveness that was his last defense that always wrested victory from the acceptance of defeat . Karen recognized the attitude . In the mirror she could see him in his underwear , massive , hairy , legs bowed grotesquely by so many62hours on a horse  --  at Bliss he had been the captain of the polo team  --  and the thick black hair on his chest padding out the T shirt like excelsior a cushion . His face , heavy bearded , had that gross blue sens- uality of a fecund priest , and the same proud-suffering air . He had only shaved below his collarline , and the black curls reached up to the shaved neck like living flames sucked up a flue . Her stomach flopped in her sickeningly , like a big fish slimy on the hook , at the sight of him who was her husband . She moved along the seat before the dressing table until she could no longer see his reflection . " I saw Colonel Delbert this morning , " Holmes said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendrick 's party . " His big jaw set , watching her levelly , he moved over to where his image was before her in the mirror again , casually , as he was putting on the breeches . Karen watched him do it , knowing what he was doing now , yet still unable to keep her nerves from jangling like a plucked guitar string . " We 'll have to go , " he said . " Theres no way out of it . Also , his wife is having another tea ; I got you out of that . " " You can get me out of the other , too , " Karen said , but her tone had lost its commanding air and was half-hearted . " If you want to go , go by yourself . " " I cant keep on going by myself forever , " Holmes said plaintively . " You can if you tell them I 'm sick , which will be the truth . Let them think I 'm an invalid , I 'm near enough one to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football , " he said . " That leaves a majority open . The Old Man told me about it , then asked if you werent coming to the party . " " The last time I went to a party where he was , you remember , I came home with my gown torn nearly off . " " He was a little tight , " Holmes said . " He did nt really mean any- thing by it . " " I hope not , " Karen said thinly . " If I wanted a man to sleep with I 'd pick a man , not that beery tub of guts . " " I 'm serious , " Holmes said , transferring the insignias from the dirty shirt to the clean one . " Your being nice to him might mean all the difference now , since this Simmons thing has opened up . " " I 've helped you with your work all I can , " she said . " You know I have . I 've gone to parties I 've hated . Its been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . But the one thing I wont do is sleep with Colonel Delbert for you . " 63 " Nobody wants you to . All I 'm asking is that you be decent to him . " " You cant be decent with a lecherous old roue . It makes me physicallysick . " Unconsciously , she picked up the brush and began to brush her hair again , distractedly . " A majority is worth getting physically sick over , " Holmes said , pleadingly . " A man with a majority now , if he graduated from the Point , will be a General officer when this war thats coming ends . All you have to do is smile and listen to him talk about his grandfather . " " A smile , to him , is only an invitation to put his hands between your legs . He 's got a wife . Why does nt he take it out on her ? " " Yes , " Holmes said tautly . " Why does nt he ? " Karen winced before the accusation , even knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nerve ends of her body vibrated shatteringly . " It was your part of our agreement , " Holmes said sadly . " All right , " she said . " All right . I 'll go . There I said it , now lets talk about something else . " " What are we having for lunch ? " Holmes said . " I 'm hungry , hungryas hell . I 've had one hell of a day , listening to Delbert . He can talk your leg off . Then having to argue half the morning with the kitchen force , and this new transfer Prewitt . " He looked at her closely . " It completely exhausts me nervously . " She waited until he finished . " You know this is the maid 's day off . " Holmes 's eyes crinkled painfully . " Is it ? By god ! What is today ? Thursday ? I thought today was Wednesday . " He looked hopefully at his watch , then shrugged . " Well , its too late to go up to the Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling him watching her closely , tried to go on brushing to escape the sense of guilt because she was not offering to fix a lunch for him . He never ate lunch at home and it was not in her part of the bargain they had made , yet still he was making her feel like a heartless criminal . " I guess I 'll just have to catch one of those lousy sandwiches at the PX , " Holmes said resignedly . He fidgeted around a minute and sat down on the bed . " What do you eat for lunch ? " he said with the air of one who shamefacedly makes a great imposition . " I usually just fix soup for myself , " Karen said , breathing deeply . " Oh , " he said . " You know I do nt eat soup . " " You asked me , did nt you ? " she said , trying to keep her voice from going higher . " I fix myself soup . Why should I lie ? " Holmes got up hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now take it easy . I 'll just go on over to the PX . I do nt mind . You know what it does to you to get upset . You just cant stand it . You 'll have yourself sick in bed . " " Theres nothing wrong with me , " she protested . " I 'm no bedfast invalid , " thinking how he had no right to use that word with her , to call her darling . He always did it , in these spells , and the word was like a skewer pinning her to the beaverboard among the other butterfliesof his collection . In her imagination she saw herself rising up , telling him what she thought of him , packing a bag and leaving , to live her own life and earn her own way . She would get a job and an apartment someplace . What kind of a job ? she asked herself . In your physical condition what can you do ? what training have you ? Besidesto be a wife . " You know your nerves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just quiet down now and take it easy . Just relax . " He walked over and put his hands soothingly on her shoulders , gripping them affectionatelyand lightly , and looking solicitously into her eyes in the mirror . Karen felt them on her , holding her down , tying her down , as her life was tied down , and she had the same sensation she remembered having as a child when out in the woods she had caught her dress on the barbs of a wire fence , and she had lunged and plunged and pulled until she got loose leaving half her dress behind , even though her mother was coming all the time to help her . " Thats it , relax , " Holmes smiled . " Now you just fix yourself lunch the way you would if I wasnt here and I 'll eat whatever you have for yourself . Now . Hows that ? " " I can fix you a toasted cheese sandwich , " Karen said weakly . " Okay , " he smiled . " Cheese will be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she got the lunch ready , sat at the kitchen table following her with his eyes . When she measured out the coffee , his eyes watched her solicitously . When she greased the skillet and set it on the burner , his eyes watched her , carefully protecting . Karen prided herself on her cooking , it was her only art and she had learned to do it well and with the least amount of wasted time and motion . But now , for some reason , she forgot about the coffee , and it boiled over . When she grabbed up the pot she burnt her hand . Holmes jumped up with magnificent speed and grabbed a dishtowelto wipe up the stove . " Now , now , " he said . " Just forget it . I 'll clean it up . You sit down . You 're worn out . " 64Karen put her hands up to her face . " No , I 'm not , " she said . " Just let me fix it . I 'm sorry I boiled it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it . " It was then she smelled the smoke . She caught the cheese sandwich just in time to keep it from burning . It was black on one side . " Thats all right , " Holmes smiled bravely . " Now just forget it , darling . I do nt want you to get upset . This is perfectly all right . " " Let me scrape it for you , " Karen said . " No , no . Its perfectly all right like this . This is good . It really is . " He chomped on the sandwich to show how fine it was . He ate it with gusto . He did not drink any coffee. " 1 ' 11 catch a cup at the PX , " he smiled . " I have to go back over to the Company to sign some papers anyway . You go in and lie down and get some rest . It was really a fine lunch , truly it was . " Karen stood in the screendoor watching him go down the alley . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put her hands down at her sides and forced herself to relax them . She coughed once or twice , rackingly , but she did not cry . She made herself breathe deeply . She relaxed her muscles , but the nerves inside them went on fluttering frantically . Furtively , as it had an intelligence of its own , her hand moved up to her stomach and touched the ridge of scar tissue , and the horror she held of her own body , of the pusiness , of the cheesy degenerations , began to rise up queasily . The grape torn open and the seed plucked out , withering before it ever came to fruition . That isnt so , she told herself , you know it isnt so . You 've borne his heir for him , who can say your life is fruitless ? How can you be fruitless ? You 've been a mother , havent you ? There must be more , there must be , something told her , someplace , somewhere , there must be another reason , above , beyond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmotherhood = honor , justification , death . There must be anotherlanguage , forgotten unheard unspoken , than the owning of an American 's Homey Kitchen complete with dinette , breakfast nook , and fluorescent lighting . Among the broken bathroom fixtures and the sticky brightly colored rainwashcd labels on the emptied cans , Karen Holmes was searching through the city clump of civilization , desperately hunting for her life , and the muck she got upon her fingers did nt matter . There was so much of it already , Karen felt , upon her . CHAPTER 7PIEwirr was sitting on his bunk waiting for chow , playing solitaireto forget the sense of strangeness , when Anderson and Clark , the G Company buglers , came in the big unsympathetic squadroom . He had carted his stuff over from A Company and stowed it , made up the bare mattress into a precisely square-cornered bunk , arranged his uniforms in the wall locker , rolled a neat combat pack and old timer 's envelope roll , set his shoes and foot locker on the stand , and he was home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue fatigues and sat down with the cards . In less than half an hour he had accomplishedwhat it would have taken a recruit like Maggio doubtful hours to accomplish , but it had been unpleasant and he did not feel satisfied . It was always unpleasant , moving like this ; it always brought home to you the essential rootlessness of yourself and all men like you , always on the move , never really stopping anywhere , never really home . But you could forget anything with solitaire , for a while at least ; solitaire was the game of exiles . Prewitt knew the G Company buglers by sight . He put down his cards and watched them cross the squadroom . He had seen and listened to them playing their guitars evenings around the quad ; they were much better on the guitars than they were on the bugle ... . The instinctive judgment swept him with the air and atmosphere of the Corps and he felt a sudden wave of unbearable homesickness . The smell of the ball diamond bleachers during the morning drill period with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleats from the different-pitched bugles , drifting up to the golf course on the wind , rolling metallically into the edge of the woods . The many bugles conflicting , the calls begun in confidence and then left hanging doubtfully unfinished . And now and then the rare wellexecutedphrase , rising over all , sharp , insistent , catching the moment and the mood and carrying them to distant unseen ears . He felt a hunger for the acrid smell of metal polish that hung about his bugle as he played . Almost enviously he watched the two men pass between the rows of bunks . It was eleven and the Corps had been dismissed . They were through for the day . It was a standing joke in the Corps about the way these two watched the clock . They were always the first to leave the bleachers and sprinted back to the barracks so they could have an hour alone to practice before the Company came in from drill . But bugling meant nothing to them , except as a means to escape66 67straight duty and to get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitars , but there were no chairs for guitars in the Regimental Band . These two possessed the things that Prewitt valued , but they wanted something else instead . It seemed the very fact they did not want what they had led life to conspire to help them keep it ; and he who loved to bugle had to give it up because he loved it . It was not right . Anderson stopped when he saw Prewitt . He seemed to be debating whether to go on or to go back out . He made up his mind , and passed by without speaking , his deepset eyes sullenly on the floor . Clark stopped when Anderson stopped and looked at his mentor to see what he would do . When Anderson went on he followed , but he could not disregard Prewitt 's eyes . He nodded embarrassedly , his long Italian nose almost hiding his shy smile . They dragged out their guitars and began to play furiously , as if by putting their souls into it they could dispel the alien presence . After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Prewitt 's direction . Then they went into a huddle . Listening to them play Prewitt realized for the first time how good they really were . He had never paid much attention to them before but being in their Company suddenly made him aware of them as individuals . Even their faces were subtly changed , were the faces of different men , no longer indistinct . It was a thing he had noted before : how you could live beside a man for years and have no positive picture of him , until you were suddenly thrown into his company to find that he was not just a vague personality but an individual with an individual 's life . Anderson and Clark came out of their huddle and put their guitars away . They passed by Prewitt again , without speaking , and went on into the latrine at the end of the porch . They were deliberately avoidinghim . Prewitt lit a tailormade cigaret and stared at it impassively , acutely aware of being the stranger . He was sorry they had stopped playing . They played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music  --  the kind of music the exbumsand field laborers and factory workers who had tried to escape their barren lives by enlisting in the Army understood and always played . Prewitt picked up his cards and started to deal himself a new game when he heard the two guitar players walking back down the porch toward the stairs . " What the hell you think ? " part of Anderson 's indignant protest68came through the open door . " The best goddam bugler in the Regimentfor Chrisake ! " " Yeah , but he wouldnt . . . " Clark said perplexedly ; the rest was only a mumble as they passed beyond the door . Prewitt dropped his cards and threw the cigaret to the floor . He moved swiftly and caught them on the stairs . " Come back here , " he said . Anderson 's head , amputated by the floor level , turned to face him with consternation , a balloon in suspension . The ominous insistence made his legs carry him back up the stairs before his mind had decidedwhat to do . Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prewitt wasted no time on preliminaries . " I do nt want your goddamnedjob , " he said in a low white voice . " If I 'd wanted to bugle , I 'd of stayed right where I was . Its a cinch I wouldnt come here and cut you out of your stinkin little job . " Anderson shifted his feet evasively . " Well , " he said uneasily , withoutmeeting Prewitt 's eyes , " you 're good enough you could get my job any time you wanted . " " I know it , " Prewitt said . A white wall of anger descended over his eyes like the polar icecap descending over the globe . " But I never check a cinch into nobody  --  outside of a game . I do nt play that way , see ? If I wanted the goddam job , I wouldnt sneak in here and cutthroatyou out of it . " " Okay , " Anderson said placatingly . " Okay , Prew . Take it easy . " " Do nt call me Prew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes wide , looking from one to the other like the spectator at a wreck who watches a man bleed to death because he does nt know what he should do and fears making a fool of himself . Prewitt had meant to say that Holmes had offered him the job and he had turned it down , but some look in Anderson 's eyes touched his mind and made him hold it back . " Nobody likes to do straight duty , " Anderson said lamely ; you never could tell about a fireball like Prewitt . " I know I ai nt as good as you are when you played a Taps at Arlington . You could get my job easy , and it wouldnt be a square thing . " It ended up in the air as if unfinished . " I do nt want you to get down sick , " Prewitt said . " You can quit worrying about it now . " 69 " Well . . . thanks , Prew , " Anderson said painfully . " I do nt want you to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Go to hell , " Prewitt said . " And do nt call me Prew . I 'm Prewitt to you . " He turned on his heel and went back inside . He picked up his cigaret that was still burning on the cement floor and took a deep drag , listening to their slow steps on the stairs . With a sudden movement of bitterness he picked up some of the scattered cards and ripped them across . Then he threw them down on the bed . Unsatisfied , he picked up the rest of the deck and methodically tore each card in two . Might as well ; they were no good now anyway . A hell of a fine start ; as if he would try to rob them out of a stinking twobit job . He pulled his mouthpiece out of his pocket and sat , hefting it in his hand , running his thumb over the cup . It was a fine mouthpiece ; it was undoubtedly the best investment he ever made for thirty bucks of crap money . He wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get out of this screwedup rathole and go up to Haleiwa and see Violet . A lot of guys went around bragging about a shackjob here and a shackjob there . Very few of them were ever lucky enough to have one . They all talked about it , trying to convince each other and themselvesof the wonderful women they had  --  and then they went down to the Service Rooms or the New Congress and had their ashes hauled at three dollars a throw . Prewitt knew how lucky he was to have Violet to shack up with him . He sat on his bunk , angry and disgusted , waiting for chow , waiting for the weekend . On the way to the PX Clark kept looking at Anderson sideways . Several times he started to speak . " You dint have no call to think that , Andy , " he blurted out finally . " He 's a good joe . You can see he 's a good joe . " " I know it , goddam it , " Andy burst out . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good joe . " " Okay , " Clark said . " Okay . We 'll be late for chow . " " To hell with it , " Andy said . When the chow whistle blew Prew went down in the thronging crowd that stampeded for the messhall . They swarmed down the stairs and clustered on the porch before the door that would not admit them fast enough , looking like good material for a recruiting poster with their shining laughing faces and clean hands and fatigue blouses splashed with water , for unless you knew them or lookedclosely you did not see the black high-water mark around their wrists or the line of dust that ran down from their temples past their ears and on their necks . There was much goosing , grabbing of crotches and accusations of " You eat it ! " with the hooting laughter . But Prew was outside of all of it . Two or three men whose names he knew spoke to him soberly with great reserve and then turned back to share their laughter with the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was not a part of it . Amid the gnash and clash of cutlery on china and the humming conversation he ate in silence , feeling from time to time the many curious eyes inspecting him . After chow they wandered back upstairs by twos and threes , subduednow and with full bellies , the boisterousness caused by the prospect of an hour 's recess replaced now by the unpleasant prospect of Fatigue Call and working on full bellies . The scattered horseplay that broke out now died in infancy , bayoneted by the cynical glances of the others . Prew took his plate and got in the line to the kitchen , scraped his slops off in the muggy bucket , dropped his plate and cup into the hectic scrabbling KP 's sink where Maggio paused long enough to wink at him , and went back up to his bunk . He lit a cigaret and dropped the match into the coffee can he had hunted up to serve as ashtray and stretched out on the bunk with all the sounds around him . His arm behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming toward him . The huge Indian of full Choctaw blood , slow-spoken , slow-moving , level-eyed , dead-faced  --  except when in the midst of some athletic battleand then as swift as any panther  --  sat down on the bunk beside him , with a shy brief grin . They would have shaken hands , under these new circumstances , if it had not been a conventionalism that embarrassed both of them . The sight of Chief 's great slow bulk that exuded confidence and calm for a radius of twenty yards about him , wherever he might be , brought back to Prew all the mornings they had sat in Choy 's with Red and argued over breakfast . He looked at Chief wishing there was some way to communicate all the memories , to tell him how glad he was to be in his squad , without embarrassing both of them . All last fall , during the football season when Chief Choate was excused from drill , almost every morning , they had , with Red , had their breakfasts together in Choy 's restaurant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was excused from drill because7170it was football season . After he had got to know the bulky moonfacedChoctaw , he had gone religiously to every game and every meet the Indian participated in , which was almost every one , because Wayne Choate jockstrapped the whole year round . Football in the fall where Chief played guard and was the only player on the team who could stand a full sixty minutes of the Army 's brand of football ; in the winter it was basketball and Chief playing guard again , the third highest scorer in the Regiment ; and in the summer baseball , Chief playing , some said , the best first base in the whole of the Army ; and track in the spring , where Chief was always good for a 1st or and in the shotput and the javelin and worth a few more points in the dashes . In his youth before he had acquired a GI beer paunch Chief had set a record for the loo yards in the Philippine Department that still stood unbroken , but that had been some years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his four years in the Company , and if he had consented to fight for Holmes he would have been a Staff Sergeant in two weeks . No one knew why he did not transfer to some other company where he could better himself or why he did not fight for Holmes , because he did not talk about his reasons . Instead of bettering himself , he stayed in G Company , a perennial Corporal , and drank himself into a stupor every night in Choy 's on beer so that on an average of three times a week he had to have a five-man detail come and get him and cart him home in one of the steel-wheeled machinegun carts . He had a foot locker full of gold medals from PI , Panama , and Puerto Rico upon which he drew for beer money when he was broke , selling them or pawning them to various wouldbe athletes on the Post , and every time he moved on to a new post left a wastebasket full of athletic citations behind him . His fans and admirers all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night in Choy 's with his enormous gut drum-tight full of unbelievable amounts of beer . Prew watched him now , thinking wonderingly of all these things , and since he could not say the things he wanted to say , waiting for him to speak . " The Top says you 're put in my squad , " Chief said , in his solemn bearlike way . " So I figured I come over and give you the Story on the outfit . " " Okay , " Prew said . " Shoot ' em . " " Ike Galovitch is the platoon guide . " " I 've heard a little about him , " Prew said , " already . " 72 " You 'll hear more about him , " Chief said with slow solemnity . " He 's quite a character . He 's acting platoon sergeant now . Wilson is the regular platoon sergeant but he 's excused from drill durin fightin season . You wont see much of him till March . " " What kind of a guy is this Champ Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chief said slowly , " if you understand him . He never talks much , nor runs around with anybody . You ever see him fight ? " " Yeah , " Prew said . " He 's tough . " " If you seen him fight , you know as much about him as anybody does . He buddies around with Sgt Henderson who takes care of Holmes 's horses . They served together in Holmes 's company in Bliss . " " Way he fights , " Prew said , " looks like he 's got a mean streak in him . " Chief looked at him levelly . " Maybe he does , " he said . " If a man leaves him alone though , he ai nt no trouble . He do nt bother much with anybody , unless they argue with him , then he 's just as liable to pull his rank and turn them in as not . I 've seen him ride a couple guys right into the Stockade . " " Okay , " Prew said . " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here , " Chief said . " Galovitch takes all the responsibilities in this platoon . Even when Wilson 's here , Old Ike does all the work . The only thing you 're responsible to me for is I have to check your stuff for Sataday morning inspection , but Old Ike checks everybody himself anyway , after the Corporals turn in their report , so its the same thing . " " What do you do around here then ? " Prew grinned . " Nothin much . Old Ike does it all . There really ai nt no need for corporals in this Compny , because there really ai nt no squads . Everythngis by platoons , instead of squads . We fall out for drill by platoons , not squads . " " You mean we do nt have any squad roster at all ? No BAR men or rifle grenadiers ? We just fall out anyway ? " " Thats right , " Chief said slowly . " Oh , we got them , on the books . But when we fall out the corporals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just falls in any way . " " Hell , " Prew said . " What kind of soldierin is that ? Back at Myer we 'd line up everybody in his proper position in each squad . " " This heres the Pineapple Army , " Chief said . " I do nt know whether I like that or not , " Prew said . " I dint figure you would , " Chief said . " But thats the way she is. 73Old Ike ought to be around pretty soon , to inspect you , and tell you what your duties is . The only time a corporal really has charge of his men here is in the morning when his squad is on latrine police , but Old Ike is always there to check it anyway . " " This Galovitch must be quite a guy . " Chief pulled a sack of Durham from the pocket of his shirt and dropped his eyes to it . " He is , " he said . He rolled a cigaret very delicatelywith his sausage fingers . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler orderly . Took care of the boilers in the winter . I think maybe he had a Pfc . " He lit the brown thin lumpy cigaret and dropped the match in Prew 's can , took several drags . But he did not look at Prew , instead he watched the exhaled smoke blandly . " Old Ike is our Close Order expert . On the Drill Schedule we got an hour 's Close Order every morning . Galovitch always gives it . " The rolled cigaret burned down quickly and Chief dropped it in the can , still not looking up . " Okay , " Prew said . " What is it ? Whats eatin on you ? " " Who ? me ? " Chief said . " Why , nothin . I was just wonderin if you aimed to start trainin now , this late in the season , or if you meant to wait till summer and be eligible for Company Smokers . " " Neither one , " Prew said . " I ai nt doin any fightin . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You think I 'm crazy , hunh ? " Prew said . " No , " the other said . " I guess not . It kind of surprised me though , when I heard you 'd quit the Bugle Corps , a man who plays a bugle the way you do . " " Well , " Prew said savagely , " I quit it . And I ai nt sorry . And I ai nt doin no fightin . And I ai nt sorry about that either . " " Then I guess you ai nt got nothin to worry about , have you ? " Chief said . " Not a goddam thing . " Chief stood up and moved over to the bunk next to Prewitt 's . " I think thats Galovitch comin now . I figured he 'd be along . " Prew raised his head to look . " Say , Chief . Is this guy Maggio in whose squad , anyway ? The little Wop . " " Mine , " Chief said . " Why ? " " I just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's in your squad . " " He 's a good boy . He 's only out of recruit drill a month , and he messes up and catches all the extra details , but he 's a good boy . He'sgot a plenty big sense of humor for such a little guy , keeps everybody laughin all the time . " Galovitch was walking toward them down the aisle . Prew watched him and was astounded . He came on between the bunks , bigfooted , bentkneed , bobbing his trunk and head with every step as if he carried a safe upon his back . His long arms reached awkwardly almost to his knees so that he resembled an ape balancing on his knuckles as he walked , and his small head covered with a cropped brush whose widow 's peak came almost to his eyebrows , the tiny closeset ears and long lippy jaw carried out the similarity . He would have been truly apelike , Prew thought , had not the insignificance of his deepset eyes and his scrawny neck made him ineffectual as a monkey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thats him , " Chief said , a twinkle gleaming faintly from the depth of his slow solemnity . " Wait 'll you hear him talk . " The apparition stopped before them , at the foot of Prewitt 's bed . Old Ike stood looking at them , the red eyes set in a well of wrinkles , and worked his loose-hung lips in and out ruminatingly , like a toothlessman . " Prewitt ? " Galovitch said . " Thats me . " " Sargint Galovitch , platoon guide am I of dis platoon , " he said , proudly . " When assigned to dis platoon you are , you become under me . Consequental one a my men . Am coming to give for you the lowdown setup . " He paused and rested his knobby hams of hands on the bed end and pulled his chin in and worked his lips in inexpressively and stared at Prew . Prew turned to look at Chief to show his wonderment , but the Indian had lain down on the bunk , his big legs dangling over the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the pillow . He was suddenly outside of all of this , disclaiming all participation . " Don ' look to him , " Galovitch commanded . " To you talking it is me not him . He is only corporal . Sargint Vilsahn is platoon sargint and it is for him say to you anything I do not say if for you to do . " When in the morning you get up the first thing is the bunk to make . With no wrinkles and the extra blanket on the pillow tucked in . I inspect in the platoon every bunks and ones not made up right tear up and the man make up again . " I am not expecting to be any goldbricks , see ? This squad detail every day to clean over the Dayroom the outside porch . After you74 75clean up under you own bunk you get the mops help the porch . " No man this platoon from fatigue or drill be taking off without I find him gets plenty extra duty . " The little red eyes glared at Prew challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike to prove his loyalty to Holmes , Wilson , the Company , and the cause , which might be Better Soldiering ; Peacetime Preparedness ; or the Perpetuation of An Aristocracy . Nobody could have named the Cause , but then its name was unimportant , as long as the Cause itself remained to levy loyalty . " And don ' think , " Old Ike went on , " can come over here a fighter everybody beating up on just because are tough guy . Quickest way to Stockade is who tough guy pulls . " And now is Fatigue Call five minute you fall out for him , " Old Ike concluded , glaring at Prew shortly , looking accusingly at Choate lying back relaxing . Then he clumped back to his own bunk where he took up again his interrupted litany to his unknown god by picking up the shoes he had been shining . After he was gone , Chief Choate heaved his bulk upright , making the chain springs on the bunk squeak in protest . " You kin gather what his Close Order Drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Prew said . " I can . Is the rest of the outfit as bad as that ? " " Well , " Chief said solemnly , " not in the same way as that . " Herolled himself another cigaret slowly and with great care . " I guess he 's found out that you ai nt goin to fight for Holmes , " Chief said with slow solemnity . " How could he have found it out ? So soon . " Chief Choate shrugged . " Its hard to say , " he said unmoved to exaggeration . " But I think he has . If he hant , knowing you was a fighter come to this outfit , he would have offered you the Compny on a silver platter and sucked your ass from here to Wheeler Field . " Prcw laughed but Chief 's round solemn face betrayed no hint of humor , or of any other feeling . He only looked a little surprised to find there was cause for laughter , which made Prew laugh the harder . " Well , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that figured out , you got any more instructions for me before I take the oath and begin me consecrated life ? " " Not much else , " Chief said solemnly . " No bottles in the bottoms of the footlockers . The Old Man does nt like his men to drink and inspects for them every Sataday , and unless I take them first he takes them . " 76Prew grinned . " Maybe I 'd better get a notebook and make a note of that . " " Also , " Chief said slowly , " no women in the barricks after ten o'clock . Unless they 're white . All the others , yellow black and brown , I got to turn in to the Orderly Room , where Holmes gives me a receipt and turns them over to the Great White Father . " He looked at Prew solemnly as the other pretended to write a note down on his cuff . " What else ? " he said . " Thats all , " Chief said . Grinning at the Chief , Prew thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ; it was the third time he 'd thought about her since this morning , but strangely , this time the thought did not hurt , and he could think about her freely , believingalmost for a minute that there were lovely women standing on each corner , waiting for him to pick them up and be their lover , give them what they wanted , even though he knew it was not so . The warmth of Chief Choate 's slow deadpan friendship had filled an empty spot inside him . Downstairs the whistle blew , and simultaneously the guard bugler began to blow Fatigue Call in the quad , and he could even listen to the call objectively . It was , he decided , very badly played , not near as good as he could have played it for them . " Its time for you to fall out , " Chief said solemnly , heaving his great bulk up from the bunk . " I think I 'll go take a nap and get a little sacktime . " " What a prick ! " Prew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at four , " Chief said , " I 'll hit Choy 's a lick and find out how the beer holds out . This is my training season . " Prew started , laughing , down the aisle , then turned back toward the Indian . " I sure guess them breakfast conversations are all through , " he said , and was suddenly embarrassed at what he should not have said . " What ? " Chief said , inexpressively . " Oh , them . Yeah , I guess they are . " He turned quickly , went on toward his bunk . CHAPTER 8THERE is , in the Army , a little known but very important activity appropriately called Fatigue . Fatigue , in the Army , is the very neces-77sary cleaning and repairing of the aftermath of living . Any man who ever owned a gun has known Fatigue , when , after fifteen minutes in the woods and perhaps three shots at an elusive squirrel , he has gone home to spend three-quarters of an hour cleaning up his piece so it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who has ever cooked a luscious meal and ladled it out in plates upon the table has known Fatigue , when , after the glorious meal is eaten , she repairs to the kitchen to wash the congealed gravy from the plates and the slick grease from the cooking pots so they will be ready to be used this evening , dirtied , and so washed again . It is the knowledge of the unendingness and of the repetitious uselessness , the do it up so it can be done again , that makes Fatigue fatigue . And any man who shoots his gun at squirrels and then gives it to his young son with orders to clean , any woman who cooks the succulentmeal and gives the dishes to her non-cooking daughter to be washed  --  those grownups know the way an officer feels about Fatigue . The son and daughter can understand the way an enlisted man feels about Fatigue . Fatigue , in the Army , occupies fifty percent of the duty time ; in the morning there is drill , in the afternoon Fatigue ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pretty posters outside every Post Office in the nation that are constantly extollingthe romance of a soldier 's life , the chance for adventurous foreign travel ( take the wife ) , the exceedingly high pay all unattached ( if you get the rating ) , the chance to be a leader ( if you get the commission ) , and the golden merits of learning a trade that will supportyou all your life . A recruit never finds out about Fatigue until some time after he has held up his right hand and then it is too late . Most of the details are not too bad , they are only fatiguing , For there is the justification that they are necessary . If there is to be baseball , some one must spread the horse manure on the diamond so the infieldwill be grassy , and no one could expect that the players do it , since they do the playing . But in addition to the necessary details that are only fatiguing there are other details , in a Regiment of Infantry , that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romantic about the cavalry when you have to curry your own horse , and it is hard to be Adventurous about the uniform when you have to polish your own boots . And this explainswhy officers , who are above such menial tasks , are capable of such exciting memoirs of war . A man may be bored with scrubbing his own cartridge belt after every sashay in the field but he is notdisillusioned ; but when he goes every afternoon to the Married Officers ' Quarters to manicure the lawns , wash the windows , sweep the yards , and clean the streets , he is not only disillusioned but degraded ; he has really known Fatigue . After every party at the Club there must be some loyal and patriotic soul who empties out the ashtrays and wipes up the liquor . But these were not all . There was an even greater test of patriotism . There was the trash collecting detail . Once every twelve days in its rounds of the battalions this chance for heroism fell to every Company , and the three-man picked detail sortied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from garbage which the Kanaka garbage truck collected , from the Married Officers ' Quarters . In itself this would not seem very patriotic ; but the officers ' wives , having no incinerators , fearing to clog the soil pipes , and not wanting to use the garbage truck whose collector was a civilian and could quit , deposited their used menstruation pads in their trash cans . Emptying a single can so used can be very patriotic , but by the end of an afternoon when the truck was full the patriotism required of the detail was immense . They deserved at least a D.S.C . as , walking the two miles to the dump instead of riding in the back , knowing what their best friend would not tell them , they trudged doggedly through the aura of bad fish that clung to them all . Even the insensitive stomachs of the most patriotic and most commonsoldiers were inclined to rebel . And the most rebellious of those stomachs , since Warden ran the details for G Company , was invariablyPrewitt 's . It became increasingly clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the head of the double line of the Fatigue formation , Warden would happen to call out one of the more patriotic details . One of these was the butcher shop detail . The butcher shop in addition to its market for the wives supplied the meat for all the individual companies . The butchers , enlisted men on Special Duty , did not mind the more delicate work of cutting steaks and chops , but they applied for Fatigue details to do the heavier slimier work of unloadingand moving the sides around . Prew 's neat tailormade blue fatigues would be stiff with blood and muck after an afternoon of this . It would be on his face and in his ears and in his hair , and the rancid smell of the butcher shop would waft about him as he walked . Warden would be standing in the corridor doorway as he came in , 78 79his sleeves rolled up two turns , smoothly cool and clean after a refreshingshower , and grinning fondly . " Better hurry up and wash , " he 'd say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for fifteen minutes . Or maybe , " he would grin , " you 'd rather go in like you are and wash up later . " " No , " Prew would tell him seriously . " I think I 'll wash first . " " Still the dude , ' ey ? " Warden would grin at him . " Suit yourself . " One day Warden asked him if he shouldnt maybe go out for fighting , or maybe baseball . " You look awful tard , kid , " he grinned . " If you was a jockstrap you wouldnt have to pull Fatigue . " " What makes you think I mind it ? " " I did nt say you did nt like it , kid . " Warden said complacently . " All I said was you looked tard . Drawn to a fine edge . " " If you think you can push me into fightin , Warden , " Prew told him grimly , " you are wrong . I can take everything you hand out . You and Dynamite together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did nt have them stripes , I 'd take your big hulk out on the green and beat it to a pulp . And if I couldnt do it with my fists , I 'd git me a knife and look you up downtown some night in River Street . " " Do nt let the stripes worry you , kid , " Warden grinned . " I can alwaystake my shirt off . Take it off right now . " " You 'd like that , wouldnt you ? " Prew grinned back . " You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one , couldnt you ? " He turned to go upstairs . " What makes you think Holmes has got anything to do with this , kid ? " Warden called after him . And there were other minor inconveniences . He had meant to use his first weekend in G Company to go to Haleiwa for the showdown with his shackjob , but all the first week he had been a victim of The Warden 's Duty Roster , as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And The Warden utilized his advantage relentlessly . As the week went by and he did not see his name on any KP list , his soldier 's intuition began to whisper warnings . On Friday when the details for the weekend were posted on the bulletin board the suspicion became fact . Warden had saved his KP back to give him on the weekend . But Warden was even cleverer than he had suspected . Prew was on KP Sunday , and on Saturday he was Room Orderly . There would not even be one day off to go to Haleiwa . There was a diabolical finesse in this arrangement , too . A Saturday KP got out of standing Saturday Inspection , but the RO had to stand Inspection like everybody else , in addition to his extra work . Warden80was a smart man , no doubt of that ; when he held the cards nobody could beat Him at the way he played the hand . Early Saturday morning Warden came out of the Orderly Room , all spruced up for inspection , to watch Prewitt manicure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Prew worked on grudgingly and ignored him . He occupied himself with wondering whether Holmes had engineered this deal because he would not fight , to force him into going out , or whether it was Warden 's own idea for some ungodly reason just because he did not like him . Sunday Warden came into the kitchen for breakfast around eleven . He was the topkicker and he did not have to eat on schedule like the rest of them . Warden had hotcakes and eggs and sausage ; the Company had had hotcakes and bacon , such as it was with Preem sleeping off a hard night in his sack . Warden leaned against the aluminum pastry table with its big utensil rack above it and ate his food with relish , in full view of the sweating KPs . Then he strolled over to the KP room past the huge built-in icebox . " Well , well , " he said straight-faced , leaning leisurely against the jamb . " If it ai nt my young friend , Prewitt . How do you like straight duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The cooks and other KPs all were watching , because The Warden almost never spent a weekend on the Post . They were expecting something big . " I like it , Top , " Prew grinned , trying to make the grin convincing , looking up from the steaming sink he was bent over , naked to the waist , his dungarees and shoes soaked with sweat and soapy water . " Thats why I transferred , " he said seriously . " Its a great life , this . I find a pearl , I 'll cut you in . Fifty-fifty . If it had nt of been for you , I wouldnt of had no chance to find it . " " Well , well , " The Warden said , laughing pleasantly . " Well , well . Thats a friend for you . Thats an honest man . Dynamite had his Preem and Galovitch in Bliss ; I had my Prewitt in A Compny . When men have served together , they 'll do anything for each other . I 'll see if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it so much , Prewitt . " He grinned down at the other , his brows hooked up his forehead . Prew always remembered it , later , as having been a look of secret understanding , a glance that swept the cooks , KPs , and kitchen , everything aside , leaving only the two pairs of eyes that recognized each other . He put his hand comfortably around a mug , heavy , handleless , at the bottom of the sink and waited for Warden to go on . But it was81almost as if The Warden saw his hand around the mug beneath the water , for he grinned lovingly again and walked away , leaving Prew standing there absurdly with his daredevilish romantic picture of himselfrising with the cup in murderous triumph . But , in spite of Warden 's threat , his name did not come up on the Daily Details sheet again . His second weekend he was free to go to Haleiwa . It was the same curious fact he had noted so many times before , in A Company ; Warden was scrupulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overstepped his own private , self-constructed line of equity . He should , he knew , have written Violet a letter , once during the middle of the second week he even thought about it for a minute . But he did not do it . Letters , like long-distance phone calls , could never convince him of the existence of another human far away existingin this same present he existed in . In reality , Violet did not exist until he saw her , then she began again where she had left off before . In-between she existed only in his mind , and how can you write a letter to your own imagination ? He could remember , as a small boy , watching his mother write frequent long letters to different relatives and friends , some of whom he had never seen . It was his mother 's hobby , but even then it had seemed strange to him , in the town of Harlan Kentucky , to write letters to other towns , to people she had not seen for years and probablywould never see again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cave-in in the mine and be dead before the answers came . After his mother died that winter of the strike , six letters had come addressed to her . He looked at her name on all the envelopes , the name of her who was already dead still existing on the paper , and then he opened them and read them curiously , and not a one of them had mentioned the fact that she had died . He had thrown them in the stove and burned them . There was a time lag there that seemed to exist in space instead of time , and he could never , after that , account for it . So he did not write to Violet , because the writing of letters did not have a true connection with the realities of death , and moving on , and eating . He waited till he could get free and went to see her . She was waiting for him at the door , leaning against the jamb and looking out through the screen , one hand propped against the other jamb as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that no matter what time of day or night he walked up the macadam road82from the highway intersection , she was always waiting in that same position , as if he had just phoned and she was watching for him . It was uncanny , as if she always knew when he was coming . But it was no more strange than anything else connected with her . He had never pretended to understand her since the first time he met her at Kahuku and took her to the carnival and , knowing carnivalswhich are the same in any portion of the earth , found that Violet was still a virgin . That in itself surprised him , and he did not get a chance to recover from it from then on . Violet Ogure . Oh-goo-rdee . You pronounced the r like a drunken d . Even the name was strange and unpredictable . The strangeness of a foreign land is understandable , because you expect it when you go among foreigners , you 're even looking for it . But the equation of the simple first name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other second and third generation Japanese , Chinese , Hawaiian , Portagee , Filipino girls with their first names after English flowers and their last names coming across alien centuries , girls whose parents had been shipped in like cattle to work the cane and pineapple for the Big Five , girls whose sons were often among the numberless hoards of little boys shining your shoes on the sidewalk outside a bar , repeating the antique legend : " Me half Japanee , half Schofield , " or , grinning obliquely , " Me half Chinee , half Schofield . " A crop fathered by soldiers who had served their hitch and mysteriously vanished into that mythical " Mainland " that was the United States . Violet was an ambivalent mingling of the intensely familiar and the inscrutably alien ; she was like the city of Honolulu with its highpowered , missionary-owned bank buildings and its shanty Japaneelanguagemovie just off Aala Park , a polygenetic blend nobody , least of all Violet , could encompass . He had learned to pronounce her name correctly , and that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken-defiled front yard and she came out on the homemade leanto porch . He took her hand and helped her down the three rotting steps and they went around to the back , a ritual they repeated every time he came , because in the time he had been coming there he had never been invited or allowed in their front room . The back porch was three times as large as the leanto on the front , unscreened , and with a network of vines from floor to roof that made it a secluded cave , almost another room , that was the living room of the Ogure family. 83And behind the house was the chicken coop , a miniature of its shanty self , where conceited hens stalked complacently about peering beadily this way and that , crooning their smug song of the Sacred Vessel , and squirting their droppings in the grass with the righteousnessof saints . The sour odor of their house and clan pervaded the whole place . And forever after the smell of chickens brought to Prew 's mind a vivid picture of Violet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetually cluttered . The covers on the peeling gilt iron bed were always rumpled , and clothes were always draped across the bedfoot and the single chair . There was spilled powder on the homemade dresser , but in one corner there was a closet , made of two by fours for frame and hung with a lushly green and riotously flowered material made especially for Hawaii . Violet had fixed it up herself , to carry all the heavy hope of someday something better . Prew stripped off his gook shirt and slacks and , naked , hunted through the clutter for his trunks , moving with the ease of long association . The clutter did not bother him ; kicking shoes aside and tossingclothes from chair to bed , he was more at home in this flimsy shack than Violet was . The cluster of shacks , growing up the hills on both sides of the road , might have been his home in Harlan , except for the absence of the soot and coaldust . The back porch with its rusty pump , the chipped sink with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric of his life , and he moved through the thick air of this poverty with the ease that only a man who has been intimate with it can have . And as he hunted for the trunks he told her all about the transfer , why he had been so long in coming . " Why did you transfer , though , Bobbie ? " Violet asked him in the clipped twittering voice that always made him chuckle . She sat on the bed and watched him exchange his shoes and socks for the old canvas fishing sneaks . The bright air slipped in from the outside through the single window that was like an afterthought , and it washed against the dimness and the funky smell of stale bedclothes . It touched his body coolly and he looked at Violet in her shorts and halter , feeling the old wild surge harden his belly and bring sweat to his palms . " What ? " he said vacantly . " Oh . I did nt transfer . I was transferred . It was Houston did it , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Theres nobody home , Lets you and me take84one ? " Three weeks , feeling the blood behind his eyes , almost a month , it was too long to wait . " Wait , " she said . " Couldnt you have gone to the officer and asked to stay ? " " Thats right . " Prew jerked his head in a nervous nod , thinking the Army made you need it more , made you hungrier . " I could have . But I couldnt . I couldnt be a brown noser . " " Well , " Violet said . " Yes . But I would think an argument could be patched up , " she said . " I mean when you had a good job you wanted to keep . " " It could of been , " he said . " But I do nt want any job that bad . Do nt you see ? There wasnt nothin else to do . Listen , " he said . " Come here . Come over here . " " Not now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost curiously , looking in his face . " It seems a shame to lose such a good job , and lose your rating . " " It is a shame , " he said . To hell with it , he thought . " Is there any liquor left around this place ? " " Theres still part of that quart you brought last time , " she said . " I havent touched it ; it was yours , " she got up proudly . " Its in the kitchen . And I think theres another one , unbroken , you brought a long time ago . You want a drink ? " " Yes , " he said and followed her into the kitchen . " You see , " he explained carefully , " I wont get to come up to see you near as often as I use to now . Also , I 'll only be makin twenty-one a month , so I cant give the dough I did , either . " Violet nodded . Inscrutably , she did not seem impressed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride a while , there was no use to spoil it now . " Lets go up to the place on the hill , " he said . " To our place , " he added intimately , and was ashamed because he felt now that he was pleading . Being without any for so long could eat into a man , and the blood was pumping through him richer now , and thicker . " All right , " she said . The door to the cupboard had no glass in it , but she opened it anyway , to reach for the bottle inside , the absence of the glass embarrassing her . While her arms were up Prew cupped his hands over her breasts from behind her . Violet jerked her arms down irritably and then he spun her , pinning her arms to her sides , and kissed her , she holding the bottle in one hand . In her bare feet she was not quite as tall as he was . They climbed up through the matted dry grass , Prew carrying the85bottle , the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little clump of trees they lay down in the matted green and brown of the dead and living grass . They looked almost straight down at the house . " Its pretty , isnt it , " Prew said . " No , " disagreed Violet . " Its ugly . Horrible ugly . " The cluster of shacks lay spread out below them , a nameless communitynot on the tourists ' maps , looking as if the first strong wind would blow them over . They were , on top of the hill , at the top of a great U where they could look down at the houses curved across the bottom or look straight across at the field of green cane on the other side . " I lived in a place just like this when I was a kid , " Prew said . " Exceptit was lots bigger . But it was the same , " thinking of all the lost forgotten memories that came back now , carrying so much life and emotion , crowding in your mind , and that you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sadness at the loss of them , and at their lack of meaning , came over him . " Did you like it ? " Violet asked . " No , " he said . " I dint . But I 've lived in a hell of a lot worse places since . " He rolled over on his back and watched the sun flickering down through the leaves of the trees . He felt the Saturday afternoon on-pass feeling come down and sweep over him , like leaves do in the fall , back home . Life does not begin again till Monday morning , it whispered . If only all of life could be like this , he whispered . If only all of life could be a three-day pass . That was a pipedream , Prewitt . He took a drink from the bottle and handed it to Violet . She drank , propped on her elbows , staring down at the houses . She drank the straight whiskey the same way he did , as if it were only water . " Its terrible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should ever have to live in place like this . My Poppa and Momma come here from Hokkaido . Not even this house is theirs . " She handed back the bottle to him and he caught her arm and pulled her over . He kissed her , and for the first time she returned it , putting her hand on his cheek . " Bobbie , " she said . " Bobbie . " " Come on , " he said , turning . " Come here . " But Violet held back , looking at her cheap wrist watch . " Momma and Poppa will be home any time . " Prew sat up in the grass . " What difference does it make ? " he said irritably . " They wont come up here . ' ' " Its not that , Bobbie . Wait till tonight . At night is the time for that . " " No , " he said . " Any times the time for that . If you feel like it . " " Thats just it , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll be coming home . " " But they know we sleep in the same bed at night . " " You know how I feel about Momma and Poppa , " Violet said . " Yes , but they know it , " he said . Then he wondered suddenly if they did . " They must know it ? " " Its different in the afternoon . They 're not home from work yet . And you 're a soldier . " She stopped and reached for the bottle on the grass . " I graduated from Leilehua High School , " she stated . You never completed the seventh grade , he told himself . He had seen Leilehua High School in Wahiawa . It was only another high school . " So what if I am a soljer ? " he said . " Whats wrong with a goddam soljer ? Theres nothin wrong with a soljer , that isnt wrong with anybody else . " " I know it , " Violet said . " Soljers are only people , just like everybody else , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But you do nt understand . So many Nisei girls go out with the soldiers . " " So what ? " he said , remembering the song . Manuelo Boy , my dear boy , no more hila-hila , sister go with a soldier boy , come home any old time . " All the soldiers want to screw them , " Violet said . " Well , they go out with civilians , too . Thats what they want . Whats wrong with that ? " " Nothings wrong with it , " she said . " But a wahine girl must be careful . A respectable Nisei girl does nt go with soldiers . " " Neither does a respectable white girl , " Prew said , " or any other kind of girl . But they 're no different than the goddam Pfcs . They all want the same goddam thing . " " I know it , " Violet said . " Do nt get mad . Its just the way the people look at the soldiers . " " Then whynt your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something ? If they do nt like it . " Violet was surprised . " But they would never do that . " " But , hell . All the neighbors see me comin here all the time . " " Yes , but they would never mention it either . " 86 87Prewitt looked over at her lying on her back in the dappled sunlight , and the short tight legs of her shorts . " How would you like to move out of here ? " he asked carefully . " I 'd love it . " " Well , " he probed , " you may get a chance to soon . " " Except , " Violet said , " that I wont shack up with you . You know I cant do that . " " We 're shacked up now , " he said . " The only thing different from all the other shackjobs is that you 're livin with your folks . " " It makes all the difference , " Violet said . " Theres no use to talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thats right , " Prew said . Life did not begin till Monday morning . It could wait till tomorrow . He rolled over on his back and lay staring up into the incredible blue of the Hawaiian sky . " Look off to the west , " he said . " Theres a storm blowing up in the west . Look at the cloud bank . " " The clouds are beautiful , " Violet said . " So black . And piling higher and higher one on top of the other , like a cliff wall . " " Thats a line squall , " Prewitt said . " Thats the first beginning of the rainy season . " " Our roof leaks , " Violet said . She reached for the bottle . Prew was watching the racking mass of clouds . " But whynt your folks kick you out . If its like that . Bringing me here , " he asked . Violet looked surprised . " But I 'm their daughter , " she said to him . " Oh , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . It 'll rain pretty soon . " The rainstorm came up quickly after it had hurdled the mountains . By suppertime it was raining hard . Prew sat out on the back porch alone while Violet helped her mother fix the meal . Her father sat in the front room , by himself . The old folks , that was the way he always thought of them , had come home before the rain , chattering Japanese back at the crowded Model T that let them off and then clattered on down the road to the next house . Five families owned the Ford together , just as the whole community had built and owned the miles of water sluices of weathered wood that stuck up all along the little valley like scaffoldingthat had been used to make the mountains before the dawn of history . They had rushed through the house to the back porch where Prew and Violet were sitting , and on out to hoe their tidy truck patch that the water sluices emptied into , before the rainstorm came. 88Prew watched them , stooped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dried and withered apples and he felt a selfrighteousindignation at the entire human race for the life these people lived , these who looked to be Violet 's grandparents or greatgrandparents , and yet were not yet forty years of age . Their garden , laid out in immaculate little squares and triangles , utilizing every inch of ground , of radishes and cabbages and lettuce and taro and a little underwater rice patch , plus a half a dozen foreign vegetables , was their life ; and it showed the industry that was in them . They worked on in it until the rain began to fall before they stopped and put their hoes away . When they came up on the porch , they neither one spoke to Prew or seemed to know that he was there . Sitting on the porch alone , listening to them fixing supper , he felt again the indignation he had felt before , the sense of loss and the aloneness , the utter defenselessness that was each man 's lot , sealed up in his bee cell from all the others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork reached him from the inside , the alonenessleft him for a while . The warm moist smell promised other people lived and were preparing supper . He listened to the pouring and the thunder rumblings that sounded hollow like they were in a rainbarrel , shared the excitement and the coziness of the buzzing insects that had sought refuge on the porch , and now and then he slapped detachedly at the mosquitoes , making a sharp crack in the pouring buzzing silence . The porch sheltered him from all but the splashes of the drops that hit the floor and their spray touched him with a pleasant chill . And he was secure , because somewhere out beyond the wall of water humanity still existed , and was preparing supper . Violet called him and he went in , feeling the Army and the strange wild eyes of Warden were very far away , that Monday morning was a bad dream , an age-old racial memory , as cold as the moon and as far away , and sat before the steaming plate of flat-tasting foreign vegetables and chunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished eating , the old man and woman stacked their plates in the sink and padded silently , without a word , into the front room where the garish little altars were , where Prew had never been invited . They had not said a word all through the meal , but he had learned long ago not to try to talk to them . He and Violet sat silently on in the kitchen drinking the aromatic tea , listening to the wind buffet the shack and the rain drumming its nails deafen-89ingly upon the tin corrugated roof . Then he , like Violet , stacked his dishes in the old chipped sink , feeling completely at home here and tiontent . The one thing he lacked was a cup of coffee . When they went into her bedroom , Violet unconcernedly left the door wide open although they could see directly into the lighted front room . He could see the flickering light reflecting from her gold body as she turned matter-of-factly to him . The matter-of-factnessgave him pleasure , a sense of long-lifedness and continuance that a soldier seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him afraid he would be seen , shamed him with his own desire . He woke once in the middle of the night . The storm was gone and the moon shown in brightly through the open window . Violet lay with her back to him , head pillowed on bent elbow . From the stiffness of her body he knew she was not sleeping , and he put his hand on her naked hip and turned her toward him . In the deep curve of her hip and the indented juncture of ball and socket underneaththere was an infinite workmanship of jewel-like precision that awed him , and called up in him an understanding that was like a purge and awakened liquid golden flecks within his eyes . She rolled willingly , unsleepily , and he wondered what she had been thinking of , lying there awake . As he moved over her , he realized again that he did not know her face or name , that here in this act that brings two human fantasies as close as they can ever come , so close that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , nor she him , nor could they touch each other . To a man who lives his life among the flat hairy angularities of other men , all women are round and soft , and all are inscrutable and strange . The thought passed quickly . He awoke in the morning on his back , uncovered . The door was still open , and Violet and her mother were moving around in the kitchen . He smothered an impulse to grab up the covers over his nakedness and rose and donned his trunks , feeling deeply shamed , embarrassed by his own pendulous existence which all women hated . The o1 ( 1 woman took no notice of him when he entered the kitchen . After the morning cleaning was done and the old people had padded silently away to visit neighbors , Prew thought the whole thing over and finally , characteristically , just came out with it . " I want you to move to Wahiawa and shack up with me , " he said bluntly . Violet sat in her chair on the porch , half-turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a half closed fist . " Why , Bobbie ? " She continued to stare at him curiously , the same curiosity with which she always watched him , as if seeing for the first time the subtle mechanism from which she got her pleasure , and that she had always thought was simple . " You know I cant do that . Why make a showdown of it ? " " Because I wont be able to come up here any more , " he said , " like I used to . Before I transferred . If we lived in Wahiawa , I 'd come home every night . " " What is wrong with living this way ? " she asked him , in the same odd tone . " 1 do nt mind if you only come up on weekends . You do nt have to come every night like you used to do , before you transferred . " " Weekends ai nt enough , " he said . " At least not for me . " " If you break off with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that often , will you ? You wont find any woman who will shack up with a private who makes twenty-one dollars . " " I do nt like being around your folks , " Prew said , " they bother me ; they do nt like me . If we 're goin to be shacked up , we might as well be shacked up . Instead of this half way stuff . Thats the way it is . " He said it flatly , like a man enumerating the faults and values of a new spring coat . " I 'd have to quit ' my job . I 'd have to get another job in Wahiawa . That might be hard , unless I took a job as waitress in a bar , and I cant do that . " I quit my job in Kahuku , " she said indifferently , " and left a nice home where I was one of the family  --  to come back here to this rotten place  --  against my parents wishes that I not leave my higher position . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up every night . I did it because you asked me to . " " I know you did , " he said , " I know you did . But I did nt know it would be like this . " " What did you expect ? " she said . " You do nt make enough to pay for shacking up , Bobbie . " " I did . I 've got almost a full month 's pay as a First-Fourth coming , " he said carefully . " It 'll be enough to get us set up for a month , until you get a job and I get some more dough . With your job and my twenty-one bucks we can live better than you 're livin here . And you do nt like it here . Theres no reason for you not to go . " He stopped talking , long enough to get his breath , surprised at how fast he had been talking. 90 91 " You did nt believe me , did you ? " Violet said , " when I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showdown . You cant force me , Bobbie . Momma and Poppa would not like it , they wouldnt let me go . " " Why wouldnt they like it ? " he said , trying to keep his voice from going faster . " Because I 'm a soljer . Do you care whether I 'm a soljer or not ? If you do , why the hell did you go with me in the first place ? why did you let me come here ? They cant keep you by not wanting you to go . How can they keep you ? " " They would be disgraced , " Violet said . " Oh , balls ! " Prew said , letting loose the rein . " If I was a gook beachboy instead of a soljer it 'd be all right though . " This was what he knew it would come down to . They 'd live like cattle , worse than Harlan miners , but they 'd be disgraced if their daughter shacked up with a soldier . They 'd let the Big Five shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disgraceful . That wasnt soldiers . The poor , he thought , they are always their own worst enemy . " Its not as if we were married , " she said softly . " Married ! " Prew was dumbfounded . The picture of Dhom , the G Company duty sergeant , bald and massive and harassed , crossed his eyes , trailed by his fat sloppy Filipino wife and seven half-caste brats ; no wonder Dhom was a bully , condemned to spend his life in foreign service , like an exile because he had a Filipino wife . Violet smiled at his consternation . " You see ? You do nt want to marry me . Look at my side . Some day you will go back to the Mainland . Will you take me with you ? You want me to leave my people , and then be left without them or you either ? And maybe with a baby ? " " Would your folks like it if you married me ? " " No , but they would like it better than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be disgraced , " Prew said wryly . " Would you go if I married you ? " " Of course . It would be different then . When you went to the MainlandI would go with you . I would be your wife . " My wife , he thought . Well , why do nt you do it ? There was a rising desire in him to do it . Wait a minute , kid . Thats the way they all feel , all the men who finally get married . Like Dhom felt . On one side they see their freedom , and on the other they see a piece of ass right there where they can always get it , without all the bushwhacking buildup , always there handy to be reached , without the months of preparation , or the sluts that are the other alternative . What do you want ? " If I married you and took you with me , " he said cautiously , " there would be no difference . We would both be outcasts . Nobody in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married to you wouldnt mean I 'd have to take you with me . Being married means nothing , to most people it means less than nothing . I know . " Like Dhom , he thought , who married for his piece of ass and after he was hooked she suddenly did nt want to give it to him any more . " But you still do nt want to marry me , " Violet said . " You goddam right I do nt , " he said , his voice rising under the sting and guilt of the truth of what she said . " If I was gon na spend my life in Wahoo it would be different . I 'll be movin all over , goin all the time . I 'm a thirty year man . And I ai nt no officer to have the govmint pay for transportin my lovin wife all over the goddam world . As a private , I wouldnt even get subsistence for you . A guy like me ai nt got no business bein married . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Why not go on like we are ? " " Because , " he said . " Because once a week just ai nt enough . " Theres a war comin in this country . I want to be in on it . I do nt want to be held down by nothin that will keep me out of it . Because I am a soljer . " Violet had lain back in her chair and rested her head against the back , her hands dangling , dangling over the ends of the arms of it . She kept on looking at him , curiously , across the chair back . " Well , " she said . " You see ? " Prew stood up and stepped toward her . " Why in hell would I marry you ? " he shot down at her . " Have a raft of snot-nosed nigger brats ? Be a goddam squawman and work in the goddam pineapple fields the rest of my life ? or drive a Schofield taxi ? Why the hell do you think I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat my heart and pride out in a goddam coalmine all my life and have a raft of snot-nosed brats who look like niggers in the coaldirt , like my father , and his father , and all the rest of them . What the hell do you dames want ? to take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire and give it to your mother for Mother 's Day ? What the hell do you ... " There was no hood of ice over his eyes now , like there was when he had been facing Warden , like there was when he had been trying to talk her into it , they were blazing now , with the fire of a strip mine that smoulders and smoulders and finally breaks out in the open for a little while . He took a deep shuddering breath and got hold of himself. 92 93The girl could almost see the white icecap of anger rolling down across his eyes , like the glaciers of the ice age rolled across the earth . She lay back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicts being washed down with the firehose , letting the force hit her , yieldinginstead of fighting it , with a patience born of centuries of stooped backs and dried apple faces . " I 'm sorry , Violet , " Prew said , from behind the ice . " Its all right , " the girl said . " I did nt mean to hurt you . " " Its all right , " she said . " Its up to you , " he said . " This transfer changes my whole routine of living . It works with a different rhythm , like a new song . They ai nt at all alike , the old song and the new . " This is the last time I 'm comin up . You can either move or not , its okay . When a man changes his life , he has to change it all . He cant keep nothin that reminds him of the old life , or it does nt work . If I kept comin up here , I 'd get dissatisfied with this transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt aim to do that , or let anybody know I want to do it . " So its up to you , " he said . " I cant go , Bobbie , " the girl said , not moving , no change in her voice , still from the chair as she had been before . " Okay , " he said . " Then I 'll be leavin . I 've seen lots of guys shacked up in Wahiawa . They have a good time . Them and their wahines have parties together and go out together , movies and bars . All like that . The girls ai nt alone . Not any more , " he said , " than any human being is always alone . " " What happens to them when the soldiers leave ? " she said . Her eyes were looking off at the hilltop trees . " I do nt know . And I do nt give a good goddam . They probly git other soljers . I 'll be leavin . " When he came back out he carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nearly empty one , rolled up in the trunks , all the things he had owned here , all that he was taking with him . The little that they were , they had been deposited here as security for a pass of entrance , collateral for the loan of a life that existed off the Post , and in taking them away he had revoked his claim . Violet was still sitting in the same unchanged position , and he made himself grin at her , drawing his lips back tautly across his teeth . But the girl did not see it , or notice him . He walked down the steps and around the corner of the house . Her voice followed him around the corner . " Goodby , Bobbie . " Prew grinned again . " Aloha nui oe , " he called back , playing the role out to the end , with a strong sense of the dramatic . As he crested the little hill he did not look back , but he could feel through the back of his neck that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand propped against the other side as if barring the door to a salesman . He walked on toward the intersection , never looking back , seeing in his mind the fine tragic picture his figure disappearing down the hill must make , as if it were himself standing back there in the door . And the strange thing was he had never loved her more than at this moment , because at that moment she had become himself . But thats not love , he thought , thats not what she wants , nor what any of them want , they do not want you to find yourself in them , they want instead that you should lose yourself in them . And yet , he thought , they are always trying to find themselves in you . What a wonderful actor you would have made , Prewitt , he told himself . It was only when he was below the hill that he could end the role and stop , turning to look back , allowing himself to feel the loss . And it seemed to him then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bars , in railway trains , in offices , in mirrors , in love , especially in love , for the self of him that is there , someplace , in every other human . Love was not to give oneself , but find oneself , describe oneself . And that the whole conception had been written wrong . Becausethe only part of any man that he can ever touch or understand is that part of himself he recognizes in him . And that he is always looking for the way in which he can escape his sealed bee cell and reach the other airtight cells with which he is connected in the waxy comb . And the only way that he had ever found , the only code , the only language , by which he could speak and be heard by other men , could communicate himself , was with a bugle . If you had a bugle here , he told himself , you could speak to her and be understood , you could play Fatigue Call for her , with its tiredness , its heavy belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather stay at home and sleep , she would understand it then . But you havent got a bugle , himself said , not here nor any other place . Your tongue has been ripped out . All you got is two bottles , one nearly full , one nearly empty . And that we cant take through the gate , friend , he told himself , because the MPs will drink it up themself , and that we cant cache along94 95the fence because there are guys who get their whiskey that way , look for it every night . Shall we drink it , friend ? I think we 'd better . We are much closer , sometimes we can almost see each other , when we 're drunk . Lets go to the tree . The tree , below the hill , halfway to the intersection , was a gnarled old kiawe tree filling up its little field , where on his trips up here he had gone before to sit , and where the brown bottles of his past trips lay in the grass . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift his legs high until he got under it where there was the flattened smooth place that he always sat with his back against the roughness of the bark and no one could see him from the road because there are times every man must be alone and in the squadroomthere is no aloneness , only loneliness . The ancient thorny-fingered guardian that all day protected its little patch of virgin grass from the philandering sun 's greedy demanding of that last maidenhead in the field , spread its warped washerwoman 's arms above him now as it had the grass all day , protecting the philandering prodigal now as it had its daughter 's greenness , until he drank his whiskey , thinking some about The Warden and the Company , the jockstrap Company , but mostly about Violet and the fact that a man could never move without finding boxes to pack the curtains and the canned goods . It was all one to the tree , him or the grass , since being female all it needed was a thing it could protect . He added the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride home , to the crowded loneliness of the barracks  --  home , to the separateness of the squadroom where there is no solitude  --  home , with a 13th Field Artillery truck taking swimmers back from Haleiwa , and went , drunk , to bed . And when the end of the month and Payday came , he took his last pay as a First and Fourth , the money that was to have set Violet up in Wahiawa , and with a fitting sense of irony , blew it in the gambling sheds , determined to start even . He lost it all across the crap table at O'Hayer 's in fifteen minutes , and he did not even keep out enough to buy a bottle or to buy a piece of ass . It made a lovely gesture , and the large bets he faded created quite a furor . BOOK TWO*the co ipairj96CHAPTER 9THE rainy season was the nearest thing to winter in Hawaii . Perhaps , in the winter months , the sky would be a little duller , more hazy and less blue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hawaii was never more different from summer than was our late September . The temperature remained the same , and the lack of water in the great red plateau of pineapples where Schofield Barracks lay was the same in winter as in summer . There was never any cold to suffer in the winter in Hawaii . But neither was there any persimmon-flavored air of fall 's October , nor any sudden awakening to the warmth and quickened thighs of spring 's young April . The only time there was ever any cosmic change , in Hawaii , was in the rainy season and so its change was always welcomed by the ones who could remember winter . All , that is , except the tourists . It did not come all at once , the rainy season . There was the usual feeble storm or two in waning February , like a man who feebly kicks and struggles just before he dies , but bringing promise and a breath of chill , saying there was water near , hold on a while . Then the early storms gave up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and they ran away before the onslaught of the sun which dried the mud to dust again , leaving only a caked cracked memory that crumbled underneath the round-toed bluntness of the GI shoes . But in early March the times between the rains got shorter and the rains themselves got longer , until finally there were no times between , but only rain , of which the earth would avidly drink its fill and then , like a man dehydrated in the desert who cant keep from drinking too much , vomit all the rest it could not assimilate , down the streets and down the hills , along the flumes and irrigation ditches that webbed the carmine earth of the plateau and now were torrentialrivers . Until at last the whole earth and everybody on it , like a honeymooning bride , begged for thirst again . It was then that Schofield moved indoors . Field problems were replaced by lectures on the various armament nomenclatures in the Dayrooms , Close Order and Extended Order were made to step down99for dry-run target exercises on the porches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having to compete with the exciting luxury of being under shelter while the rain beat down outside . Raincoats , of two kinds  --  the rubberized kind that absorbed the water like a blotter , and the slicker kind that shed both air and water until the wearer was so bathed in sweat he might as well have worn the other kind , appeared from out of hiding in the combat packs hung on each bed foot . And on those evenings when the rain would cease long enough for men to go back to their restless midnight walks the newly issued gadgets called " field jackets " would appear upon the streets and roads . And now , in the rainy season , when the groups of men moved in on the roofed over Boxing Bowl behind the old Post Chapel , coming from all over , radial spokes about a hub , they carried blankets , both to spread out on the cold concrete that brings down the piles and to wrap around them . And perhaps a hidden pint for extra warmth , if they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And here in Hawaii 's autumnal March , under the roof of Schofield 's Boxing Bowl where two nameless ciphers fought each other in the ring , football , apples , and October and all the thousand little towns across the nation with their little highschool football teams hovered low above the Bowl , brought momentarily alive again by an illusion . With three Smokers still to be run off in the Bowl in the second week in March the Hawaiian Division Championship had already been decided . Dynamite Holmes 's " Bearcat Cubs " had lost , by thirty points to the 27th Infantry , twice as much as they could hope to pick up in the last three Smokers , and the great gold ring with its golden fighters in it had been removed from its case of honor in the sallyportto be ready for its presentation to the winner when the season ended . Dynamite could be seen moving around the Post with sagging shoulders and an irritated brow and it was rumored that he would be shipped down , relieved from boxing , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martials in a single month and sent two men to the Stockade . But in the big octagonal hole in the ground with its serrated scallopedconcrete sides it was not important , to the spectators , who was fighting , or who would win . It was only important that the winy air and excitement of anticipated conflict be enjoyed , bringing back the distant continent of home where all the grave young highschoolathletes who , despite their coaches with their turned-up topcoat collarsand conflicting visions of Knute Rockne movies and jobs they feared to risk , fought frantically with the magnificent foolishness of youth as if the whole of life depended on this game , and who were still young enough to cry over a defeat , an illusion that their coaches never shared , a thing that like Santa Claus they themselves would lose all too soon before the widening range of vision and the knowledge that their loyalty was a commodity and could be shifted easily , and a thing that the men who perched on the concrete of the Boxing Bowl remembered fondly in their own hunger for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over its defeat near as much as Dynamite , or as much as Dynamite thought it did . Its loyalties had been shifted from one outfit to another too many times , and its depression lasted exactly the time it took to walk home from the Bowl and get a small change crapgame started in the latrine . The bright light of the boxing squad faded rapidly . Payday was much nearer than next year 's season , and there were rumors that half the houses between River Street and Nuuana Avenue had got in shipments of new girls . But if the honor of the Regiment had no other exponent except Dynamite , it had a great one there . After his interview with Col Delbert and the securing of his borderline reprieve , he collected his charts and maps and began the planning of next year 's campaign which was to be the greatest yet , and would bring the trophy back where it belonged . " It shall return , " he said , and even before the last Smoker had been played out he had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warden was standing in the corridor doorway when Holmes loosed the thunderbolt of the transfer of the cook , Stark , from Ft . Kamehameha . It was raining hard that day and from the doorway he watched his commander come striding through the silver curtain , oblivious of the muddy quad , his tailored belted topcoat with its collar up around his ears flapping soddenly , but still smartly , around his booted legs , and shamefully there was none of the traditional cheerful adoration in The Warden 's heart . Something about the stridingfigure told him this was not a routine trip to see that everything was running right and he was afflicted with a sense of foreboding ill . " Boots and saddles , " he sneered out loud defiantly , but not loud enough for Holmes to hear , and turned his back upon the coming Captain and went inside , to prove his independence to himself . " I want these fixed up right away , " Holmes said , coming dripping100 101into the Orderly Room and pulling papers from inside his coat . " Wheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , without enthusiasm . " Sgt /Maj O'Bannon called for all the clerks this morning . " Then you 'll have to fix them , " Holmes said , handing him the papers . " I want an endorsement , you know ; and a good letter of recommendation . " This man Stark served with me at Bliss and I 've already talked to Col Delbert about him . He wrote Department Hq to get his request through channels safely . " Holmes took off his Cavalryman 's hat and swung it vigorously , scattering the water on the floor . " My God , " he said , " its wet . He 's a damned fine man . I always like to do everything I can for my old men . " " Yes , Sir , " Warden said , and went on studying the papers . " I want it sent out today , " Holmes said happily . " I 'll wait and mail it myself . Theres some other things I want to talk to you about anyway . We 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir , " Warden said , and went on studying the papers . " Are you listening to me ? " Holmes said . " Yes , Sir , " Warden said . He raised the papers up , as if displaying them . " We got a full staff of cooks , Capn , " he made it casual . " You 'll have to bust somebody to make room for this guy . Have you talked to Sgt Preem about it yet ? He ai nt kicked about his present cooks as far as I know of . " But he did nt make it casual enough . Holmes 's face lost its roundness of happiness and became severe , all planes and angles . " I do nt think Sgt Preem will contest my decision , Sergeant . " " Not , " Warden said , " if you give him a bottle of lemon extrack . " " What ? " Holmes said . " I said , " Warden said , " not if he wants to keep on the right track . " Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in Bliss . And I have never yet found it necessary to bolster my judgment with the advice of subordinates . " " Yes , Sir , " Warden said , staring back at him . " I know what I 'm doing , Sergeant . Just let me handle it . When 1 want advice I 'll ask for it . " " Yes , Sir , " Warden said , still staring at him . Holmes would never get a better first sergeant , and Holmes knew it , and Warden knew he could get by with it . Holmes stared back long enough to let himself feel he had not been intimidated , and then he dropped his eyes to his sharp-peakedhat and shook it again to get the water off , unable to face the thing in Warden that just did not give a fuck . " My God , " he mumbled . " Its wet . " " Yes , Sir , " Warden said . Watching Holmes sit down at his desk and begin to doodle , feeling he had triumphed momentarily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the advantage . " Can this thing wait a couple days , Captain ? Leva is way behind in his supply reports and I 've been helping him out . I 've got work to do thats imperative ; and this thing can be fixed up any time . " In a couple of days he might cool off and forget his altruism . He had done it before . Holmes laid his pencil down emphatically . " Whats the matter with Sgt O'Hayer ? " he said . " He 's the supply sergeant isnt he ? " " Yes , Sir ! " Warden said . " Well then . Let him do it . Thats his job . " " O'Hayer cant do it . Sir . He 's too goddam busy running his goddamgambling shed . " " What do you meant he cant do it ? He 's the supply sergeant . He has to , do it . Are you questioning my judgment , Sergeant ? " " No , Sir ! " " All right then . Let O'Hayer do his own job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'm Company Commander of this outfit every man will do his own job , and it will be run as I say . And I want those papers made out now . " " Yes , Sir , " Warden said violently . " I 'll make them out right now , Sir . " And the supply and all the rest of it can go to hell , he thought . Now there would be five boys from Bliss to hamstring the outfit . He sat down at his desk and went to work , ignoring Holmes , and in the work belittling him . " By the way , Sergeant , " Holmes interrupted coolly . " About that open Pfc . I want you to have Mazzioli make out a Company Order giving it to Bloom . " Warden looked up from his typewriter , his eyebrows quivering . " Bloom ! " " Yes , " Holmes said tranquilly , " Bloom . Bloom 's a good man , he 's got the makings of a good noncom in him . Sgt Galovitch tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Company . " " Not Bloom , " Warden said . " Why , yes , " Holmes said , satisfaction in his voice . " I 've had my eye on him for quite a while . I keep my finger on the pulse of this102 103Company much more than you think . Good athletes , I 've found , alwaysmake the best soldiers , " he said maliciously . " Bloom won four of his fights in the Bowl this year . Its not impossible that we 'll make a Division Champion out of Bloom next year . Sgt Wilson is going to work with him . " Holmes waited , looking at him , demanding an answer with his eyes . " You have Mazzioli do that tomorrow , will you ? " he insisted gently , but firmly . " Yes , Sir , " Warden said without looking up . " Yes-sir , I 'll do that . " " Thanks , " Holmes said . He picked his pencil up triumphantly . Warden finished up the papers , wondering if Holmes really believedthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; aware , as he handed the papers to Holmes , that he had just witnessed the beginning of the complicated mental process that had elevated over half the noncoms in the Company to their present rank . Holmes looked the papers over with an air of profound well-being . " I suppose these are in good order ? " " Sir ? " exploded Warden . " I make them out they 're always in good order . " " Now , now , Sergeant , " Holmes said , raising his hand as if he were a bishop . " I know you 're a good first sergeant . I just want to be sure theres no slip on this transfer . " " I made it out , " Warden told him . " Yes , " Holmes smiled , " but your mind was too much on Leva and the supply room . If you 'd quit worrying about Mess and Supply and trying to do their work in addition to your own , we 'd have a lot more efficiency , and a much better outfit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Warden said . " Now , now , " Holmes laughed . " It cant be that bad , Sergeant . You look for things to worry about . " Oh by the way , how is this new man Prewitt making out with straight duty now ? " " Doing fine . That boy is a good soldier . " " I know he is , " Holmes said . " Thats what I 'm counting on . I never saw a good soldier who liked to do straight duty as a private . I 'm expecting to see him out for Company Smokers this summer . Theres an old saying that they tame lions in the Army . " " I think you 're wrong , " Warden said bluntly . " I do nt think you 'll ever see him out for boxing . " " Wait until the rainy season 's over , Sergeant , before you be so sure . We 've got a lot of field work coming up this summer . " He winkedat Warden knowingly and picked up his rain-dark hat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been included in the plans of his campaign , and how could he not be on the squad if he was in the plans ? Warden watched him plowing his way back across the rainswept deserted quad , realizing suddenly why he hated Holmes . It was because he had always feared him , not him personally , not his physique or mind , but what he stood for . Dynamite would make a good generalsomeday , if he got the breaks . Good generals ran to a certain type , and Dynamite was it . Good generals had to have the type of mind that saw all men as masses , as numerical groups of Infantry , Artillery , and mortars that could be added and subtracted and understood on paper . They had to be able to see men as abstractions that they worked on paper with . They had to be like Blackjack Pershing who could be worried about the morality of his troops in France so much he tried to outlaw whorehouses to save their mothers heartache , but who was proud of the raindrenched earth and muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his topcoat made a picture in his mind of a ghost town street and a strong wind rolling along a tattered scrap of paper in the gutter to some unforeseen and unimportant destination , moaning with the sadness of its duty . From upstairs he could hear the shouts and splashings of the Company washing up for chow , and the chillness that swept in through the open window made him shudder and put on his field jacket that hung on his chair . He stared out the window , his rage distintegrated , replaced by an unutterable melancholy that had no reason he could find . Leva 's bald head floated leisurely by the open window , heading for the kitchen where he and Warden ate , instead of with the Company in the messhall . " Whats for chow ? " Warden called . " BS and C , " stated the wryfaced Leva laconically , and strolled on . Roast beef hash and gravy ! Again ! Preem was getting worse and worse . It kept the Company Fund broke buying GI lemon extract for him . Warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought out the regulation .45 pistol he always kept there , hefting the heavy weighted balance in his hand . Just like the pistol his father had brought home from the War . Same weight , same shape , same heavy blueness . He and Frankie Lindsay up the street had swiped it from104 105his father 's bureau , every now and then , and shot caps in it sticking them in the slot before the pinless hammer ; they would drop pebbles . down the muzzle too and shoot them out a foot or so , playing they were bullets . The Company was trooping down the stairs for chow . Warden leveled the pistol at the small doorless closet where the filing cabinets were and cocked it . The raising of the hammer made a dull metallic click that was an ominous expectant sound , and Milt Warden banged his other palm down flat on the desk . " Ha ! you son of a bitch , " he said out loud . " Thought I did nt see you . " He stood up , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivering . " Re-enlist , will you ? I 'm Wolf Larsen , see ? and nobody re-enlists .. Not without answering to old Shark . . . . No you do nt ! " He stepped around the desk and strode at the closet , chin thrust forward murderously , stopping in the doorway , pulling the trigger slowly , inexorably . The hammer fell , inevitable as a clock stroke . The dull click was flatly disappointing after the expectancy of the cocking . He tossed the heavy pistol on the closet table clatteringly . " Continuednext week , " he said , looking down at it . In its simple lines and solid gunmetal color it was an entity , beautiful and complete within itself as a woman 's calf . But then , he thought , a woman 's calf is only a symbol of the rest of it ; what man would be satisfied with a woman 's calf alone ? Angrily he picked it up and jerked the slide back , letting it slam forward viciously , carrying a cartridge from the clip into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own head and putting his finger lightly on the trigger . Just where is , he thought , the line that separates insanity ? Any man who would pull this trigger now would be insane . Am I insane ? because I put it loaded to my head ? or because I touch the trigger ? He gazed raptly at the heavy death a moment , then he took it down . He released the magazine expertly and ejected the shell upon his desk . He slipped shell back into clip , clip back into piece , piece back into drawer ; and leaned back in his chair listening to the sounds of eating in the messhall . After a while he rose and took a fifth of whiskey from the second drawer of his file cabinet and had a long , adam's-apple-bobbling drink . Then he went out onto the porch and into the kitchen where Levawas leaning against the castiron sink , eating from a plate in his hand . Warden 's chance came sooner than he had expected . The next afternoonit cleared a little , the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ranks before the next assault . It was hanging low and heavy-bellied , ominously , as Holmes came around the quad , staying on the street this time , wearing civvies , a soft brown tweed suit , and carrying his topcoat , to tell him that he was going down to town with Col Delbert and that he would not be back today . And suddenly Warden knew that he would have to do it . He did nt know why exactly , because this was more than just a woman , there were women enough downtown that he could have . This went much deeper . Up until now , while he had thought about it , he had only played with the idea . Always before it had been a point with him to steer clear of Army women , they were cold , with no more warmth in them than in a brilliant diamond , and there was no pleasure in them . They did their fornication out of boredom rather than desire . And from what Leva had told him and from what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Yet above all that he still knew that he would do it , not as vengeance , or even retribution , but as an expression of himself , to regain the individuality that Holmes and all the rest of them , unknowing , had taken from him . And he understood suddenly why a man who has lived his whole life working for a corporation might commit suicide simply to express himself , would foolishly destroy himself because it was the only way to prove his own existence . " Will you be back in time to take Retreat ? " he said to Holmes casually , not looking up from the papers in his hand he had been reading . " Hell no , " Holmes said happily . " Or Reveille either , probably . I told Culpepper to take them both for me if I do nt show up . If he does nt show up , you take them . " " Yes , Sir , " Warden said . Holmes was walking back and forth across the office , displaying an uninhibited joy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning lights that flickered out the window oilily upon the gloomy rainy day , Holmes 's normally florid face was flushed a deeper hue of happiness . " All work and no play , " Holmes said , and winked . It was a male wink , implying the turgid weighted pendulum that must be relieved , 106 107and it flung a momentary bridge across the gulf of caste that always separated them . " You ought to take a day off yourself , " Holmes said . " All you do is sit around this gloom sweating over this paper and that . There are other , happier things in this world besides administration . " " I 've been considering it , " Warden said thinly , exchanging the papers in his hand for some on his desk and picking up a pencil . This was Thursday , the maid 's day off , it was just as good a time as any . He watched the beefy happiness on Holmes 's face narrowly , surprised that now at this time he should like him better than he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going . I 'm leaving it in your care , Sergeant . " There was great trust and feeling in his voice , and in his suddenly powerful emotion he clapped his hand on Warden 's shoulder . " It 'll be here when you get back , " Warden said . But he was only playing out the role , and his voice was dead . You 've got nothing to go on but your woman 's intuition , Milton , Warden told himself , you better play it safe , you better really have it figured out . He watched Holmes leave and sat down at his desk to wait for Mazzioli to come back , because even now , in this big moment , he would not leave the Orderly Room with nobody but the CQ to run it . It began to rain again before the clerk came back , and Warden occupied himself with cleaning up some odd jobs that had been accumulating . There were a number of letters he had to write out for Mazzioli to copy up for Holmes to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week 's drill schedule , looking up the Field Manuals for the authorization . Alone in the damp air , he worked savagely , taking out his hatred on the paper , forgetting everything else but this before him , throwing himself headlong at it like a hopped-up Jap attacking a machinegun , and the power of his energy filled the room to bursting . Mazzioli , the company clerk , was dripping wet when he came in and trying to protect a half a dozen manila envelopes from the water . " Jesus Christ , " he said , looking at Warden with his sleeves turned back . " Its cold enough outside . Shut that window before we both freeze to death . " Warden grinned at him slyly , his eyes squinted up . " Is the poor little delicate baby cold ? " he said . " Is him freezin ? " " Aw , " the clerk said . " Can it , will you ? " He put his folders down and stepped to push it shut himself . " Leave it open ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk protested . " Then freeze , " Warden grinned . " I like it open . " Suddenly his face hardened . " Where the hella yah been all goddam day ? " he snarled . " You know where I 've been , " the clerk said primly . " I 've been over at the personnel section in Regiment . " Having attended a businss collegeon the outside , he exercised his right to intellectual superiority ; to this end he prided himself on his good grammar and always sat in on the discussions held by the clerks in Choy 's . Now and then he even held a discussion with Pop Karelsen , the sergeant of the weapons platoon , who rumor had it once had been a rich man 's son . " I 've been working with Sgt/Maj O'Bannon , " Mazzioli added bitterly , with a prissy mimic . " If I ever saw an old maid ... " " Grant went to the hospital today , " Warden interrupted bluntly . He picked the Sickbook up and opened it and held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interned ? He 's got the clap . Know what that is ? " The clerk stepped back , his armor pierced , looking guilty . Warden grinned sourly . " Yeh . Thats time lost under AW io7 , " he said , bludgeoning him with it . " Did you make up his individual sick record ? did you make a note for the Morning Report ? did you make a remark for your pay cards ? did you fix my card index roster ? The goddamSickbook is your job . You 're the clerk . I cant do your work , too . " " I did nt have time when the Sickbook came back this morning , " Mazzioli started . " Those medics never get it back before eleven . They ... " " Do nt gim me any excuse , collegeboy , " Warden sneered . He split the plea apart and dealt with both halves deftly . " The Sickbook was back at nine-thirty . O'Bannon did nt send the orderly around till ten . You sit around here all morning on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hafta tell you ? Keep your work up to date . Do everything the minute it comes in . Once you get behind you never get caught up . " " Okay , Top , " Mazzioli said , crestfallen , all his blandness gone . " I 'll do it now . Let me have the book . " He reached out to take it , but Warden did not relax his grip . Tall , deepchested , and disgusted he stared down at the clerk , a malignant expression in the ends of his eyebrows . Mazzioli looked at him . " Oh , " he said , guiltily , and let go . " Soon as I finish film these . I 'll do it soon as I finish these . " He turned from the silent sarcasm to his folders . Warden tossed the Sickbook on his desk . " I already done it , " he said in a normal tone , disgustedly . " Its all fixed up already . " 108 109Mazzioli shot him an admiring glance from the file cabinet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell , " Warden said , violent again . " If you do nt watch yer step , you 're gon na find your ass busted back to private and do a little straight duty . Which would probably kill a college angelina like you . A classic example of the American educational system , thats what you are . " Mazzioli did not believe the threat , but he put a sad expression on his face , just in case . Warden saw completely through it . " You think I 'm kiddin ya ? " Warden said , with his overpowering violence . " Keep on like you 're goin and watch . You 'll find yourself divin for pearls in the kitchen . I 'm the first sergeant here , not you , and if theres any leisure around here I get it , see ? If there ai nt enough for two , then you work . And if you do nt quit hangin around with them two-bit philosophers over at Regmint you 'll be scrubbin this Orderly Room floor for me . " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Gogh , " Mazzioli said . " He 's a painter . " " Well , well , " Warden said . " Do tell . A painter . Did you ever read Lust For Life ? " " Yes , " Mazzioli said , surprised . " Did you ? " " No , " Warden said . " I never read . " " You ought to read it , Top . Its a good book . " " Did you ever read The Moon and Sixpence ? " Warden said . " Sure , " Mazzioli said , surprised again . " Have you ? " " No , " Warden said . " I never read . " Mazzioli turned to look at him . " Aw now , " he said . " What are you doing , kidding me ? " " Who , me ? " Warden said . " Do nt flatter yourself , kid . " " I bet you read them , " Mazzioli said . He laid down his filing andsat down and lit a cigaret . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " To hell with your theories , " Warden said . " Lets get them files fixedup . I got some business to attend to myself . " " Okay , " Mazzioli said . He got up angrily and went back to work . Looking at the anger on Mazzioli 's face , Warden laughed outright . " So Grant 's got the clap , hey ? " he said , conversationally . " I told him he should have taken a pro , " Mazzioli said distastefully , but still angrily . " Or at least used a rubber . " Warden snorted contemptuously . " Do you wash your feet with your socks on , kid ? " " I 've already heard that one , " the clerk said aloofly . Warden snorted again . " Where 'd Grant say he got it ? " " At the Ritz Rooms , " Mazzioli said distastefully . " Serves the son of a bitch right . He should of known better'n to go to that crummy joint . He 'll be a goddam private in the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's payin for it . " Warden stood up and banged his fist down on his desk so hard that Mazzioli jumped in spite of himself . " Let that be a goddam lesson to you , Corporal , " Warden said violently , " if you do nt want to lose those goddam stripes you love so much . " " Who ? " Mazzioli said , astonished . " Me ? " " Yes , you . Stick to your goddamned rubber glove and become a queer , like the sex hygiene lectures advise you . " " Now listen , " Mazzioli said indignantly . " You listen , " Warden said . " I got some very , very important business to attend to , see ? And I wont be back till probly four o'clock . You stay here in this Orderly Room till I get back , see ? and if I hear of you even goin to the latrine , I 'll bust you down tomorrow , see ? " " Aw , for Christ 's sake , Top , " Mazzioli protested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . " " This business of mine , " Warden said , grinning to himself , " is strictly official . You had the whole goddam morning off to discuss art . You got a soft job ; if you do nt like it , you can quit any time . How many cupsacoffee you have in Choy 's this morning , bah ? " " I only went down for coffee once , " Mazzioli protested . " Four o'clock . And you better be here when I get back . Theres about six letters there to be typed up and next week 's drill schedule to type up . Not counting all the filin that you 've let get behind . " " Okay , Top , " Mazzioli said dejectedly as Warden shouldered himself into his raincoat and picked up a sheaf of papers , seeing his afternoonsacktime departing on the black wings of tyranny . The Warden , and his prisoners . Anything to keep somebody from doing what they wanted . He was a manic-depressive , Mazzioli decided suddenly , happily , or a paranoiac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom of the rainy afternoon where The Warden might be going . Official business , my old fanny . But Warden had anticipated that , and he walked along the street around the quad , resolutely through the rain , it drumming boomingly an his sugar-stiff campaign hat and rustling in his raincoat that was110already beginning to wet his back , and climbed the stairs to RegimentalHq above the sallyport . From the porch he looked back across the quad and saw Mazzioli 's head and shoulders dark against the light from the Orderly Room window , almost as if he had his nose pushed against the glass . What a kid , he thought , no more conception of a soldier than a rabbit and taking it out in talking about art . He laughed out loud , throwing it out defiantly against the soundblanketingcurtain of the rain , feeling in him the smoking sparking pinwheel of the coming profanation of the sacred mark of caste . Maybe she wont even be home , he told himself . Yes she will , she 'll be there . He took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wet . They were authentic letters , ones Holmes really should have signed before he left . Always be prepared , boy scout , he grinned . He stopped a moment , grinning more , before the bulletin board just inside the doorway . On the side that had been stencilled PERMANENTwas a copy of McCrae 's In Flanders Fields printed in red oldEnglishtype on vellum and with the margins adorned with tortured figures in the pancake British helmet of the War . Next to it was a poem called The Warhorse by an unknown general , Retired , of the World War , the first World War , comparing an old soldier to the old firehorse who came running every time the bell rang . Then there was Col Delbert 's latest memorandum right beside it , complimenting the troops on their spirit and athletic prowess and esprit de corps , all tangible results , the memo said , of their high moral character , as propounded by the Chaplain and the Sex Hygiene Lectures , although this was more or less implied . Warden crossed the hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two colonels from Brigade standing in the dusky corridor with its varnished glassfront trophycases talking , the rest of the hall now at two o'clock deserted and the office doors , except for Sgt/Maj O'Bannon'swho practically lived in his , closed . He had hoped there would be nobody around and he looked closely at the colonels to make sure they did nt know him . He looked just a little bit too long . " Oh , Sergeant , " one of them called . " Come here , Sergeant . " He came back up the three or four steps and walked over to them and saluted , restraining a powerful urge to look at his watch . " Where is Colonel Delbert , Sergeant ? " the other one asked , the tall one . " I do nt know , Sir . I havent seen him . " " Has he been in today ? " the fat one asked , his voice wheezing alittle . He wiped his forehead with a handkerchief and unbuttoned the rainwet shiny gabardine of his topcoat that was identical to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sure I couldnt say , Sir , " Warden said . " Do nt you work here , Sergeant ? " the tall one asked narrowly . " No , Sir , " Warden said , thinking fast . " I do nt work in Hq . I have a company , Sir . " " What company ? " the short one wheezed . " A Company , Sir , " he lied . " Sergeant Dedrick of A Company . " " Oh of course , " the short one wheezed . " I thought I knew you . I make a point to know our noncoms in Brigade . You just slipped me . " " Do nt you know enough to report when you come up to an officer , Sergeant ? " the tall one rasped . " Yes , Sir , but I have some business to attend to and I guess I had it on my mind . " " Thats no excuse , " the tall one rasped , militarily . " How long have you been a noncom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warden said . " Well , " the tall one said . Then he said , " You should know enough to watch things like that then . I 'm certainly glad none of your men were here to see the example you just set . " " Yes , Sir , " Warden said , wanting to look at his watch . If he would just only brace me now , he thought . Thats all we need . We could play like back at the Point , upperclassmen hazing the Dumbjohns . " Carry on , Sergeant , " the tall one said . " And in the future be more careful . " " Yes , Sir , I will , Sir . " He saluted quickly and made for the stairs , before the other changed his mind . Holmes 's wife might be going out this afternoon ; if she was , and they made him miss her . . . He laughed , inside , to think what those two would think if they had known what he was thinking . " He sure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeze . " My god , " the tall one said . " They do nt care who they give rockers to any more . It did nt use to be like that . " " Dedrick always was a dumb bastard , " the short one said . " Thats how I remembered him , his dumbness . " " Its a damned disgrace , what the service 's coming to , " the tall one said . " In the old days , a noncom would have been busted flat , to do a thing like that . It isnt like it used to be . " " I wonder where the hell Delbert is , " the short one wheezed . Warden , laughing silently , went on down the inside stairs and out112 113into the sallyport past the folding iron gate that would be open until Retreat , in too big a hurry to be mad . Somebody called to him from Choy 's but he only waved and went on , out the front of the sallyport , crossing Waianae Avenue to the officers ' quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the alley behind Holmes 's corner house . He stopped under the shelter of a big old elm , grinning to himself because he was breathing so heavy , feeling the autumnal chill creep up to him under his raincoat when he stopped , thinking this was a fine day for it and that if she had taken all the others there was no reason why she shouldnt take him too , before he went up finally and knocked on the door . Inside a longlegged black shadow moved across the dimness of the livingroom doorway cutting off the light , and he caught the scissor-flash of naked legs cutting the light and opening again in another step and his breath seemed to go very deep in his chest . " Mrs Holmes , " he called , knocking , his head pulled down between his shoulders in the rain . The shadow moved again inside without sound and stepped through the door into the kitchen to become Karen Holmes in shorts and halter . " What is it ? " she said . " Oh . If it isnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside or you 'll get wet . If you 're looking for my husband , he isnt here . " " Oh , " Warden said , opening the screendoor and jumping in past the water that ran off the eave . " And if I 'm not looking for him ? " he said . " He still isnt here , " Karen Holmes said . " If that does you any good . " " Well , I 'm looking for him . You know where he is ? " " I havent the slightest idea . Perhaps at the Club , having a drink or two , " she smiled thinly . " Or was it snort ? I guess it was snort you said , wasnt it ? " " Ah , " Warden said . " The Club . Why did nt I think of that ? I got some papers its important for him to sign today . " He eyed her openly , traveling up the length of leg in the very short homemade-looking trunks , to the hollow of the hidden navel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's eyes that were watching his progress and his open admiration indifferently , without interest . " Kind of chilly for trunks , ai nt it ? " he said . " Yes . " Karen Holmes looked at him unsmiling . " Its cool today . Sometimes its very hard to keep warm , isnt it ? " she said . " What is it you want , Sergeant ? " Warden felt his breath come in very slowly , and go very deep , clear down into his scrotum. " 1 want to go to bed with you , " he said , conversationally . That was how he had planned it , how he had wanted to say it , but now hearing it it sounded very foolish to him . He watched the eyes , in the unchangedface , widen only a little , so little that he almost missed it . A cool cool customer , Milton , he said to himself . " All right , " Karen Holmes said disinterestedly . With Warden , standing dripping on the porch , it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her . " What are the papers ? " she said then , reaching for there . " Let me see them . Maybe I can help you . " Warden pulled them back , grinning , feeling the grin stiff on his face , masklike . " You wouldnt know anything about them . These are business . " " I always take an interest in my husband 's business , " Karen Holmes said . " Yes , " Warden grinned . " Yes , I sure bet you do . Does he take as big an interest in your business ? " " Do you want me to help you with them ? " " Can you sign his name ? " " Yes . " " So it looks like his own signature ? " " I do nt know about that , " she said , still not smiling . " I never tried . " " Well I can , " Warden said . " I can do everything for him but wear his goddamned bars . At that I draw the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign them himself . " " Then I 'd better call the Club , " she said , " had nt I ? That is where he is . " " Having a drink or two , " Warden said . " But I 'll be glad to call him for you , Sergeant . " " To hell with that . I never like to disturb a man drinking . I could use a drink myself right now . Bad . " " But if its business , " Karen Holmes said . " Anyway , I do nt think you 'll find him at the Club . I got a faint suspicion he went to town with Colonel Delbert , " Warden grinned at her . Karen Holmes did not answer . She stared at him unsmiling from a cold reflective face that did not know he still was there . " Well , " he said . " Ai nt you going to ask me in ? " " Why , yes , Sergeant , " Karen Holmes said . " Come right in. " 114 115She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rusty from standingstill so long , and stepped back up the single step into the kitchen to let him in . " What kind of drink do you want , Sergeant ? " " I do nt care , " he said . " Any drink 'll do . " " You do nt want a drink , " Karen Holmes said . " You do nt really want a drink . What you really want is this , " she said , looking down at her own body and moving her hands out sideways like a sinner at the altar . " Thats what you really want . Isnt it ? Thats what you all want . All all of you ever want . " Warden felt a shiver of fear run down his spine . What the hell is this , Milton ? " Yes , " he said . " Thats what I really want . But I 'll take a drink too , " he said . " All right . But I wont mix it for you . You can mix it yourself or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair beside the enameled kitchen table and looked at him . " Straight 's all right , " he said . " The bottle 's there , " she pointed to a cupboard . " Get it yourself . I wont get it for you . " She laid her hand flat on the cool smoothness of the table . " You can have it , Sergeant , but you 'll have to do the work yourself . " Warden laid the papers on the table and got the bottle from the cupboard , thinking I can match that , baby . " You want one too ? " he said . " You just wait , " he said . " You 'll help me . " " I do nt think I want a drink , " Karen Holmes said . Then , " Yes , perhaps I 'd better . I 'll probably need it , do nt you think ? " " Yes , " he said . " You probly will . " There were glasses on the sink and he took two and poured them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one was anyway . " Here , " he said . " To the end of virginity . " " I 'll drink to that , " she raised her glass . She made a face from the liquor as she set it down . " You 're taking an awful chance , you know , " she said . " Do you really think its worth it ? What if Dana should come home ? I 'm safe you know : my word is always better than an EM 's word . I 'd holler rape and you 'd get twenty years , at Leaven-worth . " " He wont , " Warden grinned , repouring in her glass . " I know where he is . He probly wont be home at all tonight . Besides , " he said , looking up from filling his own glass , " I got two buddies from PI at Leavenworth , I 'd be among friends . " " What happened to them ? " she asked , drinking what was in her glass , making another face at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel 's wife by one of MacArthur'sgook boy scouts . " " Both of them ? " He nodded . " And with the same dame . She picked them up , they said , but they still got twenty years . The gook was the colonel 's orderly . But I 've heard it said he did it out of jealousy . " Karen Holmes smiled tolerantly , but she did not laugh . " I think you 're bitter , Sergeant . " She set down her empty glass and lay back in the chair , sprawled . " My maid is liable to be home any time you know . " Warden shook his head , seeing in his mind a picture of her lying on a bed inviting him , now that his first insecurity was gone . " No she wont , " he said . " Thursday 's her day off . Today is Thursday. , " " You think of everything , do nt you , Sergeant ? " " I try , " he said . " In my position you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " I guess we can dispense with these now , cant we ? They 're nothing , are they ? " " Yes , they are , " he said . " They 're letters . You do nt think I 'd bring something worthless , do you ? so Holmes might see them ? so you might use them as evidence when you turned me in ? And you can call me Milt , now we 're intimate . " " Thats what I like about you , Sergeant : You have confidence . Its also what I dislike about you . " Slowly she tore the papers into little bits and dropped them in the wastebasket behind her . " Men and their confidence . You can consider these as the payment you had to make . You always pay , do nt you ? " " Not if I can help it , " Warden said , wondering again what all this amounted to anyway , not expecting anything like this . " I got carbons of those back at the office , " he grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up . " " At least your confidence is real , " she said . " Not false confidence , or bravado  --  many men have that . Pour me another drink . Tell me , how did you acquire it ? " " My brother is a priest , " he said , reaching for the bottle . " Well ? " " Thats all she wrote , " he said . " What has that to do with it ? " " Everything , baby . In the first place it isnt confidence , its honesty . Being a priest , he believes in celibacy . He has a very heavy heard116 11.7shaved very close and he believes in mortal sin and he is worshipped by his adoring flock . Makes a very good living at it . " " Well ? " she said . " Whata ya mean , well ? After watching him a while , I decided to believe in honesty , which means the opposite of celibacy . Because I did not want to hate myself and everybody else , like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy . " I decided to not believe in mortal sin , since obviously no Creator who was Just would condemn His creations to eternal hellfire and brimstone for possessing hungers He created in them . He might penalizethem fifteen yards for clipping , but He wouldnt stop the ball game . Now would He ? " " You wouldnt think so , " Karen said . " But where does that leave you ? if there is no such a thing as punishment for sins ? " " Ah , " Warden grinned . " You went right to the heart . I do nt like this word sin . ' But since there is obviously punishment , I was forced by irrefutable logic to accept the weird outlandish idea of reincarnation . That was when my brother and I parted . I had to beat him up , to prove my theory ; it was the only way . And , to date , the reincarnationis as far as my philosophy has gotten . What do you say we have another drink ? " " Then I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Karen Holmes said , a kind of interest flickering for the first time in her eyes . Warden sighed . " I believe the only sin is a conscious waste of energy . I believe all conscious dishonesty , such as religion , politics and the real estate business , are a conscious waste of energy . I believe that at a remarkable cost in energy people agree to pretend to believe each other 's lies so they can prove to themselves their own lies are the truth , like my brother . Since I can not forget what the truth is , I gravitated , naturally , along with the rest of the social misfits who are honest into the Army as an EM . Now what do you say we have another drink ? Since we 've settled the problems of God , Society , and the Individual I really think we rate another drink . " " Well , " the woman smiled , and the momentary flick of interest had gone out , replaced by the old flip and coldness . " He 's smart as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to enclose the erect pride of such virility . But since you believe the conscious waste of energy is a sin , do nt you believe the loss of semen is a sin ? unless accompanied by impregnation ? " Warden grinned and dipped the bottle in salute , bowing over it . " Madam , you have touched the weak spot in my philosophy . Far beit from me to snow you . All I can say is  --  not as long as it is not cast out on the ground , or paid for , and sometimes even then . ( Have you ever served in the field ? ) All I can say is  --  not as long as it is useful . " Karen Holmes emptied her glass and set it on the table , with finality . " Useful . Now we 're getting into dialectic . " " Do nt such talk always ? " " And I do not believe in dialectic . I do nt want to listen to your definition of what useful means . " She put one hand behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the floor . Staring at him with eyes of liquid smoke in which there was a curious and great disinterest she unzipped her snorts and shucked out of them without moving from the chair and dropped them with the halter . " There , " she said . " That is what you want . Thats what all the talk 's about . Thats what all you virile men , you intellectual men , always want . Isnt it ? You big strong male men who are virile and intelligent , but who are helpless as babies without a fragile female body to root around on . " Warden found himself staring at the twisted navel and the ridge of scar-tissue that ran down from it , disappearing in the hairy mattress , and that was so old now as to almost be a shadow . " Pretty , isnt it ? " she said . " And its a symbol , too . A symbol of the waste of energy . " Warden set his glass down carefully . He moved toward her on the chair , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the feminine grossness that he loved , that was always there , that he always knew was there , hidden maybe behind perfume , unmentioned , unacknowledged , even denied , but still always there , exist ing , the beautiful lovely grossness of the lioness and the honest bitch dog , that no matter how much , shrinking , they tried to say it wasnt so , in the end always had to be admitted . " Wait , " she said . " Not here , you greedy little boy . Come in the . bedroom . " He followed , angry at the " greedy little boy " but knowing it was true , and wondering wonderingly what kind of creature this one was with all the buried darknesses . He wasnt wearing anything under his CKCs and she shut the door , turning to him blindly , her arms out , raising the roundnesscs of her breasts and making hollows beside her arms . " Now , " she said . " Here . Now . Here and now and now . " 118 119 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other one . " " Then you just move over there . " " All right , " she said . She laughed , the first time , richly . " You take your cuckoldry seriously do nt you , Milt ? " " Where Holmes is concerned I take everything seriously . " " And so do I. " As he moved nearer and nearer to the center of the redness which contained himself , and which he never reached , feeling it blinding him with the light he hungered after and bringing the purring deep down in his throat , the screendoor in the back slammed loudly . " Listen , " Karen said . " Theres someone . Listen . " They could hear the footsteps coming phlegmatically , not slowing , not turning , soundingheavy through the walls . " Quick . Take your clothes and get in the closet there and shut the door . Quick . Hurry up . For God 's sake , hurry , man . " Warden vaulted the other bed , scooping up the uniform and stepped inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk kimono and sitting before her dressing table by the window that looked through the truckway to the barracks . By the time the bedroomdoor was knocked on she was brushing calmly at her hair , but her face was very white . " Who is it ? " Karen called , wondering if the trembling in her voice was noticeable . " Its me , " a boy 's voice said . " Its Junior . " He knocked again , demandingly . " Let me in . " " All right , " she said . " Come in . It isnt locked . " Her son , a nine-year-old miniature of Dana Holmes in his long pants and Aloha shirt , came in , wearing the unholy sullenness that is in the faces of so many holy offspring of duly sanctioned misalliances . " They let us out of school early , " he said sullenly . " Your face is white . Whats the matter , you sick again ? " he asked , studying his mother 's face with the unconscious distaste healthy children have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male superiority that in the last year or two he had picked up from his father . " I 've not been feeling well the last few days , " Karen told him , truthfully , trying hard not to be defensive , and looking at this boy who in one short year had become his father , thinking with a kind of sickness that this long-jawed beefy face , once round and merry , had grown inside her flesh , feeling again the old revulsion . Lookingat the boy , there was suddenly no guilt inside her for the man hiding in the closet , there was only a dull anger at the furtiveness like the slipping around corners of youths in school going to their first whorehouse . " I 'm going over to the Company this afternoon , " the boy said , looking at her from across the battlements of the besieged city that is childhood . " I want my uniform . " " Did you ask your father if it was all right ? " Karen said , feeling tears rising behind her eyes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put her arms around him and explain so many things to him . " He isnt there today , you know . " " Who said he was ? " the boy said . " He 's never there in the afternoon . He do nt care if I go over to the Company . Long as I do nt get familiar with the men , he said . You got no right to keep me home just because you hate the Company . " " Good God , child , " Karen said . " I do nt want to keep you home . I do nt hate the Company . I just wanted . . . " " I do nt care what you say anyway , " the boy said , cramming his fists down in his pockets . " I 'm going anyway . Dad said I could go and I 'm going . " " I wanted to be sure it was all right with your father , " Karen said . " You always ask him first . " " He went to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to ask him , I 'd have to wait till tomorrow morning , probly . You talk like we had company . " " All right , " Karen said , wondering if she was being bitchy , so many of them took their bitchiness and anger at their husbands out on the defenseless children ; it was one thing she had promised herselfthat she would never do . " If you were going anyway , why did you even bother to come home and tell me ? " " I did nt come home to tell you , " the boy said . " I came home to get my uniform to wear and you have to help me put it on . " " Go get it out then , " she said . At least there was one thing she could still do ; anyway she could do it when Dana wasnt home . In the last two years his education in both school and life had been taken from her hands , along with all the other things . She felt herselfslipping back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the closet . At least there was one way left for a woman to express herself , she thought distastefully , now that the chastity belts were outlawed , now that the stocks and ducking chairs were gone , although the condemnation still was just as bad. 120 " Well come on , " the boy said impatiently . " I 'm in a hurry . I 'm going to help Sergeant Preem cook supper tonight and eat with them . " " Is that all right with Sergeant Preem ? " she said , getting up to follow him . " It has to be , do nt it ? If he 's my Dad 's mess sergeant . Come on , I 'm in a hurry . " In the little room he had for himself Karen helped him shuck off his clothes , staring wonderingly at the small naked agility , surprised again that this foreigner and stranger was her child to love and cherish the way all the books on child-care said . Here were bones and nerves and ligaments from her body , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitized plate that had been Karen Jennings of Baltimore , Md. , as a man might use an old box camera , for the pictures it would take , not caring about the technique of the using . Now I 've borne the heir , she thought . The film is taken out , the negative made , the picture in the process of development . And the crumbling shredding rotting leathered box is put back on the shelf . Useless now . The mechanism of its dark interior having been accidentallybroken by a bad exposure . Thats pretty good , my girl . You ought to write yourself . You 've got some good material . And I do nt think you 'd romanticize love so very much . The unspeakable loneliness of self-pity that is blind and tongueless rose up hot in her , trying to bring tears . She helped the boy to struggle into the one-piece suit some of whose buttons he could not reach , cocked the cap right on his head , and tied the issue tie that was too big for him . Making of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young second lieutenant complete with gold bars and Regimental insignias on his shoulders and US and crossed rifles on his collar tabs and all the painful illusionsthat went with them . God help you , she thought , God truly help you , and the woman you marry in order to reproduce a replica of yourself . The second generation of an Army line , begun by a farm boy from Nebraska who wanted more than farming and whose father knew a Senator . Karen put her arms around her son . " My boy . " " Hey , " he said , distastefully . " Do nt do that . Leave me alone . " He shrugged out from under the arms and looked at her accusingly . " You 've mussed your cap , " Karen said and set it straight . Junior looked at her again and then inspected himself in the mirrorand finally nodded . He picked up his allowance money off the dresser and slipped it in his pocket . " I may go to the show , " he informed her . ' Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad said it was good and I would like it . And for gosh sake , " he said , " do nt wait up for me , like I was a kid . " He gave her another look to make sure she understood and then he left , wearing his responsibility heavily . " Watch out for cars , " Karen called , and then bit her lip because she said it . When the backdoor slammed she went back to the bedroom and sat down quickly on the bed and put her face in her hands , waiting for the nausea to leave , afraid she was going to cry . Crying was the last ditch where she always made her stand . She looked down at her hands and saw that they were shaking . After a while she made herselfget up and go to open the closet door , sick with the humiliation of this unjust degradation of herself and Warden whom she could hardly face . " I think you 'd better go , " she said , pulling back the door . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " She stopped , amazed , the words trailing off forgotten . Warden sat crosslegged on the pile of his uniform in the cramped space , the skirts of several dresses draped over his head like a crazy turban , and his big square shoulders were shaking helplessly with laughter . " Whats the matter ? " she said . " What are you laughing at ? What are you laughing at , you fool ? " Warden shook his head and a dress fell down over his face . He blew his breath weakly , floating it aside , and looked at her , his body still shaking with the laughing and his eyebrows hooked up high . " Stop it , " Karen said . " Stop it , stop it , " her voice going off up high . " It isnt funny . Theres nothing funny about it . It would have been twenty years for you , you fool . What are you laughing at ? " " I use to be a traveling salesman , " Warden gasped . Staring unbelievingly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . " A what ? " she said . " A traveling salesman , " he laughed , still sitting there . " For two years I was a traveling salesman , and this heres the first time I ever had to hide in anybody 's closet . " Karen stared at the laughing face and hooked quivering brows and pointed ears that were like a satyr 's . The Traveling Salesman , and The Farmer 's Daughter . The Classic Love Story , the Romeo and122 123Juliet , of the American continent . The symbol of the Great American Brand of Humor , and of all the shameful sniggerings and wishfulthinkingwinks of all the poolroom eunuchs . And suddenly she began to laugh . If the whim had struck this madman he would just as soon have marched right out of the closet naked up behind the boy and hollered boo . In her mind she saw a picture of him doing it and it sent her far off into laughter . She sat there on the bed , the sense of shame at nearly being exposedin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laughing , trying hard to stop the laughing that was making her begin to cry . It was Warden 's turn to stare uncomprehendingly . He uncrossed his legs and took the dresses off his head and got up and went over to her , thinking that somewhere he had judged this whole thing wrong , that Leva had been wrong , that this was something that had never come within his realm of knowledge . " There , " he said helplessly . " There . There , " feeling the absurdity , the oppressive impossibility of any human being trying to communicate with and understand another 's mind in a life where nothing was ever what it seemed to be . " Please do nt cry , " he said , searching vainly for a word , " I cant stand to see somebody cry . " " You do nt know what its like , " Karen said , shivering and whimperinglike a puppy in the rain . " The two of them . Its more than anyone was made to stand . " " Ah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up in this deal in the first place . He put his arm around her . " Its all right . He 's gone . There , " he said . " There . " Her breast , lying in his cupped palm , was warm and soft like a young bird quivering with fearful trustfulness . " Do nt do that , " she said , pulling irritably away from him . " You do nt know . You do nt even care . Its nothing to you . A piece of ass . What is it to you ? Leave me alone . " " Okay , " he said . He stood up and went to get his shirt , feeling almost relieved . " What are you doing ? " she cried at him frantically . " I 'm leaving , " Warden said . " Wasnt that what you wanted ? " " Do nt you want me either ? " Now what the hell , he thought . " Sure , " he said . " Hell yes . I thought you wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " if you want to . Go ahead . I do nt want to force you into anything . I do nt blame you , I do nt blame you a hit . Whywould you want to stay ? Since I 'm not even a woman any more . " " You 're a woman , " Warden said , looking at her in the thin kimono . " All woman . Take it from me . " " Not to anyone but you , " she said . " I 'm nothing . I cant even work . Theres nowhere in the world I 'm needed . " " You 're needed , " Warden said , coming back and sitting down by her . " In this world beautiful women are needed more than any other thing . " " Thats what men always say . Needed to be some man 's beautiful whore . But I 'm not even that . " " You 've got a nice suntan , " he said , running his hand across her back , hearing the rain outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach at Kaneohe . It wont be raining there . " " I do nt like Kaneohe , " Karen said . " Its damn near as public and as crowded as that goddam Waikiki . " " Ah , " he said , " but I know a little beach near Blowhole that is private . Nobody knows about it . Nobody ever goes there . You climb down the cliff wall and there is a little inlet with a sand beach , suddenly , firm and smooth and the rock wall towering above you so the cars on the highway pass just above and they never know its there . You feel like you use to feel when you were a kid and hid by yourself in a cave of bushes and watched the others hunting you . You do nt even need to wear a bathing suit at this place , and you can get tanned all over . " " Will you take me there ? " she said . " What ? " he said . " Sure . Sure , I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? and swim there in the moonlight and then lie on the little beach ? and you love me there where nobody can see us or know that we are there ? " " Sure . Sure , " he said . " We 'll do all that . " " Oh , I 'd love to do that , " Karen said , looking at him worshipfully . " Nobody 's ever done anything like that with me . Do you really want to take me ? " " Sure , " Warden said . " When you want to go ? " " Next week . Lets go next weekend . I 'll take Dana 's car and meet you someplace in town . We 'll get some sandwiches and take some beer . " She smiled at him radiantly and put her arms around his neck and kissed him . " Okay , " Warden said . He returned the kiss , feeling hungrily under his hands the long twin muscles along her spine running from the tiny waist up to the wideness of the shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling the twin pressures of her breasts against him , and thinking of the childlike radiance that had been in her face that was so different from the sophisticated hardness that she had worn on it in the kitchen , and wondering what is this anyway ? what the hell have you gotten into , Milton , you and your woman 's intuition ? " Come here , " he said , hoarsely , gently . " Come here , little baby . Come here to me . " The great gentleness that was in him , that he was always wanting to bring forward but never couid , rose up in him now like a flood , blindingly . " Oh , " Karen said . " I never knew it could be like this . " Outside the rain thrummed ceaselessly and cascaded ceaselessly from the roof , and in the street the sound of the stiff brooms of afternoon Fatigue grated soothingly , above the rain . CHAPTER 10THE appointment of Pvt Bloom to Pfc did not come as a surprise to G Company . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Bloom , who , until he suddenly went out for Company Smokers last year and then followed it up with Regimental and four wins in the Bowl , had only been one of the many other doughy faces peering with forlorn grins out of the Company 's yearly photograph . From a less than mediocre soldier Bloom had vaulted , using the sturdy pole of boxing politics , into the position of being the only private , Pfc or otherwise , whom Old Ike ever called out of the ranks to give Close Order and who was being groomed for Corporal . And the non-jockstrap faction in the perpetual feud was very bitter in its denouncement of the obvious favoritism . Capt Holmes would have been shocked , then hurt , then probably indignant , if he could have known the reaction Bloom 's Pfc had on the majority of the privates in his Company , but only a little of their muttered comments ever reached him , and that only after it had been watered down until it was considered suitable for his ears by those of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had particularly been Bloom 's friends , welcomed him into their fold with much brotherlinessand defended him violently . They had to do this in order to perpetuate their doctrine that jockstraps made better leaders , and which had always been their justification against the bitter mutteringsof the straight duty privates who could not make a rating . Little Maggio , the gambler and ex-shipping clerk for Gimbel 's Basement , was particularly bitter and incensed . " If I had knew , " he said to Prewitt , whose bunk was two beds from his own in Chief Choate 's squad , " if I had only knew what : his man 's Army had been like . Of all the people in this outfit , they give that vacant Pfc to Bloom . Because he is a punchie . " " What did you expect , Angelo ? " Prew grinned . " He ai nt even a good soljer , mind you , " Maggio said bitterly . " He 's ony just a punchie . I 'm only out of ree-croot drill a month and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Soljerin ai nt what does it . " " But it ought a be . You wait , man . If I ever get out of this Army , you just wait . Draft or no draft , they 'll never get me back . " " Balls , " Prew grinned . " You got all the makins of a thirty year man . I can see it on you a block away . " " Do nt say that , " Maggio said , violently . " I mean it . I like you , but I do nt like even you that much . Thirty year man ! Not me , buddy . If I 'm goin to be a valet , yard man , and general handyman for some fuckin officer , I 'm goin to get paid for it , see ? " " You 'll re-enlist , " Prew said . " I 'll re-enlist , " Maggio said chanting the old bugle call parody , " in a pig 's ass hole . If anybody should of had that rating , man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soljer in this outfit for my dough . By a hunert million miles . " The rainy season 's course of indoor lectures had given Maggio an admiration for Prew as a soldier . His feverish quick-moving eyes had not missed Prew 's competence with the rifle , pistol , BAR and MG and with all their nomenclatures , all old stuff from his previous enlistment . But his admiration for Prew as a soldier had jumped a hundredpercent when he found out Prew had been a fighter in the 27th and refused to fight for Holmes . He could not understand it , but with his ingrained championing of the underdog , learned at Gimbel 's and not lessened by the Army , he admired it . He had watched Prew 's soldiering from a distance admiringly , but it was not until he found out about the other thing that he offered open friendship . " If you 'd of decided to punch for Dynamite you would of got that rating . You can bet your balls you 'd got it . And you want to spend thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prew grinned , and agreed , but he said nothing . There wasnt anything for him to say. 126 127 " Come on , " Maggio said disgustedly . " Lets get a game goin in the latrine . Maybe I can win enough to go to town . " " Okay , " Prew said , still grinning , following him . The rainy season had been good to him . The leisurely lectures in the Dayroom and the practical work of field- and detail-stripping and assembling the various pieces on the chilly porches with the sound of rain outside were things he liked , and since they were conducted by a single officer or noncom for the Company as a whole , they gave him respite from the vengeful eye of Old Ike Galovitch who seemed bent on protecting the honor of the Great God Holmes , ever since he first found out that Prew had refused to fight . Also , the ending of the boxing season had relieved the tension he had brought into the Company , temporarilyat least . The three globed lights in the first floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was spread out on the concrete floor between the row of commodes in open stalls on one wall and the urinal trough and washbowls on the other , and the six men sat down around it . Maggio , shuffling the cards , looked over at the topless , seatless , commodesin their stalls where three men were sitting with their pants down , and held his nose . " Hey , " he said , " is this a goddam cardroom ? or a la-trine ? Attensh-HUT ! Da-ress Right , DHRESS ! " The men looked up from their magazines , cursed , and went back to business . " Deal the cards , Angelo , " Anderson , the company bugler , said . " Deal the cards . " " Sure , " said Salvatore Clark , the apprentice bugler , grinning shyly under his long Italian nose . " Deal them cards , Wop , or I 'll put you down and shove them up you , see ? " He laughed then , with rich shy humor , unable to keep to his self-appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggio said . " I 'll deal these cards . I 'm stackin these cards . " He held the deck in his open left hand , index finger crooked professionally around the top . " You couldnt stack shit with a shovel , Angelo , " Prew said . " Listen , " Maggio said . " I learn to deal these cards in Brooklyn , see ? on Atlantic Avenue , where anything less than a royal flush never had a chance . " He riffled the cards from right hand to left , as near as he could come to the delicate card ladder of professional gamblers . He began to deal . The game was stud . And each of them was suddenly alone , engrossed . Prew laid the fifty cents in nickels he had borrowed from Pop Karelsen , Sgt of the Weapons Platoon and intellectual friend of CplMazzioli , and who had taken a liking to him when he found out he knew machineguns , on the blanket and winked at Clark . " Boy , " said Sal Clark fervently . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take it over to O'Hayer 's and make a killing . " It was the hope and dream of all of them . " I 'd take that of Honolulu over , I mean . I 'd rent me the whole friggin New Congress Hotel for one whole night , and the ones I couldnt lay I 'd have to watch and give advice . " He , who could never get up nerve enough to even go to a whorehouse unless someone was with him , chuckled and grinned shyly at his own deception . " You ai nt never been to the New Congress , have you Prew ? You ai nt never been to Mrs Kipfer 's , have you ? " " I ai nt had the money yet , " Prew said . He looked at Sal , feeling a warmness of protection , and then across at his sidekick Andy who was engrossed sullenly in his cards , and then back at Sal , on whose account it was mainly that he had finally made friends with them . Sal Clark with his shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who is utterly without malice , envy , distrust , or the desire to better himself and so incompetent to maintain himself in our society , and who the prosperous business men , joyously robbing each other every chance they got , fed and clothed and protectedtenderly , as if in some metaphysical way he with his undistractedmind might make a plea for them with God , or save them from their consciences . In the same way , Sal Clark was taken care of and respected as the talisman of the Company . Anderson had made overtures of friendship to Prew several times , and on Payday after Prew had blown in his pay , he even offered to loan him money , but every time he came around Prew had cut him off , because Andy 's eyes never focused on his face but always on one side or the other , and Prew did not want for friends men who feared him . And it was not until Sal Clark with his wide , deep , uncomprehendingdoelike eyes had asked him trustingly to be friends that he suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those warm February nights before the rainy season started when the stars seemed near enough to finger . He had come out of the smoky drunkenness of Choy 's feeling the beer all through him lightly and stopped in the lighted tunnel of the sallyport that funneled the large sounds of the night . Across the quad the lights in the 2nd Battalion were still on and shadow figures moved across the porches in front of them . The dark quadrangle was sprinkled with the lightning bugs of cigaret butts , clustered around128 129pitchers of beer , glowing as some one dragged and then fading out again . From over in the far corner near the bugler 's megaphone came the ringing chords of a guitar and voices raised in four-part harmony . It was rule of thumb harmony , but it was closely knit and it carried clear and sharp across the quad , sounding good . And in the slowly moving harmony he recognized Sal 's twanging nasal , standing out , more hillbilly than any mountain man , although he was a long nosed Wop from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feelin mighty weary , from my head down to my shoes . . . Got to keep a rollin . . . truckdriver 's blues . . . Never did have nothin , got nothin much to lose . . . Got a lowdown feelin . . . truckdriver 's blues . " And the utter simplicity of the plaintive lament in Sal Clark 's voice reached out and touched him . He felt his anger and indignation at Warden and this setup dwindling away into a kind of deep perceptivemelancholy for which there were no words . It was all in the words of the song , but the words actually said nothing at all ; except that a truckdriver was weary and had the blues . The music came to him across the now bright , now dull , slowly burning cigaret of each man 's life , telling him its ancient secret of all men , intangible , unfathomable , defying longwinded descriptions , belying intricate cataloguings , simple , complete , asking no more , giving no less , words that said nothing yet said all there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had driven the ox sled through the summer hills in the Kentucky mountains , the song of the Choctaw on his reservation , the song of the man who had laid the rollers for the stones heavy as death to build the glorious monument to the king . In the simple meaningless words he saw himself , and Chief Choate , and Pop Karelsen , and Clark , and Anderson , and Warden , each struggling with a different medium , each man 's path running by its own secret route from the same source to the same inevitable end . And each man knowing as the long line moved as skirmishers through the night woodsey jungle down the hill that all the others were there with him , each hearing the faint rustlings and straining to communicate , each wanting to reach out and share , each wanting to be known , but each unable , as Clark 's whining nasal was unable , to make it known that he was there , and so each forced to face alone whatever it was up ahead , in the unmapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other clerks who congregated mornings at Choy'sto discuss Art and Life were blind . He knew them , so involved in intricate conversation , so secure in pointless argument , they could not see the thing they sought to grasp lay right before them , all around them , and could be touched only momentarily , but never grasped and held by any sharp dissection . It spoke now from the bottomless shallowsof a hillbilly song that in its artless simplicity said everything their four-dollar words could never say , went back to a basic simplicity that gave a sudden flashing picture of all life that could never be explained and an understanding of it that could never be expressed . The clerks , the kings , the thinkers ; they talked , and with their talking ran the world . The truckdrivers , the pyramid builders , the straight duty men ; the ones who could not talk , they built the world out of their very tonguelessness  --  so the talkers could talk about how to run it , and the ones who built it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the straight duty man would build it up again , simply because they were hunting for some way to speak . He could feel it all there in the song , and in Sal Clark 's howling painful nasal voice . " Feelin mighty weary . . . never did have nothin . . . got a lowdown feelin . . . truckdriver 's blues . " He had walked a zigzag trail through the parties of beer drinkers over to the corner and stood on the outskirts of the little crowd that always congregates around a guitar player . There was a small group of five actors who were the center . The others , lumped deferentially as onlookers , stood around and sang or listened , beneath the superiority of the creative circle . Andy and Clark had swung into San Antonio Rose , and Prew circled around the outer edge , listening but making no attempt to enter , and Andy had caught sight of him . " Hey , Prew ! " he called , a fawning in his voice . " We need a guitarman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , thanks , " he said shortly , as ashamed of the flattery in Andy as if it had been in himself , and turned to go . " Aw , come on , " Andy urged , looking at him through the opening that the crowd had made , his eyes moving all around his face but never resting on it . " Sure , Prew , come on , " Sal seconded eagerly his wide eyes shining blackly with enthusiasm . " Boy , we 're havin a lot of fun . We even got beer tonight . Say , " he added , rushing the new thought out , " I 'm gettin pooped out . How about you takin this one for a while ? " It was the greatest offering he could make , but it was the obviousness of it that hit Prew . " Okay , " he said curtly . He walked over and took the proffered130 131guitar and sat down in the middle of the group . " What 'll we play ? " " How about Red River Valley ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite . Prew nodded and hit a tentative chord , and they swung into it . As they played Clark pressed the beer pitcher upon him . " It ai nt as good as Andy 's new one , " Sal said , nodding at his guitar . " He sold it to me cheap when he bought the new one . Its beat up , but its good enough for me , to learn on . " " Sure , " Prew said . Sal squatted in front of them holding the beer pitcher . He was grinning with great joy and he sang the song in that whining nasal , his eyes half shut , his head back and on one side , almost drowning out the rest . When it ended , he took Prew 's empty beercan that had its top cut off to serve as a glass and filled it . " Here , Prew , " he said anxiously . " You gon na play , you 'll want to wet your whistle . Singin makes a guy get dry . " " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth with the back of his hand and looked at Andy . " How about my Talkin Blues ? " Andy offered , It was his specialty , that he never liked to do when there was a crowd , but now he was offering it to Prew . " Okay , " Prew said , and hit a chord to start it off . " I been lookin for you to come around , " Sal Clark said , above the music . " I been hopin you 'd come around , Prew boy . " " I been busy , " Prew said , not looking up . Sal nodded quickly . " Yeah , " he said , with grotesque sympathy . " I know you have . Say , any time you want to play this old box , you just get it out a my locker . Do nt bother to ever ask me , I never lock it . " Prew had looked up then , at the candid happiness that was on the long thin olive face because he 'd lost an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd said , " and thanks , Sal , thanks a lot . " He had bent his face back to the strings , feeling warm himself , because he too had made two friends today ... . " Two whores , " Maggio said , flipping over with its mate the queen he had for hole card . " Two bullets , " Prew grinned , turning up his own . He reached out and scooped in the small handful of change frorn the blanket . There was a chorus of groans and curses as he added it to the four dollars he had won in the past two hours . " A little more of this , " he said , and I 'll have enough to hit O'Hayer 's shed for a big lick . " While they had played the guard bugler had sounded a watery Tattoo from the corner of the rainy muddy quad , and there had been a sudden influx of last minute pissers before they went to bed , and the CQ had come around and thrown the light switches in the squadrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon-doors of the latrine there were the heavy silences and soft stirrings of a great deal of sleep . But the game had gone on concentratedlythrough it all with that passionate singularity generally attributed to love , but which few men ever feel , for women . " I might of knew it , " Maggio said dejectedly . He pulled down the strap of his undershirt and scratched his bony shoulder tragically . " **27;5894;TOOLONG . Any man catches an ace paired on the last card should have to throw in his hand or be outlawed from our club , thats all . " " You 're as cold as a well digger 's ass in the Klondike , Angelo , " Prew grinned . " Yeah ? " Maggio glowered . " You believe it : its so . Gim me them goddam cards , men . Its my deal . " He turned to Clark . " Hear that , Nose ? Prewitt says it : Its so . " Maggio fingered his own big nose as he slapped the deck down for Prew to cut . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dint know my father was never out of Brooklyn in his life , I 'd lay you money you was my kid brother . If I had money , that is . " Sal Clark grinned shyly . " My nose ai nt big enough to be your brother . " Maggio rubbed his hands together briskly and then ran each finger and his thumbs across his nose . " Now , " he said , " now . Here we go . I 've changed my luck . Better'n a nigger any time , " he said , patting his big nose . He began to deal . " Who ever pinned you with the monicker of Clark , Ciolli ? You 're a traitor to the Italian people , Ciolli . You snob . " " Hell , " Sal grinned , unable to keep his face straight like Maggio 's . " I can help it ? if the immigration people couldnt spell Ciolli ? " " Comeon , Angelo , " Prew said . " Deal the cards . You cant make money you do nt deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thats what I cant win for , " Maggio said briskly . " You 're a Wop , Ciolli . A greasy , hooknosed Wop . I do nt know you . First jack bets . " " Bet five . " Andy threw in a nickel . Clark glowered comically , trying to narrow his fawn 's eyes . " I'm132 133a hard man , Angelo . Do nt mess with me . I 'll pull you apart . Ask Prewitt will I pull you apart . " " You 'll never get rich on five , " Maggio said to Andy . " Lets make it ten . " He threw in a dime . " Is that right , Prew ? Is this Ciolli boy really tough ? " " I call , " Prew said . " Sure he 's tough . He 's hard . I 'm teachin him the manly art of self-defense . " He looked at his hole card . Sal grinned delightedly under his huge nose . " Then he 's hard , " Maggio said . " I quit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " he said , " its up to you , Jew-boy . Ten to you , you char-acter . " " I call , " said Pvt Julius Sussman , who had been losing steadily , " but I do nt know why . Where 'd you learn to deal such stinking hands ? " " I learn to deal these cards in Brooklyn , as you would know if you had of ever got out of The Bronx for air . I 'm a Card Dealer . Queen is high . " " Bets five , " Sussman said disgustedly . " You 're nutward material , Angelo , thats what you are . The original Ward Eleven Kid . You better re-enlist . " " I 'll re-enlist , " Maggio said . " Right in your eye , with all six inches of it . " He looked at his hole card . " Two more weeks till payday . I 'm ona hit Honolulu like a fifty caliber . Look out , Service Rooms ! " He picked up the deck . " Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sussman said . " A good piece of ass and a ride on my motor would kill you , Angelo . " " Listen to him , " Maggio said , looking around . " The Waikiki Beach Kid . Him and his motorcycle and his one string git-tar . Last time around , " he said . " Last time around . Any cuts , burns , or bruises . " " Dealem , " Prew said . " The man says dealem . " Angelo passed the cards , his thin hand flickering nervously , pouring out the energy , as he deftly made the round . " I aim to win this , friends . Oh , oh . Two Jacks to Andy . Jesus Christ ! I closed my eyes . Two Jacks bets . " " Its a ukelele , " Sussman explained . " Originally Hawaiian instermint . And besides , it gets the wahines . Thats all I care . My motor gets more pussy than all the dough in this compny . " " Then why do nt you put the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You cant even play it anyway . " " I do nt have to play it , " Sussman said . " Its ony atmosphere . " Maggio peeked tentatively at his holecard . " When I have to startplayin a one string fiddle and buy me a motorcycle on time to get wahines , I 'll start payin my three bucks at the window . " " You pay your three bucks at the window now , Angelo , " Sussman , whose motor was the dearest thing in his life , said testily . " Thats what I said , dint I ? " Maggio said disgustedly . " I call that two bits , Andy , and hump it two . Four bits to Reedy . " " Horse frocky , " said Pvt Readall Treadwell , the sixth man , who had not won a single hand and who came from southern Pennsylvania . He heaved the fat-lined barrel that was his chest and belly in a lazy sigh and turned over his cards and tossed them in . His round face grinned lazily , belying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftness of little Maggio he was like a fat cross-legged Buddha . " You guys done broke me . I ai nt got no business playin cards with sharpers no ways . " " Hell , " Maggio said . " You still got twenty cents . Stick around . I 'm just beginning to win . " " Gotohell , " Treadwell said , getting up . " I got enough for two beers left is all . An I aim to drink em , not you . Ah cant play poker no ways . " " Hell no , " Maggio agreed . " All you 're good for is a BAR man , to lug that 27 pounds around so some noncom can take it away from you when its time to shoot it . " " Man , you know it , " Reedy Treadwell said . But having stood up , he was no longer a part of the circle . He stood behind them looking down a minute , then ambled out , no unhappier than if he had won ten dollars . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I almost hated to take his money . But I convinced myself . Everybody in this cornpnyis characters except me and Prewitt . And sometimes I 'm gettin so I wonder about Prewitt . All right , all right , " he said to Andy , " what you gon na do ? " " What you got there ? " Andy stalled , sullenly studying Maggio 's cards . " You can see em , " Maggio said . " Four clubs up , one club in the hole . That makes a flush . " " Maybe you ai nt got it , " Andy said . " Call and find out , " Maggio said . " Thats my advice to you . " " You checked the bet on the last card , " Andy said sullenly . " You checked a cinch into me . " " I dint have that last club on the last card , " Maggio said . " Quit stallin . You gon na call ?

" Balls ! " Maggio said . " You seen them four clubs up before you bet . Put the blame on Mame . " " I call , " Andy said . " Money talks , " Maggio said . Andy threw in a quarter , reluctantly . " How about you , Prewitt ? " Maggio grinned . " I got to call , " Prew said , studying Andy 's face . " I 'm low man on this totem pole , but if he 's ony got a pair I got him beat . " He threw in his money . " Read em and weep , " Angelo chortled , triumphantly turning up the fifth club . He reached out and scooped in the money , letting it trickle through his fingers and making a high chuckle like a miser . " You better quit now , " he said to Prew , " if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old nose , see ? and I 'm hot as Big Virginia'sdouble shunt . " " It wont last , " Prew said , taking a last drag on his tailormade and flipping it at one of the commodes . " Hey , " Maggio said . " The butt . The butt . Do nt throw it away , you capitalist . " He scrambled up and picked it up from under the commode , inhaling the smoke luxuriantly . " Lets go , " he said , " lets go . Reedy 's out : its your deal , Andy . " Sick a Bull Durham , " he said , coming back . " I worked in Gimbel'sBasement , I least had tailormade cigarets . You niggerlip them , Prewitt . You 're sloppy . You ai nt a soljer . " " A drag , " Clark said . " Gim me a drag . " " My god ! " Maggio said . " At the end of the month and two weeks till payday ? I just got it . Leave me have a drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Andy dealt the second round , face up . Clark took it gingerly and sucked , burning his fingers , and then flipped it into a commode . " So , " Maggio said . " You do nt believe it , Prewitt . You do nt think I 'll take your money . My ace is high , bet two bits . " " Jesus Christ ! " Prew said . " Its your own fault , " Maggio said . " I warned you . " Andy dealt the next round and Maggio 's ace was still high . It stayed high through the whole hand and won it for him . He won the next hand , and the next one , and the one after that . The sparking energy radiating from his knobby bony frame seemed almost to callto him the cards he wanted and repel the good cards from the others . " Man , " Maggio said , " I 'm hot . I can feel it in my belly . A nail , Prewitt , " he said bitterly , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grinning , Prew reluctantly pulled out his almost empty pack . " First you take my money , then you want me to provide you with tobacco . I had to borrow money to buy this pack . " " Buy another pack , " Maggio said . " You got money now , you hebe . " " Buy your own pack . If I furnish butts to the players , then I cut the game . I 'll split it , " he grinned , " but thats all I 'll do , see ? " He handed out two of his small stock , one to Maggio and Sussman , the other to Andy and Sal , and took one for himself . The others passed their paired cigarets back and forth between them as they played , and as Angelo went on winning . Andy was dealing when the saloondoors opened and Pfc Bloom came in , pushing the door back so hard it banged against the wall and then swung back and forth squeaking loudly . Pfc Bloom advanced on the men around the blanket with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinky head , so big the tremendous shoulders seemed to fill the door . " Quiet , jerk , " Maggio said . " You want the CQ up here and break up the game ? " " To hell with the CQ , " Bloom said , in his customary loud voice . " And you too , you little Wop . " A transformation went over Maggio . He stood up and walked around the blanket , up to the huge Bloom who towered over him . " Listen , " he said in a contorted voice . " I 'm particular who calls me Wop . I ai nt big and tough , and I ai nt one of Dynamite 's third rate punchies . But I 'm still Maggio to you . I wont mess with you . I work you over , I 'll do it with a chair or a knife . " He stared up at Bloom , his thin face twisted , his eyes blazing . " Oh yeah ? " Bloom said . " Yeah , yeah , " Maggio said sarcastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head forward pugnaciously on the thin bony shoulders , and there was the sudden attentive silence that always precedes a fight . " Lay off , Bloom , " Prew said , surprised at the clear loudness of his voice in the silence . " Come on and sit down , Angelo . Five up to you . " " I call , " Maggio said without looking around . " Take off , you hum , " he said over his shoulder as he walked away . Bloom laughed after him self-confidently and nastily. 136 137 " Deal me in , " Bloom said , elbowing in between Sussman and Sal Clark . " We got five players , " Maggio said . " Yeah ? " Bloom said . " So what ? You can take seven players in draw poker . " " This is stud , " Maggio said . " You can take ten then , " Bloom said , missing the point . " Maybe we do nt want no more , " Prew said , squinting at his holecardthrough the smoke of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What'sa matter ? Ai nt my money no good ? " " Not if its in your pocket , " Maggio said . " Its probly counterfeit . " Bloom laughed loudly . " You 're a character , Angelo . " " To you I 'm Maggio . Private Maggio . " " Cheer up , " Bloom laughed . " You may make Pfc yourself someday , kid . " He looked down and brushed the new stripes on his shirt caressingly . " I hope not , " Maggio said . " I sincerely , truly hope not . I might turn out to be a son of a bitch , too . " " Hey , " Bloom said . " You mean me ? Are you callin me a son of a bitch ? " " If the shoe fits , friend , you wear it , " Maggio said . Bloom looked at him a minute , puzzled , not sure if he had been insulted or not , not able to understand why the antagonism , then he decided to laugh . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you was serious . Who 's got all the cigarets ? " he asked . Nobody answered . Bloom looked around , and spotted the bulge in Prew 's shirt pocket . " Gim me a butt , Prewitt . " " I ai nt got any , " Prew said . " Yeah ? What 's that in your pocketr Come on , give us a butt . " Prcw raised his face impassively . " An empty pack , " he lied , staringin Bloom 's eyes without embarrassment . " I just killed it . " " Yeah ? " Bloom laughed sarcastically . " All believes that stand on their head . Give us the butt on that one then . " " Sure , friend . " Prew flipped the butt of his cigaret contemptuously . It lit on the floor near Bloom , under a commode . " Hey ! " Bloom protested . " You think I 'll smoke that ? after its rolled in all that piss ? Thats a hell of a way for a guy to act , for Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , " Maggio said . " Tasted good to me . " " Yeah ? " Bloom said . " Well maybe I ai nt sunk that low yet . When I do , I 'll pick me up some horseturds and roll my own . " 138 " Suit yourself , " Maggio said . He crawled over and picked up the butt in question and smoked it himself . " Just watch out , " he said , crawling back , " you do nt pick the wrong one up and smoke your self . " Sal Clark had been collecting the cards for the new hand , keeping his face averted embarrassedly from all the antagonism that had come in with Bloom , as if he did not want to see it . " Shall I deal him in ? " he asked Prew gently . " I guess so , " Prew said . " What 're you ? " Bloom sneered . " His man Friday ? Do you ask him when its time to crap ? " Sal hung his head and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , " Prew shot back , seeing Sal 's face . " You do nt like it ? " Bloom shrugged indifferently . " Its no skin off my ass . " Sal looked at Prewitt gratefully as he began to deal . But Bloom did not even see it . With Bloom 's entrance the centrality of the game disintegrated and the close comradeship was gone . Everybody played silently . There were no more wisecracks . It might have been the big game in O'Hayer 's shed . Maggio won several more hands and every time Bloom cursed loudly . " For Christ 's sake , shut up ! " Julius Sussman said finally . " You make me wish I 'm not a Jew . " " Yeah ? " Bloom snarled elaborately . " What 're you ? ashamed of beingJewish ? Maybe you ai nt a Jew ; maybe you 're a stinking greaser . " " Maybe I am . " " Sure , maybe he is , " Maggio said . " He ai nt no frigging kike , thats sure . Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of this . I 'm going over to O'Hayer 's shed and run this pocketful of change into some real dough . " " Hey , wait a minute , " Bloom said , jumping to his feet . " You ai nt quittin winners , are you ? " " Sure I 'm quittin winners , " Maggio said . " You think I 'm gon na quit losers ? Where 'd you learn to gamble ? your mother 's sewing circle ? " " You cant quit winners , " Bloom said . " And take the money over to the sheds out of the game . " " Yeah ? " Maggio said . " You watch me . " Bloom turned to the seated circle . " You guys gon na let him get by with that ? He 's got your dough too . "
