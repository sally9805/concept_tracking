 | There 's been an accident . " How those cold and impersonal words can send a stab of fear through any one of us . We all hope we 'll never hear them applied to ourselves or anyone close to us . Yet the chances are great that someday we will play an unwilling part in an automobile accident , and even if it involves no more than a bashed-in fender or a shattered headlight , it will entail certain obligations and privileges . We should know about them , to be prepared for the possible , unhappy contingency . Before I list the things you should do in an accident . I 'd like to pass along a piece of general advice based on years of observing women drivers : If your automobile is involved in an accident , keep your head . Do not become panicky , lose your temper , argue . make accusations , or even say much about the accident itself . Woman 's tears . reputed to be effective on so many occasions , should not now be in evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as you write down names and license numbers and attend to other details . This is not idle advice . If the smashup proves to be serious . or if you are later sued , anything you said or did at the time . anything you signed , can be used against you in court . So behave with quiet dignity , and give only such information as is required : your name and address , license numbers , etc . If you are in any way involved in an accident , your first duty is to stop . The hit-and-run driver is behaving both irresponsibly and immorally . And if he is caught , the act of running away counts heavily against him . So stop immediately and stay at the scene until you are certain everything has been properly taken care of . The most serious accidents are , of course , those in which someone is hurt . If this occurs , see that a doctor or an ambulance is sent for at once . Unless there is danger of worse injury , such as the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to move the patient . Keep him warm with a coat or robe ; give him first aid only if you are experienced . When you send for help , be sure to give accurate directions . Even if a person who appears to he hurt protests that he does n't need a doctor , it 's best to get medical attention ? for his sake and your own . We 've all heard of accidents where those involved decided later ( either honestly or otherwise ) that their injuries were more serious than they first appeared . A doctor 's examination may prevent a suit against you . Perhaps you will be helped by one of the many accidentaid groups that have been set up all over the country , especially where there are through highways . In the state where I live , they are called Rescue Squads , and they are well organized , equipped , and trained . @#  | As soon as medical help is on its way , : he police ( either state or local ) . Or t report the accident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ther an accident involves bodily inor only automobile damage , always rt it to the police ; it 's further proon against unfair or unwarranted ands by the other driver . If the age is extensive , do not move the until an officer arrives . Give him name , address , license numbers , and other routine information . It is not ssary to give more than the simplest ription of the accident . The officer 's rt will show his interpretation , based the stories of both sides and what he rues at the scene . In every state except one , you are ged to report certain types of acci. is to the police . A few states require orts only if there is bodily injury ; -s , where car damage exceeds a cersum ( often $100 ) . Laws also differ . it the period within which you must an account ? some allowing you as as twenty-four hours , others as ch as two months . Ask the attending r about the law of the state you are he will furnish you with an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you were to blame does not relieve you of this - The driver of every car involved st file a report . - But , " I hear women say , " I do n't want call the police or report a small act and get a bad record . " There are two reasons this is a foolish etude . First , the law in forty-seven : es requires you to report certain accits . Second , a report made at the time prove to be your greatest friend if , cr. a suit should be filed against you . for getting a " bad record . " only a perwho is frequently involved in accits need be concerned about this ; and I sure we all agree that such a person ld be kept off the road . NCIDENTALLY , while you wait for the octor or police , be sure to warn onrning cars , especially after dark . When s has n't been done , a two-car accident often turned into a three- or fourjam-up , or a person trying to be 1pful has been struck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , : : derchiefs or similar articles can be aced as warning flags along the road in ach direction . After the doctor and police have been for , and everything possible has en done for anyone who is hurt , make notes for future use . Write down the carne , address , telephone number , and car and driver 's licenses of the other car 's driver ; the car owner 's name , if he was n't driving ; the name of his insurance company ; and a brief description of the car . Record any other details you might find useful : the names and addresses of the other car 's occupants , any witnesses , the doctor , the ambulance attendant , and the hospital to which the injured person was taken . If time allows ( or do this Later ) , add comments on the weather , -. erne of day , etc . Did you blow your horn ? Was there a stop sign , a traffic : : ght ? Was the road slippery ? Were your headlights on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Your last report , which should alo. made promptly , is to your automol.  - -  insurance company . Always carry your license the identification card f nished by your insurance company .
