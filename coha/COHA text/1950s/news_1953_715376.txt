txt Chancellor of the Exchequer R. A. Butler gave Britain a budget today that cut income and sales taxes as well as corporation levies in a program designed to give incentive for greater production . For the first time since World War II , a British Chancellor proposed no new taxes or increases of old ones . On the contrary , he cut 5 per cent off the basic 471h per cent rate of income tax , slashed the hated purchase tax by a minimum of 25 per cent , promised inIdustry that the excess profits tax would end next January and granted substantial offsets in taxes to industries willing to invest money to increase production . ' The first reaction to his budget proposals was one of relief among the ordinary taxpayers that their burden was to be lightened rather ' than increased for a change . But ' the most far-reaching effects of the change in Britain 's economic land financial policy are likely to Ibe reflected in the nation 's industry , agriculture and commerce . A Spur to Foreign Trade From the viewpoint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Butler was to restore offsets against taxes for capital expenditure on plant and machinery and the'construction of industrial buildings and mining works . These offsets will operate for the profits tax as well as the income tax and should go a long ' way toward improving Britain 's competitive position in world trade by improving her plant capacity . For investment in plant and machinery the allowance will be 20 per cent of the amount invested and for the construction of industrial buildings 10 per cent , For investments on new mining works , both at home and abroad , the rate was increased from 10 to 40 per cent . That Mr. Butler 's second budget as a Conservative Chancellor was destined to be popular was apparent not only from the cheers of his supporters in the House of Commons and the speechlessness of the Opposition , but from the relief of the ordinary taxpayer . Inevitably it will revive speculation as to whether Prime Minister Churchill is thinking of a post-coronation autumn election to increase his narrow majority in the Commons , an eventuality that most professional politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to find a margin for granting tax relief without cutting appropriations for defense or the social services . In fact , he estimated that , of total expenditures for the coming year of ? 4,259,000,000 ( $11,925,200,000 ) , defense would cost ? 1,497,000,000 and the social services ? 1,264,000,000 . This allocation of about onethird of the budget for defense compares with a figure near 60 per cent in the United States . The defense estimate was up , ? 108,000,000 over last year and that for social services ? 80,000 , - 000 . The total estimated expenditure for the coming year was up by ? 108,000,000 over last year 's estimate . From his speech in the Commons it was apparent that Mr. Butler hoped to make good the losses from his tax concessions to a large extent by economies in Government spending and increased revenues from customs and excise duties . The excess profits levy , which he promised to eliminate next Janulary , is expected to yield f100,000 , - 000 in the interim . He estimated that reductions in the purchase tax and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other minor concessions would cost #7,000,000 . The income tax reduction of sixpence ( about 7 cents ) for each pound ( $2.80 ) that is taxable will mean a loss of revenue of ? 117,000,000 . This makes a total reduction in taxation in the coming year of ? 169,000,000 . At the same time , Mr. Butler explained that he was budgeting for a surplus of #109,000,000 , exclusive of capital investment , about ? 20,000,000 more than was realized in the past year and sufficient , he thought , to absorb any inflationary surplus of buying power . Of all the taxes the British are called upon to pay , none is more burdensome to the consumer and industry than the purchase tax . This differs from a sales tax in that it is paid by the retailer or middleman to the manufacturer and then passed on to the consumer . On some luxury goods it ' has been 100 per cent of the wholesale purchase price . The automobile industry , with its curtailed export market , the slowly recovering textile industry and many other specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifling them . Mr. Butler slashed it by onefourth and in some cases of de- , pressed industries even more . The tax on jewelry and silverware , for instance , was cut from 100 to 75 Iper cent . The tax of 66 2/3 per 1cent on automobiles , radio and television sets , refrigerators , vacuum cleaners and washing machines was reduced to 50 per cent . The purchase tax on all sorts ' of household goods , hardware and bicycles was cut from 33 1/3 to 25 per cent . Taxicabs , which have been disappearing from the London streets at an alarming rate because of the diminution of their profits , ' will be exempt from purchase tax and can be bought freely on the installment plan . Amateur sports and theatricals and all cricket matches are freed from the entertainment tax . Referring to the heavy taxation under which Britain has suffered since the war began , Mr. Butler said long-term planning was not enough and that " an immediate quickener is indicated " to " banish the hopeless feeling that extra effort is not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , that would " relieve corporate industry and will not forget the vital human element . " He proposed to reduce the standard rate of income tax from 9s 6d in the pound to 9s . More than half the benefit of this reduction , he said , will go to corporate industry and the rest to individuals in every walk of life . At current levels of profits and dividends , the sixpenny reduction represents f45,000,000 relief on the undistributed profits of corporations . Whether the new budget will prove in fact to be , as some economists said tonight , the most potent shot in the arm the British economy has had since economic pressure forced Sir Stafford Cripps to devalue the pound is for time to tell . However , it is true , as Mr. Butler said in the House , that the Government of which he is a part has " moved for the first time in a. new direction . " He called upon the British people to " step out from the confines of restriction to the almost forgotten ? but beckoning prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
