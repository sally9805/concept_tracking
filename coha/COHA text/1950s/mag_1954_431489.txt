 | Behind the scenes with the American evangelist 's historic crusade in England Mrs. Billy Graham Tells the Story By ' Stanley High NOT SINCE the Dwight L. Moody revival in the late 19th century IN has Great Britain been as deeply stirred as by U. S. evangelist Billy Graham 's Greater London Crusade last spring . The 35-year-old Southern Baptist minister from Montreat , N. C. , confounded skeptics who predicted that his fiery preaching , so successful in America , would fall flat in England . " Three short months have transformed the atmosphere of Britain , " wrote the editor of the British Intelligence Digest . " The Archbishop of Canterbury became enthusiastic ; the Prime Minister sent for Dr. Graham ; the first Sea Lord went to the inquiry rooms after hearing Billy Graham , And so likewise did many thousands from all walks of life . The effects seem to he a calm , a confidence , an escape from the house built on shifting sands to i hat built on rock . This remarkable occurrence is of first historic importance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through May , Billy Graham preached in Harringay Arena ? a 12,000-capacity sports palace which ,  | so Graham 's associates were warned , few sports events ever filled and no man in Britain , save possibly Churchill , could hope to fill two nights in a row . For 72 nights , except for four when there were serious storms , Gra ham 's preaching filled it often twice . On a network of landwires , the Harringay services were sent to capacity audiences in halls and churches in 400 communities throughout England , Scotland , and Wales . More than 38,000 persons registered their " decisions for Christ . " In all this , no one , save Billy Graham himself , was more actively engaged than Ruth Bell Graham , his wife . Daughter of missionary parents , she was a dedicated member of the 3o-person " Graham team , " which handled arrangements , answered letters and phone calls . Her days in London were filled with engagements all single-mindedly aimed to help her husband 's ministry . Every night at Harringay she worked ' as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their public decision and came for guidance to the inquiry room . But Mrs. Graham found time to write her parents in North Carolina . Her father permitted me to read these letters and I received Mrs. Graham 's consent to publish excerpts from them . They tell from behind the scenes the amazing story of the Greater London Crusade . They begin late in February , when Dr. and Mrs. Graham and several associates , arriving in England , were greeted in the press with an outpouring of scorn and hostility . Billy was headlined as a " Hot Gospeller " ; his Crusade as a " Gospel Circus " ; his beliefs as " Fifty Years Out of Date . " When , at London 's Waterloo Station , he was met by the biggest crowd sinc the arrival of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks 30 years before , on headline was : " Film Stars ? So Why Not Billy ? " A Daily Mirror columnis wrote , " Now comes an Export from God 's Own Country to tell us what t think and what to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dearest Folks : This is all fantastic . Last Tuesday , somewhere between the Isle of Wight and Southampton , a tug full of pressmen pulled alongside the liner : 25 reporters , i i photographers . I knew they were after Bill 's scalp and there was nothing we could do but pray for wisdom and be as courteous as we could . Several followed me . Their first observation was : " I see you still wear make-up . " " Is it true , " one asked , " that you husband carries around his own special jug of water for baptisms ? " Bill wore a gray flannel sport-coat and a tie with small gray and black checks . So one wrote : " No clerical collar , but my what a lovely tie ! " A reporter told me : " Mrs. Graham , I am disappointed in your husband . " " Is that right ? " ( I ca n't imagine anyone being disappointed in Bill . ) " Yes ; we expected bright , hand-  | painted ties , flashy socks and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary chap . " Ashore , Bill was interviewed on television , so I had to stand beside him . The first question was : " Who Invited you over here anyway ? " Then such killers as " Do you think you can save Britain ? " " Do n't you think you 're more needed in your own country ? " Bill 's answers were wise , really terrific . God sure helps that man ! There was one movie star aboard who should have had the press . I think only one reporter interviewed her . It was ludicrous . The greatest reception England has given anyone at Southampton since the war ? and to a preacher ! But we could see God beginning to cause man to praise Him . As we went through customs , the customs man said : " Welcome to England and good luck , sir . We need you . " A dock worker came up and said : " God bless you , sir . I am praying for you . " At the station , a soldier recognized Bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Medical Corps was coming to Harringay . As we boarded our third-class compartment , the conductor said to Bill : " I 'm not much on religion , but could do with some . " At Waterloo station we stepped out into a perfect mob . Cheers rose , everyone had a wonderful smile and the air was filled with : " God bless you ! " and " Welcome to London ! " Suddenly the crowd began singing : " And Can It Be That I Shall Gain an Interest in My Saviour 's Crown ? " I watched Bill 's slow progress through the throng of singing , cheering , laughing folks . More than 1000 British churches ? two thirds of them Church of England ? joined in the invitation which brought Billy Graham to London . Chairman of the London campaign committee was General Wilson-Haffenden ; foremost among his early supporters was Dr. H. R. Gough , Anglican Bishop of Barking . " The man I feel most sorry for in this Billy Graham business , " wrote Hannen Swaffer , Daily Herald columnist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , has become the American evangelist 's bestknown British sponsor . " Dearest Folks : Bill was interviewed by a reporter from the Herald . He asked if Bill did n't feel that the crowd at Waterloo were fanatics , to which Bill replied : " Not unless you consider some of your leading clergymen , leading generals , Members of Parliament and the good Christian people who have been praying for these meetings ? not unless you consider them fanatics . " At six o'clock we had a team meeting in the lounge . There was a **26;730;TOOLONG talk from Bill on how we must conduct ourselves as Americans in England . When the Bishop of Barking came in we had just requested a prayer for him , as the Herald had been most unkind . General Wilson-Haffenden said : " Now do n't you bother to pray for the Bishop . He is where Christ  | put him . You get busy and pray for Hannen Swaffer . " And the Bishop agreed heartily : " Do n't you worry about me , Billy . If for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christ 's sake , I shall be only too happy to appear a fool with you . " Did I tell you that last night in one cold , unheated building 800 people prayed all night long on their knees for this meeting ? I went to shop for some long evening gloves since Lord and Lady Luke were to entertain us at Claridge 's with a terrifying list of Lords and Ladies . Bill was scared stiff over the guest list and the idea of having to address them . We dressed and were ready at 7:45 p.m . It was stated on the engraved invitations : " Full Dress and Decorations . " That meant medals . Claridge 's is sort of a WaldorfAstoria . Only more so . The guests were already assembling . We were taken into a lovely room where we were stopped by a man in a bright red cutaway coat and knee-britches . He asked our names and then announced in a loud voice : " Dr. and Mrs. Billy Graham ! " We stood in line with Lord and Lady Luke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man in red , shook hands with us and then went through and were served cocktails , I think you would call them . Even the evangelical bishops over here take wine and sherry . Bill and I got so full of orange juice I thought we would never want to see any again . I got so tickled once at Lord Luke . The British have a keen sense of the ridiculous . He remarked to Bill and me that he did not know many of the folks coming . When I said that in that case it was a good thing he had the gentleman in red to tell who was coming , he threw back his head and laughed . " Yes , it does give one a bit of an inkling , does n't it ? " All London is watching , talking , waiting . Something is going to happen . Friday noon Bill spoke at a luncheon of nearly woo ministers . Friday night he was guest at a dinner at the House of Commons . Around 300 attended . At Harringay , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon of the Crusade . Over too newspapermen , many still gunning for Billy , were present . " All the tricks of the modern demagogue , " wrote one . Someone remarked : " Only the people seem to be for Billy . " Dearest Folks :  | Last night it was cold and snowing . When we got to Harringay pract ically no one was going in . They all seemed to be rushing by to the dog races just behind Harringay . Then at the door : " The Arena is jammed ! " What a sight ! And what a thrill to hear them sing : " All Hail the Power of Jesus ' Name ! " How they can sing ! Bill brought a message on " Does God Matter ? " : " Many of you here tonight are like a plane in a fog which has lost contact with the airport . You are circling round and round in the monotony , confusion and drudgery of life . You can make contact with God tonight through Jesus Christ . " Two hundred and twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all we asked . An Anglo-Catholic Rector has gone through the entire counseling course and is one of the counselors . What an odd assortment are working together in these meetings ! All with one great desire : to win men to Christ and see revival come to England . Tonight by six the arena was about half filled with people who had no reservations . As the 7:30 service was completely booked by coach parties , they called Bill to hurry over , closed the doors at 6:3o , and had a wonderful service . Then , at 7:15 , they dismissed that crowd and let in the reserved crowd outside . Policemen said between 30,000 and 35,000 were waiting . There were IIOo from Wales , and it had taken them four hours by train to get there . The house mikes were turned off and the entire congregation sang : " Guide Me 0 Thou Great Jehovah " ? thrilling , majestic , imploring . Later the dear folks from Wales sang " I Will Sing of My Redeemer " to their old Welsh tune . They divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts would break . And you 're quite sure yours will . After the second service they were dismissed , and hundreds more who had waited patiently outside were let in . Bill preached a third sermon . Amazing response , so prompt , so quiet and so many . Among those I talked with were a mother backslidden for 20 years and her daughter , both very attractive ; two little usherettes from the News Theatre on Oxford street and a lovely young model . They called for a French and a Spanish-speaking counselor . Monday night a man called for someone  | speaking modern Greek . How these folk get enough from the message to come forward I do n't know . God must be bringing them . As a Russian said , " All my life , I 've wanted to receive Christ , but I did not know what I must do . As soon as I entered Harringay I felt His Presence here . Now tell me , how can I receive Him ? What must I do ? " The power of God transcends all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elsewhere throughout Great Britain , where church membership and attendance in recent years had reached an all-time low , reports now began to come to the Campaign Committee of a marked increase of worshipers , of unprecedented numbers applying for church membership , of volunteers for Christian work . " It is not too much to say , " said the London Times scale of the Crusade 's success so far . " Dearest Family : Did I tell you about one young woman converted at Harringay ? The next day the people with whom she worked looked at her curiously and one finally asked , " Good Lord , what has happened to you ? " " That 's exactly what has happened to me , " she replied . " The good Lord has come into my heart . " One night I was introduced to a rather rugged-looking white-haired man who , when he found I was Mrs. Graham , took my hand in a most un-English way and kissed it . He was a pit miner up from Newcastle . He had spent his entire year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon there was a tea for young women converts . I t was wonderful . There was a terrific testimony by a drama student who was converted last week . She has a marvelous personality and a sense of humor . She kept putting off Christ for fear He might interfere with her good times . And her idea of a riproaring good-time was an all-night party . In fact , she had scheduled one herself for last week . It was a " Heaven or Hell " party . You were to go dressed as a citizen of one or the other place . She had kept coming to Harringay and kept fighting off conviction . She knew for one thing if she received Christ she would have to call off that party , and that she could not do . But finally the conviction got so heavy she gave in and yielded her heart and life to Christ . Her eyes fairly danced as she told of the peace and joy that have been hers since . Of course word got round the drama school of her conversion due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is carrying on as a fine witness . One wonderful thing is the way Christians are bringing non-Christians . One man has started ' Operation Andrew " in his community . They have brought close to 300 friends to the services , of whom 76 have been gloriously converted . How the tone of the press had begun to change toward Billy and the Crusade is clear from the account of William  | Hickey , columnist for the Daily Express , of a night at Harringay : " We parked the car in front of the sows of coaches that had come from the Guth , the west and the north . We iissed the queues and went in . They ere singing hymns . The force of it lilt you . I do n't know quite where . But I felt different . " Billy Graham is not a particularly good preacher . But it does n't matter . The choir leader and his wretched tromhone did n't matter a tinker 's cuss . What did matter was that thousands of British people were there who were 1 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind had been pressed and a fantastic reaction had taken place , reaction that made those releases of atomic energy small-time stuff . For this as the ultimate spiritual energy that His always changed the world . " Shall we pray ? ' said Graham . Every head was bowed . Every eye closed . ' I 'm going to ask you to come and stand quietly here , to surrender yourself to Christ . ' And then the wooden boards of the hall started to creak under the footfalls . I shall never forget that creaking as long as I live . " Some hurried . Some walked slowly with measured tread . The choir was singing softly , the same verse over and over again . A man and woman walked forward hand in hand . A man followed them in tears , his head bowed . They all went forward singing ? just as they did in Nero 's arenas , with a smile of unearthly happiness on their lips . " This is God 's doing , ' said Graham . There is no other answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Dearest Family : Last night a counselor told me of a man he had talked to . He came from down on the south coast . His wife , for months , had been praying for his salvation , unknown to him . He was unmoved . They came to Harringay . He was unmoved . Undaunted , she continued praying . One night as they tucked their little girl in bed , the child said : " Mummy and Daddy , I 'd like to have Jesus come into my heart . " Even this did not touch him . Then one day he was down on the beach walking by himself when he was suddenly overpowered with a sense of sinfulness and guilt . When he got home he told his wife : " I wish I could go to Harringay again , but I have n't the money . " His wife said : " I have been saving for an Easter outfit . " They found there was just enough for two round-trip tickets . So they came and he got converted . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " He got a robe of righteousness . " And then there was a surgeon here in London , a woman , and quite successful . She took two patients to Harringay . Both were converted and the surgeon says they have n't been back since for professional services . " Which proves , " said an Englishman , " that what some folks need is doctrine instead of doctoring . " As I walked into Harringay , I was stopped by an attractive young couple . A really pretty girl and a laughing , handsome husband with a blonde little girl . " Do n't you remember us ? " they asked . Then I did . They were a couple who had come forward Monday afternoon , a Spitfire pilot  | and his wife on the verge of breaking up . I could hardly believe they were the same couple . " You 've made my wife so happy , " said the pilot . I felt like saying , " It is you , sir , who have made her happy . " Really , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he or me , but the Lord . Sunday Bill and I went to Cambridge . There were two overflow services . Bill stopped at each and greeted the packed crowds and then spoke at Great St. Mary 's Church and his message was relayed to the other two . The church was jammed . Undergraduates only ? and how they listened ! The invitation was clear-cut . Then he asked all those who wished to do so to leave quietly while those who wished to receive Christ as both Saviour and Lord remained . I raised my head . It looked as if the church was still full . I could n't believe my eyes . Bill could n't either , evidently . He explained again , quite simply and clearly . I-Ic made it as hard as he dared . Then he asked for those who wished for the first time to receive Christ in their lives to come to the front for booklets and prayer . They all got up , jamming the aisles till they had again to be seated . Then Christian undergraduates stepped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathly quiet in that old church , with a wooden crucifix looking down from the wall and stone slabs marking the graves . God is working in incredible ways . Keep praying for us I know you will . We heard last night a church in Red China is praying fir these meetings , too . Billy Graham wrote to the Daily Mirror columnist who had greeted him as an unwelcome American " export , " asking for the privilege of meeting him . The columnist , " Cassandra , " replied : " Will you meet someone fairly hellbent and not averse to a little quiet wickedness ? Why should we not meet in a pub called The Baptist 's Head ? ' You could drink what you choose while I sin quietly with a little beer . " After their meeting Cassandra wrote : " He came into the Baptist 's Head absolutely at home ? a teetotaller and an abstainer able to make himself completely at ease in the spit-and-sawdust department , a difficult thing to do . " Billy Graham looks ill . He has lost 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can carry back to North Carolina with him : It is that in this country , battered and squeezed as no victorious nation has ever been before , and disillusioned almost beyond belief , he has been welcomed with an exuberance that almost makes us blush behind our precious Anglo-Saxon reserve . " I never thought friendliness had such a sharp cutting-edge . I never thought simplicity could cudgel us sinners so damned hard . We live and learn . " On a rainy Saturday afternoon , May 22 , Billy Graham preached the Crusade 's concluding sermons to two outdoor audiences . The first filled White City Stadium with 70,000 people . At the second 120,000 ? more than were drawn there by the 1948 Olympics ? filled Wembley Stadium . When , with the Archbishop of Canterbury at his side , Billy Graham gave the invitation ,  | more than 2000 walked across the turf to stand before the improvised altar and register their " decision for Christ . " Dearest Folks : Well , it 's all over , yet in one way it has only begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we had let ourselves realize it would be the last . It was absolutely jammed . Cassandra , the columnist , was there and Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ? and I do n't know who all . The Wing Commander came by just to say goodby again and how their lives had been changed . Remember , he is the Spitfire pilot who came forward with his wife . I Ie looks like a new man now . Right there is an example of what makes the hardness of this work worth while . You meet a young couple , ready to break up , making one last desperate effort to solve their problems . You watch them come to Christ . You see the change that takes place . A Christian home is started . So you see if White City Stadium had been empty , if the press had sent Bill off as skeptically as they greeted him , it still would have been worth it all . That is only one example . Only eternity will disclose them all . If only you could have seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spread out before us like a great , unbelievably big oval packed with flecks of color which are people . People at the end of the stadium were standing . Scores had camped at Wembley overnight . I ca n't begin to explain it : the coldness of the weather , the immensity of the stadium , the thousands upon thousands of people , the quietness of it all , the sense of God 's presence . The sermon was simplicity itself . At the invitation hundreds upon hundreds streamed forward . Then the Archbishop of Canterbury prayed ? simply , clearly , movingly , and pronounced the sweetest blessing I have ever heard . And the reporters ! They are friendlier , but bewildered . " Whatever it is that Billy Graham has , " wrote one of them , " he 's got more of it than anyone else . " The people were so sweet singing " To God Be the Glory " and calling " God bless you , come back soon ! " as the bus with all the team on it pulled slowly off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much happiness and gratitude in our hearts . On board the departing bus was an American newspaperman , George Burnham of the Chattanooga News Free Press . " As the team 's private bus inched through the milling crowd , " Mr. Burnham wrote , " Billy Graham stood in the aisle and said : I want all of us to bow our heads right now and give thanks to God for all He has done and is doing . This is His doing and let none fail to give Him all the credit . ' " Only moments before , the young man had stood before 120,000 people with the word of God in his hand , in his head and in his heart . He now stood with bowed head , just another sinner saved by grace . " A few seconds after the end of the prayer , someone began to sing softly ,  | Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow . ' Others took up the words and the song grew in volume as the bus passed along through the quiet streets . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham Edition , " with front and back pages wholly devoted to the evangelist and the Crusade . Across two front-page columns , the lead story began with the gospel of Luke : What went you out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken in the wind ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
