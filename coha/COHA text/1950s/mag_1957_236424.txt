Look Back in Anger ( by John Osborne ) hit England with a bang last year and it is clear enough why . On the one hand , it jabbed some good spiny cactus into the aspidistra drama of the English stage ; on the other hand , it clangingly echoed a new generation 's call to disorder in English life . And it had something more than the Zeitgeist or England 's general theatrical anemia to recommend it ; it had a man who could really write . <P> Look Back in Anger has hardly raised the curtain on the frowsiest-looking attic in years than it catapults upon the audience the most blisteringly vituperative character . While his better-born young wife ( Mary Ure ) bends over an ironing board and his working-class friend ( Alan Bates ) sprawls over the Sunday papers , Jimmy Porter looses his bilious scorn , like a revolving gun turret , on everything within range : art , religion , radio , Sunday , England and , again and again , his wife and mother-in-law . As minutely venomous as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mockery sauced with self-pity , his growl subsiding in a whine , he brings to a vast repository of grievances a commensurate repertory of abuse . <P> As the play proceeds , an actress friend of his wife 's comes to stay in the house , lashes back at him , and rouses the put-upon pregnant wife to give him the gate . But after the wife leaves Jimmy 's bed and ironing board , her friend suddenly takes over both . At the end , despite her being wild about the brute , the friend clears out from a sense of guilt , while the wife , who has had a miscarriage , pleads with him to take her back . <P> Postulating a grey-as-ashes England where upper-class loss has not meant lower-class gain , Playwright Osborne writes of a young intellectual who looks back because he has no incentive to look ahead , and looks back in anger because he has no brighter past than future . Exulting in his wrongs rather than crusading for his rights , living in " the American age " but without sharing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disorganization Man . But gnawing at him worse than have-not economics is the endemic English intestinal bug of class resentment . Happily , none of this ever becomes a mere plight in man 's clothing . Jimmy ( extremely well played by Kenneth Haigh ) is always real in himself , exasperatingly and vibrantly alive , and with a natural-sounding , real-life gift for witty and eloquent abuse . <P> Less happily , what is best in all this has been pretty fully conveyed by the end of a brilliant , dynamic first act . Indeed , the first act 's very power of assault gives to what follows a diminished impact . But what follows has also too little organic development . The play never really advances from a kind of one-man show to any kind of social drama . To be sure , a negativist , no-exit attitude that shies away from moral crisis can not develop very far ; while at the same time so much overt anger must shut the door on irony . Having shown how angry Jimmy can be , the play chiefly thereafter shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on human plight would have helped : it cuts deeper than Bohemian mess . <P> Not for a good many years has anyone come out of England with Playwright Osborne 's verbal talent for throwing stones . But playwrights need an architectural talent too , for placing one stone on top of another .
