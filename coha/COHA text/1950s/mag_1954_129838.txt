Before juvenile delinquency got violent , the slingshot was considered to be the No. 1 item of the delinquent . Since that time when it rated as the top toy pest of American youth , it 's hit the comeback trail in many areas in a manner that is downright respectable . Today the woods , and not the streets , is where it 's being used . // The slingshot got its bad name because it was mostly a weapon for popping somebody you did n't like in the backside . It 's still banned in many sections of the country today . But quite a few adults have discovered that it is a pretty sportsmanlike weapon for hunting small game . The slingshot fans have grown into a large though scattered bunch , with some of them even forming clubs . And they claim that their weapon is more sporting than the rifle or the bow and arrow , and a lot less dangerous to life and limb . You can get squirrels , rabbits , pheasant and quail in season  --  and before the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a good mess of frogs ' legs just waiting to be taken . // A KENTUCKY WINDAGE DEAL // Just how sharp your aim will get depends  --  as with everything else in sports  --  upon how much practice you put in on it . This hip-pocket weapon gives you no sights or arrows to guide your eye . It 's on a sort of Kentucky windage basis . That 's tougher on the hunter , easier on the squirrel . It follows , therefore , that the slingshot actually is more sportsmanlike than gun or bow . // One nice point about the slingshot is that it can be used with perfect safety in your basement or rumpus room . Just hang a sturdy piece of canvas over a strung piece of rope , then pin a readymade paper target on it ( or paint your own target right on the canvas ) . You 'll find that your round little ammo will plop gently to the floor in the same shape it was when you fired it . Or , if you want a fancier target than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out blanket in it , rolled into ball formation , or an old pillow . Then hang the target from the top of the keg 's opening , let fly and no harm will be done to you , spectators or ammo. // A slingshotter does n't even have to whittle his own weapon any more . They are professionally made nowadays in wood , plywood and aluminum . About three dollars will get you as good a one as you 'd want . // For ammunition , the cheapest and probably the best is 7/16 steel ball . It can be bought in any machine shop . A dime , or a nickel , will get you most of a season 's supply . However , there are some hip-pocket hunters who prefer to use regular No. 0 buckshot , which works just fine too . // One of the best slings that can be bought is the Wham-O Sportsman . It is made of plywood , which is very strong , and its powerful rubber bands make it accurate and highly effective . // But if you 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father 's or grandfather 's day . They used to cut a three-pronged branch of sturdy quality  --  hickory or dogwood is best . A jackknife whittled it down to a nice stubby size . Then they tied the three prongs together , drawing in both the outside branches as tightly as possible and tying them to the middle one . The U-shape they achieved was very desirable to the finished product . // A slow oven baked it overnight , " setting " it in the desired shape . Then the center prong was sawed out , and two strips of inner tube or two rubber bands about 1/16 inch thick , 5/8 inch wide and 8 inches long attached . With a home-made sling like this , a good shooter could bring home the fixings for many a squirrel pie . // STEADY STANCE AND CAREFUL EYE // In shooting there 's almost no difference between the stance taken with the sling and that taken with the bow and arrow . For best form , your body should be at absolute right angles to the target . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . Distribute your weight evenly on both feet . Be steady and comfortable  --  then bring your pouch up to your right eye . Sight the target and , as you do , do n't pull the right arm back , ever . Instead , push the left arm slowly forward . Always keep the shot cup at the level of your eye . // The legal open season for small game hunting with the slingshot , in most states , is the same as it is for archers . In other words you 'll never have to worry about stray rifle shots , but you should be sure to check your local ordinances and find out if slingshots are permitted . And if you tackle the sport before you 've become too good a marksman , there 's another quarry around you . Bring a small bag along , and you can always beat the swifty squirrels at their own game : that is to say , fill the bag nice and full of nuts . Then , at least , nobody can say you came home empty-handed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
