At plants 1,100 miles apart last week , General Dynamics ' Convair Division gave the U.S. a peek at two new developments in the deadly art of aerial warfare , one over sea , one over land . From San Diego , Convair 's giant **28;12171;TOOLONG Tradewind turboprop transport went aloft as the Navy 's newest flying boat tanker , packing enough fuel for eight swept-wing jets as they snuggled up , four at a time , behind trailing funnel-fitted hoses . Even bigger news was Convair 's new B58 Hustler bomber , a plane eight years in development as the nation 's first truly supersonic long-range bomber . At Fort Worth , a cameraman for the Star-Telegram snapped a picture of the Hustler as it was rolled out of the hangar for its first ground tests and test flight . <P> The plane looks like a bigger , burlier version of Convair 's supersonic F-102 jet fighter interceptor : like the F-102 , it has a needle-nosed , coke-bottle fuselage with sharply swept delta wings and high , shark's-fin tail . The Hustler appears to be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly comparable to the current Air Force standby , Boeing 's 600-m.p.h . B-47 medium bomber . But where the B-47 has six General Electric J47 ( 5,800 lbs . of thrust ) engines , Convair 's new B58 gets its supersonic hustle from only four General Electric J-47s , with an estimated thrust of more than 12,000 Ibs. each . Estimated speed of the Hustler : between 1,000 m.p.h. and 1,400 m.p.h . <P> So far Convair has a $400 million development contract for a small number of planes . But if the Hustler proves as good as it looks , Convair is in line for a whopping big order and a pat on the back . Where most U.S. planemakers just build the air frame , then fit on whatever armament , radar , etc. that the Air Force orders , Convair 's B58 is the first U.S. aircraft to be built under the new " weapons-system " concept , where the prime contractor is responsible for everything ( except engines ) . On a plane as complex as the Hustler , the new system can save as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
