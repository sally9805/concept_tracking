The photographers arrived early , giving their own thanks for the clear blue Thursday morning-and for Ike , light-footed and squire-like , who met them in a costume that shouted the autumn spectrum : green sport coat , yellow vest , polka-dot tie , tan Stetson . Photogenic as he was himself , the President came equipped with an even more picturable subject : his three frisky grandchildren , bundled joyfully in snowsuits and mittens , prepared to steal the scene as effectively as he hoped they would . With Ike and their father , Major John Eisenhower , the children played in front of the canary-yellow barn , watched by a full platoon of sharp-eyed cameramen and reporters . Lounging patiently at the barn door was Tony , a black-and-white Shetland pony , hitched up to a two-wheeled , wicker-basket cart . <P> At grandfather 's directions , the wind-flushed children arranged themselves with poised proficiency . Into the cart went David , 7 , his assurance unmarred by a missing front tooth . From Ike came a sudden stage direction : " Hey , stop chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David slowed his jaws momentarily , grasped Tony 's reins and waited for his sisters to get in beside him . As the photographers fired at will , Barbara Anne , 6 , assumed a dignified mien , staring thoughtfully out across the presidential fields . Susan , almost 4 , watched skeptically and clutched her doll , whose name changes almost daily ( current one : Drew Hushing Eisenhower ) . <P> A Tender Mouth . Reporters began firing questions . Ike said he thought Tony was a gift from Packard " Dan " Hendrickson , brother of New Jersey 's former Senator Robert C. Hendrickson . But the cart 's origin stumped him . Observed David , " I think it came from Texas . " ( It came from an anonymous friend of Ike 's in New York . ) <P> When the photographers asked for pictures of David driving Tony , the boy happily nicked the reins and yelled , " Gid-dyap .

" That 's good , " said Ike after a few steps . " Now stop him . " <P> David yanked hard on the reins , and Tony stopped short . Ike quickly reprimanded his grandson : " Easy , easy . Always remember that a horse has just as tender a mouth as you have . " Explained David , looking as curbed as Tony : " But I have to be tough with him , so he 'll know who 's riding him . " Indefatigably , the photographers next asked Ike to pat Tony . Sighing , Ike complied , addressing his feelings to Tony : " All right , Tony . They insist on getting a picture of you being patted . " Off the Wagon . Susan got restless in the cart , delivering her only comment : " Hey , help me out . " That matched Ike 's sentiments . Ike told David he could drive on alone up to the farmhouse . Then the President , the girls and their father , not forgetting a black Scottie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Bidding the photographers a relieved goodbye , they followed David and Tony up a 200-yd. dirt road to the big white house , where the U.S. and presidential flags snapped in the chilly breeze .
