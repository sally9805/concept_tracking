No one would have suspected that the small , well-tailored woman with blue-rinsed grey hair and smart , blue-framed spectacles was a nun , or , for that matter , that she was an American . Mother Mary Dominic Ramacciotti regards her occasional social round of luncheons , teas and receptions in Rome as the hard part of her work . This week she was back at the " easier " part : putting in an 18-hour day building an Italian Girls ' Town . <P> Though she has an ancient Tuscan name , spry , sixtyish Mary Ramacciotti was born and bred in Baltimore . She joined the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Baltimore while still in her teens , stayed on to teach . Romance languages , eventually became dean of Notre Dame of Maryland college .

They looked in wonder at the pink exterior walls , the brightly painted rooms ( " Colored paint costs no more than white , and it 's much more cheerful " ) . One girl exclaimed at the sight of a mirror on the wall : " We were never allowed mirrors in the orphans ' home ! " Mother Mary quickly replied : " I want you to have mirrors and I want you to look at yourself . When you do n't look at yourself , it is n't you who suffers-it 's the person who has to look at you . " <P> Not Crickets . Purpose of the five-year course is to train the girls to support themselves as governesses , social workers , children 's counselors and above all to be confident women who " know how to grace a home .
