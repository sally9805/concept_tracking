When the Atomic Energy Commission allowed observers , including newsmen , to watch a thermonuclear test at Bikini atoll in late May , it told them practically nothing and got them out of the test area as quickly as possible . The rest of the tests were supposed to be secret . <P> They were not , however , kept entirely secret . Long-range atom-bomb watching has become a favorite sport in Japan . When nuclear tests are impending , whether by the U.S. or the U.S.S.R. , all sorts of instruments are checked and tuned for superfine sensitivity . This year a survey ship , the Shunkotsu Maru , carrying scientists and scientific apparatus , has been cruising near the danger area in the Pacific , and tuna boats have been gathering radioactive dust . Japanese scientists relish the fact that they are the only ones in the world who make observations and report them openly . <P> By Earth , Air &; Water . First atomic news that reaches Japan from a " high-yield " explosion in mid-Pacific is carried by earth waves , detected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air waves , picked up by barographs . Then come ocean waves , which register on tide gauges . <P> On May 21 , the day of the " open " shot , the Japanese scientists got the news promptly by earth , air and sea . A week later , on May 28 , came waves from an otherwise secret explosion . Both explosions had about the same power , and both were apparently about half as strong as the big one the U.S. exploded on March 1 , 1954 . <P> For weeks after these explosions , the Shunkotsu Maru collected very little radioactive material , and Japanese scientists conjectured that the explosions , which took place high in the air , had tossed most of their " hot " residue into the stratosphere in the form of extremely fine dust . The explosion on March 1 , 1954 behaved differently because it was a " tower shot " that stirred up millions of tons of quick-settling coral dust . First radioactive material from the May 21 explosion was brought home by the tuna boat Stiruga Maru . Analyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain a familiar array of fission products-ruthenium , rhodium , tellurium , iodine , cerium , neodymium , etc. - as well as uranium 237 and neptunium 239 . This combination of elements indicated that the explosion was the " fission-fusion-fission " type , which gets much of its energy from the fission of normally inactive uranium 238 . <P> Slow-Falling Dust . Last week the Shunkotsu Maru reported radioactive dust from a third explosion that apparently took place on June 12 or 13 . Analysis showed that it was also of the fission-fusion-fission type , but for some reason , perhaps small size or extremely high altitude , it did not stir up air or water waves strong enough to reach Japan . A small earth wave was detected on June 12 , and a slightly stronger one on June 13.
