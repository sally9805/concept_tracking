Pop Goes the Alley Cat Drawings by . James Real A Story by Wallace Stegner ETT1NG up to answer the door , Prescott looked into the face of a Negro boy of about eighteen . Rain pebbled his greased , straightened hair ; the leather yoke of his blazer and the knees of his green gabardine pants were soaked . The big smile of greeting that had begun on his face passed over as a meaningless movement of the lips . " I was lookin ' , " he said , and then with finality , " I thought maybe Miss Vaughn . " " She 's just on her way out . " The boy did not move . " I like to see her , " he said , and gave Prescott a pair of small , opaque , expressionless eyes to look into . Eventually Prescott motioned him in . He made a show of getting the water off himself , squee-geeing his hair with a flat palm , shaking his limber hands , lifting the wet knees of his pants with thumb and finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimen : on the scrawny side , the clothes too flashy but not too clean , the mouth loose and always moving , the eyes the kind that shifted everywhere when you tried to hold them but were on you intently the moment you looked away . But he made himself at home . And why not , Prescott asked himself , in this apartment banked and stacked and overflowing with reports on delinquency , disease , crime , discrimination ; littered with sociological studiesand affidavits on police brutality and the mimeographed communications of a dozen betterment organizations ? The whole place was a temple to the juvenile delinquent , and here was the god himself in the flesh , Los Angeles Bronzeville model . Well , he said , I am not hired to comment , but only to make pictures . Carol came into the hall from her bedroom , and Prescott saw with surprise that she was glad to see this boy . " Johnny ? " she said. ? " Where did you drop from ? " Over the boy had come an elaborate self-conscious casualness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounged to his feet , rolling the collar of the blazer smooth across the back of his neck . Prescott was reminded of the slickers of his high school days , with their pinch-waisted bell-bottomed suits and their habit of walking a little hollow-chested to make their shoulders look wider . The boy weaved and leaned , pitching his voice high for kidding , moving his shoulders , his mouth , his pink-palmed hands . " Start to rain on me , " he said in the high complaining humorous voice . " Water start comin ' down on me I think I have to drop in . " " How come you 're not working ? " " That job ! " the boy said , and - batted it away with both hands . " That was n't much of a job , no kiddin ' . " " Was n't ? " " You know . Them old flour bags heavy , you get tired . Minute you stop to rest , here come that old foreman with the gooseroo . Hurry up there , boy1 Get along there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Carol gave Prescott the merest drawing down of the lips . " That 's the third job in a month , " she said , and added , " Johnny 's one of my boys . Johnny Bane . This is Charlie Prescott , Johnny . " " Pleased to meet you , " Johnny said without looking . Prescott nodded and withdrew himself , staring out into the dripping garden court . " You know a fact ? " Johnny said . " That old strawboss keep eyeballin ' me and givin ' me that old hurry-up , hurry-up , that gets old . I get to carryin ' my knife up the sleeve of my sweatshirt , and he comes after me once more , I 'm goin ' cut him . So / quit before I get in bad trouble out there .

I like me a job with some class , you know , something where I could learn something . " " I can imagine how ambition eats away at you . " " No kiddin ' ! " the burbling voice said . " I get real industrious if I had me the right kiwi of a job . Over on Second Street there 's this Chinaman , he 's on call out at Paramount . Everytime they need a Chinaman for a mob scene , out he goes and runs around for a couple hours and they hand him all this lettuce , man . You know anybody out at MGM , Paramount , anywhere ? " " No , " she said . " Do you , Charlie ? " " Nobody that needs any Chinamen . " Prescott showed her the face of his watch . Johnny Bane was taking in , apparently for the first time , the camera bag , the tripod , the canvas sack of flash bulbs beside Prescott 's chair . " Hey , man , you a photographer ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of town for the Russell Foundation , " Carol said . " Take a long time to be a photographer ? " Johnny 's mouth still worked over his words , but now that his attention was fixed his eyes were as unblinking as an alligator 's . " Three or four years . " " Man , that 's a rough sentence ! Take a long time , uh ? Down by the station there 's this place , mug you for a quarter . Sailors and their chicks always goin ' in . One chick I was watchin ' other night , she had her picture five times . Lots of cats and chicks , every night . Money in that , man . " She shook her head , saying , " Johnny , when are you going to learn to hold a job ? You make it tough for me , after I talk you into a place .

" If we 're going to get anything today we 'll have to be moving . " " Just a minute , " Carol said . To Johnny she said , " Do you know many people over on your hill ? " " Sure , man . It fultitudes . " " Mexicans too ? " " They 're mostly Mexicans over there . My chick 's Mexican . " He staggered with his eyes dreamily shut . " Solid , solid ! " he said . " He might help us get in some places , " Carol said . " What do you think , Charlie ? " Prescott shrugged . " He could hold reflectors and learn a little about photography . " Prescott shrugged again . " Do you mind , Charlie ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack of flash bulbs and the tripod to Johnny and picked up the camera bag . " Lesson number one , " he said . " A photographer is half packhorse . " T HE barrio was a double row of shacks tipping from a hilltop down a steep road clayily shining and deserted in the rain , every shack half buried under climbing roses , geraniums , big drooping seedheads of sunflowers , pepper and banana trees , and palms : a rural slum of the better kind , the poverty overlaid deceptively with flowers . Across the staggering row of mailboxes Pres-cott could see far away , over two misty hilltops and an obscured sweep of city , the Los Angeles Civic Center shining a moment in a watery gleam of sun . Johnny hustled around , pulling things from the car . As Prescott took the camera bag , the black face mugged and contorted itself with laughter . " You want me and my chick ? How about me and my chick cuttin ' a little jive , real mean ? Colored and Mexican hobnobbin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Carol said drily . ' ' Privies in the rain , ten kids in a dirt-floored shack . How about Dago Aguirre 's ? That 's pretty bad , is n't it ? " " Dago 's ? Man , that 's a real dump . You want dumps , uh ? Okay , we try Dago 's . " He went ahead of them , looking back at the bag Prescott carried . " Must cost a lot of lettuce , man , all those cameras . " Prescott shook the bag at him . " That 's a thousand dollars in my hand , " he said . " That 's why I carry it myself . " Rain had melted the adobe into an impossible stickiness ; after ten steps their feet were balls of mud . Johnny took them along the flat hilltop to a gateless fence under a sugar palm , and as they scraped the mud from their shoes against a broken piece of concrete a Mexican ' boy in Air Force dungarees opened the door of the shack and leaned there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hdrale , cholo . " Dago looked down without expression as Johnny shifted the tripod and made a mock-threatening motion with his fist . " We came to see if we could take some pictures , " Carol said . " Is your mother home , Dago ? " Dago oozed aside and made room for a peering woman with a child against her shoulder . She came forward uncertainly , a MAGAZINE sweet-faced woman made stiff by mistrust . Carol talked to her in Spanish for five minutes before she would open her house to them . Keeping his mouth shut and working fast as he had learned to on this job , Prescott got the baby crawling on the dirt floor between pans set to catch the drip from the roof , He got the woman and Dago and the baby and two smaller children eating around the table whose one leg was a propped box . By backing into the leanto , between two old iron bedsteads , and having Carol , Johnny , and Dago hold flashes in separate corners , he got the whole place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Foundation expected . Askalways , the children cried when the flashes went off ; as always he mollified them with the blown bulbs , little Easter eggs of shellacked glass . It was a dump , but nothing out of the ordinary , and he got no picture that excited him until he caught the woman nursing her baby on a box in the corner . The whole story was there in the protective stoop of her figure and the drained resignation of her face . She looked anciently tired ; the baby 's chubby hand was clenched in the flesh of her breast . Johnny Bane , eager beaver , brisk student , had been officious about keeping extension cords untangled and posing with the reflector . By the time Prescott had the camera and tripod packed Johnny had everything else dismantled . " How you get all them lights to go off at once ? " he said . Prescott dropped a reflector and they both stooped for it , bumping heads . The boy 's skull felt as hard as cement ; for a moment Prescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room , and straightening up without a word he showed Johnny and Dago how the flashes were syn-chronized , he let them look into the screen of the Rolleillex , he explained shutter and lens , he gate them a two-minute lecture on optics . " Okay ? " he said to Carol in half-humorous challenge . She smiled . " Okay . " The Aguirre family watched them to the door and out into the drizzle . Johnny Bane , full of importance , a hep cat , a photographer 's assistant , punched the shoulder of the lounging Dago . " Ay to wacho , " he said . Dago lifted a languid hand . " Now what ? " Prescott asked . " More of the same , " Carol said . " Unfortunately , there 's plenty . " " Overcrowding , malnutrition , lack of sanitation , " he said . " Four days of gloom . Ca n't we shoot something pretty ? " " There 's always Johnny 's chick . " " Maybe she comes under the head of lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm . " What about my chick ? " Johnny demanded . " You want my chick now ? " Carol stood tying a scarf over her fair hair . In raincoat and saddle shoes , she looked like a college sophomore . " Does your chick 's family approve of you ? " she said . " Most Mexican families are n't too happy to see boy friends hanging around . " Tickled almost to idiocy , he cackled and flapped his hands . " Man , they think I 'm rat poison , no kiddin ' . They think any cat 's rat poison . They got this old Mexican jive about keepin ' chicks at home . But I come there with you , they got to let me in , do n't they ? " " So who 's helping whom ? " Prescott said . That made him giggle and mug all the way down the slippery hill . " Hey , man , " he said once , " you know these Mexicans believe in this Evil Eye , this ojo . When I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Prayer backwards and puttin ' the eyeballs on him , and when here comes that big flash , man , her old man really think he got the curse on him . I tell him I do n't take it off till he let Lupe go our any time she want . Down to that beach , man . She look real mean down there on that sand gettin ' the eyeballs from all the cats . Reety ! " " Spare us the details , " Carol said , and turned her face from the rain , hanging to a broken fence and slipping , laughing , coming up hard against a light pole . Prescott slitheredafter her until before a shack more pretentious than most , almost a cottage , Johnny kicked the mud from his shoes and silently mugged at them , with a glassy , scared look in his odd little eyes , before he knocked on the homemade door . I T WAS like coining into a quiet opening in the woods and startling all the little animals . They were watched by a doien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had opened the door and saw three men with cards and glasses and a jug before them on a round table . A very pregnant woman stood startled in the middle of the floor . On a bed against the far wall a boy had lowered his comic book to stare . There was a flash of children disappearing into corners and behind the stove . The undershirted man welcomed them with an enveloping winy breath , but his smile was only for Carol and Prescott ; his recognition of Johnny was a brief , sidelong lapse from politeness . Somewhere behind the door a phonograph was playing " Linda Mujer " ; now it stopped with a squawk . Once , during the rapid Spanish that went on between Carol and the Mexican , Prescott glanced at Johnny , but the boy 's face , with an unreal smile pasted on it , blinked and peered past the undershirted man as if looking for someone . His forehead was puckered in tense knots . Then the undershirted man said something over his shoulder , the men at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The host brought it and offered it to Carol , who grinned and tipped and drank while they applauded . Then Prescott , mentally Lasting the garlic and chile from the lips that had drunk before him , coldly contemplating typhoid , diphtheria , polio , drank politely and put the jug back in the man 's hands with thanks and watched him return it to the table without offering it to Johnny Bane . They were pulled into the room , the door closed , and he saw that the old hand-cranked Victrola had been played by a Mexican youth in drape pants and a pretty girl , short-skirted and pornpadoured . The girl should he Lupe , Johnny 's chick . He looked for the glance of understanding between them and saw only the look on Johnny 's face as if he had an unbearable belly ache . This was a merry shackful . The men were all a little drunk , and posed magnificently and badly , their eyes magnetized by the camera . The boy was lured from his comic book . Lupe and the youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and watched and whispered with a flash of white teeth . As for Johnny , he held reflectors where Prescott told him to , but he was no longer an eager beaver . His mouth hung sullenly ; his eyes kept straying to the two on the couch . Dutifully Prescott went on with his job , documenting poverty for humanitarianism 's sake and humanizing it as he could for the sake of art . He got a fair shot of the boy reading his comic book under a hanging image of the Virgin , another of two little girls peeking into a steaming kettle of frijoles while the mother modestly hid her pregnancy behind the stove . He shot the card players from a low angle , with low side-lighting , and when an old grandmother came in the back door with a pail of water he got her there , stooping to the weight in the open door , against the background of the rain . Finally he said into Carol 's ear , with deliberate malice , " Now do we get that red-hot shot of Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean man , Charlie , " she said , but she smiled , and looking across to where Johnny stood sullen and alone she said , " Johnny , you want to come over here ? " He came stiff as a stick , ugly with venom and vanity . When Carol seated him close to Lupe the girl rolled her eyes and bit her lip , ready to laugh . The noise in the room had quieted ; it was as if a dipperful of cold water had been thrown into a boiling kettle . Carol moved Chuey-in close and laid some records in Lupe 's lap . Prescott could see the caption coming up : Even in shacktown , young people need amusement . Lack of adequate entertainment facilities one of greatest needs . Older generation generally disapproves of jive , jive talk , jive clothes . The girl was pretty , even with her ridiculous pompadour . Her eyes were soft , liquid , very dark , her cheekbones high , and her cheeks planed . With a rebozo over her head she might have posed for Murillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her elders did , but at Prescott 's word became absorbed in studying the record labels . Chuey laid his head close to hers , and on urging Johnny sullenly did the same . The moment the flash went off Johnny stood up . Prescott shifted the Victrola so the crank handle showed more , placed Chuey beside it with a record in his hands . " All right , Lupe , you and Johnny show us a little rug-cutting . " He watched the girl glance from the corners of her eyes at her parents , then come into Johnny 's arm . He held her as if she smelled . bad , his head back and away , but she turned her face dreamily upward and sighed like an actress in a love-drama and laid her face against his rain-wet chest . " Que chicloso ! " she said , and could not hold back her laughter . " Surote ! " Johnny pushed her away so hard she almost fell . His face was contorted , his eyes glared . Spittle sprayed from his heavy lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly Prescott found himself protecting the camera in the middle of what threatened to become a brawl . Chuey surged forward , the undershirted father crowded in from the other side , the girl was spitting like a cat . With a wrench Johnny broke away and got his back to the wall , and there lie stood with his hand plunged into the pocket of his blazer and his loose mouth working . " Please ! " Carol was shouting , " Chueyl Lupe ! Please ! " She held back the angry father and got a reluctant , broken quiet . Over her shoulder she said , " Johnny , go wait for us in the car . " F OR a moment he hung , then reached a long thin hand for the latch and slid out . The room was instantly full of noise again , indignation , threats . Prescott got his things safely outside the door away from their feet , and by that time politeness and diplomacy had triumphed . Carol said something to Lupe , who showed her teeth in a little white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , who bowed over her hand and talked close to her face . There was handshaking around , Carol promised them prints of the pictures , Prescott gave the children each a quarter . Eventually they were out in the blessed rain . " What in hell did he call her ? " Prescott said as they clawed their way up the hill . " Pacheco talk . Approximately a hippy . " " Count on him for the right touch . " " Do n't say anything , Charlie , " she said . " Let me handle him . " " He 's probably gone off somewhere to nurse his wounded ego . " But as he helped her over the clay brink onto the cinder road he looked toward the car and saw the round dark head in the back seat . " I must say you pick some dillies , " he said . Walking with her face sideward away from the rain , she said seriously , " I do n't pick them , Charlie . They conic because they do n't have anybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got anybody else , " he said , and then they were at the car and he was opening the door to put the equipment inside . Johnny Bane made no motion to get his muddy feet out of the road . . " Lunch ? " Carol said as she climbed under the wheel . Prescott nodded , but Johnny said nothing . In the enclosed car Prescott could smell his hair oil . Carol twisted around to smile at him . " Listen ! " she said . " Why take it so hard ? It 's just that Chuey 's her cousin , he 's family , he can crash the gate . " " Agh ! " " Laugh it off . " He let his somber gaze fall on her . " That punk ! " he said . " I get him good . Her too . I kill that mean little bitch . You wait . I kill her sometime . " For a moment she watched him steadily ; then she sighed . " If it helps to take it out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll worry about you , if that 's what you want . " A few minutes later she stopped at a diner on Figueroa , but when she and Prescott climbed out , Johnny sat still . " Coming ? " she said . " I ai n't hungry . " " Oh , Johnny , come off it ! Do n't sulk all day . " The long look he gave her was so deliberately insolent that Prescott wanted to reach through the window and slap his loose mouth . Then the boy looked away , picked a thread indifferently from his sleeve , stared moodily as if tasting some overripe self-pity or some rich revenge . Prescott took Carol 's arm and pulled her into the diner . " Quite a young man , " he said . Her look was sober . " Do n't be too hard on him . " " Why not ? " " Because everybody always has been . " He passed her the menu . " Mother loved me , but she died . " " Stop it , Charlie ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said at last . " Forget it . " While they were eating dessert she ordered two hamburgers to go , and when she passed them through the car window Johnny Bane took them without a word . " What do you want to do ? " she said. ? " Come along , or have us drop you somewhere ? " " Okay if I go along ? " " Sure . " " Okay . " In a street to which she drove , a peddler pushed a cart full of peppers and small Mexican bananas through the mud between dingy frame buildings . No one else was on the street , but two children were climbing through the windows of a half-burned house . The rain angled across , fine as mist . " What 's here ? " Prescott said . " This is a family I 've known ever since I worked for Welfare , " Carol said . " Grandmother with asthma , father with dropsy , half a dozen little rickety kids . This is to prove that bad luck has no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the package empty . He tried the pockets of coat and raincoat without success . Carol opened her purse ; she too was out . Johnny Bane had been smoking hers all morning . " We can find a store , " she said , and had turned the ignition key to start when Johnny said , " I can go get some for you . " " Oh , say , would you , Johnny ? That would be wonderful . " Prescott felt dourly that he was getting an education in social workers . One rule was that the moment your delinquent showed the slightest sign of decency , passed you a cigarette or picked up something you had dropped , you fell on his neck as if he had rescued you from drowning . As a matter of fact , he had felt his own insides twitch with surprised pleasure at Johnny 's offer . But then what ? he asked himself . After you 've convinced him that every little decency of his deserves a hundred times its weight in thanks , then what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably the nearest over on Figueroa . " " Oh , " site said , disappointed . " Then I guess we 'd better drive down . That 's too far to walk . " " You go ahead , do your business here , " Johnny said . He leaned forward with his hands on the back of the front seat . " I take the car and go get some weeds , how 's that ? ' Prescott waited to hear what she would say , but lie really knew . After a pause her quiet voice said , " Have you got a driver 's license ? " " Sure , man , right here . " " All ? right , " she said , and stepped out . " Do n't be long . Charlie dies by inches without smokes . " While Prescott unloaded . Johnny slid under the wheel . He was as jumpy as a greyhound . His fingers wrapped around the wheel with love . " Wait , " Carol said . " I did n't give you any money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and threw it into the seat , and Johnny Bane let off the emergency and rolled away . " What was that ? " Prescott said . " Practical sociology ? " " Do n't be so indignant , " she said . " You trust people , and maybe that teaches them to trust you . " " Why should anybody but a hooligan have to be taught to trust you ? Are you so unre-liable ? " But she only shook her head at him , smiling and denying his premises , as they went up the rotted steps . T HIS house was worse than the others . It was not merely poor , it was dirty , and it was not merely dirty , but sick . Prescott looked it over for picture possibilities while Carol talked with a thin Mexican woman , worn to the bleak collar bones , with arms like sticks . In the kitchen the sink was stopped with a greasy rag , and dishes swam in water the color of burlap . On the table were three bowls with brown juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen wall . In the front room , on an old taupe overstuffed sofa , the head of the house lay in a blanket bathrobe , his thickened legs exposed , his eyes mere slits in the swollen flesh of his face . By the window in the third room an old woman sat in an armchair , and everywhere , in every corner and behind every broken piece of furniture , were staring broad-faced children , incredibly dirty and as shy as mice . In a momentary pause in Carol 's talk he heard the native sounds of this house : the shuffle of children 's bare feet and the old woman 's harsh breathing . He felt awkward , and an intruder . Imprisoned by the rain , quelled by the presence of the Welfare lady and the strange man , the children crept soft as lizards around the walls . Wanting a cigarette worse than ever , Prescott glanced impatiently at his watch . Probably Johnny would stop for a malt or drive around showing off the car and come in after an hour expecting showers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Carol 's voice had dropped ; the bare walls echoed to any noise , the creeping children and the silent invalids demanded hushed voices and soft feet . " Portrait shots ? " she whispered . " All this hopeless sickness ? " " They 'll be heart-breakers . " " That 's what they ought to be . " Even when he moved her chair so that gray daylight fell across her face , the old woman paid no attention to him beyond a first piercing look . Her head was held stiffly , her face as still as wood , but at every breath the cords in her neck moved slightly with the effort . He got three time exposures of that half-raised weathered mask : flash would have destroyed what the gray light revealed . Straightening up from the third one , he looked through the doorway into the inhuman swollen face of the son . It was impossible to tell whether the Chinese slits of eyes were looking at him or not . He was startled with the thought that they might be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our friend is taking his time , " he said to Carol , and held up his watch . " Maybe he could n't find a store . " Prescott grunted , staring at the dropsical man . If he shot across the swollen feet and legs , foreshortening them , and into the swollen face , he might get something monstrous and sickening , a picture to make people wince . " Can he be propped up a little ? " he asked . Carol asked the thin , hovering wife , who said he could . The three of them lifted and slid the man up until his shoulders were against the wall . It troubled Prescott to see Carol 's hands touch the repulsive flesh . The man 's slits watched them , the lips moved , mumbling something . " What 's he say ? " " He says you must be a lover of beauty , " Carol said . For a moment her eyes held his , demanding of him something that he hated to give . Once , on his only trip to Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he remembered how he had fired at a noise in a tree and brought something crashing down , and how they had run up to see a little monkey lying on the bloodied leaves . It was still alive ; as they came up its eyes followed them , and at a certain moment it put up its arms over its head to ward off the expected death blow . To hear this monster make a joke was Like seeing that monkey put up its arms in an utterly human gesture . It sickened him so that he took refuge behind the impersonality of the camera . and when he had taken his pictures he said something that he had not said to a subject all day . " Thanks , " he said . " Gracias , senor . " Somehow he had to counteract that horrible portrait with something sweet . He posed the thin mother and one of the children in a sentimental Madonna and Child pose , pure poster art suitable for a fund-raising campaign . While he was re-checking for thesecond exposure he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It came from the grandmother . She sat in the same position by the window of the other room , but she seemed straighter and more rigid , and he had an odd impression that she had grown in size . The thin woman was glancing uneasily from Prescott to Carol . The moment he stepped back she was out of her chair and into the other room . The grandmother had definitely grown in size . Prescott watched her with a wild feeling that anyone in this house might suddenly blow up with the obscene swelling disease . Under the shawl the old woman 's chest rose in jerky breaths , but it did n't go down between inhalations . Her gray face shone with sudden sweat ; her mouth was open , her head held stiffly to one side . " Had n't I better try to get a doctor ? " Prescott said . Bending over the old woman , Carol turned only enough to nod . Prescott went quickly to the door . The peddler had disappeared , the children who had been climbing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain . Johnny Bane had been gone for over an hour ; if this woman died he could take the credit . In a district like this there might not be a telephone for blocks . Prescott would have to run foolishly like someone shouting fire . A girl of ten or so , sucking her thumb , slid along the wall , watching him . He trapped her . " Where 's there a telephone ? " She stared , round-eyed and scared . " Telefono ? You sabe lelefono ? " He saw comprehension grow in her face , slapped a half-dollar into her hand , motioned her to start leading him . She went down the steps and along the broken sidewalk at a trot . It took four calls from the little neighborhood grocery before he located a doctor who could come . Then , the worst cause for haste removed , he paused to buy cigarettes for himself and a bag of suckers for the children . His guide put a sucker in her mouth and a hand in his , and they walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was still empty , and he cursed Johnny Bane . Inside , the grandmother was resting after her paroxysm , but her head was still stiffly tilted , and a minute after he entered she fell into a fit of coughing that pebbled her lips with mucus and brought her halfway to her feet , straining and struggling for air . Carol and the thin woman held her , eased her back . " Did you get someone ? " Carol said . " He 's on his way . " " Did he tell you anything to do ? " " There 's nothing to do except inject atropine or something . We have to wait for him . " " Has n't Johnny come back ? " " Did you really expect him to ? " Her eyes and mouth were strained . She no longer looked like a college sophomore : a film from the day 's poverty and sickness had rubbed off on her . Without a word she turned away , went into the kitchen , and started clearing out the sink . As Prescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of an old woman choking to death would add to the sociological impact of Carol 's series , but he was damned if he would take it . He 'd had enough for one clay . The dropsical man turned his appalling swollen mask , and on an impulse Prescott stood up and gestured with the pack of cigarettes . The monster nodded , so Prescott inserted a cigarette between the lips and lighted it . Sight of the man smoking fascinated him . The Rolleiflex was just going into the bag when it struck him that he had not seen the Contax . He rummaged , turned things out onto the floor . The camera was gone . Squatting on his heels , he considered how he should approach the mother of the house , or Carol , to get it back from whichever child had taken it . And then he began to wonder if it had been there when he unpacked for this job . He had used it at the Aguirre house for one picture , but not since . The bag had been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . So had Johnny Bane , Carefully refusing to have any feeling at all about the matter , he took his equipment out on the porch . Four or five children , each with a sucker in its mouth , came out and shyly watched him as he smoked and waited for the doctor . T HE doctor was a short man with an air of unhurried haste . He examined the grandmother for perhaps a minute and got out a needle . The woman 's eyes followed his hands with terror as he swabbed with an alcohol-soaked pad , jabbed , pushed with his thumb , withdrew , dropped needle and syringe into his case . It was like an act of deadpan voodoo . Within minutes the old woman was breathing almost normally , as if the needle had punctured her swelling and let her subside . For a minute more the doctor talked with Carol ; he scribbled on a pad . Then his eyes darted into the next room to where the swollen son lay watching from his slits . " What 's the matter in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's been bedridden for months . " " Dropsy 's a symptom , not a disease , " the doctor said , and went over . In ten more minutes they were all out on the porch again . ' ' I 'll expect you to call me then , " the doctor said . " I will , " Carol said . " You bet I will . " " Are you on foot ? Can I take you any-. where ? " " No thanks . We 're just waiting for my car . " It was then four-thirty . Incredulously Prescott watched her sit down on the steps to wait some more . The late sun , scattering the mist , touched her fair hair and deepened the lines around her mouth . Behind her the children moved softly . Above her head the old porch pillar was carved with initials and monikers : GJG , Mingo , Lola , Chavo , Pina , Juanito . A generation of lost kids had defaced even the little they had , as they might deface and abuse anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand . " How long do you expect to sit here ? " he said finally . " Give him another half-hour . " " He could have gone to Riverside for cigarettes and been back by now . " " I know . " " You know he is n't going to come back until he 's brought . " " He was upset about his girl , " she said . " He felt he 'd been kicked in the face . Maybe he went up there . " " To do what ? Cut her throat ? " " It is n't impossible , " she said , and turned her eyes up to his with so much anxiety in them that he hesitated a moment before he told her the rest . " Maybe it is n't , " lie said then , " but I imagine he went first of all to a pawnshop to get rid of the camera . " " Camera ? " " He swiped the Contax while we were having lunch . " " How do you know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Her head remained bent down ; she pulled a sliver from the step . " It could n't have been here . I was here all the time . None of the children went near your stuff . " She knew so surely what Johnny Bane was capable of , and yet she let it trouble her so , that he was abruptly furious with her . Social betterment , sure , opportunities , yes , a helping hand , naturally . But to lie down and let a goon like that walk all over you , abuse your confidence , lie and cheat and steal and take advantage of every unselfish gesture ! " Listen , " he said . " Let me give you a life history . We turn him in and he comes back in handcuffs . Okay . That 's six months in forestry camp , unless he 's been there before . " " Once , " she said , still looking down . " He was with a bunch that swiped a truck . " " Preston then , " Prescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Preston and imposes on you some more , and you waste yourself keeping him out of trouble until he gets involved in something in spite of you , something worse , and gets put away for a stretch in San Quentin . By the time they let him out of there he 'll be ripe for really big-time stuff , and after he 's sponged on you for a while longer he 'll shoot somebody in a holdup or knife somebody in a whorehouse brawl , and they 'll lead him off to the gas chamber . And nothing you can do will keep one like him from going all the way . " " It does n't have to happen that way . There 's a chance it wo n't . " " It 's a hell of a slim chance . " " I know it , " she said , and looked up again , her face not tearful or sentimental as he had thought it would be , but simply thoughtful . " Slim or not , we have to give it to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even then , " she said . " He 's everything you say  --  he 's mean , vicious , dishonest , boastful , vain , maybe dangerous . I do n't like him any better than you do , any better than he likes himself . I3ut he 's told me things I do n't think he ever told anyone else . " " He never had such a soft touch , " he said . " He grew up in a slum , Harlem . Routine case . His father disappeared before he was born , his mother worked , whatever she could find . He took care of himself . " " I understand that , " Prescott said . " He 's a victim . He is n't to blame for what his life made him . But he 's still unfit to live with other people . He is n't safe . Nine out of ten , maybe , you can help , but not his kind . It 's too bad , but he 's past helping . " " He was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattractive , do n't you see , and mean . People do n't like him , and never did . He tries to run with the neighborhood Mexican gang here , hut you saw how Chuey and Dago and Lupe just tolerate him . He does n't belong . He never did . So he prowled the alleys and dreamed up fancy revenges for people he hated , and played with stray cats . " Prescott moved impatiently , and the children slid promptly further along the wall . Carol was watching him as steadily as the children were . " He told me how he ran errands to earn money for liver and fish to feed them . He wanted them to come to him and be his cats . " Prescott waited , knowing how the script ran but surprised that Carol , a hardened case worker , should have fallen for it . " But they were all alley cats , as outcast as he was , " she said . " He 'd feed a cat for a week , but when he did n't have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd grab it and get clawed . So he used to try to tic cats up when he caught them . " Prescott said nothing . " But when a cat would n't let itself be petted , or when it fought the rope  --  and it always did  --  he 'd swing it by the rope and break its neck , " Carol said . She stirred the litter in the step corner and a sow bug rolled into its ball and bounced down into the dirt . " ' I give them every chance , Miss Vaughn , ' that 's what he told me . ' I give them every chance and if they wo n't come and be my friend I pop their neck . ' " Cautiously Prescott moved the camera bag backward with his foot . He looked at the afternoon 's grime in the creases of his hands . " That 's a sad story , " he said at last . " I mean it , it really is . But it only proves what I said , that he 's too warped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some human being who would n't play his way  --  Lupe , for instance . " " Would you pop a cat 's neck if it would n't come to you ? " Carol said softly . " Do n't be silly . " " But you 'd pop Johnny 's . " They stared at each other in the rainy late afternoon . Prescott told himself irrelevantly that he had not fallen in love with her on this job . Anyone who fell in love with her would have to share her with every stray in Greater Los Angeles . But lie liked her and respected her and admired her ; she was a fine human being . Only she carried it too far . And yet he had no answer for her . " Good God , " he said , " do you know what you 're asking ? " " Yes , " site said . " I know exactly . But I know you ca n't come with liver and fish heads six days a week and on the seventh come with a hangman 's rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every chance ' unless you really did . " The brief sun had disappeared again in the mist and smog . The street was muddy and gray before them . Behind them the thin woman came to the door and opened it , shooing the children in with an unexpected harsh snarl in her voice . Prescott felt disturbed and alien , out of his proper setting and out of his depth . But he still could find no answer for her . Yon could not come with liver and fish heads six days . a week and with a hangman 's knot on the seventh . You could not put limits on love , if love was what you chose to live by . " All right , " he said . " We do n't call the cops , is that it ? " " Was the camera insured , Charlie ? " " Yes . " " So was the car , " she said , and smiled a crooked smile . " What have we lost ? Let 's try to get along without the police as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway and said good-by and watched them down the steps , and the children pressing around her flanks watched too . Prescott waved , and the woman smiled and nodded in reply . But none of the children , solemnly staring , raised a hand . After a moment he was angry with himself for having expected them to .
