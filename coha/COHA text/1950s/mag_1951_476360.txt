I AM a wife , a mother , and a grandmother , and I have been a continuous jobholder since I graduated from college . Besides all that , I am a dodo . I never used to think of myself as a dodo , but it has been brought home to me by my married daughter and her contemporaries that I most certainly am . These young people have perpetrated a revolution right under the noses of my generation . There have been no parades , no crusading arguments or lectures or legislative lobbying . They did not fight for a revolution ? they simply are one . The whole argument of marriage versus a career which burned like a roaring fire when I was my daughter 's age is now as dead as wet ashes . The revolution that we were so vociferous about as a matter of principle has taken place unobtrusively as a matter of hard necessity . My daughter and her friends and the young married women who work in my office do not call themselves career women . They do not harangue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not discuss the primary function of woman as a homemaker . They do not argue the propriety of muscling in on the labor market . They just plain work . " It is not a question of argument , " they contend . " It is a matter of bookkeeping . " Under present circumstances a single pay envelope will not meet the needs of a whitecollar-class family . It is as simple as that . In 1949 , according to the figures of the Women 's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor , nearly half of all the married women in the United States held jobs outside the home ( 48 per cent as against 30 per cent in 1940 ) , Indeed , a larger number of employed women are married than single . These figures are enough to show that the working wife is in a fair way to becoming the norm rather than the exception . I T HAS long been typical in our pattern of society that the husband provides the income and the wife administers the household and takes care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition must be considered in more than just its economic aspects . The effect on men and women as individuals , on the delicate emotional balance of their mutual relations , and on children and the parent-child relationship must all be taken into account . The most cursory reader of anthropology knows that for every social function deemed " natural " for one sex or the other in one society , another society has developed a pattern in which the roles are reversed . The revolution in which the new generation of young couples are engaged is not a frontal attack on our cultural patterns , but it does alter them in ways which have far-reaching consequences . Through a good many years of my life I heard men say , " I 'd be ashamed to let my wife work . " The standard of a man 's success in America was ? and to some extent still is ? his earning capacity . It was a symbol of his masculine prowess and an extension of his virility . To maintain his social , his economic , and his psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being its source of supply , he often had to relinquish long-term goals for temporary advantages and to sacrifice his natural aptitudes to the demands of an immediate and steady job . No wonder Thoreau said that " most men lead lives of quiet desperation . " No wonder , then , that men jealously guarded their prerogatives . To be a " good provider " was one of the chief criteria ? and in the eyes of many was the criterion ? of man 's achievement . Every woman of my generation who worked in what was called a " man 's job " knew what it was to walk on eggs . With a diplomacy that would make Machiavelli look like a coal-heaver in a conference of foreign ministers the masculine ego had to be protected from the slightest scratch in both marital and occupational relations . This often made the women of my generation hopping mad . What we did not realize was that the restrictions foisted on us by the masculine ego were not prompted by innate sex cussedness . They were imposed by a cultural code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which they would keep women from flouting , if they could , for the same reason . But something has happened to alter this code , something that has convinced men as well as women that the rigid demarcation of their spheres of action made them both the losers . I do not mean to say that all the barriers are down . Cultural patterns change slowly and barriers crumble and shift only under heavy pressure . But the pressure of practical , not theoretical , considerations has done its work . Our young couples , who care less about abstract justice than they do about the good life for their families , have toppled a good many time-honored prejudices . They have not set out to reform the world ? they just want to live in it . THESE young people were children durthe great depression of the thirties . They learned the facts of economic life by experiencing or observing the collapse of financial security . They were married either just before or during or after the late war , and when their husbands were called into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand alone in a practical as well as an emotional sense . Once the war was over and husbands returned , few of them had had a chance to accumulate any savings . The allotments they received from the government were insufficient to support their families in accordance with middle-class standards of living . Wives with or without children either had to pro duce income or throw themselves on the mercy of relatives who had problems of their own . For a while it looked as though this were a temporary situation , and that once the war and a short adjustment period were over , women would pop back ( or be pushed back ) into their accustomed and " proper " roles . But that is not what happened . The returned veteran found himself faced with a set of alternatives . He had three possible choices : ( 1 ) He could grab the first job available , and in a frantic effort to catch up on the time the war had cost him , he might very well throw away any chances of a career , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he found some job that seemed to him congenial and that had promise for the future . He could do this only if his wife could help to keep the rent paid and the larder stocked . ( 3 ) He could take advantage of the GI Bill of Rights for basic or advanced training in a vocation . But here again this choice was open to him only if his wife could be breadwinner as well as bread-slicer . Many young wives wanted to give their husbands every possible chance to make a wise decision for the future and so they kept the jobs they had or found others . This established the pattern . With the cost of living continually on the rise there has been little inclination on the part of wives to devote themselves wholly to housework . Their pay checks have become vital to the maintenance of an acceptable standard of living . IS THIS rift in the established pattern just another example of the disruptive effects of war ? Does the working wife inflict a deep though subtle trauma on her husband 's pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her children ? Is she subconsciously seeking an excuse for selfish personal ambition or sex rivalry ? These are costs that must be computed as carefully as any bank balance . Let 's let a few young women speak for themselves : " My husband and I , " one young woman told me , " are in this family business together . It is not a choice between bolstering my ego with self-expression or coddling his ego as the sole source of funds , but of getting our family the education , the health , the basic security they need . . . . " And another young woman put it this way : " The women have not changed half so radically as the men . After all , we had the background of the gradual and sporadic breakthrough of women into the man 's world ' ever since World War I. The whole point , I think , is that we are working in collaboration , not competition , with our men . " She had more to say . She wanted to make it clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was best for both of them in the long run . " Neither of us , " she went on , " is burdened with the notion of giving up a principle or making a sacrifice when I contribute to the exchequer . It is not a source of emotional disturbance to either of us whether my contribution is less , or the same , or more than his . We 're not competitors , we 're partners . We 're in the single business of making a going concern of the family . " Still another young woman , whose marriage had threatened to founder , felt this way about it : " I went to work to save our marriage from battering itself to pieces against the rocks of worry , insecurity , inadequacy , and frustration . When my husband was convinced that my decision to work implied no accusation of failure on his part but just a realistic acceptance of the way things are , he was as relieved as if I 'd sprung him out of jail . He would not have suggested it himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stung that I had notbeen alert enough to think of it sooner . Now that he is more relaxed and at ease in his own work , instead of constantly looking over his shoulder at the wolf , his health has improved ; he works with less strain and fatigue and far more effectively . " This new design for family harmony is a far remove from the rationalizations of women who fought for their rights simply as a matter of principle . But if it solves some old dilemmas , it raises some brand-new ones . What , for example , about a man doing " woman 's work " ? If both mother and father work , who looks after the children ? Supposing that the husband 's job takes him to a different locality and the family must move , what happens to his wife 's job ? These are a few of the questions that inevitably arise . Let 's take them , and some others , in order . YYY p ARADOXICALLY enough , a good many men learned in the armed forces how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to do the jobs for him , the service man learned how to make a bed , darn a sock , sew on a button , and peel a potato . As a result many an ex-soldier regards these ? and , by extension , many other ? housewifely chores as neither beyond his competence nor beneath his dignity . He is psychologically conditioned to accept the dual-income family as a dual-housework family . The dividing line between " men 's work " and " women 's work " has not been taken by assault so much as it has crumbled away . This was the reef on which the working wives of my generation often crashed and sank . It was assumed that , whatever else the woman did , the personal and material care of the household was primarily her responsibility . If she entered an income-earning occupation , she must have the energy and executive ability to carry , in effect , two jobs . This assumption was not really the man 's fault . Even if the wife 's earnings paid for . domestic help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list , audit the household bills , balance the budget , watch for sales of linen , replenish supplies , confer with the children 's teacher , make sure their teeth were brushed and their fingernails clean , and convoy them to the dentist and to parties . And only the wife seemed to have the competence and the aptitude to do these things . Her ability to manage all this and a job too was the test of her success . Many women gave up under the pressure of husbandly criticism when all of these things could not be managed ; others damaged their health or their job efficiency or both under the too heavy burden . But the husband 's attitude has changed ; practice has revised the principle . The postwar husband feels no ignominy in running the washing machine or taking clothes to the Laundromat , mixing the baby 's formula , starting the dinner , or pushing the vacuum cleaner . Executive efficiency in the household is not a sex attribute , and many men who take the common-sense view that they should share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have demonstrated that freedom from hidebound traditional procedures can be turned to good account . They see the problems of household management with fresh eyes . They discover short cuts , tighten schedules , and invent improved procedures . " Woman 's work was never done , " perhaps because she followed deep-rutted grooves and did not try to invent new methods of getting the work done more quickly . Not all husbands , of course , are endowed with the executive gifts that revolutionize household routine , but in the two-income family they are willing to shoulder their share of the domestic load without resentment or condescension . It is difficult for men , however , to realize that housework never stays done . " It simply does not occur to my husband , " one young wife said to me , " that a room dusted once is not dusted forever . " Some wives wait for their husbands to catch on for themselves ( and some do and manifest great pride in their unaided discoveries ) ; others make joint programs , listing and allocating the chores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater domestic experience , continue to supervise the household , but there are also husbands who plunge in and teach their wives more about household management in a month than their grandmothers ever knew . How does a two-income family cope with the problem of bringing up young children ? Not so long ago a woman of proved vocational ability was adjured to divide her life into two ? or , more rarely , three ? periods . She might work until she produced a baby , but then she must either bury her vocation altogether , exchanging it for that of housewife-and-mother , or else lay it away for long years with the rather feeble hope of resuscitating it after the children were grown . That picture has now changed out of all recognition . Indeed , one hears wives arguing that children , instead of constituting the unanswerable argument against the two-income family , are strong arguments in its favor . " If it were n't for the children , " said one wife to me , " I 'd be tempted to try to get along on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need two incomes to enable us to have a house with a yard that the children can play in ; to live in a neighborhood where I do n't have to worry about their playmates ; to provide a guitar for the musical one and dancing lessons for the one who needs to improve her muscular co-ordination ? not to mention teeth-straightening and medical insurance and the bonds we are stowing away for their education . " None of these young mothers denies that children need more than material goods , that they need personal care , attention , and affection . But they are convinced that a child is not worse off for being deprived of the full-time solicitude and attention of one parent exclusively ; that , in fact , he is better off when the parents share in the job of parenthood ; and that even if the parents differ in their treatment of the child , this is not necessarily a grave disadvantage . I know , for instance , one family in which the mother is efficient , orderly , dependable , and inclined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy-going , and playful . Said the wife to me , " Our children know what to expect of each of us . They know they can run a bit wild with him , but that they will have to cope with me , too . They will have to learn to get along sooner or later with all sorts of people , and they might as well learn it sooner , with those who love them . They take us both in their stride , and I believe our extremes of temperament are somewhat modified by our joint association with them . " Nevertheless there remain inescapable problems in the care of children when both parents work away from home . If the wife 's earnings are small , these problems are real and difficult : it may be that every penny earned ( after income taxes ) will be swallowed up in the hire of the necessary services . And even if she makes a good salary , she has to do some canny contriving . These problems have been attacked in a variety of ways , depending upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional woman with three children ? one in school , one in nursery school , and one a toddler ? who needed both a housekeeper and a nursemaid , but could not afford both , even though she made a good income . She hired one full-time domestic , chosen primarily for her child-care qualifications and only secondarily as a housekeeper ; installed all possible labor-saving equipment , some of which she could acquire through her professional services to the suppliers ; and was able to divide the residual domestic chores between her husband , herself , and the housekeeper . I know another one who placed her children in a state-operated child-care center which had been established in wartime when women war - workers were essential . The youngest children spent the whole day at the center ; the others went there directly from school . Far from suffering from this regime , the children flourished under it . They had previously been somewhat over-indulged and had run rough-shod over their mother and other adults ; now they have become so well adjusted that they would be welcome in any society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that provide them offer a satisfactory solution to the outstanding problem of the low-income family , which must balance cash earned by the wife against increased cash expenditure to fill her home functions . But most of them are not available to middle-income families . Most mothers in this bracket must therefore make do with mothers ' helpers , nursery schools , school playground facilities , community recreation centers , and , of course , baby-sitters ; plus boys ' and girls ' camps for the summer months . And of course there is a certain amount of group co-operation among the working parents . In one instance , the mothers take turns , each on her day off , looking after the children of the group , who are brought to the sitter 's house . In another instance , a schoolteacher operates a summer guest house for the children of her college friends , on her family 's ranch . Some of these are stop-gap measures . But because the parents with whom I have talked regard their dual-income situation as a permanent , rather than a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment , satisfactory solutions will be worked out . Even if the wife 's contribution to income is almost or even wholly canceled out by the increased expenditure it entails , the net result may be on the credit side of the ledger in terms beyond those of the immediate budget . For one thing , it may have the important value of job-satisfaction . The college professor who earns less than the garage mechanic ? and the examples could be multiplied by the dozens ? knows that part of his compensation lies in doing the work he likes . Many a young man has faced and made that choice . The recognition that a woman might similarly prefer bookkeeping to housekeeping , even if she saved as much money by staying at home as she would make outside , has been delayed , largely because women were limited in the opportunity to find out whether housekeeping was indeed their preferred m ? tier . It was not , as William James would say , a " live issue . " It may have taken a world war , inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not likely to lapse into any " innocuous desuetude . " The second imponderable to be considered against immediate cash is the value of job-continuity , with its corollaries of dependability and opportunity for advancement . Even though the wife 's contribution may barely cover expenses at the outset , it may be profitable in terms of long-range investment . W HAT happens when circumstances arise to split the dual-income arrangement geographically ? Suppose the husband is transferred to another locality , or the wife is offered a position of advancement which involves moving and , if accepted , would require her husband to give up his own previous position ? Legally , the husband 's domicile determines the wife 's , even if she is the sole support of the family and he contributes nothing but his presence . Law is basically a codification of established custom , and though its modifications always run far behind changes in 62 I/ARPER 'S custom , it still reflects the most commonly accepted attitude . Even now , the wife is likely to be the one who has to make an adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required of her to adapt her special skills to a new occupational framework , to turn a former avocation into a primary instead of a secondary vocation , to seek or invent new avenues for promoting the sale of the abilities she has to offer . But there is a ground swell of change even in this tradition-weighted attitude . Much depends here on the husband 's ability to put preconceptions aside and view the problem freshly and realistically . If the wife 's job pays more , or offers greater prospects of advancement which would be lost if she moved when her husband was transferred , these are questions of common finance , not to be judged in terms of emotional conflict . Some jobs are readily transportable , others are not . Thus far , in feeling their way , women have tended to focus on the more flexible occupations , and expect to do the major part of the adjusting if any is necessary . This may be good for their wits , and a certain amount of adaptability is a valuable job-quality for either man or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the man is an accountant and could be fairly sure of finding a position almost anywhere , and the woman is , say , a marine biologist who would find herself in an occupational desert in Iowa , then the adjustment might reasonably be in the other direction . There is still a lingering feeling in the public mind that certain occupations are inherently appropriate for women ? notably teaching , diatetics , nursing , library work , social service , and of course secretarial work . But the present generation of working wives spans a great range of occupations . On my list of acquaintances are photographers , florists , restaurateurs , psychologists and psychiatric aides , typographers and editors , as well as a veterinarian , a poultry farmer , a dog breeder , an architect , and an investigator for the U. S. Bureau of Internal Revenue . What especially interests me is the inventiveness which many women are showing in thinking up new occupations which fill needs occasioned by the very fact that two-income families are so plentiful . One woman has paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own school bus ( the family car ) to pick up the other pupils . Another operates a " Children 's Escort Service , " taking groups of children to the circus and the zoo and on picnics and local sightseeing trips . Another has set up a bring-yourchild baby-sitting center . She happens to live in a rather large old house with a yard and sleeping porches ; she began with a modest outlay for extra cots , blankets , toys , bottles , and mugs , and has increased her equipment gradually as her clientele expanded ; her individual fees are moderate , but they add up to a good living . Jobs of this sort might be described as newly-invented answers to the old question , " Who takes care of the caretaker 's daughter when the caretaker 's busy taking care ? " Iv T HE depression years , the war years , and the postwar years have cracked the old economic-social family mold . These were forces outside the control of individual women , but they have learned a lesson from circumstances . The working wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , and are determined not to repeat them . The first of these lessons is that dual-income living must be continuous . It is a fallacy to imagine that one can lay it aside for twenty years and then pick it up where one left off . " Previous experience , housewife , " is no recommendation for non-housewifely employment . Training lapses with disuse or is outmoded by technical advances . The older women who try to " break back in " have a bleak time of it . The second lesson is that a woman must have definite , marketable assets that are worth somebody 's money to pay for . She must not expect people to give her a job because she has a pretty talent and wants to " do something with her time " or because she wants to express her personality or even because she has good ideas about the way a business might be run . She must be able to produce results that are worth dollars and cents . Does anybody imagine this means the working wives of 1951 have become materialistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family life ? You would not believe so if you heard the sort of comments on two-income living that I have been hearing recently from those who are engaged in it . I think of one wife who told me that the extra things which her income earned did n't seem luxuries to her ; she called them " the difference between bare living and a life , " adding , " I believe my husband and children are entitled to that difference if it is obtainable . If I could make it obtainable , and did n't , I 'd feel myself a deliberate failure as a wife and mother . I do n't look on the ' tired business man ' as a comic figure ; I think he is a tragedy ? and an unnecessary tragedy . " I think of another who said to me , " Marriage taught me that an insurance for security in the dim future is n't enough . We need our security here and now and continuously , and it takes two to provide it . " And I think , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband had been stubbornly opposed to her taking a job , and was not fully converted until the evening when her small son said to him in confidential mood , " Daddy , are n't you awfully glad mother has gone to work instead of sticking round the house all the time ? She 's so much easier to get along with ! " I CAN remember the suffrage parades , though the leaders in that fight were in an older age-bracket than mine . I belonged to the National Woman 's Party . I wrote articles and made speeches opposing legal discrimination against ( or , for that matter , for ) women . When my husband proposed to me , I told him , with a sort of hesitant defiance , that I was not a housekeeper . I was not so naive as to talk about my " career , " but I suppose I did think of myself as at least a foot soldier in the worthy cause of women 's rights . My daughter and her friends think all those ideas are " quaint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " irrelevant , immaterial , and incompetent . " The working wives of 1951 are not motivated by feminism , but by common sense applied to economic dilemma . Their design for living has its holes and rough edges , but they are confident that it is firmly grounded on emotional as well as material fact . They are sure it will work ? because it has to !
