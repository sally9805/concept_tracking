 | MUST WE TAX THE RAILROADS OUT OF BUSINESS ? Exorbitant and inequitable state and local levies are not only bleeding these ' tntial carriers to death but are helping to subsidize the competition On the edge of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana 's Glacier County lies the town of Cut Bank ( pop . 4500 ) . Surprisingly , this small community casts a large and expensive airport : cost about four million dollars of leral funds and it covers three : Ines the area of New York 's La Guardia Airport . Only one carrier , Western Airlines , uses this field . In 1 ) 58 about two passengers a day r ( larded its planes there . But the townspeople feel an airport is so important that they are willing to pay for its maintenance by keeping its 1703 acres off the tax rolls and assessing tax a special annual airport tax against local property owners . On the face of it , this makes sense . If the citizens are willing to pay for an airport , well and good . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logic becomes a little blurred . In 1958 the Great Northern Railroad , which runs through Cut Bank and is therefore a local taxpayer , was assessed $2530 as its share of the costs of this competing facility ; in the same year Western Airlines paid $41.17 ! But if you should accuse Cut Bank of unfairness to the Great Northern , the city fathers could point out that in whacking the railroad hard with local taxes they were only following well-established practice . Some of our biggest cities ? New York , Cleveland , Boston , Pittsburgh , to name just a few ? are masters of this art , and thousands of smaller taxing bodies are also practicing it with a will . In 1958 the bills of all these  | state and local tax collectors added up to a railroad tax of 400 million dollars ( in addition to 550 million dollars in federal income and payroll taxes ) . More than any other single factor , it is this huge sum that is causing our railroads frantic concern over what a 1958 Senate report called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails have seen their revenues increase less than one percent a year over the past decade , their state and local taxes have climbed at the rate of more than three percent annually ! There are two reasons for the railroads ' concern : the sheer size of the taxes , and the relationship between the railroads ' taxes and those paid by their fast-growing competitors . The first problem stems from the fact that the railroads are the largest industrial owners of real estate in the United States , with 386,000 miles of track taking them into 96 percent of our 3067 counties . This means that their rails run through literally thousands of individual tax jurisdictions ? states , cities , towns , villages and school districts ? to which every year they must contribute . In New York State alone the railroads contribute to more than 6000 taxing bodies . If these taxes had some logical relationship to the railroads ' earnings in each community , the system might make some sense . But there is no such relationship . In New Jersey , the Pennsylvania Railroad paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Toledo , Ohio , the local ne papers and the chamber of co coerce conducted a campaign force the New York Central to build a new passenger station , though old station was already running a deficit . The Central did build a new terminal , at a cost of $4,856,000 , an d the annual tax on it jumped from $8484 too $48,799 . In Pittsburgh , the Pennsylvania Railroad spent $9,500,000 in real ' ing its tracks and rebuilding its senger shed as part of the cit Golden Triangle redevelopment p gram ? and immediately got slap with a tax boost of $31,000 annu on the improvement . And whenever the construction a new highway or the improvem of an old one necessitates buildi an overpass or changing a gr crossing ? which happens hundr of times every year ? the railr not only has to contribute to the c struction bill but finds itself pay more in taxes for the improvem Exorbitant overvaluation of r road facilities for tax purposes i temptation that many local po cians can not resist . Jersey City , N. a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When one railr serving this city sold 33 acres recently ? just to cut down on crushing tax burden ? the land , sessed at $621,296 , sold for $19,472 . One of the odd results of the multiplicity and overlapping of tax judo , dictions is that the railroad Indust ' contributes more tax money direct to education than does any other pri- vate institution . Every year about 60 percent of the railroads ' property taxes in Illinois go to education . In 1956 , 45 percent of the Pennsylvania Railroad 's 32-million-dollar state and local taxes went to schools . In School District No. 7 of Lincoln County , Montana , the Great Northern pays 91.38 percent of all school taxes levied in the district ? despite the fact that the railroad 's property comprises only one third of one per , lit of the land . Altogether , the railnads ' state and local tax bill for education in 1958 ? an estimated 140 union dollars ? was equal to allost a third of the federal government 's contribution to the same school systems ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their competitors is the other half of the picture . Here again the problem goes back to the fact that the railroads own so much real estate : statio ns in the hearts of cities , freight yards in their outskirts , and hunreds of thousands of miles of track from coast to coast . All this they build and maintain themselves , and on all of it they pay taxes . But who builds , maintains and owns the airports , the waterways and the highways ? By and large it is the government , and the government pays no tax . Nor , in any sense comparable to the railroads , do the airplanes , barges and trucks that use se facilities . The airlines and water carriers nothing at all toward the construction and maintenance of their rights of way and signaling systems . The trucking industry does pay taxes in the form of registration and mileage fees , and in fuel and equipment levies . But these are merely user charges , intended to do no more than contribute toward highway construction , maintenance and administration costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal auto motive excise taxes be earmarked exclusively for highway purposes . ) The railroads , on the other hand , without a cent of government subsidy , pay the full costs of building , maintaining and administering their rights of way , and it is the railroads , and the railroads alone , that must pay additional hundreds of millions of dollars toward the administrative costs of general government of the communities through which they run . In New York City the railroads pay about nine million dollars in taxes on their passenger facilities . How much of this goes to support the city 's two giant airports , La Guardia and Idlewild , it is impossible to estimate . Certainly some does , since these two fields pay no taxes . Boston 's 2000-acre Logan International Airport , which cost 74 million dollars of city , state and federal funds , is not taxed at all . But the New Haven Railroad 's 31-acre South Station in downtown Boston pays the city over a million dollars every year in taxes ? about the same as the user fees paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads paid 32  | IN CONCLUDING an investigation begun more than three years ago , the Interstate Commerce Commission has urgently recommended a series of specific steps to revive dwindling railroad passenger travel . These steps include relief from local , state and federal taxes ? among them being the repeal of a ten-percent federal excise on passenger fares . The I.C.C . strongly urged equitable treatment of the railroads with other modes of travel . It declared : " The impetus given motor and air travel by federal , state and local government promotional programs has unquestionably operated to the disadvantage of railroad passenger service . Yet there is little evidence of any comparable government effort to promote the public interest in railroad passenger service or to prevent or to take into account competitive inequalities that may be induced by such promotional programs . " million dollars in property taxes in 1955.7 he 244 truck lines doing business in the state , the 17 certificated airlines and the 65 barge and towing companies paid $800,000 . The one encouraging glimmer of light for the railroads is the fact that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early this year a report to the governor of New York by his special assistant on transportation admitted that the state 's treatment of the railroads was grossly unfair , and went on to say that this was actually costing the state money in the form of lost business and employment . As a result , the legislature has already enacted measures to alleviate the situation to some degree . In West Virginia railroad tax reform is likewise before the lawmakers . At the federal level , Senator George A. Smathers of Florida has conducted long and deep-probing hearings into the rail situation . The report of his subcommittee recommends that state and local governments re-examine railroad taxes to correct the " inequitable tax situation . " The problem is such a pressing one that the air is suddenly full of suggested solutions . Some observers suggest that railroad property used in connection with passenger service should be exempted from taxation , since it is easily demonstrable that the railroads lose money on passengers . Others favor some kind of government subsidy for the railroads , to offset the subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the solution lies in slapping heavier taxes on the railroads ' competitors . All these suggestions ignore one basic fact . It is our national policy to treat our so-called " highways of commerce " ? roads , airways , canals ? as precious national assets and to keep them free of taxation . Why ,  | it should this policy not apply to the railroads ? Certainly , in terms of the tonnage they carry , these are the most important transportation arteries of all . Why must they pay any property taxes ? Despite the apparent logic of such reasoning , nobody has yet dared to voice this suggestion . Property taxes n c traditionally the province of the states , and who wants to stand up in public and ask the states to cut down the tree that rains 400 million dollars into their treasuries every year ? But somebody will have to start talking in these stark terms soon . For this tax shakedown is inflicting such deep financial wounds that the railroads ' very existence is threatened . @#       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
