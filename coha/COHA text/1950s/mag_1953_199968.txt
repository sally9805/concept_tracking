As the 3-D craze swept Hollywood , Variety reported last week that one producer claimed he was going to shoot his next picture in a process " much better even than 3-D . " i.e. , 4-D . " It means , " the moviemaker explained , " that I 'm using 3-D and I 've got a story , too . " The week 's two new 3-D movies seemed to concentrate on stereoscopic effects rather than dramatic effectiveness . <P> House of Wax ( Warner ) , a remake of the 1933 2-D thriller , The Mystery of the Wax Museum , pictures Vincent Price as an insane sculptor who murders his victims and then immerses them in molten tallow for his waxworks display . At the end , meeting a fate he has richly earned , he falls into a puddle of his own wax . <P> An intermittently gripping shocker , House of Wax . utilizes the process known as Warner Phonic sound ( multiple sound tracks and speakers ) mostly for recording eerie musical effects and the screams of ingenues . The picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , 1952 ) , and calls for Polaroid spectacles .

The picture 's writing and direction are also blurry , and the extra dimension is used primarily as a trick . All sorts of objects pop out at the audience from the screen : fists , a skeleton 's hand , cancan dancers ' legs , guns , pickaxes , spears , falling bodies . As Waxworks Proprietor Price says at one point : " I 'm going to give the people what they want-sensation , horror , shock . " If , as Hollywood fondly hopes , this is what moviegoers want , House of Wax is a howling success . <P> Man in the Dark ( Columbia ) is photographed in Columbia 's own 3-D process ( also requiring Polaroid glasses ) . It is a black &; white cops &; robbers yarn about a criminal ( Edmond O'Brien ) who , as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he has stashed away the $130,000 take from a payroll robbery . Like House of Wax , the movie seems tireless in depicting objects jumping out at the audience : surgical instruments , a car , a bird , a spider . In fact , just about everything seems to come out at the moviegoer except a good movie .
