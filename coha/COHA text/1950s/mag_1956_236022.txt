Some like their ballet new , lean and glinting ; they favor the New York City Ballet . Some like it pageantesque , formal and applauseworthy ; they favor London 's Sadler 's Wells . Some like it storyful , mellow and magical ; they had almost no place to turn except Copenhagen , where the Royal Danish Ballet spun comfortably on its 200-year-old tradition , rarely ventured into the outside world ( TIME , Aug. 31 , 1953 ) . But last week the Danes were in Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House , and provided crowds with something to cherish for years to come . <P> Foam Rubber . On the festive opening night ( Danish national anthem , speeches , cheers ) the featured work was La Sylphide , choreographed by famed August Bournonville in 1836 and passed down virtually unchanged from lip to toe . It begins with a round of mimed action during which some observers usually expect the dancers to burst into recitative and aria at any moment . The white-clad sylph ( Margrethe Schanne ) , her supernatural character implicit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotch farm boy ( Henning Kronstam ) ; but when the family arrives , she dashes over to the fireplace and literally whisks up the chimney . <P> After that , the growing drama of the boy 's unhappy betrothal to a human girl is developed through the dancers ' fingertips-pointing at the eyes to indicate tears , at the forehead for mystification , at the ceiling to swear by all that 's holy , etc . There are magic veils , palm reading and plots until the sylph 's little wings drop off and , faltering as if blind , she dies . When , amid all this fabulizing , they get a chance to dance , the Danes are light on their toes-as if the stage were covered with foam rubber and their movements are graceful rather than virtuoso . Everything they do onstage helps the drama , and so there are no star dancers , nor is there much pause for applause . Nevertheless there were gasps of approval at the powerful male leaps . <P> Green Seaweed . Choreographer Bournonville 's other big ballet of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1842 ) , had even more pantomime as well as one long actful of leaps and turns . It also contained a memorable little piece of stage magic that delighted New York City audiences as if they were children at their first puppet show . When Teresina ( Kirsten Ralov ) is turned into a naiad , she kneels in a pink gown , then suddenly stands up dressed in green seaweed . Later , with as little fanfare and in full view , she suddenly switches back to pink . <P> There is less magic in the minor fare offered by the Royal Danes-Graduation Ball is even more giddy than Ballet Theater 's version ; Dream Pictures is a pointless period piece that does , however , include a hilarious dance by three doddering octogenarian couples . While it is at the Met , the company will offer the first U.S. performances of Romeo and Juliet , with the Prokofiev score and new choreography by Frederick Ashton . Then it will visit ten cities in the eastern U.S. and Canada to give more Americans a chance to see ballet storyful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
