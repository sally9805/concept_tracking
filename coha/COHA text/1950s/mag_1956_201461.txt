When Danish-born Pianist-Funnyman Victor Borge did his record-running ( 849 performances ) one-man show on Broadway , union rules demanded that he be assisted by eleven stagehands and four stand-by musicians . The musicians never played , and what the stagehands did remains a mystery . Last week Borge transported his Broadway show , in a cut version and with a few additions , to TV . When all the producers , directors , musicians , stagehands , boom pushers , scenery movers , cameramen , set painters , carpenters , copyists , audio and video control men were counted , it was clear that network TV 's first one-man show called for more than 200 people to get it on the air . <P> In moving from the stage to TV , Borge 's show suffered a loss of the intimacy that the unmelancholy Dane 's comic style demands . The hilarious mood of Comedy in Music was also seriously damaged by an overlong potpourri of Tchaikovsky melodies , played by a full orchestra and conducted by a Borge suddenly turned serious maestro . But despite everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his deserved laughs as he coughed his way through Debussy 's Claire de Lune , tangoed his way through Jealousy while sitting at the piano , doublecrossed the studio audience by playing Tea for Two off key while the audience was humming it , took his bows with the stagehands.
