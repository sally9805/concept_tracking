From the day Raider Louis Wolfson became chief stockholder of American Motors , Wall Streeters wondered what he planned to do with the 420,000 shares ( 7% ) owned by him and his family . Last week the SEC enlightened them . It discovered that Wolfson had sold all his A.M.C. stock while publicly proclaiming his great faith in the company . Then he and associates had sold short at least 150,000 shares , i.e. , sold borrowed stock in the expectation of buying it back at lower prices . After that , charged the SEC , they had made " false and misleading statements , " and put out " bogus information " to drive down the price of the stock so that they could cover their short interest . The SEC got a restraining order in court to prevent Wolfson from what it termed fraudulent stock manipulations . <P> Cleaned Out . As long ago as April , there were rumors that Wolfson was selling . But on April 7 Wolfson announced that he was " perfectly satisfied " with the progress of American Motors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , when reporters checked with William A. Shea , an attorney for Wolfson , he blandly denied any selling . Yet by that time , the SEC discovered , Wolfson and his associates had already disposed of 134,300 shares of stock through two Manhattan brokerage firms . <P> The Wolfson group continued to sell until it had cleaned out its holdings . Estimated profit on the sale : $2.5 million . Then , said the SEC , Wolfson began to sell short in the belief that A.M.C. sales would slide and the price of the stock drop . But A.M.C. car sales rose and the stock did not drop ; the Wolfson accounts were eventually caught in a short position of about 150,000 shares . <P> Fortnight ago , when Wolfson no longer owned any American Motors stock , Alexander Rittmaster , a business associate who Wolfson once said " speaks for me , " told the New York Times that Wolfson had sold a quarter of the shares , still had 300,000 to go . Another Wolfson associate got out a statement the same day saying that Wolfson confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down 1 ? points to 11 ? , and about 50,000 shares were bought for Wolfson accounts to help cover their short positions before the SEC got its court order . <P> Contempt Charges ? The SEC will argue its case against Wolfson in court Aug. 5 . Meanwhile , Wolfson can cover his short position only at the risk of contempt proceedings , and any broker who aids him may face the same charge . If the short sales are not covered , he runs the risk of losing heavily if A.M.C. shares rise . At week 's end American Motors Boss George Romney stepped in to clear the air , also gave one reason why the stock may well rise . American Motors had no way of knowing that Wolfson was disposing of his stock , * said Romney , who praised the SEC 's action . More important , he announced that American Motors operations for the third quarter will be " even more profitable than previously expected , " i.e. , nine months ' earnings of about $12,300,000 v. last year 's nine-month deficit of $6,467,926 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could well hit between $2.50 and $2.75 per share . <P> <P> * Under SEC rules , shareholders are not obliged to report stock transactions unless they own 10% of the outstanding stock or are officers or directors of the firm .
