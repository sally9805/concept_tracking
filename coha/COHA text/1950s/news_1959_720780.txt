txt Massachusetts is paying four times as much for its proposed $30,000,000 16-story state office building as the Travelers Insurance Company paid for its le , story downtown building containing about half as much floor space . the Massachusetts Citizens ' Committee pointed out today . The committee this week instituted a 30-taxpayers suit in the Supreme Judicial Court challenging the constitutionality of the 1958 act setting up a three-member private corporation to construct the state office building and lease it to the state . Until the court case is cleared , the State Office Building Association can not float the bonds needed to finance the structure . At the same time , the citizens ' committee continued its drum-fire criticism of the lease signed by Charles F. Mahoney . State Commissioner of Administration , with the association under . which the state is to pay a S2,500,000 annual rental for 23 years for the completed structure . Pig in a Poke ' The committee charged that under terms of the lease the state " agrees to pay an estimated S74,200,000 for a pig in a poke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental will total $57 , - 500.000 over 23 years , the committee added that the state will be required to maintain the building at an estimated cost of S725,000 a year , or a $16,675 , - 000 total over the 23 years . In addition , the state must pay-all valid claims against the association for personal Injury or property damage , plus litigation expenses and any taxes levied against the corporation . Comparing the cost of the state office building with that of the new Travelers building , the committee said the latter building cost the insurance company S7.500,000 , including purchase of the land . The Travelers building includes 298,000 square feet , compared with 583.000 square feet of floor space in the proposed state office building , plus 100,000 square feet of garage space , according to the association 's announced plan . the corporation may spend any of the $30,000,000 which may be left over after construction . " At the same time the citizen 's committee disputed claims that the state plan is like the installment purchase contracts under which private corporations have built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal contracts are full of safeguards which are.completely lacking in the state lease . Furthermore , the committee said the federal installment purchase plan , in operation between 1954 and 1957 , " was dropped by Congress when it found it cost more to use a middle man corporation than to have the government construct them . " The citizens ' group stressed that the federal program required competitive bidding on financing and construction and that the buildings were constructed in accordance with detailed plans and specifications prepared by the federal government . The latter also supervised construction . Any alterations made by the federal government were the property of the federal government . " The federal government has never created a special corporation for the sole purpose of constructing a federal office building , " the committee added . The committee has been seeking passage of legiSlation to surround the State Office Building Association with safeguards to protect the public interest . Picture Held Unclear Recalling that Commissioner Mahoney said that even the proposed new building will not be big enough in a few years , the committee charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this inadequate building . The lease merely requires that the building have at least 500,000 square feet and that it be constructed ' substantially ' in accordance with the ' general description ' contained in the lease . " There is no provision in the lease for state supervision of construction nor for slate inspection of the completed building to make sure it at least meets the general description in the lease . " The state may make any repairs , alterations or additions to the building at its own expense but any such alterations , additions , etc. , become the property of the three-man corporation . " The corporation is made up of William F. Callahan , Chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority ; Otis M. Whitney , State Commissioner of lnsur- , ance , and Anthony N. DiNatale , State Commissioner of Public Works . All ** named personally in the legislation , not by office . Surplus Fund Watched Other criticism outlined by the citizens ' committee in its latest issue of " The Watchdog " was that the lease " does not require the corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30,000,000 in bonds or on the construction contract , nor does it require payment of the prevailing wage , " There is no restriction on how
