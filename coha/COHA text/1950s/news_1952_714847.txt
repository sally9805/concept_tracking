txt Gov . Adlai Stevenson , Democratic nominee for President , told his Illinois constituents farewell today at the state fair 's traditional Governor 's day ceremonies , and fought back at Republicans who attacked him yesterday from the same platform . In a farewell address , in which he said good-by six times in six different ways , Stevenson accepted one Republican charge  --  that he is a captive candidate  --  as a fact , and said he hoped he could bear it with " becoming modesty . " He enumerated his captors as the city bosses , the CIO , the Dixiecrats , President Truman , Wall street , and the Americans for Democratic Action , a left wing political group . He said his captors fight amongst themselves , but that it 's " not too uncomfortable to be captured by most everybody except the Republican old guard . " Stevenson singled out for attack or ridicule in the ? Republican party , tho not by name , its Vice Presidential candidate , Sen. Nixon , former President Hoover , and Sen. Dirksen R. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a foil in introducing Vice President Barkley to the crowd , saying that the 77 year old former President 's speech at the Republican convention last month in Chicago was " deeply melancholy in tone , " was couched in " funereal language , " and gave the effect of " black , unrelieved gloom . " Barkley , Stevenson said , is a " stripling of 74 " who " exulted in the prospects of democracy , speaking with robust and youthful confidence about the exciting years ahead . " He referred to Barkley 's speech at the Democratic convention in Chicago shortly after labor leaders had put the " too old " sign on Barkley 's ambitions for President . " The Republican party , " Stevenson said , " is the party which makes even its young men seem old . The Democratic party is the party which makes even its old men seem young . " He said that fact would be demonstrated by a contrast between Barkley 's speech today and Sen. Nixon 's speech on Republican day yesterday . Nixon is 39 . Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's discussions yesterday of eating fried mush at the Eisenhower camp in Colorado . That may explain the Republican difficulty in finding something to say , Stevenson said . For Dirksen , who has referred to Stevenson as the worst governor Illinois has had this century , , Stevenson used this thrust : " I 'm not the only governor on whom he has poured his rich and reckless invective . I can well understand why he should look back with sentimental regret to the more bounteous days of my predecessor here in Springfield . " The references were to Dirksen 's speech attacking Gov . Dewey at the Republican convention , and to former Gov . Green , whom Stevenson defeated in Illinois in 1948 . Pokes at Eisenhower At one point in the speech an exuberant rooter in the stands shouted loudly and clearly , " atta boy , Adlai , give ' em hell . " Gen. Eisenhower , the Republican candidate , did not escape Stevenson 's innuendo . At two places in his speech he made jokes about what has become a standard antiEisenhower item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one farewell , Stevenson said , " I am about to leave you on long journey , and the route , by the way , wo n't be a military secret . " At another point , in discussing governmental theory , &man,; said , " the essence of republican government is not command . It is consent . " Stevenson reviewed what he called the accomplishments of his three and a half year administration in Illinois , and said he has learned much in those years . Now he said , he faces " a future limitless with danger and opportunity . " Decries Cry for Change Stevenson rapped Republicans for advocating a " doctrine of change for the sake of change . ' " It is like buying a surprise package at a novelty store , " he said . He tore into " me , too " campaigning and referred to ' he Republican day yesterday as a " bipartisan gathering with representatives from both branches of the Republican party . " In his speech . billed yesterday as one which would deal with foreign policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of applause , which was generally restrained , came when he predicted his own election . Hits at Shift In Power " We talk about and deplore incessantly the increasing centralization of power over our lives in Washington , " Stevenson said . " But that tidal drift toward the capital will go on and on unless those necessary functions of government which do n't have to he performed in Washington are performed , and properly performed , at the state or local level . The people will demand the services and ri they do n't get them at home they will turn to Uncle Sun . And cry dollar you send to Washington to pay for t hem will shrink before it gets back ironic . " Enemies Are Because our enemies are big , because business and labor and agriculture are big , because everything is big and organized nowadays . our federal government has inevitably become bigger too . But it should be unencumbered in the discharge of its monstrous major duties by a lot of other jobs it need not do . And the states are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters sweeping toward the DiRlHet of Columbia . " While I want you to sweep me down there , do n't sweep any more government jurisdiction down there ! Sometimes one must overcome a feeling of reluctance about changing jobs . But the reluctance I feel about bigger and bigger jobs for the federal government is a reluctance I wo n't get over ! " Heads Motorcade to Fair Stevenson headed an open auto motorcade to the fair , and was fleetingly applauded as he moved thru the crowds in the . fairgrounds . One woman shouted " We like Ike " at the parade , and then to make sure the governor heard , she ran forward nearer his car and repeated the slogan . Back at the executive mansion , Stevenson entertained 50 political leaders headed by Col. J. M. Arvey , national committeeman from Illinois , at lunch , and then received other guests on the lawn . Earlier in the day Stevenson talked to Paul Fitzpatrick , New York state chairman , and promised an appearance at the Democratic state convention Aug. 28 , Fitzpatrick told reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm leaders .
