At foreign-aid time , there are few sharper antagonists in the House than Louisiana Democrat Otto Passman and Minnesota Republican Walter Judd-Passman passionately against , Judd dourly for . Louisiana 's Passman , 59 , onetime refrigerator distributor and World War II Navy materiel and procurement officer , seven-term Congressman and Appropriations Committee axman , is an acknowledged expert who knows how to find every foreign-aid dollar in every foreign-aid pipeline and how to take maximum debating advantage thereof . Minnesota 's Dr. Judd. 60 , onetime medical missionary in China , is a nine-term Congressman and Foreign Affairs Committee veteran who just as expertly supports foreign aid out of his own personal experiences . <P> Last week , as the House considered the President 's request for $3.9 billion for foreign aid in fiscal 1960 , the rivals took to the floor , soon moved from statistics and specifics to their basic philosophies . Said Otto Passman , dazzlingly arrayed in a crisp white linen suit : " First , we can not spend ourselves rich . Second , we can not make ourselves secure by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were once told that foreign aid would stop Communism . Now we are told it is our duty to buy our way of life for countries all over the world . But we can not in fact improve their living standards by as much as one per cent even if we should give away everything we own . " <P> Replied Minnesota 's spectacled Walter Judd : " The question is what is to happen in our nation 's interest . Sometimes we act as if we were not at war-and in the most perilous situation in which the U.S. has ever been-partly because it does not look like war . Therefore we do not go all out to do the things necessary to win . " <P> At debate 's end the House , by 279,136 , upheld Otto Passman , upheld the Appropriations Committee 's slash of foreign-aid funds from the President 's $3.9 billion to $3.1 billion , including $435 million lopped off U.S. military aid to U.S. allies .                 @ @ @ @
