IT HAS been frequently said that sometime in his career every citizen should take a turn at being a public servant of some sort , for in this way he might gain some concept of what it is like to he on the receiving end of public scrutiny . The same , 1 think , might be said of working in a school . The attitude that one takes away from school as a graduating pupil is a compound of sentiment , suspicion , pleasure , pride and , with luck , a little respect for learning . The parents ' attitude toward school is quite different . School becomes a third force in the family , an institution that steps between parent and child , and it becomes in many adult minds a wholly unreasonable ogre that delights in making silly rules , that takes pleasure in establishing unattainable standards , and likes to make parents feel that they do n't really know anything about their own offspring . I suppose that there has always been and will always be a war between parents and schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools like government bureaus need criticism from the citizens to see that they do their job . But get on the inside of the school and look out at the parents , and the picture strangely changes . Parents in the eyes of the school principal and of the teacher become part of their children , because the teacher sees the child as a member of a family unit . There is a gap between parent and teacher that can only he partially bridged , not for any lack of eagerness on both sides but because there is a difference in point of view almost like that between generations , which can never quite be reconciled . When I was a school principal , not many years ago , I ran a boarding and day school for girls . One evening after dinner I went to my office and found a girl waiting to see me . She was from West Virginia and spoke with the accent of that part of the country . " Sir , " she said to me ( West Virginians evidently like to say " sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ? " I told her to come into the office . " Sir , " she said again , " would you do me a favor ? Would you keep this for me ? " She held out her hand and in it was a little , nickel-plated , pearl-handled Colt automatic . " Where , " I asked , " did you get that ? " And in her reply was the distance between teacher and pupil . teacher and parent , but confidence at the same time . " Why , sir , " she said , " Daddy gives us each one when we 're sixteen . " Get on the inside and Iook out . Think of the school not as a place to which children go but to which children come , not as a place to which children are sent but to which you welcome them . It looks quite different . Instead of seeing your child as the focal point of the school , if you are on the inside you see a group of human beings taking their place in a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their profession , and you change the aphorism to read , " Those who can , teach . " And if you are a school head you struggle to solve all of the hundreds of problems of the institution ( everything from plumbing to study schedules ) for one single purpose , to let those who can , teach , and those who can , learn . Schools vary as teachers and principals vary and as parents and children vary . In the days when Harper 's was founded there was just one curriculum in all schools . It was something like this : mathematics , Latin , Greek , rhetoric , logic , the art of speaking , and perhaps philosophy . Discipline was the watchword , not only intellectual discipline , but the birch-rod kind as well . The private schools prepared boys for college ( there was no college for women in the fifties ) and those who could not entrance . LOOK AT THE SCHOOL afford private school " read " their Latin and did their cramming for college under the stern eye of the parish minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of schools for those who were fortunate enough to be able to afford them , and the schools , so long as they met the requirements of the colleges , could teach as they thought best . And in this tradition of freedom to do their job as they saw it , the diversity of American education grew , experiments flourished , and the old was swept out or refurbished . So that now a parent can pick a locality , a kind of school , a big one or a small one , and there is an independent school to fill the need . Nobody , or almost nobody , wants his child to be the guinea pig for an experiment , and yet the laboratories must be constantly at work if education is not to become moss-grown . And this is the tradition of the independent schools which reaches back to the establishment of the first " academics " as they were called some three hundred years ago in New England and New York . The standards of the good school are its own standards , not those minima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the standards of its faculty , of skillful teaching , and intellectual curiosity . And for the parents who can choose , they can find the school for their child and a teacher looking from the inside out who can honestly say , " We know what you want for this child . Trust us , and we can give it to him .
