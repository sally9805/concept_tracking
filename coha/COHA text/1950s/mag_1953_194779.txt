Dad 's Last MIG Lieut . James F. ( " Dad " ) Low , 27 , left Korea for the U.S. last week , through with combat but not with flying . The Air Force has belatedly become the focus of his life : with nine MIG kills to his credit , he is one of the three top U.S. jet aces. - At 25 , Jim Low thousht of himself as a failure and a misfit . He had tried being a gambler , but could get nowhere with cards , dice or horses . Raised in Sausalito , a California town across the bay entrance from San Francisco , he had served three wartime years in the Navy as a radarman ( " a long , dull tour of duty , mostly with convoys " ) , had then gone to college on the G.I. Bill . But he could not get interested in engineering , geology or salesmanship . Finally he got himself accepted for pilot training in the Air Force.The other cadets , mostly younger than he , called him " Dad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad " Low knew that he had found himself . <P> One day last week , a grizzled veteran with eight kills and four rows of ribbons , Low took off from his interceptor base near Seoul . Over northwestern Korea , he and his wingman saw contrails ( vapor trails ) ; then Low spotted two MIGs , camouflage painted in green and brown . The enemy planes tried to get away , one zooming , the other diving . Low chased the <P> JET ACE Low Nine is too uneven . high MIG , but it disappeared in a haze . The wingman tangled with the diving MIG , which had a resourceful pilot in the cockpit . When the wingman had tired himself out trying to get a shot , Low took over , and the Red pilot almost tired Low out , trying to scrape him off against a high ridge , then trying to blind him in the sun . At last Low got the enemy in his sights , poured .50-caliber slugs into the engine and tail section , saw the MIG 's canopy fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the MIG 's cockpit and wing roots before the Red jet finally crashed and exploded . The fight had lasted 15 minutes , an unusually long time for jets . A few days later , " Dad " Low had his bags packed and was waiting for a transport to Tokyo when some 40 MIGs came howling down toward the front lines , as if feinting at Seoul . Low sweated that one out on the ground . But he said : " I sure would like to have hacked down just one more . Nine is such an uneven number . " <P> - The most kills in Korea ( 14 ) are credited to Major George A. Davis Jr . ( TIME , Dec. 24 , 1951 ) . missing in action since February . Major Frederick D. Blesse has shot down ten .
