txt Boston 's future as a port is not expected to be seriously impaired by the St. Lawrence Seaway . This is the consensus of those familiar with port affairs . The bulk of the 17,000,000 tons of cargo handled by the port in 1953 was made up of intraport , coastwise , and local traffic or import cargo that was destined for New England users , port statistics indicate . This , it is argued , will not be affected by the seaway . Only a small fraction of the port 's tonnage of freight is made up of goods going to or from Canada and the Midwest , which might use the seaway instead . Most Midwest products come through New York , Baltimore , or Philadelphia , because of the lower rail rates or more frequent ship railings , observers say . Canadian Trade Figures on just how much Midwest freight passes through Boston are not available . Only 13,800 tons  --  about two good shiploads  --  of freight went through Boston to Canada in 1952 . In the same year , Canadians shipped through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsprint . This Canadian business has been growing every year , and it is believed it will not be affected by the seaway , because most of it is moved in the winter months when the seaway would be closed by ice . Favorable rail rates are responsible for bringing most of it into the port . William H. Gulliver , Jr. , chairman of the Port of Boston Commissioners , pointed out that Boston still enjoys the advantage of being closer to Europe than any other North Atlantic port . If the current battle to bring rail freight rates to Boston down to a level with other ports on the eastern seaboard , the port will be in a good competitive position despite the seaway . Blow to Capital Richard Preston , chairman of the Massachusetts Development and Industrial Commission , agreed that the volume of shipping would not be adversely affected . But he added that the construction of the seaway " will have the effect of stifling any investment capital which might have been earmarked for the Port of Boston . " New Englanders in Congress have traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The argument was that it would mean the end of Boston as a port , The first significant break in this tradition came last January when Senator John F. Kennedy ( D ) of Massachusetts threw his weight behind the seaway , saying that he could see no great harm to New England and that regional feelings should not be allowed to stand in the way of the " legitimate needs and aspirations of other sections " of the nation . Senator Kennedy in his arguments for it said that export grain from Canada and Midwest states was the one commodity that might be lost . However , he pointed out that grain formed only nine-tenths of 1 per cent of the total traffic in the port in 1952 . Bottom Cargo Grain has value beyond its tonnage because it is useful as a ballast or bottom cargo . It is the only commodity Boston has to offer for ballast , and it is an attraction to ship operators . However , some doubt has been expressed as to whether even a great percentage of the grain shipments would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . Grain shipments are almost entirely controlled by the federal government contracts to ship it as aid to foreign countries .
