The Budapest monthly Muvelt Nep ( Cultured People ) laid out for its readers the Hungarian Communist line on dancing . The waltz and polka are " traditionally democratic . " The tango , fox trot and English waltz , though " reflections of the capitalist decline . . . can not be classed with American dances . They may now be danced with taste . " But the samba , swing , boogie-woogie , rumba , conga and the like " are tools of aggression let loose by the bosses of America against human culture and progress . " <P> However , warned Muvelt Nep : Hungarian youth need not react by dancing " in overalls and with a hammer clenched in the hand . " That would be " leftist deviationism. "
