A Stock Market AppraisalThat the stock market is not a " one way street " was evidenced again by some fairly active profit taking this week . There was strong sentiment among the experts in Wall Street that a correction was overdue . Most of these ideas have crystallized into the thought that between now and March , February being the most-mentioned month , there will be a correction which may lop off one-third to one-half of the average advances since the I election . In that section of the bull market attribut- ' able to election results which got underway late in October in anticipation of a Republican victory , industrials climbed 28.33 points or , 10.7% , to their early January , 1953 peak Railroads experienced a rise of 13.46 points or 13.6% over a comparable period , while utilities were up 3.46 points , or an even 7% . Of course , the Wall Streeters looking for a February " correction " have tradition with them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and railroads 33 . Still , the buying since election has probably been 20% speculative and 80% for long term investment by institm.ionti and other portfolios which do not buy to sell again in a hurry . However , there has been sufficient speculative buying to bring about a reaction if these short-terms decide that the market may decline sufficiently to permit purchases of stocks at substantially lower prices . Many of these opinions hold that the market will go higher after such a correction . In other words , stocks that have been sold should be replaced if such a decline does occur . Much depends on the news which flows out of Washington after the new administration conies into control . Tax news will carry special weightmarketwise . If controls lapse at end of April and it Is apparent that the excess profits tax will be permitted to end in June . these will be two points for the bulls . Meanwhile , the gathering opinion that a reaction is imminent will act as a brake on excesses . A questionnaire by this department to 10 persons . including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings out the idea from seven that the three Dow-Jones averages will end 1953 higher than they started . All 10 believe that the industrial average will get well through 300 , some visualizing as ' high as 850 before 1953 closes . The business men in the group expect that elimination of the excess profits tax would be of considerable value to industry and that although commodities Might continue to soften In 1953. such a decline would bring in increased consumer buying . The banking element of the group expects money to rule fairly tight during 1953 and a lot of private money to go into business as a result . This might mean less money for securities . There is a general atmosphere of optimism among all ten as to the economic , business and financial outlook this year . but all suggest that there may be some difficult adjUstments which should , however , in the long run be of immeasureble benefit . Among common equities , the brokers and trader ! favor higher prices for these groups in the following order : chemicals , utilities , steels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks getting the most votes for doing better in 1953 included Union Carbide , Chrysler , U. S. Steel , Armco , Zenith . Panhandle Eastern , American Gas &; Electric , General Dynamics , American Agricultural Chemical , Southern Railway , Atchison , Phillips Petroleum and Illinois Central . Brokers generally believe that 1953 is going to be a year of more split stocks and such suggestions go as high as lists of 130 candidates . Obviously many of these will not be split , but as demand increases for investment purposes , it may be that many of those shares which now have very limited markets will be forced to consider splitting their shares . In fact , some of them are already doing so . Companies have added considerably to their shareholder lists in 1952 . American Telephone &; Telegraph leads in this regard . It is understood that this company , with the largest stockholders ' list in the world , ended 1952 with 1,200,000 registered share owners , which was 125.000 more than at the close of 1951 . Of the new shareholders , 95,000 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employestockholders " . Both of these extraordinary totals indicate a strong investment demand . Inasmuch as most of the firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange have far fewer than 125,000 shareholders , the addition by American Telephone during 1953 is a striking reflection of those who are buying for a good yield based on stable earnings and sagacious management . By and large , a consensus of market opinion indicates the present plateau on which the market is resting may favor those , who are calling for a reaction , but that the odds support those investors who stand fast to their positions over the long pull and use declines to make selective additions to their portfolios . ? ? ? Lukens Steel Co. - A prosperous new fiscal year for Lukens Steel Co. is predicted by its president , Charles Lukens Huston . Jr. , who foresees a continuing high volume of steel plate production . " While there may be some softening in demand for light-gauge steel plates . " he said " there seems to be no decrease evident in demand for heavy plates and plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business " He noted that the industry 's production capacity for heavy plates has not been increased as rapidly as that for light-weight plates , strip and sheet . Completion this year of additional facilities will materially expand the company 's specialty production capacity and increase operating efficiency , he stated . However , this is expected to put some strain on the company 's working capital , as available funds are withdrawn for capital expenditures on the firm 's centralized maintenance project and additional sodium hydride descaling facilities . The Lukens fiscal year ends in October and latest available figures show that for the nine months of fiscal 1952 ended last July 5 sales of the company totaled $51,096,682 , compared with $54,160,808 reported for the like period of 1951 , when sales equalled $80.546,418 for the entire year .

Arthur G. &; Co. - Indications are that 1953 should be another good year for Arthur G. &; Co . ( American ) , steel and oil engineering company . The company 's prospects for new business appear favorable. recently has received a number ? of inquiries for sizable petroleum refining and iron and steel projects . with additional ones expected shortly . These prospects for new operations , plus the present heavy backlog , make the 1953 earnings outlook promising . Based on present data , it is estimated that consolidated net profit fur 1952 reached a record $2,530,000 , or $5 a share , compared with $2,284,219 , or $4.51 a share . for the previous year . The high earnings indicate the company had worked off a large amount of work carried over from 1951 . While this progress brought about a considerable reduction in backlog , It was largely offset by new contract woeit added during the year . The result ta that 's present backlog is equal to about 80% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common stock outstanding , reflecting a two-for-one stock split last May and a change in classification of the stock from Class B to common , In of der to bring the stated value of capital stock more in line with the company 's investment in fixed assets , directors recently authorized an increase in the stated value of the stork ? from $84,410 to $2,025,840 . This was accomplished by a transfer of $1,941,430 t ? om earned surplus to the capital stock account This is equivalent to increasing the stated value of the 506.460 shares of common from approximately 17 cents per share to $4 a share .
