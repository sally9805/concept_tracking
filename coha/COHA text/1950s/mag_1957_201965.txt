For a moment last week at a weed-grown point of their common border , Israelis and Jordanians pursued not war but justice . At issue was the identification of two scraggy black cows that had been stolen from a Jordanian Arab last February , taken into Israel and sold . The thief had been arrested by the Jordan police . After a complaint transmitted to Israel by the U.N . Mixed Armistice Commission , Israeli police found the stolen cows in a local barn and promptly arrested two Israeli Arabs for receiving stolen property . To give them a fair trial , the property had first to be identified . <P> With a flag-draped card table serving as the bar of justice , the Israeli court was called to order on the very edge of the line of rusting iron bars that mark the border . On one side , Israeli soldiers guarded the prisoners on trial . From the other , officers of Jordan 's army approached with Mustafa Jela , the seamed and middle-aged owner of the cows . The first witness ( from the Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path of the cows to the border . The second was a character witness for Jela . " He is an upright man who does not know how to lie , " he said . " If he says the cows are his , they are his . " Then came Mustafa himself . Swearing his oath on a Koran ( printed in Israel ) , he told the court : " I know those cows as I know my children . " Could he describe them , asked the court ? Yes , said Mustafa , one had a very large udder , the other a twisted horn . The prosecutor and the judge looked at each other with a nod of assent . The truck in which the cows lowed sorrowfully was opened and the beasts clomped out-one with an extra-large udder , the other with a twisted horn . <P> " Praise be to Allah and to Israeli justice , " cried Mustafa . " Court adjourned , " snapped the Israeli judge as the cows were led across the border into Jordan .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
