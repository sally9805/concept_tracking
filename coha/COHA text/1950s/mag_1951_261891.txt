A cardinal goal of German organized labor is Mitbestimmungsrecht . Literally , it means " the right of codetermination " ; it implies union participation in corporate financing , pricing , supply and all other functions of management . ( Some observers have seen Mitbestimmungsrecht in Walter Reuther 's pronunciamentos on U.S. industry . ) <P> When the Allies , in 1947 , set up temporary trusteeships to supplant the Ruhr industrial cartels , they accepted Mitbestimmungsrecht . Labor representatives were given equal positions with management on each of 24 new company trustee boards . Later , all three of Western Germany 's big political parties supported some form of Mitbestimmungsrecht , to keep their labor support . <P> Faced with the imminent return of Ruhr industries to their owners , German union leaders began to wonder what would happen to this postwar gain . Early this January , wizened , 75-year-old Hans <P> Boeckler , the ex-goldsmith president of the 5,000,000-member German Federation of Trade Unions , decided on a showdown . He threatened Chancellor Konrad Adenauer with a Feb. 1 strike of 225,000 metal workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners agreed to join the strike . <P> Adenauer replied angrily , " It can not be said that . . . freedom to organize . . . implies the right to cripple the economy in order to force certain acts from the legislature . " Businessmen denounced Mitbestimmungsrecht and the unions ' " terroristic power . " Snapped Fritz Berg , president of the Federation of German Industry , " The back door to Socialism . " <P> Last week Adenauer , aware that the threatened strike might wreck West German and West European recovery and rearmament , called in five labor leaders and five Ruhr industrialists . <P> For three days the owners held out , then capitulated . On Thursday five jubilant union leaders and Adenauer walked out of the smoky conference room of Bonn 's Palais Schaumburg with a new agreement . Labor will have equal representation with management in both the new three-man governing committees and the eleven-man directorates of German coal and steel companies . The odd members will be chosen jointly . <P> It was labor 's biggest postwar victory in continental Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis with militant free enterprisers in his own government . The triumphant unionists , confident that the new settlement would become law , made plans to extend Mitbestimmungsrecht to all German industry . <P> Thus the Corporative Society , so heavily denounced when it was bannered by Mussolini , made its way back into the center of European life .
