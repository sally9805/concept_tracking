DE LESSEPS OF SUEZ ( 334 pp. ) - Charles Beatfy-Harper ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> A bronze , bigger-than-life statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps . builder of the Suez Canal , stood for 60 years in Port Said . Last December , as Egyptian demonstrators celebrated the withdrawal of the Franco-British invasion force , they expressed their hatred of all things European by blowing up the statue . The great builder would have been neither surprised nor resentful . Irrational violence , betrayal and humiliation dogged him all his long life without dampening his boundless optimism or shaking his firm belief in the essential goodness of man and the basic harmony of nations . <P> Ferdinand de Lesseps was the ideal 19th century man , a living embodiment of the " poetry of capitalism . " His cheerful cry . " Open the world to the people ! ' ' was echoed by the industrialists and investors of his time . The Suez Canal was to be only a beginning : De Lesseps dreamed of making an inland sea in the Sahara Desert , and of uniting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercontinental railway . <P> Overweight Heir . The idea for the Suez Canal fired De Lesseps ' imagination when he was 27 years old . Born into a French diplomatic family in 1805 , De Lesseps had arrived in Alexandria as a consular official , and read a memoir on the Suez project written by one of Napoleon 's aides during the occupation of Egypt 34 years before . He became a close friend of Said , the overweight heir to the Egyptian throne , by giving him free access to the consulate kitchen while the boy 's militant father was trying to starve him into a semblance of manly vigor . Sixteen years were to pass before Said and De Lesseps met again . Then , pudgy Said was the ruler of Egypt and Ferdinand had resigned from the consular service . Said Pasha invited De Lesseps to come to Egypt , was quickly won over to the canal project . <P> The canal cost 453 million francs to build . More than a hundred million cubic feet of earth were moved in ten years .

De Lesseps ' real roadblocks lay not in the sand and rock of the Sinai desert but in the chancellories and salons of Europe . In France envious rivals-including the Saint-Simonian Socialists-tried to take the canal away from De Lesseps . In London successive British governments first derided the idea , then worked to block construction of the canal , then bought shares in it , and finally occupied Egypt to secure military control of the new route to India . De Lesseps spent as much time rushing about Europe to put out fires as he did in digging . But the canal was built , England placated , and in 1869 the waters of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea were joined directly for the first time-more than 3,000 years after the earliest known attempt , using the Nile as a connecting link , was supposedly made by the legendary Pharaoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
