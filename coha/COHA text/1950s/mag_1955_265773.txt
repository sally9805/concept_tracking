" Ecuador , " says President Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra , " is a very difficult country to govern . " He should know ; he is currently involved in his third try at it . The big difficulty in both of his previous terms was the armed forces . Velasco twice tangled with top commanders , who accused him of unconstitutional conduct , and twice got chucked out of his job . Last week it was Velasco v. the military again . <P> The crisis started a month ago , when Velasco 's Minister of Economy Jaime Nebot made a slighting reference to a high army officer . Incensed at this challenge to military prestige , other officers demanded that the President fire Nebot . Velasco balked , so the armed forces persuaded Defense Minister Reinaldo Varea Dnoso , himself a lieutenant colonel , to resign in protest . Then , one night last week , the commanders redoubled their pressure , insisting that Velasco not only oust Nebot but restore Varea Dnoso . <P> Velasco , alarmed , climbed into his private car at 10p.m. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Driving all night on the perilous , 300-mile road that swings down through the Andes from the capital at Quito , he reached the Pacific seaport of Guayaquil . Seven top officers ordered troops to occupy Quito communications centers , then flew off after him . But the President 's lead gave him time enough to strike a deal with the Guayaquil military command . By dumping Nebot , he persuaded the Guayaquil garrison to arrest the pursuing officers for " promoting disorder , " when they stepped from their plane . ( Four were soon released . ) Velasco put the mayor of the loyal city of Guayaquil into the Defense Ministry in place of Varea Dnoso . At week 's end the winner and still President of Ecuador was Jos Mara Velasco Ibarra.
