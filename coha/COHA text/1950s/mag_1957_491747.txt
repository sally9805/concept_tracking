4 Possibly one of the reasons Alan Walbridge Ladd has escaped middle-age spread ? though the twin curses of a double chin and retreating hair arc upon him  --  is that he rarely sits down . At forty-three he is a PM-pound bundle of nervous sinews . He will do almost anything to keep busy  --  from emptying ash trays and taking the cook 's telephone calls to diving into a pool lo escape conversation . He will finger his favorite dagger  --  a finely etched , gold-inlaid job supposed to have been the personal weapon of Hermann Goering  --  or turn on blasting hi-fi music . In a Palm Springs hardware store of which he is a partner , he will meticulously examine accounts and wait on customers . He is forever speculating about new deals  --  for himself or some of his old friends  --  or setting about personally to renovate what he calls his " $450 , - 000 bastard Hawaiian-Modern-French Provincial " home in Holmby Hills . Ladd likes a mixture of decorating styles .

" ? It is this unending expenditure of energy which is probably the most significant factor in Ladd 's rise as a screen hero . Few critics think of him as an actor  --  though he has done competent jobs in such pictures as Scott Fitzgerald 's The Great Gatsby . The gamut of Ladd 's performances runs from his excellent portrayal of a wandering gun fighter in Shane to a bumbling characterization of a knight errant in The Black Knight . In both he rode horses ; one was done in blue jeans and the other in iron pants . The first was a movie milestone , the second a medieval mishmash , but both , significantly , made large amounts of money . . ! Arum y 9 , 19.17 67 1 .

He has a $200,000 , sixty-acre ranch in Hidden Valley , an exclusive section forty-five miles northwest of Hollywood . Item he raises between 3500 and 500 ) chickens , an enterprise on which he breaks even . " I defy anyone to say I 'm not in business there , " says Ladd . In addition he has eleven horses  --  he used to have twenty-seven  --  ten golden retrievers , five dachshunds and assorted other critters . At one time he tried to raise six massive black Angus cattle , but the herd , as heavy as a couple of tractors , used to spend hours leaning up against a board fence , crushing it to the ground . " It made me mad , " says Ladd and , on the foreman 's assurance that the five cows simply were bloated , not pregnant , he sold the lot . A few weeks later each cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bought three dozen assorted pigs and was surprised when the swine commenced to vanish . This remained a mystery until he came upon the head and entrails of a 500-pound sow ; some thief had been quietly slaughtering them . The discovery annoyed Ladd and he sold the whole bunch . At one time he reveled in a balanced zoo : seventeen boxer dogs , seventeen cats , seventeen horses and seventeen rabbits . " Even the rabbits would n't rabbit when I caged them together , " says Ladd . It made him mad and he got rid of all of them . More recently , Ladd 's self-confidence has been bolstered somewhat by his success with turkeys . " We raised forty out of forty last year , " he says proudly . " But we do n't sell them ; we give them away . " Only one entry in the ranch ledger shows a real cash profit . Out of the horses Ladd raised , one proved to be a huge  --  seventeen hands , Iwo-inches  --  black stallion named Alsulad . Ladd swears he learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever the cause , Alsulad earned back $14,000 in racing before he went lame . " This supported three or four others of the string , " says Ladd . He has two foals by Alsulad , one of which he feels may prove a future winner . The swank $225,000 hardware store has been a problem . Open for about a year , it is breaking a little better than even . In real estate the Ladds possess a valuable business site in the exclusive town of Rancho Santa Fe near San Diego , a lot on Lake Sherwood near his ranch , a " house for relaxing " in Palm Springs , and 110 acres of strategically placed real estate in the same area , covered with date palms and tangerine trees . Ladd had two plans for the property : either subdivision or the raising of rare eymbidiums . " My movie production manager . George Bertholon , is an expert on orchids and there 's no use wasting him , is there ? " he asks . Many movie stars have entered the oil business , chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladd is no exception . This venture has been good to him . He has a percentage in oil fields scattered through California , Oklahoma and Texas ; and on a total investment of less than 5150,000 , he can export to get back a 50 per cent return each year for possibly tacitly years , " I 'm preparing for the future , " says Ladd gloomily . " I 'm working myself to death so that the guy Sue marries afterward wo n't be in financial want . " " Alan 11411S a great sense of insecurity , " says Sue , " Every picture , he thinks , will be his last . l-k can iseser believe he is where he is or understand how he got there . But l : he has a great strength and tenderness on the screen  --  women want to take care of him . " This is probably a cry good estimate , by a woman a ho has spent nearly twenty years tr mg to be object ' ' , c about him . One of the supreme secrets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to succumb to or one they want to succor . With picture audiences supposed to be predominantly female , hissing either type of appeal mill do : hazing both , as Ladd seems to , is better yet . Sue knows that in Ladd 's portmanteau of neuroses he has a large complex about his , height and coloring . He was one of tho first to break through the taboo agsinst small , blond leading men , and is both proud and apprehensise about it . But his fise-foot-sesen height still bothers him . It stems from his fruitless days of job seeking , when he sometimes had to stand on a bos , as he still does , to buss a tall actress or play a scene with actors like six-foot-four Jack Carson  --  an agonizing affair that once lost him an M-G-M contract . It persists at parties .... hen some tall , dark friend is likely to holler , " Sit down , Alan : you look as if you 're standing in a hole ! " Once Ladd was willing to fight when anyone said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protects him from most of the world . At a critical point in their married career a few years ago , Ladd got a crush on a pen hide actress . To her friends , Sue gritted , " I 'd like to drown her in a teaspoon of water , " but in the same breath she admitted , " Alan feels abused , and he should  --  I have n't been giving him the attention he needs . " She tries to keep bad reviews and articles assay from him by scissoring them out of the papers . But Ladd got hold of a couple of mordant comments by Bosley Crowther , critic for The New York Times . and smoldered for years until Crowther came to Hollywood . Ladd invited him to dinner . After coffee , he took him into the library and showed him the offending sentiments . " You say I 'm my usual grim , poker-faced self , " Ladd said grimly . " That 's the role in the picture . What was I supposed to do , come in giggling and scratching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next review of a Ladd picture contained the mixture as before , Lately Ladd has acquired a wry humor about such comments . " The terrible part about cracks like that , " he says , " is that they 're right . " Like some other Hollywood stars , Ladd shudders visibly at the idea of " live " television . He prefers to have his acting edited by film cutters . In spite of this , his appeal is deemed strong enough for a major sponsor to make him a standing offer of a two-a-year , half-hour filmed show  --  at $50,000 apiece . Ladd 's long film career commenced with bit pans in 1933 . He estimates that he has appeared in " about 150 " pictures . but this includes appearances in mob scenes , educational films and even advertising-convention rouscrs . Somewhere in the welter of his career , the little ! stuccoed , blond leading man has made it his business to find out what his audiences want and give it to them . Success escaped him for eight awful years . It came only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunches  --  and met Sue Carol . Sue , a doll-faced , dark-haired Chicago girl who had come West on her own in 1929 , was hardly more than twenty-one when she starred in it series of depression movies , the best called Soft Cushions . Ten years later she turned agent , organizing her own firm , Within the first couple of months she was asked to listen to a radio show . She heard only two characters  --  an old mail and a very young one  --  that she thought might lit into her folio , She invited them both to drop in ; a single youth appeared , " Where 's the old man ? " asked Sue . " I 'm both guys , " said Ladd solemnly . As far as she was concerned , it was love at first sight . " He was the cutest boy ever , " Sue says . " Very shy , sun-bleached hair , a wonderful smile , trenchcoat and muscles . He was for mc . " She got him a job playing the part of a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two scenes , but they happened to be the first and last scenes taken  --  so Ladd was carried for sixteen weeks . On the strength of this , Sue got her future husband his second job in a propaganda film . The Beast of Berlin , This cost $20,000 , was shot in five days , and made $5,000,000 in release . The confusion was so great that connoisseurs of Ladd films find their idol twice : once being killed as a young anti-Nazi and , later , resurrected , digging a grave for someone else . The bit roles that followed were shrewdly judged by Sue . If they were short , she charged $750 a week ; if long , she charged $150 , " Our idea was to get lots of film to show producers , " she says , Shc let her other clients go and she and Ladd lived on his earnings . At last Ladd got a chance to do Li scene with some Paramount contractees in the famous " glass cage " ? an enclosed , brightly lighted booth in which actors did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making caustic comments . Ladd worked with quaking knees , but his voice  --  a soothing growl  --  intrigued his critics . He was offered a contract at $300 a week . He rushed across the street to the RKO studios to meet Sue for lunch . She hurried up to him : RKO had offered him a $750 job in a picture . They took the Paramount offer . Ladd got his first big part as the gunman Raven  --  thus setting off a trend in baby-faced criminals . His popularity soared , but he got no more than $300 a week for starring in a series of pictures that were immense grossers : The Glass Key , Lucky Jordan , and China , Sue , who had persuaded him to dye his hair black for his first part , also got him a salary boost . By 1942 , when he enlisted in the Army Air Force , Ladd was getting 5750 a week . During World War II Ladd managed to work up to a corporal . He was offered a commission a couple of times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have influenced the offers . He underwent hazing by people who wanted to meet him and then said , " Oh , 1 thought you were taller ! " When he was taken off the garbage detail by an officious officer fan of his , he begged to go back . " I 'm happy with garbage , " he explained , A few Army friends asked him for dates with Hollywood stars , and Ladd explained , " I 'm a married man myself . " He had wed Sue just after finishing This Gun for Hire . It was the second marriage for Ladd , third for Sue . Ladd had married a childhood sweetheart in 1936 , but they broke up in less than two years ; Sue had married actor Nick Stuart in 1930 and was divorced five years later . Shc married a Chicago businessman , Howard Wilson , in 1936 , and was divorced again after two years . The war ended for Ladd in November , 1943 . Just before he was due to take part in the invasion of Bougainville in the Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among other things , " says Sue , " he had double hernias . " Ladd returned to Hollywood and his Paramount career . Unlike many movie stars , his fan prestige seemed not to have suffered by his absence . He made such films as And Now Tomorrow , Salty O'Rourke and Two Years Before the Mast ; and his salary rose to $3500 a week . " Most of my pictures got to be the same , " Ladd says disconsolately . He escaped from gangster portrayals into Westerns only to have a six-shooter pushed into his hand again in Whispering Smith . He was scheduled for a second-rate soldierof-fortune show called Saigon and balked unless he could do Gatsby . He got his wish , but his bosses showed him how much business the former had done . " You just keep pulling the triggers , " they said jovially , " and we 'll keep pulling in the money . " This cynicism about his talents has given Ladd a simple philosophy . " Maybe I ca n't act , " he says defiantly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life and 1 knOw what 's good for me . I ca n't play black or gray ; I ca n't be a villain or anything too close to it . I have to play white . " His friends  --  among them such excellent actors as Van Heflin , Lloyd Nolan and Edmund O'Brien  --  think more of him than that , " By the curious chemistry of film , " says O'Brien , " Alan has a great following , but it has nothing to do with acting . So you are surprised to find , when you play opposite him , that he is a very good actor just the same . " Ladd himself is a little doubtful about this . So is Sue , his constant counselor on roles . It was she who dissuaded him from taking the unsympathetic role played by the late James Dean in Giant , a meaty portrayal that most actors would have welcomed . Being a devotee of the director , George Stevens , who had given him his favorite part in Shane , Ladd was in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity depended upon his playing the clean-cut , wholesome hero who is able to handle any emergency . Ladd accordingly took just such a role in Santiago , an outstandingly mediocre adventure tale that further lowered his critical stature and enlarged his bank account . Sue occasionally complains that " people like to make me the heavy with Alan . " She denies that she makes his decisions for him and Ladd backs her up . " We have quite a few beefs , " he says tersely . Sue privately concedes that her and Alan 's theme is a line from a song ; You Always Were a Headache , but You Never Were a Bore , " I contribute my judgment , " she says , " and he goes ahead and does what he ( Continued on Page 70 ) 70 tConthoasi twin 1*. r M11 wants anyway . To give you nit idea , he 's always inventiog household gimmicks in his head . I pooh-pooh them and a little later som else puts them on the market , 1 's e had ' I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like ' howd ! .. ' " One of the family beefs came during Ladd 's first visit to Imgland , where he has matte three pictures . Ile rarely complains about money matters , though he insists on getting the change from a dollar if the children bin a paper or gimcrack . Thus it came as a shock to Sue when he became infuriated about her purchase of a magnificent Georgian silver tea set . " Send it back ! " he rasped in his best movie tones . Sue did  --  hack to the United States . And she ordered two other sets for their girls . The family operates with four children . Two are by the earlier marriages of Sue and Ladd : Carol tee , Sue 's twenty-fouryear-old daughter , and nineteen-year-old Alan , Junior . The tw o others arc thirteenyear-old Alarm and nine-year-old David Alan . The latter endeared himself recently to his tax-conscious father when . having been presented with a quarter , he remarked gravely : " Well , this is really only ten cents after the Government gets its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success that Ladd enjoys results from his deliberate combining of his personality with roles that are in the Great American Image . The box-office effect has been especially notable abroad , where the old-fashioned form of democracy is widely believed in . Ladd makes the impact more direct by the way he acts . " I 've got to lei the audience know what I 'm thinking , " he says . " I have to get ninety per cent of my work down to reflexes . " If he must open a door in a scene , Ladd may spend hours opening a similar oneat home . If he has to smile at a critical moment , he will grimace a hundred times into a mirror . He trained his voice to its pleasant , low level by reading from the Basle day after day , stumbling through the thickets of unfamiliar pronunciation until his voice failed . One day his voice descended to its present caliber and main-tamed its strength . " I think it 's the tonsils , " Ladd says thoughtfully . " David . my kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his removed . Now I 'm scared of any sore throat , " Ills single-mindedness --  " I just like to think about one thing at a lime , " he insists  --  conies from an experience in his past . Ladd bad a diving teacher in North Hollywood High School who was a stickler for preparation . When Ladd was a senior , the instructor used to make hint get out on the board and bounce on it hundred , : of times simply for balance , " I never hit the tank for weeks , " says Ladd . " Bounce , bounce . bounce ; shower and go home . My feet used to bleed from that coconut matting . Then I had to make the approach and never dive , but finally he let me go in , and l discovered that all l had to worry about was what to do when I got Lip in the air . That 's how I like to act . " Ladd was horn in Hot Springs , Arkansas , on September 3,1913 . His father was an English public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember anything about him , and my mother never spoke of him , " he says . " When I was in England I started to look up the name , but I got cold feet . " His mother took him to Denver , where she met and married James Beavers , a house painter . In the 1921-22 depression the family moved west in a model T Ford , taking four months to reach California . En route , Beavers painted houses to keepthem in food and Ladd 's mother look jobs washing and cooking , The paintbrushes were finally sold to buy the last few gallons of gas . They arrived in a Pasadena tent and shack town without tires , a kerosene lamp as a headlight , " Those were the rough days , " says Ladd ruefully . " I used to hike six miles to school from the combination garage-house we built . We got potato soup and cheap mutton week after week . I still turn green when Sue serves lamb , " His stepfather got a job painting for movie studios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive . " Rut he was scared even to be a foreman , " he says . Nevertheless Beavers labored twenty-four to forty-eight hours at a stretch to bring in enough money to support his family . When Ladd was ten , they moved out to North Hollywood to a rented cottage in the midst of vast areas of grapevines , citrus fruits and peaches . " We never really had a place of our own , " says Ladd . " I kept arguing with my stepfather about buying acreage , when he was getting sixty dollars a week , but he never could see it . " Ladd 's stepfather died of a heart attack in 1936 , three years after Alan graduated from high school . The following year , in a fit of depression , his mother committed suicide . Something of iron from this period must have stiffened Ladd . He has an inflexible kind of discipline which he is able to impose on himself at any time . " When we used to go from agent to agent and studio to studio looking for jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in the car , reading or doing puzzles . He carried a whole wardrobe in the rumble seat , from sports jacket to tuxedo , just to be ready to act in any emergency . " Not many people did Ladd a favor in his early days ; those who did he remembers with a loyalty that outweighs allother considerations . He tries to get old hams directing jobs because they befriended him . He gave a 5700 movie camera to one simply because the fellow admired it ; he has handed out several complete wardrobes to out-of-work techni- cians and publicity men . Ladd has a compulsion to make up for his own hardships as a youngster . At the age of eleven he was offered his first job  --  as a kid extra in Hollywood at a buck a day . He ran away from it , hiding in an open grave in a nearby cemetery . The next offer he accepted : his work consisted of mopping out a candy store at five o'clock every morning . " The proprietor used to come in and count the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for it . " In the summer he got a job cutting open apricots and later smoking them in sulphur dioxide , and " to this day I hate them . " He and a chum were fired for sleeping on a pile of drying fruit . " We kept warm overnight from the heat , but we got canned for mashing the apricots , " says Ladd . He went to work for one of the first supermarkets , the pioneer Piggly Wiggly stores . " Pulling the wilted leaves off the lettuce , polishing the apples  --  there is n't a trick I do n't know , " says Ladd . " I only stole one thing in my life and that was an avocado on this job . I did n't know what they were , so I picked one up , took it into the men 's room and bit into it . It was awful  --  and t was stuck with the seed . Ever try to hide a hot avocado seed ? " Meanwhile Ladd was having trouble in school . " 1 guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 had a lousy temper and the first day some kid pushed my head into the fountain . started to punch him and found out that he was twins , but I licked them both . " His size inspired is loathed nickname , " Tiny " Ladd . His marks wavered near Frbrnary 9 , I967 the bottom until he suddenly found out about sports . In the next few years he became a hero to the school . He spent four years in varsity football , held the 1931 San Fernando Valley shot-put record , and was the filly-yard k  --  e-style interscholastic swimming champion for years  --  as well as being one of the star divers of the area for nearly a des:ode . The name " Tiny " became an accolade . As his grades started to climb  --  he ended a B student  --  he became head of the World Friendship Club , the Hi Y , captain of swimming , track and football , and president of the student body . He started to like clothes and became the nattiest dresser for miles around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newest fads : loud neckties , belts , crazy socks . He commenced to take an interest in girls , " I did all right , " says Ladd . " I borrowed a car and went to dances , and one year I was state champion in the fox trot and waltz . " An English teacher worked on him to enter dramatics and finally prevailed . Ladd took the part of Ko-Ko in The Mikado and planned to make his entrance swinging in from the rafters on a rope . The rope broke at the premiere , however , and Ladd landed on his head . Fortunately , he was not injured , and he reveled in the thunder of applause and laughter . Meanwhile , his odd jobs continued . One was pumping gas , another was hawking papers at a road junction . He sold some of the first potato chips manufactured in the West , pedaling furiously from house to house on his bike to insure that the brown paper bagfuls arrived hot . His gymnastic appearance as Ko-Ko in the school play had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio was trying to form a stock company , and Ladd qualified for the tryouts . He spoke his lines so poorly , however , that he was encouraged to seek some other career , Together with another young hopeful named Tyrone Power , he passed unregretfully out into the workaday world , Ladd went to work for eighteen dollars a week on a local paper , the Sun-Record . As printer 's devil , columnist , advertising manager , copy boy and sports editor he rose to thirty-five dollars a week in two years . Leaving the paper , he started Tiny 's , a hot-dog stand . This enjoyed a modest success , enabling Ladd , in three years , to pay for his parents ' $6000 house and to pocket about $1000 a year extra . Since Tiny 's occupied only part of his time , he took on a succession of daytime jobs . One of these was as a salesman for National Cash Register , for which he got forty-five dollars a week  --  until he was fired because he insisted on wearing a loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was reporting the radio news for an oil company at seventy-five dollars a week . But he was looked upon as a spiffy part-time movie extra rather that a radio career man . Finally his sponsor asked him stiffly , " Movies or radio , Ladd ? " With the instinct of a salmon swimming upstream , Ladd chose his nonexistent movie work and his still-functioning hot-dog stand . Not long after this , a studio worker who owed him a sizable tab for food and drink offered him a job as u " grip " ? at that time the trade name for a studio handy man . Ladd went to work for Warner Brothers . The lirst day he made every possible mistake and was promptly fired . A friend interceded for him with the boss . The latter demanded why Ladd should be rehired . " Well , he used to be one of the best high divers around , " said Ladd 's friend weakly , " 0 , K , , " rasped the boss , around his cigar .

Another time , he dropped a plank through a piano . Later , being a swimmer , he was sent under water to steer a miniature frigate through a tank while an imperturbable marksman shot bits off the model with a high-powered rifle . Then one day Ladd looked down from his perch and saw an actor friend reading a paper . The friend did nothing else for ten days . Ladd could not help asking him what he was doing there . His friend replied that he got fifty dollars a day for waiting around to do his part . That decided Ladd : he went home , sold his hot-dog stand for $1500 and entered a school of dramatic training . The night of his graduation premiere at the school he was offered a job with a news service at $300 a month , starting immediately . But Ladd chose to stick 71 with the intangible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rough . His chief income was from making transcription records for radio at fifty cents a shot . He tried to keep a car and a watch to pawn for $150 and $7.50 respectively . He finally settled down to doing between fifteen and twenty shows a week on a Los Angeles station  --  a two-year workout which broadened his experience if not his acting knowledge . He hocked his car to rent a tuxedo for the Goldwyn Follies , in which he did a comedy bit . He got the lead in a commercial film for an insurance company , playing a man who ages from eighteen to eighty . Bette Davis chose him to play opposite her in a couple of radio programs , and he snared two scenes in a film called Captain Caution . With Sue 's steady pushing , he was slowly getting to be well known by the directors and producers when the double chance at RKO and Paramount suddenly came his way  --  his career was air-borne . These days Ladd keeps himself as busy as ever . He is designing a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . He is starting a series of TV shows called Box Thirteen , adapted from one of his old radio shows . Getting ready for more of what he sardonically calls his " good-Ladd , bad-Indian " pictures , he maintains a correspondence  --  via secretaries  --  with about 600 faithful fans here and abroad , some dating back to 1936 . He is also occupied with nursing along $400,000 worth of life insurance and an annuity , which will pay him a tax-free $250,000 when it falls due in 1964 . He had what he terms " a short beef " with Sue recently when she dropped an additional $100,000 insurance policy without his knowledge . " Never do that , " Ladd told her . " You never can tell when we might need it . " .
