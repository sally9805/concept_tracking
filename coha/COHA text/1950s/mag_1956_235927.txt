Who are the most likely candidates for the 1956 Democratic vice-presidential nomination ? <P> The one man who could have the nomination almost for the asking would probably not accept it ; Texas ' Lyndon Johnson considers his place as Senate Democratic leader more important than the Vice President 's chair , sees little reason for compromising his 1960 presidential chances by appearing on what he suspects will be a losing 1956 ticket against Eisenhower . Moreover , although he has recovered from his own heart attack a year ago . Johnson 1 ) knows that his candidacy would weaken the Democrats ' health issue against the President , and 2 ) would like another four years to build up his own strength for campaigning . <P> In reverse , one man who might now settle for second place on the ticket could probably not get it under any circumstances ; Tennessee 's Estes Kefauver has made too many enemies along the campaign trail , has few delegates that he could use in a trade for the No. 2 spot . <P> With Johnson and Kefauver eliminated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in today 's unofficial huddles are : <P> Massachusetts ' John Fitzgerald Kennedy . Trademarked by his boyishly unruly shock of brown hair , slim Jack Kennedy , 39 , has looks , brains , personality , an attractive wife ( who is expecting her first baby in October ) . He has a fine World War II record as a PT-boat skipper in the Pacific , a noteworthy vote-getting ability in a pivotal state ( he defeated Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . by 70,700 votes in 1952 ) , reputation as an able , independent-thinking , middle-of-the-road member of both House ( 1946-52 ) and Senate . If the Democrats are to make their big pitch to farmers , Kennedy 's vote this year against rigid , 90%-of-parity farm supports might work against giving him a place on the ticket . Far more controversial is the fact that Kennedy is a prominent Roman Catholic and-despite persuasive statistical arguments that <P> Catholicism is no longer a national political liability ( see box ) - many Southern and Midwestern Democratic politicians gulp hard when his name is mentioned . Geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York 's Harriman. but he stands high on the Stevenson list . <P> Minnesota 's Hubert Horatio Humphrey . He has patched together his state 's Democratic-Farmer-Labor organization after its stunning primary defeat by Estes Kefauver , is now edging back toward the center of the national stage . St. Paul 's Representative Eugene McCarthy ( no kin to Joe ) has begun organizing a **27;15047;TOOLONG movement . Humphrey , an effective orator , is the champion of high , rigid farm supports . Although he has risen in the estimate of his Southern Senate colleagues ( Georgia 's Walter George offered to campaign for him in 1954 ) , other Southerners recall vividly-and bitterly-his strident civil-rights performance at the 1948 convention . Humphrey 's charter membership in Americans for Democratic Action is today something less than a national political asset . Nonetheless , longtime Stevensonian Humphrey , 45 , ranks high in the Stevenson camp . <P> <P> And Harriman eyes him wistfully as just the partner for a continent-spanning , true-blue liberal Harriman ticket .               @ @ @ @ @ @
