txt Bostonians must act to raise nursery teaching salariy if they want to keep attracting girls to the profession , according to Dr. Abigail Adams Eliot , director of the Nursery Training School in Boston . " At present more than half of the nursery school teachers around Boston do n't earn enough money to live on , " continued this nationally known pioneer and leader in nursery school education at an interview today . $1,800 Average Presenting results of a just-completed Nursery Training School poll of 62 nursery schools and kindergartens around Boston ( not public schools ) Dr. Eliot said : " Nowhere in the United States do nursery teachers receive wages lower than they do in the Boston area . Their average  --  not minimum or beginning ? wage is $1,800 a year here . " Even the directors of nursery schools do not receive adequate pay , " she continued . " Their yearly wages range from a top of $3,500 to a bottom of $700 . " This yearly Income is substantially less than public-school salaries . The recent bill passed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers ' salaries from $1,800 to $2,100 ( in communities under $2,500,000 valuation ) and from $2,100 to $2,300 in larger communities . But the salaries in nursery schools have no rules governing them  --  and no minimums . There are two reasons the low salaries around Boston have existed as long as this , according to Dr. Eliot : 1 . Boston is oversupplied with young women who like living here and are willing to work at a low salary to enjoy the benefits of the metropolitan area for a few years . 2 . Many of the young teachers have husbands studying in Boston area colleges and want to work near them . Situation Criticized " But , " continued Dr. Eliot , " this temporary oversupply certainly does not justify a below-living wage . It is not right that so many of these girls should have to depend on friends and family for support . " What can be done to raise their salaries ? First , Boston area parents must become aware , according to this nursery-training leader , that most of their preschool children are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than money "  --  but who need the money . Then , with parents ' support , schools should agree on a minimum wage . The nine schools run by the Associated Day Care Services , a Red Feather Agency , already have begun setting standards for member schools , Dr. Eliot pointed out . " L hope the recent law requiring teachers to be certified also will affect nursery schools , " she continued . " That law combined with recent Health Department legislation should help unify our nursery school standards . " But such action must come soon , according to Dr. Eliot , if we are to offset the tendency , described in the National Conference on Teacher Education , for more teachers to leave the profession this year than in any year since World War IL
