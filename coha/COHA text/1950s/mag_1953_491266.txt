31 The Scott of the Purply Reefs . THE motorship Christophe had disappeared without a trace , on a routine voyage from Home Island to Tampa , via the Isle of Palms . Now , two years later , Henri and Joseph Christophe were determined to solve the mystery . Henri and Joseph  --  last of the Christophe men  --  had been pearl fishing in the Pacific at the time of the disaster . Their brother , Malcolm , had been captain of the lost ship . Now they had the responsibility of supporting the Christophe family ? twenty-nine impoverished relatives . The Christophe was insured , but no insurance could be collected until proof of the ship 's fate was found . Henri and Joseph built a launch and set out to learn about the Christophe 's last voyage . They were told that the Christophe had reached the Isle of Palms two days late . But this was explained . Captain Malcolm had delayed at the Purple Reefs to search for survivors of the Webber , a steamer wrecked there the week before . Henri and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Webber and the lose of the Christophe . The live Herera brothera  --  lifelong enemies of the Christophes  --  had been in the steamer 's crew . And Black Tobias , whoseonly son was lost with the ship , insisted that some great evil had boarded the Christophe at the Reefs . He had seen giant footsteps there , in the sand . The brothers sailed out to search the Purple Reefs . A week later Black Tobias joined them . Tobias had discovered that Jacques and Christ inn , two sponge fishermen who had disappeared , had gone to the Reefs at the same time as the Christophe . He was certain that whatever evil had overtaken the Christophe had destroyed the fishermen . Henri suddenly had an explanation for the giant steps Tobias had seen . He knelt and drew a pattern of a footprint in the sand . " Is that your giant 's step ? " he asked . Tobias nodded . " That is the track of a suit diver , " Henri said . " His track was here four months after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested him two years ago interests him still . " 1 AS they baled the dried fans and plumes in the flickering light of the fire , Tobias asked , " You think I he hope of treasure was in the loss of . Jacques t LI R 1T1 : ' 11 11 11 t ' E OM BERG Elland Christian  --  and of the Christophe that took my son ? " - Beginning the packing of leopard-spotted , purple-lipped cowries , Henri said , " We know that Jacques and Christian came here , and did not come home again . We know the Christophe touched here , and went on a little way , and did not come home again . Being West Indians , we know that the years and the generations pass and the great treasures are not found . We know how unlikely is even a hint of treasure . Yet the things that we know happened with the Christophe are not merely unlikely but seemingly impossible . " Suppose that Jacques and Christian , coming here to seek treasure , did find treasure or strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacques and Christian of what they had found or seemed about to find ? Suppose that others learned ? and believed ' ? There at least would be reason for greed to wish that Jacques and Christian and those of the Christophe were not Men have killed for greed . " Pushing down the starched , purple lace layers of the fans , . Joseph regarded Henri doubtfully . " What others , brother ? " ( Lontimied on Page 19 ) THE SVIVIHItY P:11.:N1 Pt let THE SECRET OF THE PURPLE REEFS ( Comtism ... 4 him , Pase 31 ) " We do not know . But thanks to Tobias , we do know more than we did . We know that it was here that Jacques end Christian came to meet the unknown evil . We must try to know what , it was ! We know that a suit diver had secret interest here . We must try to know what interested him ! " He smiled at Joseph . " I know that the Hereras were startled when Joseph spoke of the lost sponge fishers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if leas to make them kill . But for n moment they were startled and considered killing . " The Hereras were in jail in the RepublicereeverJacques and Christian or our brother and the Christophe reached here , Henri . " The Hereras are not easily startled  --  and they were startled , " Henri said stubbornly . " It is the suit diver that most interests me , " Joseph said thoughtfully . " It could be that something that Jacques and Christian found and the thing for which he seeks are linked . " " Were a suit needed in regard to any find of Jacq ues and Christian 's , Jacques and Christian must have found indication only , " Henri said . " Jacques and Christian had no suit . Thus , if they found anything , they must have found trace of some valued thing rather than the thing itself  --  perhaps , as with the finders of the golden bars , an indication that said , ' Somewhere still lies a ship from which I came . ' " " And we must seek without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great coral beds where it seems likeliest the galleons lie  --  if they lie  --  call for no suit , " Henri said , continuing his reasoning . " Thus , why a diver feeling a suit needed for tracing anything learned by Jacques and Chris-tian ? " Tobias spoke from where he knelt at the pile of sea urchins ' skeletons , " The hurricane here was of great violence . That which wan found by Jacques and Christian could perchance have said , ' Here a ship was flung up  --  and carried over . ' " " That could be . I wish we had our suits from the Pacific  --  whose sale paid our passage home , " Henri said . " Meantime , we are learning those spots where there is nothing that could interest anyone save the good doctor at the museum . We are also piling up such good sea things for him that one regrets wasting a day of the calm weather .... Joseph , should Tobias be willing , why do not you and Tobias continue the collecting and the search while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Channel , the Straits and the Gulf will all be like a duck pond . The only long jumps are from here to the Isle of Palms and From the Cape to Florida , and neither will hurt One man in a launch is always danger , for little disasters for two are great disasters for one , " Joseph said hesitatingly . " Yet Tobias and I could lay up many things for the good doctor . " " I will not fall overboard with the engines running . Neither will I break my leg nor develop the malaria , " Henri said , grinning . " Let us do it ! I can deliver Madame Combs ' messages to her husband , M'sieur Ashby , and attend to several matters in the Republic , then go to Jewfish Bay and check if M'sieur Webber has returned . Thence 1 may be able to send on the mails to Tampa while I go to Miami to do our business there . And still I could he hack in Jew-fish Bay when you and Tobias reached it with a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tow the catboat into Tampa , and we would be very rich ! At least rich enough to be utterly certain of paying poor M'sieur Latour . Tobias ' share would , of course , belong to Tobins . " Tobins , looking up from the delicate scraping of spines from the exquisite skeletons of the sea urchins , shook his head . " 1 am comforted to aid , for the aiding lends perhaps to knowledge of my son . But I want no share . Money is good when one may say , ' It will get this or this for one loved ! ' But it becomes only very sad when the one loved is no longer there . Let the money go to M'sieur Latour and to Domrerny ! I have all I need , M'sieur Henri and M'sieur Joseph , and we will speak of it no more ! " The hrothers looked at him and respected his decision . " But I still do not like you running the way alone , Henri , " Joseph said . They argued for an hour before Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Sea Lily stacked with haled specimens , Henri swung out from the reefs . He was pleasantly sleepy and rather pleased with himself when he finally put the Sea Lily into Ashby 's hidden creek ; only to find the shack shuttered and both shack and mangrove hanks silent to his hail . Crossing the dock , he went into the mangroves to see if Ashby had run for cover , followed a little path through the dense walls of green , and came out on an even more secret arm of the creek . Mangroves met completely over the water and another small wharf , but there were signs that a rather large launch was normally kept and serviced there . At one end of the dock was a weathered storage shed , and looking into its interior darkness through crack in the planks , Henri caught but was unable to identify a rich gleam of copper . Ten minutes of calling having produced no result , he wrote down Mo Crienble messages . Then , thinking of the little boys as they hnd stood holding Ashby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame your wife loved you very greatly , While we said naught of the matter , it is my thought I het she would also love the little ones . for your sake and theirs . Your friend , Henri Christophe. " slipped the note under the door of the main shack . Consulting the old man who had originally told them of Ashby 's hideout , he learned that the ancient surmised that . Ashby hod persuaded some native woman on one of the creeks to take temporary charge of the little boys and had gone away in his launch . Ashby had done this before . The old man would have liked to own the launch  --  a work boat , but one of the finest and most seaworthy in the Caribbean . Leaving the old man . Henry considered the Fact that Ashby owned a fast and seaworthy launch , that Ashby had shown anxiety at the thought of Henri and Joseph working the reefs , and wondered where Ashby now was . Had Ashby 's fear been for Henri and Joseph , as his words had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had driven him In t he swamps ? Was it t hat Ashby knew what had befallen the Christophe and that the knowing was a very dreadful thing ? Fearing that he simply wasted fuel , Henri turned the Sea Lily for 1 he little town where the Hereras had made their landfall from the wrecked Webber . The alcalde , the small , fat mayor . woke to apoplectic wrath when asked about the Flereras ' sojourn in his town . For the town had no jail . And when the Hereras had been arrested for drunken riot they had been placed in the city hall , which they wrecked before smashing their way out to further terrorize the people . Coinciding , as the Hereras visitation had , with a stalling of the storm 's forward march . during which the great terror spun aimlessly , growing always in strength and beating the little town with great rains and blinding spindrift , it hurl been too much . The mayor was now living only in the hope that the sea scum would one day return to some strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports he had outstanding complaints against t hem . " M'incur , have you record of the exact day upon which they left ? " Henri asked . The mayor needed no record . It had been upon the day the hurricane had finally made up its mind and swept toward the peninsula of Yucatan . Reboarding the Sea Lily in the little , green-watered harbor , Henri was trembling with excitement . For the time of the Hereras ' departure from the little town made it physically possible for them to have been upon the Purple Reefs when the Christophe last touched there . Whatever unknown thing had befallen upon the Purple Reefs , the Hereras had not been behind bars when the thing befell . Yet , having allowed the physical possibility of the Hereras ' having returned to the wrecked Webber , surely their actions made it highly unlikely that they had done so ? Their interest in the Webber had been so criminally slight that they had failed even to report the wreck . They had shown no interest in salvaging what was left of the Webber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since they had not known that the military men were gone . What could have caused them to return to the Purple Reefs ? Hurrying his mail delivery in the Isle of Palma , he returned to the seemingly insoluble riddle : How might a ship be sunk under conditions where oil slick must have shown , and yet have shown no oil slick ? This time , as the Sea Lily threaded the almost landlocked waterway that had been Malcolm Christophe 's course between the Isle of Palms and the Cape , he would keep his mind fixed on this one question . In most places the stagnant and leprous green bottom was actually visible , so that even without betraying oil it must have revealed a sunken rowboat , while even From seemingly deserted keys and the sweltering green hearts of swamps , t he little cooking fires climbed , telling of watching eyes and lieteningears . And just as there was no mile of ( se run where eyes would not have noted the wild glow of a burning ship or men been startled by the groundand-water-shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a ship sank invisibly and soundlessly , there must still have been the betraying oil that could not be gathered up and must be seen . As every mile of the hundred and forty miles opened before him , he continued to ask himself , " How could oil slick have been unseen here ? " At the end of the hundred and forty miles , as the Sea Lily took the deep blue of the Channel of Yucatfin , he knew that there had been nowhere that oil slick would not have shouted its presence . As the insurers had contended , it was impossible that a ship had sunk without trace on that course . Yet the Christophe had left the Isle of Palms and had not reached the Cnpe . Try then the theory that for unknown reasons the Chriatophe had gone seaward . With the Sea Lily breasting the dark whisper of the Straits of Florida , he was still trying to think of reasons or compulsions that might have taken Malcolm Christophe seaward . There were none that seemed to him valid . 5n Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pieced n slow little ship sei far fmm course or in such comb ! inns tied the searching air forces and ships would not have found I he ever-betraying oil ? he oil that would have reached the surface wherever the ship sank and would have been found , and had not been found , He was exhausted by lack of sleep , yet tilled with the strange joy that he was about to see the girl again , as the Sea Lily threaded the mangrove lanes leading to Jewtish Bay . He was so eager to see the girl who was grown , yet seemed a little girl , that it was only after twice falling asleep at the wheel that he put the launch into a sheltered pool and stretched out on the deck to sleep . Waking , as the mangrove shadows stretched long aerate : the water , his heart beat hard against the warm planks of the deck . But the gray wharf on the muddy little river was empty as he finally swung the launch in under the bank , let the anchor go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , a pair of hare legs shot into view from the top of the bank . " Hello . " a rough , young voice said . " How 's the rescue business ? " And the girl he had wished to see was laughing down at him . " I got a glimpse at you where you come in from the bay . " She dropped with a soft plop to the deck , to sit cross-legged , running her fingers along her crimson toenails . " Where you heading for now ? " " Good day to you . m'selle . We have saved no one since we helped you with the children , " Henri said . " I carne to learn if M'sieur Webber has returned . " She did not look at him . " No . He ai n't come back . " She looked up and her face was red . " I 'm not at Tom 's place now ! I 'm on my own . I 'm runnin ' the cafe . I 'm in business . " Chattering like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of the cafe . Her pride and self-importance were touching . " I 'm doing good with the caf ? ! " She looked like a delighted infant . " Real good ! They said I wouldn't- " " My congratulations . There is much pleasure in one 's own busing . . . . M'selle , you still do not know when M'sieur Webber will be back ? It is very important to me that I see him . " She looked down again , playing with her toes . " What you want to see Tom for ? " " As I mentioned before , in regard to our family 's lost ship . " " Tom does n't know nothing ! Tom would n't do you any good ! " " He may know something without knowing that he knows it , " Henri explained patiently . " At least , I must talk with him . Can you tell me when he will return ? " Her eyes met his with a strange and pleading anxiety in them . " Tom wo n't do you good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Tom ! " She jumped up and put her hands on his ' shoulders . " Do n't go to Tom , Henri ! " Her face and voice were strangely urgent . " You want to find out something , I 'll ask  --  when he comes back . Tom 's a funny sort of man . " He looked at her , puzzled . " Why should I not talk to him ? " " I do n't know . Just do n't ! Promise me you wo n't ttol , ' a him , Henri ! He 's just no good to yoi . ! Promise ! " " I can make no such promise , " he said . " As soon as M'sieur Webber returns , I must talk with him , m'selle . " SA ' 111111 ) , 11 ' Ile looked down inlo her eyes . " He has not returned ?

" He found her eagerness and her struggle with her English very lovely . " The menu is most inviting , m'selle . But I do not have the money for such luxuries and I can not let a charming girl ! my for my meal , " Henri said , smiling . Her face fell . She sulked for a minute , then grew happy again . " Well , come and see my caf ? . Come and have a cup of coffee ! You can have a cup of coffee ! It 's good coffee ! " " If I pay for it . then many thanks ! " Along the straggling street , she pattered beside him like a confiding puppy . The men greeted her and the younger men eyed her overlong , but the women ignored her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they wo n't talk to me , Henri . They do n't like my caf ? or the boys ' liking my caf ? either ! They just are n't friendly . " " You will forgive me , but since they seem conservative and in main elderly women , could it be that they would he more friendly if you wore more clothing , m'selle ( " Henri suggested , smiling down at her bright head . wear less'n I did wear , because they were so mean to me ! " ehe told him defiantly . After a minute , she asked anxiously , " Would you like me in more clothes ? Would you , Henri ? " Her brown child 's hand plucked at his sleeve . - Is that what you mean ? " " For me , you could not he more charming , " he said . " But too great lack of clothing may be misinterpreted by conventional persons. - Her face was redly flushed as she looked down . " Your brother did n't like me , did he ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , will you , Henri ? Things the women say are just because I 'm a stranger and they 're not neighborly , the old cats ! The hateful , scratching old cats ! " Her anger cleared . " There 's the caf ? ! It 's nice , is n't it ' ? " Her face was beautiful with pride as she looked at the rickety structure . " It is truly fine , " Henri said , touched . " I 'll make coffee , fresh ! Do you like your coffee strong ? " " M'sieur Talleyrand said that it should be ' black as the devil , hot as hell , pure as an angel , sweet as love . ' " She puzzled with the quotation , her hands busy at the urn . Even in late afternoon the caf ? was swelteringly hot and beads of sweat glittered on the rose flush of her forehead . " It is n't the busy time yet , but it gets real busy when the loggers come in . I do all the work , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's not too hard . I do n't mind it . " She pushed her wet hair back with her fist . " The loggers want to help with the dishes , but they clown and break them .... I have n't told you my name . My name is Rue . I guess may mother was sorry she had me . " She worked briskly at the urn . " Here 's your coffee ! " The coffee was good , though he regretted the nickel for it . But her joy and his own pleasure in watching her exuberant youth were compensation . Feeling something of the treachery of one who seeks information from a happy child , he naked , " M'eelle , since EVENING POST you are no longer at M'sieur Webber 's landing , you would know if he had returned ? When he gave to New ( Irans , he perhaps comes and goes in his power boa t ? - She caught the last part of Lhie sentence mud her laughter ring , pushing her betties together .

" The genuineness of her laughter could not be doubted . Then her face pouted us a truck stopped outside . The loggers . " " M'sello , it was delightful , " Henri said , rising as the first group of loggers stamped in . " And my thanks for the pleasure of seeing the caf ? . " In the street , which was growing cooler now , he puzzled over the report on Thomas Webber 's seamanship and considered the problem of why the girl did not want him to talk to Thomas Webber . She was so altogether openhearted , so disconcertingly frank , that be could not associate her with cruelty or deceit . Yet she did not wish him to talk with Thomas Webber . If he had not liked and trusted her , he would have said that she was afraid , and for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could send the Sea Lily 's mail on to Tampa with the combined mailman and iceman , who would also give him a ride at dawn to the Tamiami Trail , where he could catch the bus for Miami . He could leave the Sea Lily with an old man by the name of Pop Watts who cared for boats like babies . He even hoped that by the time he got back from Miami , Thomas Webber might even have returned , and the girl had made him more anxious than ever to talk with him . He was untying the stern rope of the Sea Lily preparatory to catching a fish for his supper , as the girl 's legs , clad this time in blue slacks , again appeared over the top of the bank . On her feet were scuffed and surprisingly small tennis shoes . Above the slacks , she wore a long-sleeved white shirt . " I made a deal with the camp cook to feed the boys . He 'll use all the butter but I do n't care . ' She mopped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am about to fish for my supper , " Henri said . She smiled her radiant , artless smile . " Take me along ! " He said , " I am alone , neselle ! " She stared at him , then laughed delightedly until her face went red and tears were on her lashes . " What did you say ? " " I meant that I would not wish to embarrass you by in any way compromising you . " " You wo n't ! " she said , and her face was suddenly unlaughing . " If that 's all that 's bothering you , let 's get going ! " The launch dropped down the mangrove channels and headed out between the bird-thick islands . Where the nature of the keys changed and little white beaches appeared , Rue suddenly jumped to her feet . " Pink shells ! Let me get them ! " She pointed to the sand riffles where shells like pink moths lay among the coral fragments . Henri edged the launch in and jumped into the thigh-deep water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find of the fairy shells , then waded back with the bright heap in his cupped hands . FFFFF iry 3,1733 " These were what you wished ? " As Ihloanpds uttothuecrnhe ( hors into ntoh.er hands , his own She laughed with pleasure . " Thanks . When I get enough I 'm going to make a shell necklace . They look like pink flowers in a real thick pink necklace . " Where sand-bottom showed like jade between brawn weeds , he dropped anchor and baited the lines , handing hers to her . " Lower to the bottom and then pull up until the sinker clears . " Hardly were the lines down when he caught a line grunt and she pulled in a muttontish . When her line needed re-baiting , he slid on a fresh shrimp tail for her , his hands deftly large about the scrap of flesh as he knelt on one knee at her side . When she had caught two more grunts and he three , he told her , " I have enough now . I would not have needed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry tomorrow . But perhaps you can use more fish for the care " I sure can ! " They fished until the light turned to lead silver and the sea between the reflections of the sky was sullen green . As they headed homeward , he said , " Hold the wheel while I clean the fish . Cleaning them is hard for a woman 's hands , but easy for mine . " Surprised , he saw that her eyes were full of bright tears . He smiled at her . " Watch the sand banks ! - " What would happen if we hit a old bank ' ? " " We would be out all night , until the morning tide , " Henri said , flicking the silver scales from a pink fish . Beside them the mangrove walls slid by , black-green with coming night . Henri began to wash the fish in the warm water beside the launch . Suddenly the Sea Lily checked , reared heavily , almost swamping her stern , lurched sideward and stopped . Henri sprang to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steered on the wrong side of a channel marker . She was now staring at him wide-eyed , her face pale . Leaping to cut the engines , he said , " Do not look so frightened ! I should have been watching the markers . " Glancing astern , he knew a horrible moment in which he believed the Sea Lily might swamp completely , and then thought of mud-imbedded iron and possibly stabbed gas tanks that could result in fire . He said calmly , This is mud bottom , We should not be hurt and may be able to push off . " The further tipping of the launch indicated that this was unlikely . Dusk was deepening and the falling tide pulled strong . Hurried readjustment of the baled fans raised the stern . But in a few minutes it was plain that they were stuck for the night . Henri lit the lantern , which did not contain much fuel , then waded for mangrove roots and branches for a smudge fire . He said cheerfully , " We may as well cheat the mosquitoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke pot . " Perched on the upper gun'l and chattering like a myna bird , she asked , " I guess I should be frightened ; should I , Henri ? " Holding a bale of fans , he stood still as his face grew red with anger . " If your meaning is what I think it is , I do not seduce young children ! " He turned his hack upon her , swinging the fans to the cabin top . " Though you doubt it . there are also some standards of conduct in regard to a woman with whom one is accidentally placed alone for a night ! " " It  --  were n't accident , Henri . I ran the wrong side of the marker on purprime . " He whirled to ince her . " You what ? " Rage stopped his voice . She was clown off her perch to throw her firms round his shoulders , her head Premed into the curve of his shoulder . " Henri , I did n't want to go buck ! " Her arms tightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wanted to go on seeing you ! I wanted most to have you talk to me ! No one ever talked to me like you ? like I mattered ! " He lifted her , somewhat violently , back to the gun ' ( . " Do you know that many people depend on this launch ? Do you know that you could have wrecked it had there been old iron or roots in the mud ; that a gas tank could have been pierced and fired ; that I run responsible for the launch , and that , were it lost , I could not look my brother in the face ? M'selle , how dared you ? " She mumbled , " I 'm sorry . " Her golden head dropped on her knees and she wept . She sobbed as if she was heartbroken , with choking , gulping sobs that became a sort of crooning of desolation . He knelt down beside her and lifted her face . " Do not weep so ! You should not be , but you are forgiven . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face was puckered as little Timothy 's in his moments of misinterpretation by the family . " I did n't mean to hurt the launch ! I never thought shout it might turn over or catch fire ! I only wanted to stick it ! " You are probably incapable of thinking of anything , and should not be blamed . It has not turned over or caught fire . " " You hate me ! " " I should , and do not ! I simply set you amongst the mysteries . " Her eyes were swollen almost shut , her lashes st uck together in spikes , and her nose and cheeks were red as those of a weeping child , but the beginning of a shaken smile quivered on her lips . He stood up . " Do you know how to work a pressure stove ? " Her head was still bowed . " No . But I can mix good pancakes . You light the stove . " " Very well . " He knelt to light the stove . " Perhaps you can show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly happy again . They ate pancakes and crisp-crusted fried fish amid rolling smoke into which ? the mosquitoes still fought . From misting smoke , and drinking coffee that tasted of mangrove smoke , she said , " This is the nicest time I ever had , Henri ! You are nice , Henri ! No one ever baited hooks and got shells for me before ! Tell me about the island , Henri ! " He told her . And of the family and Aunt Caroline 's hair ; of Domremy that was steel-blue dawns when the roses dripped with dew ; and where , beyond a kind woman in the doorway , smiled the laughter , the kindness and the childishness of the generations . She said , " My folks were sharecroppers , then fruit tramps . We never stayed . " " Domremy is very poor , but the house was planned by the greatest architect of France .

She smelled of wood smoke and sunlight and map and healthy life . " Oh . you , Henri , with h your funny ways and your pocket of fish to carry on the bus ! " With one of her lightning changes , she was now , he thought , a woman and beautifully tender . She put her hands flat-palmed , against his cheeks . " Funny Henri , dear Henri . I love you !

By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foolish minute in which to put the launch ashore . You are a dear little PUPPY dog , and you will have forgotten me before you expect it . Now you must behave yourself and be no more trou tile . " " I will not forget ! I love you ! I never loved anyone but you , Henri ! You are good , Henri ! When I touch you , I touch goodness ! Take me to the sea island , Henri ! Let me live there ! Let me wait ! " " We can not properly feed all that are there already , dear . Alen you are a nee-struck child . Also you know nothing of me as I know nothing of you . This is of youth and the big stars and the night , and if you do not know that it . is nonsense , I do ! And that is well for us both  --  and now you must be a good child and talk no more nonsense . . How old are you , Rue ' ? " " Sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " I thought as much ! Now you must behave ! " " Kiss me to say you are not angry , Henri ! Kiss me ! " She pressed her lips to his cheek as he turned his head away . He said , " I do not kiss you because I am not angry . And because I have always thought the Followers too stern , but now I know that they may be very wise " " But you love me ? You said you loved me ! " " I hope to be wiser with the dawn ! You are too young to be expected to be wise , but I am a man and I am hoping that God will permit me not also to be a fool ! " " If you are n't no wiser in the morning , and the other mornings , Henri ? " " Then I will he sorry for myself , since it is not pleasant to know oneself without sense , " he said . " And it will otherwise make no difference , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , little one ? This is a very big piece of nonsense . And if you love me even a little , you will remember that when there is work to be done , one does it . At times the days are hard , since a man wishes for his own fire and the sweetness of his own woman beside it , and too much wishing stands in the way of the work . " He put his hands about her smooth face . " Since I have work to do , do not make the work harder ! " She sighed and stood back from him . " Henri , if you had not work to do , would you marry me ? " " As utterly foolish as it is . I believe I would ! " he said . " And doubtless we would make each other wretched to the end of the world ' " The Sea Lily came off the bank , undamaged , on the blackness of the rising tide , Stern-faced , Henri caught a bus as dawn was breaking over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he carried a carefully wrapped package of fried fish which smelled appetizingly through its newspapers and worked on the morning hunger of his fellow passengers so that they began to sniff . Through the confusion and aggressive newness of Miami , he went first to the file rooms of the leading newspaper . where an elderly Englishman in a wheel chair , who was amusing himself with the issues covering the Florida boom , remarked that he did not know what was making him think of fish and chips in London . Since nostalgia is a sad thing , all too familiar to the men of the West Indies , Henri bowed . " Perhaps , m'sieur , you would enjoy a fillet ' ? " The Englishman , slightly startled , said , " By George , I believe I would ' " Regarding the very large , immaculately shaven and neatly laundered but amazingly patched young man , he said , " Dudley Markham . Have to live in the blasted sun  --  Bahamas , Miami  --  damned places fairly indecent with flowers ! " After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump and may Henri with intelligent poperisi and said , " Eh ? " or " I I'm. " llut hire a liveried black man %stifle to ask , " Ready , Sir Dudley ? " I kiwi had told the red-frusel math the story of the Christophe and of what Mr. 11 louaton , Monsieur Isitour and Aunt C-nroline thought , and of his own idea about t lie oil slick , and even oft he ndvertisenient for Aunt Caroline 's wheeled chair , which would have to be a very old chair that they could fix up . " Damned interesting abieit your ship ' " the Englishman said . " Offhand , say your old Indy was on firm ground in telling you to look always for ' great money ' ? eome way in which the sinking of your ship could have been worth a lot to someone or in which your ship 's remaining afloat could have cost someone a damn big sum ! From the mechanical angle , you 're right about the oil . How it was done ? Why it was done ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Find someone who stood for a big gain or a big loss , or someone who could simply have worked the oil trick , and whoever he is , if he 's either , you can be pretty sure he 's both chaps ! " With his dark eyes grave between the amazing Christophe lashes , Henri explained . " Apart from the fairy-tale chance of treasure , it had seemed that the one source of ' great money ' might have been some large insurance fraud in connection with the steamship Webber . But it seems that there was no shadow of fraud . M'sieur Webber , the owner , lost heavily . " " Do n't know enough about it to give an opinion , but intentionally wrecked ships have n't always cast shadows of fraud either before or behind them ! Seems to me there was something about the Campello case . Ca n't clearly recall it , but might be worth your while to look it up . " He stared with popeyed ferocity at Henri . " I used to be one of the Chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the underwriters at Lloyd 's , you young idiot " Not a piece of furniture . " He poked a finger into Henri 's midriff . " What I 'm driving at is that usually when a ship is thrown away , the owners put all their eggs on the seeming legitimacy of the wreck itself to make the claim stick . Very occasionally , they do n't . They do n't bother so much about making the sinking look good , but play it from the angle of seemingly taking a loss . Your man seems O.K. from both angles  --  you ca n't fake a hurricane . But you read up on the Campello ' Did n't work . But basic idea was one of the nicest bits of fraud ever thought up . Remember when I read it I was almost sorry it was spoiled by little bits of carelessness  --  using Old Captain Fiery Lake . that sort of thing . " His popeyes stared aggressively . " If I was going to throw away a ship , I 'd certainly read up on the Campello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well collect ! Not impossible another chap with a criminal mind like mine reasoned the same way ! Read up on it ! Damned interesting ! I 've got to be off . " With the black man wheeling the wheel chair , Henri went to how the Englishman into the elevator . A girl smiled and said , " That was Sir Dudley Markham , the owner of Asiatic OiL " Henri said , " He is very nice , but homesick . " He was working through the files for the first account of the Christophe as overdue , when the black man came back with the empty wheel chair and a card on which was scrawled : VIM will give Ii , " cloth . " lo Ann , on r4 onion ofti.ring for Ille Mogi , Englund 1111 ? 41011 ? to Franiv . D.m. l'H. : It 1 can 1 ? h , you in 1 ( 145 ' wily ell Ii thin mailer of flit ' ehrinioplio , call on olio or on lily nliornops . " You bolter lake the choir , sub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a terrible temper . Also he got Revved more chains al home and swears at ' em all tierce . " He saluted and left . Henri sat down on his own chair rather weakly . Ile tried to think what . Joseph would have done . Joseph was prouder even than he . After a minute , he smiled , set his pocket of fish on the seat of Aunt Caroline 's magnificent wheeled chair and knelt beside it to let his hands exult in the chromium wonders . For once , he was agreeing with Joseph about the wonderful goodness of people . Through the balance of the day , he read carefully through the papers which covered the dates between the first announcement that the Christophe was overdue , to the statement that official search had been abandoned . Not having learned anything that was not already known to him , he obtained t he papers for the next three months , in one of which n picture caught his eye . It was Captioned GARDEN UstBRELLA OR HAT ' ? And it showed a bright-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and standing beside a pile of other enormous hats heaped one on the other beside a canal . The boy , it seemed , had been fishing far to the west along the Tamiami Trail and had sighted a bunch of floating hats , still tied together with thatch-palm string , but considerably the worse for submersion ; the hats presumably having fallen into the canal from a passing truck . At the time the photograph was taken , the small salvager had been attempting to sell the hats for ten cents apiece to passing motorists . Staring at the photograph , Henri was trembling with excitement . On the Christophe 's last voyage she had carried such hats as those shown . It had been for some possible trace of the Christophe that had not been recognized as a trace that he had sought . Was it possible that in a bunch of foolish hats the one tangible thing from the lost ship had been found ? But how had it been found where it was found ? Beside a road in Florida , whose coast , on the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the places the little ship had been , must they now look for her  --  or for signs of her  --  in the Gulf she bad not entered ? The contention of the editor 's elderly and female secretary that the editor would not be interested in seeing Henri was incorrect . The unexpected appearance of a threadbare young giant wheeling a newspaper-wrapped package of fried fish in an extremely expensive but otherwise empty wheel chair interested the editor at once . " M'sieur , you must forgive my coming in this way , " Henri said , gently holding the secretary aside . " But if Joseph and I can not prove what befell the Christophe , Domremy may be lost , we can not pay good M'sieur Latour , and it is a great problem how we may even feed the family ! " The editor , whose heavily modeled face suggested a sea captain , shook hands strongly . " The Christophe was my own pet mystery . I 've wanted to meet one of the family who owned her . " " Thank you , m'sieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see one of the hats mentioned in this story . " The editor took the paper , but his eyebrows were restless , " Just for the record , before we got down to it , who are you wheeling in tied wheel chair ? " Henri smiled . " It is II gift for Aunt Caroline . " He told the editor of Aunt Caroline 's hair , clipped to help build the Sea Lily . " And she 111114 wanted a chair for so long , so that she may again make the ! Indite ' . Gatherings in Hi8 Name us miserable as she used to , " " One of the odd problems of tho re-reins of human conduct , " the editor commented . " Sir Dudley performs a kind act , aml a thousand miles away innocent and Christian women have no premonition . ' Aunt Caroline , on target ! ' H'm 'm . " At the end of two hours of telephoning , 1 he editor had been able to establish only the place at which the hats had been fished from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a line bass hole . The family of the boy who had made the find had moved , leaving no forwarding address . " Af'sieur , I can not promise to pay you until we learn what befell  --  or find the galleons . But would it be possible to run in the paper a small advertisement seeking buyers of the hats ' ? " Henri asked , blushing to his black hair . - If I could but see a hat , I would know absolutely if it was of Home Island . Could I show or describe a hat to the weavers , they might even know if it was of those in the Christophe 's last cargo , for they tie-off differently for different years and months . " " We 'll run the ad until we get a bite  --  or until I know we wo n't , " the editor said . " There wo n't be any charge . " " I can not thank you , " Henri said . " M'sieur , would it be possible not to say why we seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the editor said . " We 'll mark it ' Top Secret ! " ' . Arriving at the weather bureau , still wheeling Aunt Caroline 's chair  --  which he had been afraid to leave at the newspaper offices , in case the editor might forget his promise to save it first in the event of fire  --  Henri looked about him with wonder and smiled at the chief meteorologist . " It is strange to be here , m'sieur , and to find you a man who might be any kindly and ruddy man of business , when to the islands and the seas your voice is so often the voice of life and death ! " He parked the wheel chair and moved to speak earnestly across the desk . " As have all men of the sea , I have already so much to thank you for that you must forgive me for asking still another favor . But was there anything of secrecy or of importance in the weather observations with which I hear the Bureau co-operated and that were made upon the Purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief meteorologist assured him that the observations had been routine ; agreeing with Black Tobias that the reefs had been closed simply because military men were of a great importance . He summoned a towheaded young observer who had participated in the tests . Grinning , the young man said , " If you are wondering if there was anything there that might have interested an unfriendly power , forgot it ! There was nothing more secret than that the sun rises in the east ! " " Thank you , m'sieur , " Henri said . " One question that may be of great importance to our search : While on the reefs , did you note a quantity of drying sponges there ? " " Sure did , " the cheerful young man , said . " It was a fine eoft , bed to take a sun bath on . " " No one came there to attempt to collect it ' ? " " No one . I wondered about it . Only people who tried to come near the reefs at all were your father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the last question . It is my understanding that in the southron Everglades the flow of water is toward the southwest ? Could that be temporarily reversed by a hurricane striking from the southwest as the second storm of the year of the Christophe 's loss struck ? So that were some object stranded on the benches or in the mangrove swamps of the Gulf it might be borne inland , perhaps halfway across the peninsula ' ? " " With the water level high , water could drive anywhere with the wind ; and the second storm that year was a soaker ! " At the Naval Air Station , the gray-haired captain who had supervised the weather tests upon the reefs was as kindly as the weathermen . Like the editor , he had closely followed the case of the Christophe . He confirmed Henri 's thought that the depth in which a ship was sunk could not cancel oil slick . Sea search had been one of his own specialties . Had the Christophe sunk within any area she could have reached from the Isle of Palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen it . " Yet , m'sieur , they did not . " " Then , while I would n't put any store in the usual sea rumors of her having been seen afloat here , there and everywhere months later , it would be my opinion she did n't sink in any area searched ! " " Joseph , my brother , who is a great strength , says that all that befell must be very simple ; that it but seems so strange because we do not know , " Henri said earnestly . The captain had noted the washed and drying sponges and , while his instructions had been to keep the reefs closed during the weather tests , he had been ready to pay the owners of the sponge haul its full value should they come . No one came . The public library owned a book dealing with the case of the Campello , but the hook was out . And the librarian suggested a small marine library in Tampa where even better histories of the case should be available . At ten o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a vacant lot near the river to spend the night . A few yards away , automobiles whizzed past , but the open-air bedroom was private , perfumed and shining with large white blossoms . It also commanded a fine view of the sky . And having eaten the last of the fried fish , Henri lay on his back and watched the low silver clouds sail across the sky and flush to the reflection of the neon lights . He found that he looked most often toward the west and the little settlement where a girl who was a child would be closing the cafe with the noisy importance of a happy child . Suddenly and with alarming tenderness , he thought of her as she would be when she would have a child of her own . Playing with a baby of her own , she would not sing it soft songs . She would shout at it and shake it and laugh loud at it , and the child would laugh back at her , loving the crowing shouts and the laughter and the youth of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
