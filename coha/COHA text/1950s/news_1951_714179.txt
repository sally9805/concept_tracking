Ruppell , Richmond County Republican leader , was accused yesterday of having tried to influence the testimony of a prospective witness for the State Crime Commission by intimating that " harm " might come to the witness ' parents . The charge was made by Henry E. Lucking , an Air Force veteran , who had told the commission on Tuesday that he had paid Mr. Ruppell $2,000 in 1945 to help him obtain a liquor store license . Mr. Lucking related the story of the alleged threat to his family as the final piece of testimony given to the commission , which ended , temporarily at least , its investigation into crime and political corruption on Staten Island . Seven days ' of open hearings were held in the West Brighton Courthouse . U. S.

The liens covered the years 1945 through 1950 . The Government ' contended that Michael Dalessio ( Mikey Dee ) of 245 Kissel Avenue , Staten Island , owed $297,478 . The most lucrative years , the lien showed , were 1946 and 1947 , for which the Government wants $105,461 and $138,306 , respectively . Alex Dalessio of 41 Ward Avenue is said to owe $66,225 , and John of 151 Jume1 Street , both of Staten Island , is down for $72,368 for the same period with the exception of 1948 . No lien was filed against him for that year . With the swearing in yesterday of William B. Herlands as a special assistant state attorney general , prosecution of the commission 's findings seemed to be assured . The former city commissioner of investigation will look into matters arising from the inquiry . He was appointed by order of Governor Dewey to supersede District Attorney Herman Methfessel in proceedings related to the investigation . Says He Met Ruppell Sept. 17 Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Glen Rock , N. J. , testified that he had met with Mr. Ruppell on Sept 17 , two days before the hearings started . He said the rendezvous was in a restaurant at 745 Third Avenue , Manhattan , and that it was arranged at Mr. Ruppell 's request . The witness said the Republican leader had telephoned him on Sept. 15 , after both had been subpoenaed to appear before the commission , and said he wanted to have a talk with him " for our . nutual protection . " Mr. Lucking said he had notified the crime commission of the call and that he had been advised to meet with Mr. Ruppell . He said a. policeman assigned to the commission staff sat in a booth behind them and that he heard their conversation . Mr. Ruppell , who preceded Mr. Lucking on the witness stand yesterday , admitted to the meeting in the restaurant , but asserted that it was held to discuss personal business and that it was not concerned with the pending hearing . Earlier in the day , during extensive examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republican leader had denied charges by other witnesses that he had exacted shakedown payments from political appointees and others desiring official ' favor . Mr. Ruppell admitted to accepting " several hundred " dollars , but insisted they were political contributions that he kept as " petty cash " expense money . Mr. Lucking said that at the // restaurant meeting Mr. Ruppell had repeated the statement about wanting to talk to him for their mutual protection . He said Mr. Ruppell warned him that the retail liquor store conducted by the Lucking family on Staten Island might prove an embarrassing thing at the hearings . " He said it might come out that my mother was not interested in the store and that it was not shown in the original license , " the witness said . " I corrected him and told him my mother was a partner from the day the application was made . That surprised him . " He then told me that I should think very carefully what I might say to the crime commission , as he knew I had a subpoena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission . I declined . He asked me what I was going to tell them when I took the stand . I declined . " Testifies on Intimidation Mr. Lucking then related the part of his conversation with Mr. Ruppell that contained the alleged intimidation . " He pointed out to me that my father and my mother were on Staten Island , and I would not want any harm to befall them , " the witness testified . " I wanted to make sure that the people who were listening to this could hear it , and I asked him to repeat it , and he pointed out that my father and mother were still living on Staten Island , and I did n't want them to be hurt . He repeated this again later in the conversation -- a tot ill of three times . " The witness then pointed his ringer at Mr. Harlan and remarked with a smile , " He cautioned me to watch out for you ; you would probably try to make a fool of me on the witness stand . " Mr. Lucking said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian clothes and that he ' was sitting directly behind , eatmg. separated by a piece of plywood up to his shoulders .

The Republican county leader lenied that he had ever accepted payment for help in obtaining liquor store or bar and grill licenses . He said that many persons came to him at his home and at his Borough Hall office as Richmond Commissioner of Public Works to discuss " many things . " On these occasions , he added , he had often been asked for advice in obtaining licenses , but that he had never taken pay for this service . Mr. Ruppell said that stories of pay-offs to him by Mr. Lucking , Edward F. Conti , Peter Prunty and several others were " untrue .

Mr. Ruppell repeated this story about Mr. Prunty , alleging that he had never looked at the contents of the envelope . In answer to a question by Mr. Harlan , he said that he could not remember whether the contribution was noted in Mr. McCreary 's records , since most of the records disappeared after the latter 's death . Mr. Ruppell denied that he had been a partner in a liquor store with former Assemblyman Arthur T. Berge as the latter had alleged in previous testimony .
