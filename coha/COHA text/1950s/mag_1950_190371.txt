After eight months of hearings and three more of a process that the bureaucrats call deliberating , the Federal Communications Commission handed down a semifinal decision on color television . Like many FCC decisions , it proved an enigma wrapped in federalese and tied with red tape . <P> FCC decided it liked the partly mechanical CBS color system better than its all-electronic competitors made by RCA and Color Television , Inc. , of California ( TIME , Nov. 28 et seq . ) . But RCA and CTI , or any other hopefuls , were told they still had three more months to prove they could outperform the CBS system . <P> Turning to set manufacturers , FCC suggested that they get right to work turning out sets that , at least , could pick up CBS color telecasts in black &; white . As a prod for the reluctant manufacturers , who are having trouble making enough sets for the current market , FCC hinted that if the manufacturers ' response is lukewarm it might make a final decision in favor of CBS next month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners of 7,000,000 U.S. sets now in use could receive CBS color telecasts in black &; white by adding an adapter ( estimated cost : $25 ) . To get the same telecasts in color would require an additional converter ( estimated cost : $50 ) . Explained the FCC report : " It would not be in the public interest to deprive 40 million American families of color television in order to spare the owners of 7,000,000 sets the expense required for adaptation . " <P> TV manufacturers , put on the spot by the FCC report , complained bitterly . Said one : " The masses might just as well forget about color TV until 1953 at least . " And even Air King 's President D. H. Cogan , who had strongly supported CBS color during the hearings , protested : " It would be suicidal now for a manufacturer to switch to making color receivers in the face of today 's material problems . " <P> Many observers thought that the FCC decision and the argument it started were academic . With the electronics industry shifting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months from now to get a constant flow of existing black &; white TV sets .
