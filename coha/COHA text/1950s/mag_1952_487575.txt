NORTH of Nairobi , and exactly on the equator , the snow-clad summit of Mount Kenya stands out against the sky . During the heat of the day clouds cover it , the ever-changing cumuli that continually rise and dissolve over the hills of the Kikuyu Reserve . Children are taught by their parents to look toward Mount Kenya in the morning and in the evening , for among those snows , they say , is a holy place . " God lives there , " they tell the children ; " it is the home of Ngai . " To themselves , though not to the children , some of them now say that since Europeans have climbed . Mount Kenya and defiled it , perhaps God does not live there any more . Armored cars are rolling over the Kikuyu country now . The decencies have broken down ; blood has been flowing . What lies behind this terror ? It is the fact that the sudden sweep of Western life and its mechanical instruments into the Kikuyu country has found no adequate human institutions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tribal and individual self-consciousness has also greatly increased , and treELIZABETH E. HOYT , professor of economics at Iowa State College , spent some time among the Kikuyu tribe in Kenya in 1951 while making a study of cultural change accompanying economic development on a Fulbright grant . BY ELIZABETH E. HOYT mendous new forces have sought outlets , overflowing the old channels . The destructive effects of undigested cultural change can be seen all over the world , but in the Kikuyu Reserve the speed of the change and certain special conditions have heightened the tragedy . I lived on the Kikuyu Reserve with a Cambridge Uni-versity girl , an anthropologist who was studying the life of women and children . She warned me before I joined her that I might not like the Kikuyu . " They have a very bad reputation , " she said . " People call them sullen and suspicious , and distrust them . That is n't the way I feel about them , but if you come you can see for yourself . " In the Fort Hall district the country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes or in narrow valleys where streams become torrents in the rains and disappear in the dry season . The violent rains wash the soil down the hillsides , and the women protect their gardens with little rows of brush which are only slightly better than no erosion control at all . The small plots produce a variety of crops  --  bananas , maize , millet , some cassava , sugar cane , sorghum , sweet potatoes , beans . Along the streams the wild arrowroot is protected , since the roots are something to fall back on in time of famine . We walked up and down these hillsides daily , greeted always by the women working in the garden plots . They were barefooted , and some had lost their toenails from the rough soil . Breaking up the ground is supposed to be men 's - work , but we saw it done by women and once by two girls about six and seven , who laughed as they made the clods fly . In some places were little platforms raised above the ground where old women sat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relics of the original forest were left . Most of the trees , , however , were eucalyptus and wattle brought in from Australia : The bark of the wattle , a kind 0f acacia , is used in tanning and is the chief cash crop of the Kikuyu in this region . I know little About their incomes , but the United States Department of State estimates that the annual per capita income in Kenya as a whole is $40 . Since the 30,000 Europeans and 100,000 Indians in Kenya are more prosperous than the 5,000,000 Africans , an estimate of $25 or $30 for Africans can be made . In Nairobi , where pay tends to be highest , wages run from $5.60 to $8.40 a month for laborers up to $21 a month for artisans . My friend 's work took her into many homes . The children , even as young as three , came with outstretched hands to meet the guests and watched quietly while the babies were measured . My friend said she had never seen a parent strike a child . We spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the women received us was almost exhausting . They seized our hands , patted our shoulders , looked deep into our eyes , poured out welcoming words . The goods sold in the markets were almost entirely local products  --  vegetables , fruits , hides and skins , articles made by blacksmiths , domestic animals . Non-native goods  --  bread , sugar , tea , liniment  --  were offered in small stores . There were far too many of these for the volume of trade , and the daily . intake of some was said to be not more than twenty cents . In a poor little shop where the total stock was not worth more than ten dollars one copy of one book was for sale : " Cry , the Beloved Country . " I visited many Kikuyu schools . Most of these were mission schools which the government subsidized ; many new ones were being built , usually on hilltops , the materials and labor being furnished largely by the Kikuyu . Other schools had been built entirely by the Kikuyu because the British did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woefully understaffed , for few good teachers were available . But the people made great sacrifices for their schools , giving in some cases half of their cash income and even selling their land and cattle to get money to contribute . I saw whole communities carrying stones to hilltops and working like bees to build the schools . A part of the children 's education , in some places , was to roof the buildings where later they could study . Nowhere , I was told , was school discipline a probDecember 13 , 1952 lem , and again and again , when we suddenly opened the door of a schoolroom without a teacher , we found all the children with their noses buried in their books . They often teach their parents to read at night . The children wore all kinds of clothing and scraps of clothing , including old army overcoats with the sleeves cut out and the skirts dragging on the ground . AMONG British and Kikuyu I often heard Jomo Kenyatta 's euphonious name . After his stay in London he had spent several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made of the greeting the Kikuyu gave him . He was hailed as a savior , the black man who had been received as the equal of the whites in Europe and had now come back to his own people to deliver them from bondage . In yearning and in triumph the cry " Jomo Kenyattal " rose sharp and clear ; then the inarticulate shouts of ten thousand tribesmen were like the roaring of the sea . When I asked the educated Kikuyu whom I meta very special group , of course  --  about Kenyatta , the response was almost always a troubled one . " Yes , " I was told , " he is a wonderful orator . He holds great crowds spellbound . It is marvelous to see him sway the people . But  --  we are not sure if he is a good leader . He collects large sums of money . Some of us would like to see an account of it . He lives much better than - we . If you ask him a direct question he knows how to evade it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel like a. fool . He is intelligent . He bases his appeal to the people on what education can do for them . He is also a master-actor . Maybe he has acted too long . " " Would he talk with me about education if I went to the independent school at Gethunguri ? " " Oh , yes , certainly , he would be happy to tell an American about his work . " I wrote to Jomo Kenyatta saying that I was an American and was deeply interested in the people 's efforts to get education . I would like to come to Gethunguri and I was free on certain dates . If he would not be there , I said , I should appreciate knowing when he could see me . I received no answer , but I went to Gethunguri  --  it was not an easy place to reach  --  and was told there that both Kenyatta and the headmaster had just left , to be gone several days at least . That , if it was a discourtesy , was the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least , however , I saw the Gethunguri Teachers ' College . What impressed me most was the women 's quarters , the best accommodations for African women I saw in East Africa . They had been made possible by contributions from thousands of bowed , bare-footed women like those whose homes we had visited and who had welcomed us in the markets of Fort Hall . When Europeans in Kenya speak of Jomo Kenyatta , they are likely to speak of Moscow in the same breath , though both Europeans and Africans told me they believed communism meant nothing to the Kikuyu masses as yet . I met one avowed follower of Kenyatta whom I questioned : What do you know about Moscow ? . . . It is a great city of the Europeans . But what does it stand for ? . . . It welcomed Jomo Kenyatta . It said he was as good as the Europeans . It was the first European city to do that . Have you ever heard of communism ? . . . Yes , I have heard of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you interested in it ? . . . No . We ca n't bother with things European . We have to think about the Kikuyu here . Moscow is the world 's center of communism , I said . All I know , he replied , is that Moscow welcomed Jomo Kenyatta . It may be for communism as you say . That is not our business . The fact that the Kikuyu independent school movement was promoted by Jomo Kenyatta naturally colored the British attitude toward it . And yet , I said to a friendly Britisher , it seems to me that this Kikuyu undertaking is one of the great educational movements of history . " False shepherds , false shepherds ! " he replied , shaking his head . " These people are sadly exploited by their own leaders . " " False shepherds or not , " I answered , " the people 's hunger is not false and their sacrifices are not false either . The shepherds might not do such harm if we gave these people more of a helping hand . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but with circumspection . Rome was not built in a day . We have the welfare of these people at heart , you know that . Let us have a few hundred years . " He went on with a smile : " You Americans are always in a hurry . It sometimes seems as if the people with the least experience are the most eager to give advice . " T CAME home . The tension grew , and darker accounts I arrived from both Kikuyu and British . Six Kikuyu boys managed to get to the United States to study last year , and one of them came to my home , practically as a member of the family . His own home was in Fort Hall , the district where I had lived . He had been critical of the British in Kenya ; he still thought they were slow . But now he saw that they , especially the colonial government , were trying to do something but did not know the best " way . Did I think they would hold his criticisms against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did r think agriculture or the social sciences or education would be the most useful major ? In the United States , he said , he had learned the difference between a value judgment and a functional judgment . Professor Drake had taught him that social scientists must tell the truth . Last September the Mau Mau troubles were in the offing , and that was what we talked about. , " I am frightened , " he said ; " I am afraid great harm is going to be done . The masses of the Kikuyu are excited ; they are terribly angry over wrongs that happened long ago . They do not know how hard it is for them to bridge a cultural gap , or for the British to help them do it . I once did not know myself . That is one of the things I learned here . I am afraid that there will be violence and they will not know what they are doing . I do not know who can tell them in time . " Could you tell them , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn better how to tell them . But whoever does that successfully must be able to work with the British , too . To be successful now it is necessary to have the confidence of both sides , and you have to feel confidence in both . Do you feel confidence in the British ? , . Some of them are trying their best , but it is hard for them to set what is inside us . They see our bodies , and they see part of our minds , but they do n't see what our souls are like . They can speak so easily , but we say foolish words , or we are dumb . If we make mistakes it is hard for them to trust us still . But it is so easy to make mistakes . And to keep on going straight ahead , with abysses on each side , is like walking on a knife edge all the time . How does the basic problem look to you ? ... The people are waking up suddenly . They want education so that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They do n't get jobs of any importance . They ca n't communicate very well . They are frustrated . So they turn their attention to politics , where they can throw themselves around and seem to be doing something . What could we Americans do that would count most ? . . . Help to get education for the Kikuyu  --  you have helped me here and could help them there . Help to spread understanding of the tensions that torment us . You could find a way to do that without offending anybody , perhaps by speaking through the United Nations . Those are the important things because they are the foundation of everything else .
