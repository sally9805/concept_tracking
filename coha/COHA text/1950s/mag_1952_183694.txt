Many of you have written to tell me how much you have enjoyed TIME 'S art pages in color , but few of you have gone as far as Reader William E. Farr of Vancouver , Wash . When TIME ran a color reproduction of a Navajo sand-painting ( Oct. 8 , 1951 ) , Farr decided he wanted to copy the pattern-on a hooked rug . About a year later he sent us the finished product , a 4-by-5-ft. rug . He had spent 320 working hours making enlarged drawings of the painting , transferring them to the monk 's cloth used as a base for the rug , selecting colors and hooking the rug . Farr explains he has been hooking rugs as a hobby for 18 years . It all began , he says , when his wife was taking lessons in the craft . " I 'll bet I could make one of those , " he said . " Why do n't you get a frame and try it ? " she challenged . He did , has been at it ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman John Kennedy , running for the Senate in Massachusetts . The footnote described one of Kennedy 's wartime experiences as a Navy lieutenant , when his PT boat was split in two by a Japanese destroyer . Since then , Kennedy has heard from Kohei Hanami , who wrote : " When I read the TIME magazine of Aug. 18 , which mentioned the battle in question , my memory being refreshed , I can vividly recall what happened . . . <P> " In one of the night battles in early August 1943 , I sighted a bold enemy boat of small size heading directly toward my destroyer of a larger type . Having no time to exchange de gunfires . . . my destroyer had to directly hit the enemy boat , slicing it in two . This boat happened to be the PT boat which was under your command . <P> " I take this opportunity to pay my profound respect to your daring and courageous action in this battle , and also to congratulate you upon your miraculous escape under such circumstances . " I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next election of Senators . I am firmly convinced that a person who practices tolerance to the former enemy , like you , if elected to the high office in your country , would no doubt contribute ... to the promotion of genuine friendship between Japan and the U.S. " <P> When I wrote you last spring about TIME 'S book , They Went To College , I may have indicated that it was the last word on the U.S. college graduate . Now it appears that the book is , in one respect at least , only the second-last word . The book ( and TIME 'S review of it as well ) called Brown University one of " 20 famous Eastern colleges , " failed to include it as a member of the Ivy League . Brown is in the Ivy League , and the editors of the Brown Daily Herald have now had the last word . In an almost-forgotten TIME style which no ordinary college student would be old enough to remember , they wrote : " From Providence , R.I. last week came disgruntled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strange to say , the clamor arose not from students remembering a short summer , but from those remembering a long , hard winter at the hands of redcovered TIME . Said one senior : ' Where does young ( 1923 ) up-startish TIME get off snubbing old ( 1764 ) historic Brown University ? ' . . . Diagnosis : Timenmity . . . " TIME was wrong . So was the Herald 's diagnosis . <P> Cordially yours ,
