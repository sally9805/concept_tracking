With new money in the bank to finance ambitious plans for a " new " paper ( TIME , Sept. 23 ) , the New York Herald Tribune suggested on its editorial page last week what an editorial page should be about . " Reading most newspaper editorials these days , " wrote the new chief of the Trib 's editorial page , ex-TIME-and-LiIFE Staffer William J. Miller , " is like eating boiled watermelon . They are dull , even worse , they are bland . Our whole society has become bland . The old-fashioned American capacity for outrage or indignation is so often absent as to seem almost archaic . We intend to restore it . " <P> Whether the page would live up to its encouraging prospectus was for time to tell , but it got off to a brisk , bright start . Sharpened and punctuated with illustrations . Herald Tribune editorials subpoenaed the ghost of Joe McCarthy for a satiric soliloquy , thrice peppered Jimmy ( " Public Enemy No. 1 " ) Hoffa , cudgeled Yugoslavia 's Tito and the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the World Series to San Marino to Jayne Mansfield 's bedipitus . Other dewatermelonization steps : reprint of a radio essay by CBS Commentator Eric Sevareid reflecting on the recent sad decline of quality in the Herald Tribune , and his hopes for a return to its " old heritage . " A well-pruned letters column in a freshened format that substitutes breeze for wind . " They Say " an occasional skimming of notable quotes in the news . " Curmudgeon 's Corner " a space to be periodically opened to outraged or outrageous comment .
