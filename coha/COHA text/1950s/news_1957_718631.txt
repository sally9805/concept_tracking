txt Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said today that Egypt has tended to drag its feet on arrangements to open the Suez Canal before all Israeli troops arc out of the country . In the light of Israel 's weekend withdrawal decision , Mr. Dulles said he hopes Egypt will now end its foot-dragging very quickly . He estimated the canal could be opened in 10 days . Answering questions at a news conference , Mr. Dulles also said a ship flying the United States flag should go into the Gulf of Aqaba soon , although he called that a matter for the shipping companies to decide . Details : Page 4 . By Richard L. Strout Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor Washington With passage of President Eisenhower 's Middle East resolution in the Senate now assured , the long debate casts light on the new relationship between President and Congress . It is one of those situations where a good deal of the importance of the matter rests beneath the surface and where the final vote does not tell the whole story . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a victory and a setback for the administration . It is considered a victory because the so-called doctrine will be finally passed , a sense of national unity against possible Communist aggression is once more expressed , and because American interest in the Middle East is now being put firmly bef9re the . world . Speedy Vote Denied It is considered a setback because most of the above conclusions were evident anyway , and because Congress rejected the sense of urgency presented in Mr. Eisenhower 's original dramatic personal appearance before Congress , Jan. 5 , and in repeated declarations by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles at Senate hearings . As it stands , the two-part resolution expresses the willingness of Congress to see Mr. Eisenhower use armed force to protect all nations in the Middle East which ask assistance against Communist attack , and to spend 200 million dollars this year in economic or military aid  --  such funds already have been appro-. priated in blanket earlier measures .

" In a succession of declarations Secretary Dulles said failure to support the President would endanger the peace , give Moscow the advantage in what he termed " the most dangerous situation " since the war , and represent " a great and maximum disaster to the United States . " There is no normal timetable for action in such matters , but doubtless the administration hoped congressional action would not run far behind that in the Formosa resolution in 1955 . The timetable on Formosa was : Presented Jan. 24 , 1955 , adopted next day by the House , 410 to 3 ; adopted by the Senate 83 to 3 , Jan. 28 . Congressional Contrast As contrasted to this , the House adopted the Jan. 5 doctrine on Jan. 30 , the vote being 355 to 61 . The Senate has waited two months and is prepared to give its leisurely approval . The delay represents an evident changed attitude of Congress toward the White House .
