They 're Bringing Home Japanese Wives By JANET WENTWORTH SMITH and WILLIAM L. WORDEN YOKOHAMA , JAPAN . T HE soldier was young and somewhat red in the face , but he stood his ground in the lobby of a Red Cross building . The girl beside him was black-haired , olive-skinned and obviously frightened . And her clothes looked too bulky on her , although they were new . The soldier addressed the nearest Red Cross worker , ignoring the awful possibility that this volunteer very well might be the wife of his colonel . " I 've been hearing about this brides ' school , " he said , " so I brought her . " He indicated the girl . " I do n't know about this government and history stuff you teach ? what I want her to ! earn is how to wear a slip . I bought her three of them now . " The volunteer blinked once or twice . She repeated , " How to wear a slip ? " Yeah , " said the boy . " I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like I told you , I bought her three of them  --  and she 's got all three on right now . " The problem of the three slips hardly qualifies as typical of the things a Japanese bride needs to know to start life in the United States , but it is n't unusual in the Japanese brides ' schools now being operated here in preparation for a great exodus already under way . Six thousand Americans  --  soldiers , sailors , airmen , civilians and officers  --  have married Japanese citizens in Japan since the end of World War II . Some 500 of these chrysanthemum-bud brides have departed by military transport or civilian ship to live in the United States as permanent nonquota residents . With Korean war rotation taking thousands of men home , applications for visas have increased recently at a rate which indicates nearly all of the 6000 expect to get to the United States sooner or later . The present extended law allowing their entry  --  Public Law 717 ? expires in March , 1952 . So the presumption is that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married at the rate of five to twenty a day at each of the six American consulates in Japan , will try to make the great trans-Pacific jump before that time . If they do so , the Japanese-race population back home will be increased 4 or 5 per cent , not counting the Eurasian children of these marriages . ( Only a few more than 100,000 Japanese lived on the Pacific Coast in 1942 , and negligible numbers elsewhere in the United States . ) The size of this upcoming migration is no surprise to Americans in Japan . Any Caucasian housewife PHOTOGRAPHY BY FRANK ROSS patronizing the Army 's post exchanges or commissaries in Japan is quite accustomed to being in the minority to Oriental shoppers  --  and the Orientals ca n't get the magic entry cards to such stores unless they can prove valid marriages to occupation personnel . Even Occidental business families in Japan ? that is , " foreign traders " ? have to get along without the sixteen-cent gasoline and ten-cent cigarettes dispensed by the Army . But the effect of these mixed marriages on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival of thousands of dark-skinned , dark-eyed brides in Mississippi cotton hamlets and New Jersey factory cities , on Oregon ranches or in Kansas country towns . The thousands are on the way , and their bright-eyed children soon will be knocking on school doors in most of the forty-eight states . The great question of how they will fit in and whether they generally will be welcomed or shunned remains to be answered . Everyone in Japan , from the official Army to casual Japanese and American observers , recognizes that there is a question , with no obvious answer in sight . The brides are all sorts of people . At the bottom , there are no prostitutes , criminals or chronically diseased ? all barred by the immigration law and the fifteen-copy ( tended courses in Sendai , ' Tokyo , Camp Drake  --  through which most soldiers pass on the way to and from Korea  --  and elsewhere . Individual schools differ in detail , but usually run for about a dozen four-hour sessions . A typical program includes sessions on history and government ; travel tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : " In a shower , the water flows from a spray located on the side wall , higher than your head " or " In public places in America , men and women do not use the same toilet facilities at the same time " ) ; attitudes : that is , boy meets girl and the wife 's place in the home ; etiquette as demonstrated by a typical day in a typical American home ; child care and feeding ; clothing and good grooming ; and multiple lessons in cookery . Reactions generally have been quick and favorable , from American husbands as well as the brides . Several husbands came along to school with their wives just to be sure the wives were getting to the right place and listening to the teachers , most of whom are amateurs , a little uneasy in their jobs , but willing to spend hour after hour in order to get results . Some husbands sent special instructions . Cooking teachers in Yokohama still remember the little lady who brought specific instructions from husband-san . " He wants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cooking teacher relaxed . This would be an easy one  --  and the first lesson was . But the next day the sad little bride was back . " He says , " she told the teacher , " I have to make the bun too . " Commonest requests by husbands are for cooking lessons for their otherwise satisfactory wives , and by far the most common cooking demand is that the wives finally , somehow , learn to ! mike a decent cup of coffee . The American takes readily to many things Japanese  --  shoes off in the house , beds made up on the tatami mats , even eating from tables ten inches high . But it 's a rare husband who can stand fish soup for breakfast or breakfast without coffee . One big Negro soldier bringing along his diminutive bride waved away the bride's-school curriculum . " Never mind that , " he said . " I 've told her all she needs to know about the United States . You just teach her how to cook . " Brides ' schools have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip-up on that " boy-meets-girl " lesson . That was one subject on which these young women were already experts . The big man with a handful of candy bars had come into each of their lives sometime before and was still around , and they were n't especially interested in knowing how such things work in the United States . Certainly getting married States-side would be unlikely to involve so many things as the commanding officer 's permission , chaplain 's interview , approval through channels , proof of citizenship and single status by husband , production of family record by wife , Japanese police and Counter-Intelligence Corps checks , and proof of husband 's ability to support wife . Each of these couples had been through all this , requiring a minimum of about six weeks ' work , before the curious ceremony which officially made them man and wife . This ceremony consists merely of showing up at a United States consulate with a sheaf of the necessary papers and a couple of witnesses . When all papers are signed , a consular officer merely makes the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get married . When the groom says , " I so swear , " the whole thing is over . Some couples go through later religious ceremonies of one kind or another , but so far as the United States consulate and the matter-of-fact Japanese authorities are concerned , the marriage is legal the moment the man swears he legally can be married . No vows , no rings , no kissing of the bride , but legal nonetheless . At any rate , there was a slight disinterest in boy meets girl . There was also something less than enthusiasm when one teacher spent class time detailing to sergeants ' and corporals ' wives the proper method of answering an engraved invitation . She assumed they 'd need to know how in America . The Red Cross was even more unhappy when another teacher with a church connection picked up a brides ' - school roll and mailed to each of the wives an earnest bit of missionary effort . This was a brochure which declared in effect : " You 're going to America where nearly everyone is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just to be like the others . " This was not precisely what the brides ' school was all about . On the whole , however , the school attracts willing teachers and youngsters who want to learn , in spite of difficulties . Nobody can learn a great deal about America in a dozen lessons , but the wives make the effort  --  especially in child care and cookery . " The girls are a joy to teach , " said one Army wife , " but we ca n't get rid of them . They insist we keep on teaching them . " Some cooking classes , started in private kitchens as parts of brides ' schools in the spring , continued into November with weekly meetings . Teaching cookery includes such things as how to bake  --  most Japanese have never used ovens  --  and such simple things as how to measure . A cookbook which calls for a " dash " of paprika can be confusing to a girl used to units of go and ragtime . Teachers also confess themselves a little at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be explained ? and the box , containing breakfast food , has pictured on its side a man from Mars in a black mask , firing pistols from each hip . Not all the work is concerned with things American . A common trait of Japanese brides is to shed everything Japanese in favor of American subst. - Lutes as fast as they can . Unless warned , many of them would rush off to the States without a single Japanese kimono , and before leaving would discard every bit of Japanese lacquer as useless junk . Patiently , teachers explain that rice bowls are useful in the States , that soup served in Japanese lacquer will make a tremendous hit with American guests , and that everybody will wish to see the kimono ? that even the elevated wooden clogs ( geta ) which clutter every Japanese doorstep should be taken along . Rain falls in the United States , too , and even that wonderful country 's back yards can be sloppy underfoot . Comedy and tragedy are hopelessly interlaced through the whole affair . A corporal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I 've been going with her since 1996 . . . but now I 've had my marriage application approved , I ca n't even get a day in Japan to get married .. .. If my fiancee could go to a school such as yours , then she will know the necessary fundamentals of being the wife of an American . " At another school an unmarried girl does show up . No , she 's not Mrs. Anybody ? hut she thinks she 'll be married in March , if the man comes back again . Thousands of men sent to Korea in 1950 did miss out on their main opportunity to marry Japanese girls . No marriages were legalized between 1947 and 1950 . Public Law 717 was enacted in August , 1950 , and expired in February , 1951 ? but all this time virtually every combat soldier was in Korea . An extension of the law last March gave them another year 's chance , but many still have not returned . Some wounded went straight home , and now their fiancees ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Korea , and survived both experiences , his wife can get a visa to join him in America . If he was killed , however , his petition is automatically extinguished and the girl can not enter the United States . Eurasian children born in or out of wedlock are Americans if their fathers admitted paternity and registered the births with American consulates . But those unregistered are Japanese for the rest of their lives if the father has been killed . Now and then , walking tragedy shows up at the schools or the escort services the Red Cross provides for wives traveling to the States alone . Typical were the young wife and baby of an American officer who had gone home ahead of them after making legal arrangements for their transportation . But at home the officer changed his mind  --  perhaps the memory of a diminutive Japanese wife did n't stand up well in comparison to long-legged American girls he met . At any rate , he tried desperately to stop his wife and child from leaving Japan . Hoping against hope for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and child along anyhow , but has never heard whether the husband finally accepted his responsibilities or continued to be a first-class jerk . Just what will happen to an abandoned wife not eligible for citizenship is not entirely clear , but the presumption is that wives who become destitute eventually will be deported to Japan . What happens to the children in such cases is even less clear .. However , such cases are a minority . Consul General James B. Pitcher , at Tokyo , has read thousands of letters concerning mixed marriages , but has yet to see one in which the American family objected to the entry of an Oriental daughter-in-law or Eurasian grandchildren . " Mostly , " he says , " they 're very much interested in ' my son 's child ' especially , and want the youngsters with them as soon as possible . " Wives at the brides ' schools usually report that they have corresponded with their husbands ' families . They are a varied lot of girls , tiny or chubby , flat-faced or quite beautiful , competent secretaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rice paddy . They speak the English their husbands taught them " Whassamatta , chum ? " or " I beg your pardon , " depending on what sort of men they married . They 've been children in a nation 's defeat , have gone hungry , have cared for smaller brothers and sisters with the aid of a couple of old kimono sleeves in contrast to the dozens of diapers they 're now given for their own children . They knew how to work before they knew how to talk ; and if they know what to do , will almost always do it well . Some are quick , some stupid , many average . They 've already been treated well by some Americans and insulted gratuitously by others , so they expect mixed treatment when they get to the States . Some married for love , some because they already had children out of wedlock , some for the very practical purpose of obtaining post-exchange privileges for themselves and their needy families . Among them are serious young people , studying hard to learn their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The transport ships carry girls cast off by their own families either as good riddance or in protest against their marriages , others who are waved away from Yokohama by whole crowds of best-dressed kinfolk , down from remote towns or villages . They 're not the very best Japan has , and certainly not the worst . And their chances for happiness appear equally mixed . One obstetrician in Yokohama , after delivering dozens of Eurasian babies , estimates that no more than 10 per cent of the marriages will stand the strain of American life . Red Cross people are generally more optimistic , although many started with strong prejudices against such marriages ? before they worked in the schools . Two things are certain . One is that these girls have their heads bursting with a fantastic collection of usable and unusable information ? " Always hold the baby 's head while bathing him " ; " All dancing in America is not jitterbugging " ; " Men and women sometimes play poker , but it is well never to play for high stakes , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendliness and animosity in America , good and had brushes with the public " ; " Do less bowing " ; " One cent is a copper coin called a penny " ; " You can whip cream with chopsticks if you wish , but its easier with a beater " ; " Bacon ( no word for it in Japanese ) is a meat usually served at breakfast " ; " Salad is served before the meat course on the West Coast , with it . in the Middle West , and afterward in the East " ? the list goes on and on . Whether they can ever sort it out is anybody 's guess . The second certainty is intent . These girls have already picked up American phrases and American dress , many have been to brides ' schools , all pore over magazines and sit enthralled at movies , noting everything American that they possibly can adopt . Recently , on a ship here , a thoughtful youngster held her child by the hand and spoke in Japanese , so she could make herself plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " and I 'm expecting it . I 'd be afraid to go to America thinking that everything was going to be wonderful , because it may not be . But I 'm going to try as hard as I can . " All 6000 of them can be counted on to do that . When you see them leaving , you wonder if the Americans who meet them on the other side of the ocean will try a fraction as hard to help them along .
