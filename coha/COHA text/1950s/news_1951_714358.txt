txt District Attorney Alfred B. Ccncdella of Worcester declared in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court today that his story was true concerning an alleged bribe involving Attorney General Francis E. Kelly and . Judge John S. Derham of the Uxbridge District Court . He made an eloquent speech in his own defense before Chief . Justice Stanley E. Qua and then heard counsel for Mr. Derham and Mr. Kelly call him a liar and attack the story of the alleged bribe as a fabrication . Mr. Cenedella was the first to speak when final arguments in the Kelly-Cenedella-Derham investigation started at 9:30 o'clock this morning . His talk was delivered with obviously deep emotion and consisted mainly ' in a defense of his action in not initiating a probe into the alleged bribe when he first heard of it . Guided by Duty " In my actions as district attorney , " he declared , " I was con-. trolled only by my desire to do my duty and never once did I waver from that determination . Whatever differences of opinion that may have existed with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no corrupt act controlled my mind or judgment . I reiterate , if friendship had controlled my actions at any time the world would never have known what John Derham told me on the morning of Aug , 8 , 1950 . " Attorney Edward Flynn was equally eloquent in pleading the defense of Judge Derham . He ridiculed the idea of any alleged conversation ever having taken place between Mr. Cenedella and Judge Derham in which the judge would have displayed a roll of bills , as Mr. Cenedella claimed he did , and then averred that he was taking them to Boston " to pay Frankie Kelly " for help in settling Ceteetiella Backed In summing up the testimony in the case , Attorney Arthur E. Whittemore asserted that " evidence shows that the ( bribe ) statement was made . " There is proof of this , Mr. Whittemore contended , " in the guilty reaction of the parties principally concerned when the announcement of the statement was made . " He also contended it to be unlikely that Mr. Cenedella is not telling the truth and pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No good reason for lying by Mr. Cenedella has been shown or suggested . " " In all matters concerning the Waucantuck case , Mr. ? Whittemore added , " the word of Judge Derham has been proved to be unreliable . " Edmund O'Callaghan also attacked the credibility of Mr. Cendella 's story of an alleged conversation with Judge Derham concerning a bribe . He called it " highly unlikely . . unbelievable . " Mr. O'Callaghan also defended the action of Mr. Kelly in dispatching assistants to supervise the office of District Attorney Cendella in Worcester last summer shortly after the latter had revealed his bribe story and asserted the attorney general 's action in this respect did not evidence any consciousness of guilt . He said it was . one of several things which the attorney general did at the time in " righteous anger " over Mr. Cendella 's story of the alleged bribe involving hint . Missing Documents In making his attack on me credibility of Mr. Cenedella 's story of the alleged bribe , Mr. O'Callaghan asserted that the district attorney had a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident before the Legislature and the supreme court but that he did not have as good a memory in recalling other aspects of the case . He also made much of the fact that several documents and papers were missing from the Department of Public Works file on the so-called Waucantuck ( Uxbridge ) land-damage case . He asserted that instead of indicating an attempt to cover up conspiracy the fact that papers were missing would indicate an entirely reverse situation . " If there was any attempt to cover up anything in this case , " said Mr. Kelly 's counsel , " nothing would have been allowed to get out of order in this case . " In this lengthy defense of Judge Derham , 41r . Flynn discounted the fact that Judge Derham could not remember what he did with the sum of $1,000 which he withdrew from the Blackstone National Bank on Aug. 7 , 1950 , the day before the alleged meeting between Mr. Derham and Mr. Cenedella is said to have taken place . Flynn Statement " Sure he withdrew $1,000 from the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he ca n't remember what he did with it . " Mr. Flynn also asserted that it should not be surprising if his client spent S500 of the $1,000 at the race track and  --  then could not remember whether he won or lost . While admitting that Judge Derham 's recollection of the $1,000 was faulty , he said such a situation is not beyond the realm of possibility or probability . At the start of his talk , Mr. Cenedella said : " I deem it improper that I should attack any of the other parties in this matter even though by doing so I could advance my own case . " At one point during his argument Justice Qua broke in to remark that the conduct of Mr. Cenedella , Mr. Kelly . or Judge Derham as public officials is not under question except as it involves any actions which would make them unfit to act as a member of the bar and , thereby , to serve as an officer of the court . The ? justice emphasized , however , that accepting a bribe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a member of the bar . Derham counsel presents summation of hearing : Page 2.
