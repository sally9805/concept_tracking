ONLY A SHORT while ago people were asking whether the cold war was ending . Now , impressed by recent events in Hungary and the Middle East , they are wondering whether it has started again . Both questions are prompted by illusions . There has been a cold war of varying intensity between Russia and the West ever since the Bolshevik Revolution ; there has been , on both sides , suspicion and hostility so deep , as to give a quite special character to relations between them . This cold war has been through several phases , , but it was never ended since it began  --  and , is not likely to end fOr a long time to come . It is also unlikely , for reasons I shall discusS in , a moment , to be more dangerous to peaCe in the future than in the past . We have misunderstood the danger of communism ; we have been too much inclined to treat it as a danger of war , and have therefore , whenever that danger has seemed to lessen , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the end of the war until Stalin 's death people used to say that Communist Russia aimed at dominating the world . Had not Marx and Lenin predicted the triumph of the proletariat everywhere ? Was not the Communist Party , self-styled the party of the proletariat , centered in Moscow ? Were not the Russians extending their power in many directions ? The very people who put these questions before Stalin died were asking hopefully , not long after , wards , whether there had been a change of heart in Moscow . And now , once again , their fears are stronger than their hopes . But beJOHN PLA111ENATZ , on the faculty of Nuffield College , Oxford , is r. the , authdr of German Marxism and Russian Communism and other books . December 8 , 1950 fore we make up our minds what there is to fear , and what to hope for , we shbuld look at East-West relations in long perspective . It was in Lenin 's time that the Russian Communists were keenest about world revolution . Their desire for world revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for at that time their country was obviously too weak . Had Germany gone the way of Russia , as Lenin hoped , Berlin and not Moscow would have been the center of , world communism ; this Lenin knew and accepted . The later adoption , by the Communist Party of Stalin 's doctrine that socialism could be established in backward Russia , though all the industrial West remained capitalist , was a sign that Moscow had given up , for the time being , serious hope of world revolution . Yet the Communist Party re-mained an international movement dangerous to the West , an instrument of Russian policy which could be used for purposes more immediate than promoting world revolution . Moscow has not abandoned the doctrine that the world will go Communist , but there is a vast difference between holding firmly to an article of faith and making it the heart and center of all policy . MOSCOW , no doubt , is now more puffed up with pride than it was in Lenin 's time . Since Stalin 's consolidation of power , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though recent events have confused Moscow , putting it in two minds how it should act , its desire for hegemony within the Communist camp is probably as strong as ever . Yet this desire was always tempered by common sense . Even Stalin never treated the Chinese Communists as he did his European satellites , and Moscow 's influence in Peking has been the greater for this self-restraint . And Stalin never used force against Tito , though there was little chance that the West would have intervened . We can explain everything that Russia has done since 1944 to shock and frighten us without assuming that she is actively engaged in trying to make the whole world Cornmunist . It is reasonable to suppose that she forced Communist governments on her European satellites not as part of a design for conquest but as a means of buttressing herself against the West . It is as obviously in the Kremlin 's interest to keep Germany divided as to make her Communist ; and it is easier to achieve the first of these aims than - the-  second . When Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East , it may be as much because she fears the West and wants to divide it as because she is eager to assist the triumph of communism abroad . LIKE the faithful everywhere , the Russian Communists , though powerfully affected by their faith , take some parts of it more seriously than others . What they take seriously depends on Past experience and present necessities . When we consider their behavior , we must avoid two mistakes : we must not dismiss their faith as altogether irrelevant , as a mere armory of excuses to justify policies already decided on other than doctrinal grounds ; and we must not suppose that their policies can be explained in the light of faith alone . It is to their interest to control an international movement which believes in its eventual triumph everywhere  --  and yet not to take that belief too seriously . If World communism is an end , it is very much an ultimate end , and the ultimate is usually in practice less important than the immediate . Moved as much by their experience since 1917 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Western Powers are deeply and irreconcilably hostile to them . They have created  --  so they believe , and the belief is necessary to their self-esteem ? a powerful " Socialist " economy which is essentially superior to the " capitalist " West 's , and must therefore seem dangerous to the classes that dominate Western society . These classes , in their own interest , must desire the collapse of the Russian system . They desired it in Hitler 's time , as their feebleness towards him proved , and they still desire it . THIS does not mean that the Russians suspect us of a serious intention of destroying their system by war , though they once may have done so . They must reason about us as we do about them , giving us credit for seeing that modern war has become too destructive to be used as an instrument of policy directly against a Great Power . But they still see us as implacable if cautious enemies . They still see their country exposed to the hostility of powers as strong as , or stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it their duty to play these powers off against one another and to use against them the peoples of Asia and Africa who , for one reason or another , mistrust or hate the West . The Russian Communists have sought to justify all their domestic policies as parts of a gigantic and heroic enterprise calling for great sacrifices from every section of a people surrounded by enemies . Psychologically , the Soviet Union , even in time of peace , has many of the characteristics of a nation at war . Even the political vocabulary of communism owes more to Clausewitz than to Locke or Rousseau . Yet the Bolsheviks- have never delighted in actual war as the Nazis did and as the Fascists pretended to do . In their anxiety to placate ' Hitler they were every bit as feeble and silly as the British and the French . If they were ruthless in the years just after the war , it was because Hitler 's invasion had badly shaken them ; they wanted to make immediate provision for future security and quickly to restore a shattered economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to take advantage of their opportunities in a chaotic , war-weary world . Today they feel much stronger , much nearer , equlity with the West . Yet they are , at bottom , just as much afraid of a major war as we are , havingas much to lose by it as we have . Therefore they probably want to continue using against us the old , tried methods ? methods designed not to prepare for war but to keep us confused and divided . These methods can , of course , also serve to spread communism . They have already been used for both purposes : for the first in China , and for the second in Europe and the Middle East . These two purposes sustain one another : the spread of communism helps to divide and confuse the West , and the more the West is divided , the easier the spread of communism . But that does not mean that the Russians are seriously engaged in a vast conspiracy to make , the whole world Communist . There is a great difference between helping local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to do the same thing in countries like the United States or Great Britain , or even France . If all the world except the Americas , Australasia and Western Europe were to go Communist , the West would still , for a long time to come , be richer than Russia and her allies , and militarily no less formidable . It would still be as suicidal for Russia to attack the West as for the West to attack Russia . If recent history has shown how easily the Communists can get power in underdeveloped countries , it has also shown how strong is the resistance to them wherever there is a large middle class and the workers are literate . This is presumably as well understood in Moscow as in Washington or London . Moscow will do what it can , without any scruple , to destroy our influence in Asia and Africa , and to increase its own ; it will be deterred only by the danger of precipitating a major war . It will also try to make trouble for the West in the West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must now be small indeed . It is , however , in Moscow 's interest that these hopes should remain alive in the breasts of Western Communists . By their repression in Hungary the Russians offend all Europe , and by their threats in the Middle East  --  which are more bark than bite  --  they woo Asia . They thereby show how much more they hope from Asia than from Europe . THE regime in Russia is milder than it was . The masses are no longer so illiterate and are perhaps more easily led than driven . The terrible methods used to collectivize the peasants , or to remove " unreliable " nations and classes to the remoter parts of the Soviet Union , or to make good at frantic speed the ruin caused by war , are no longer as much needed as they were . Already before Stalin died , it was less profitable than it had been to use slave labor ; and since his death , Communists in high places are less exposed to the caprice of insane suspicion . But if the regime is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent that it is changing , there is no sign that it is moving towards democracy and freedom as the West understands the terms . The Russians are not coming closer to us , politically and morally , merely by making a smaller use of practices we find detestable. - It is likely that Moscow will dela more gently with its satellites than it has done in the past . The better it treats them , the greater its pres-tige among neutrals . Condemning oppression in others , Moscow stands to lose more than it gains by imi-tating what it condemns , unless it can find no other way of defending interests . nterests . However much Com-munists outside Russia may want independence of Moscow , they all share certain attitudes and ambitions . As long as Moscow does not make enemies of them by asking for more than they are prepared to give , it can rely on them for many purposes  --  an , d never more so than in its conflicts with the West . Tito has proved that Communists , when they cease to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without becoming any the less Communist . There is , of course , the danger that local Communists , when they try to make themselves less dependent on Moscow , may find themselves swept out of power by popular movements ton strong for them to control . How great this danger can be has been proved by recent events in Hungary . In the last few weeks , Russian policy towards the satellites has been an odd mixture of concession , threats and brutalities . There have clearly been differences of opinion in the Kremlin about what should be done . The advantages and the dangers of allowing greater autonomy to the satellites have no doubt been hotly debated . No ' one can foretell the issue . But my opinion is that the advocates of greater mildness will win in the end . IT IS in the interest of Moscow to prevent by all means in its power , even by force , the destruction of a Communist government . But Moscow has seen how odious to their subjects Communists are when they are mere tools of the foreigner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own country by defying Moscow , anxious to make his peace with Moscow as soon as he could do so without loss of self-respect . If Moscow could put relations with former satellites on a footing that satisfied Tito , he might even return to the fold ; and if he did , the influence of Moscow over the " uncommitted " nations might be even greater . There would still be an international Communist movement ; Communists in non-Communist countries would still be loyal to that movement rather than to their own countries ; and Moscow could still use , perhaps more effectively than in the past , the subversive December 8 , 1956 St Louis Post-Dispatch methods dangerous to democracy and to friendly relations between the West and the peoples of Asia and Africa . The Communists have never felt as the Nazis and Fascists did about international , organizations . They find the United Nations useful as an insurance against war and as a place where they can play one power off against another and influence world opinion . They want to keep the peace and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance of this order , which was as much their object in Stalin 's time as it is now , has always seemed to them compatible with the unscrupulous use of the international movement they control . They have always been  --  and probably still are ? at once pacific and subversive . Their pacificism is as sincere as their subversion , for their methods are as effective in a world at peace as in a world at war . And another world war would destroy everything , even communism . All these arguments depend on one assumption : that Moscow still looks upon the West as having , by historical necessity , interests irreconcilable with its own . This assumption is based on Marxist doctrine . Now , the Russians have already discarded several doctrines as essentially Marxist as this . Why , then , should we suppose this doctrine more sacred and less vulnerable than the others ? The truth is that we suppose no such thing . For when the Communists abandoned other and equally essential Marxist doctrines , they did so not out of respect for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their behavior , even to themselves . Unless they had decided ( though the decision made nonsense of Marxism ) that they could make backward Russia Socialist while all the more advanced countries remained capitalist , they would have had no excuse for retaining power . They were unwilling to say : " The world revolution which was to have justified our otherwise premature October Revolution has not happened and is not likely to happen for years to come . We have miscalculated and it remains for us , as honest Marxists , to give up the power we can not use for the purpose which alone could justify our having it . " Instead , they kept their hold on Russia and adopted the Stalinist formula of " socialism in one country . " - THE RUSSIAN Communists have never thought out Marxism anew in the light of their experiences since they took power . They have merely neglected or reinterpreted those parts of it which stood too obviously in the Way of their , dOing whatever they felt they had to do to remain masters of Russia or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still need an orthodoxy to justify - themselves to themselves and to the world , and also as a means of discipline . They have nothing to gain by ceasing to believe that Communist countries are " proletarian " and Western countries " bourgeois , " and that the interests of the two are not to be reconciled . On the contrary , these false beliefs are necessary to them . They serve to excuse what they have done in the past , to justify the methods they must still use to retain their internal monopoly of power , to hold the " people 's democracies " together and to keep the Communists in non-Communist countries loyal . These beliefs may indeed eventually go the way of the others , as Moscow 's current profession of belief in " peaceful coexistence " would seem to indicate . But there is as yet no substadtial evidence that Moscow is preparing to jettison yet an other orthodoxy . ' 493 What is now happening in the Middle East and in Hungary could have at least one good effect . Perhaps it will persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that relations between Moscow and the West will probably continue , for years to come , much what they have been since the war . To conclude that they will so continue is not , I think , pessimistic ; for they have never been as bad as theserecent optimists , in the earlier period of their no less facile pessimism , tried to make them out . Our task  --  thank goodness  --  is not to prepare for an inevitable hot *ar , which the Russians are as eager as we are to avoid ; it is rather to win a cold war which has never ceased since it began . We can win it only by making the non-Communist part of the world immune to communism . As this is not primarily a task for the soldiers , we must take care not to be too much influenced by them . It is good for the West and the Communists to understand that they are not as immediately and catastrophically dangerous to one another as both have been too often inclined to think . But it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists want peace as much as we do , they are not a serious danger to us.
