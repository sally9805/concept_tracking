11 6,1111 T L Highborn Kinsmen A Story by Anne Goodwin Winslow Drawings by Sandra Roome T HE letter was not addressed to anyone , which kept it from seeming like a letter in the first place , and since its opening sentence was a quotation from Shakespeare , the idea of there being anything private about it did not enter Mrs. Richards ' mind . ? 0 my soul 's joy ! If after every tempest come such calms  --  she read , and was going innocently on as one who reads a school composition when she noticed her husband 's name near the bottom of the page and began , no longer innocently , to read as one who wants to know what something is about . There were four pages , in Carlotta 's beautiful handwriting , and when she finished them Mrs. Richards was assured beyond the shadow of a doubt that , as she had suspected , Carlotta , within the limits of her youth and inexperience , was devastated by passion . The fact  --  the accident  --  of Mr. Richards ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture so far as Mrs. Richards was concerned . Any way you looked at it , Carlotta was a poor little thing . If there had ever been any doubt in her mind about the advisability of taking her out of that exotic  --  that overheated foreign atmosphere  --  there was none now ; the only question now was had they done it soon enough . She was only fifteen and had been here four months already , which ought to be soon enough to forestall most things  --  she glanced again at the letter , which was again lying where she had found it , open , on Carlotta 's table . She had not made up her mind what she was going to do about it , but with it she would most certainly do nothing . It lay there on the nice wide table with its deep drawers and its shaded lamp , beside Carlotta 's first year algebra and her third year Latin and the English composition through which she tripped so lightly ; had tripped , one might say , into this . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ; the exotic atmosphere from which she had been wrested being more favorable to other idioms ; so Mrs. Richards believed . Vienna was the focal point she had in mind ; that was where Carlotta 's family always lived when they were not living on one or another of their estates ; and she had been wrested because from all accounts Vienna was at present not only exotic but unlivable , and their estates , it seemed , were now no more ; certainly no more theirs . The accounts had been furnished by Carlotta 's father , who had been at Oxford with Mrs. Richards ' husband ; the idea being to show them that his part of the world was under existing conditions no place to bring up his daughter . 1 T WAS not the first time Mrs. Richards had been led to reflect that Oxford was at least one cohesive agency still operative in a world admitted to be falling apart . Auld acquaintance still got its dues , or at all events still claimed them , in the name of Oxford ; certainly wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on it for anything . Mrs. Richards had never seen either of her parents . Their pictures , of course  --  Carlotta 's mother in evening dress was on her bureau in a silver frame ; her father , in uniform , stood on the table with the letter . Why did the aristocracy in Europe present so little variety ? You read stories about people falling in love with photographs , and certainly in the case of Continental nobility it could just as well be by the dozen . Carlotta 's mother was supposed to be a beauty ; and in a highly classified society that might be what beauty meant  --  a sort of true-to-type business . In which case Carlotta would never qualify ; she had better just stay on over here and get the benefit of being in a place where individuality might be more esteemed ; she was intelligent like her father , and showed it . But there again ? the photographer had managed to keep her father from showing anything  --  except the uniform , of course . The benefit of being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Richards  --  had begun for Carlotta the moment she got where Mrs. Richards could see her , and in the four months that had passed since then there had hardly been an hour when more conformity either as to appearance or behavior could have improved Carlotta in her eyes . Naturally it would take more time to fit her in socially  --  which for the present would be mainly school  --  than if she had been already cut and measured ; but , even so , the danger , it seemed to Mrs. Richards , lay in fitting her too soon . She looked around the room she had refurnished those four months ago with Carlotta in view . How perfectly it had seemed to suit her from the moment she came into it and put her hat down on the bed ! It was not a fluffy room ; it was serene and a little serious , and beautifully lighted , both by day and night . Carlotta had noticed it immediately  --  with all the things she had had to notice  --  on the long way there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first American house I ever came into , not counting hotels , to be like this ! " she said  --  serene and serious and beautifully lighted , though just then a little pale . The American house thus favorably passed on was in one of the quietest sections of a large and noisy Southern town . To say it had been there longer than most of the houses in that or any other section , did not make it very old except in a sense that was very regional . It had been built by Mrs. Richards ' great-grandfather . She enjoyed saying it , however , and often did , though she did not do so now . What would a mere great-grandfather be to Carlotta ? " I want you to be very happy in it , " she said instead , very happy herself in the reflection that her great-grandfather , though she did not mention him , should have made it so easily possible to take Carlotta in ; opening her doors like this to a storm-driven child seemed the most natural thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shipwrecked ; the beauty and splendor of her long past gone down , she was being taken aboard the modest but highly seaworthy vessel set afloat by the unmentioned great-grandfather  --  who had really been distinguished in other ways besides . To some of those Mrs. Richards felt indebted too , in this consciousness of handing on what had been entrusted to her ; she was especially grateful for the ability to understand things . Four months ago she thought she did . c ARLorrA 's social adjustments had turned out to be remarkably simple ; one was led to question whether they had ever been made at all  --  or what there could be so important about them if they had just been skipped . One thing Mrs. Richards noticed was how little the subject of likes and dislikes , or even preferences , among the youths and maidens she saw most , was apt to hold Carlotta . " I do like them , really , " she would say . Them ; not even the distinction of the singular number . " Not all of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be liked . " " You think I do n't notice enough ? " " I think it would be more interesting if you had to  --  if they did something to make you ; pulling your hair , for instance . " " I expect you think they do n't notice me enough , " Carlotta said , smiling . It did not matter either way . She was not indifferent , though ; she did notice ; she was vividly interested in almost everything ; only emotionally detached . Four months ago , that was  --  or say three and a half . " I 'm going to drive her down and show her the plantation , " Gilbert said . " I 'm going to fool her ; I 'm going to tell her it 's an estate . " Nobody lived on the plantation now except the manager . What would Carlotta make of it , especially at this time of year , with the cotton stalks and the mule barns and the mud ? What sort of a past could she construct for Gilbert from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to quote figures to her before she could understand  --  even if she understood then . It was when they came back from this expedition that Mrs. Richards began to realize how many things Carlotta did understand . Differences , shadings  --  the whole table of distinctions , even the ones they considered local  --  were as plain to her as if she had learned them in childhood  --  as if she had never had to learn them at all . " She wanted to see everything , " Gilbert said . The picture of their day together was very clear to Mrs. Richards . If Gilbert had had a daughter  --  but daughters , she reminded herself , did not always want to see everything ; not after they were small . D 66 0 MANY of your young men go to English universities ? " Carlotta asked her the next day . Her mind was still on the plantation . " Very few , " Mrs. Richards said . " I really do n't know exactly how Gilbert happened to go . I believe it was more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money at that time , and Oxford was something nice he could buy for Gilbert . " " He liked it though , did n't he ? " " He likes everything . It did n't leave any particular impression on him  --  that I ever noticed ; it did n't change his accent . " Mrs. Richards smiled . " Was his father disappointed ? " " Because he did n't change ? Goodness , no ! Nobody in their senses ever wanted Gilbert to change . That 's the effect he has had on people ever since he was born . " She smiled again , but Carlotta did n't . " Are you going to ask me if many of our young men are like that too ? " she went on  --  to make . her smile . Carlotta was looking at her gravely . " Nobody would ever ask you that , no matter where they were from . " " That 's just it  --  no matter where they were from they would feel as if they had known Gilbert all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We used to roll out in our perambulators together ; and that is unusual too , at least over here it is . I have heard of children in Europe being destined for each other from their cradles . " " My grandmother was  --  in Poland ; my mother 's family were Polish  --  perhaps you never thought about how many places I am from myself , " Carlotta said . " Some time I will show you her picture ; she is the one I look like ; not my mother . " " Go get it now , I would love to see it ! " Mrs. Richards exclaimed . " I want to see everything you can show me . " " I would have to rummage , " Carlotta said . " I packed in such a burry . Let me tell you about her now and show you the picture later . Her life was very interesting . " " It must have been  --  from the start ; engaged in her cradle and happy ever after , I hope . " Carlotta shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing after another happened to her ; she even killed a man . " " Your grandmother ? What man  --  but was n't that dreadful for him ? " " Perhaps  --  if he had time to know about it ; but for her it meant a great deal that was worse than death can be for anyone . Sher was sent to prison and was on trial for her.life ; she really went through months of misery . It was a cause cahbre ; a French writer made a book about it , somebody told me ; have never seen it . I believe it did not tell the truth . " " And what was the truth ? It was not her husband  --  was it  --  the man she killed ? " " No ; her lover . Her husband  --  my mother 's father  --  was not a bad man , but she had never loved him ; nobody ever considered that . The other one  --  the man she killed  --  had been unfaithful to her after she had sacrified everything for him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlotta ? " Mrs. Richards did not go on . Surely what ? " I expect it sounds like a movie to you , " Carlotta said , " but my grandmother was as far as anything you can imagine from the Hollywood type . She was very gentle , verytr  --  s serieuse . It was just because she had loved only that one man in all her life . Everybody understood that what the lawyers said about self-defense and all the rest was only for the jury  --  so they would acquit her . And on the day she was acquitted it was like a matinee at the opera ; people have told me ; everybody was there , crying and applauding . " " And then what did she do ? " " She went home ; at least I suppose she did . That was before I was born , naturally . I never Saw my grandmother anywhere except at home , in the country . . I used to go there in the summer when I was a child . The plantation reminded me of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own summers with a grandmother in the country , asked herself after this story how great a difference it would have made in her feeling at the time and in her memories since , if she had known that her grandmother had killed somebody  --  a man  --  her lover . Hearing it when you were little  --  knowing it first and understanding it afterwards  --  made a difference , of course . Carlotta , who had grown up with the knowledge , seemed to think of it as sad more than anything else . All the same , it was an odd thing to have your grandmother do . So many things these days , with the pattern of life being perpetually shifted , made you wonder how much was only pattern after all . Conduct , important as it was , seemed to be more the product of its time and place than one was in the habit of considering it . Carlotta had evidently loved her grandmother ; she was proud of her  --  one could see that . She was right too about her resemblance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Richards not only strikingly like her but strikingly lovely . One could imagine the same movements , the same tones ; grace rather than beauty ; more grave than gay . Of course she was older when this was taken ; about thirty , would n't you say ? " Mrs. Richards was showing the photograph to Gilbert . She had told him the story  --  the " interesting " story of what the grandmother had done . " How can you tell , with nothing to go by ? " he said . " That hair  --  I suppose their styles do run sort of parallel with ours , do n't they ? " " Whether their morals do or not ? , The thing that impresses me , though , is the sort of finish about both their faces . Carlotta , right now , at fifteen , looks as completely turned out intellectually as the woman in this picture  --  a woman of thirty , say , with all that experience ! When I think of what I probably was at fifteen  --  I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert  --  me at fifteen ? " " You are almost the first thing I remember at all , I know that ; it was nearer five than fifteen , though . " " I mean the changes , darling  --  the differences in me . Carlotta makes me feel sometimes as if I have a good deal of changing still to do , to get where she is right this minute ; which is certainly not the way most of my friends affect me  --  the ones of my own age or even older . I feel positively immature lots of times by the side of Carlotta . Her ancestors did it for her , I suppose ; she is a finished product . " " Finished for what kind of life  --  in what kind of a world ? It would be tough going for her ancestors in the world we are in at present , " Gilbert said . She shook her head . " But she is tough ; that is one of the things they have done for her . Lots of fine things are tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M RS . RICHARDS had congratulated herself more than once since Carlotta came on not having invited her to call them something more intimate than Mr. and Mrs. Richards  --  as she had come near doing  --  as it seemed natural to do , with so many of their young friends calling them by their Christian names , though they had not , as far as she could remember , been invited either . She realized more and more that keeping up one or two small formalities was likely to keep things easier between them  --  they had probably been invented in the first place with some such end in view . Another thing she had made up her mind to do was to keep her part in Carlotta as much as possible separate from Gilbert 's part . She resisted whenever she could  --  whenever she could think of it in time  --  the temptation to repeat to him her conversations with Carlotta , or to ask him questions about what she said to him . Almost from the beginning she had felt instinctively that there might be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to share with one another . It was a curious thing to feel this without knowing in the least what she was feeling it about , and it was particularly hard for her , with this tremendous new interest in her life , not to be able to talk about it in all its aspects , whenever she and Gilbert were alone . She felt as if something priceless had been given to her with a mysterious penalty attached to it . It was almost as if Carlotta were a time-bomb , she thought with amusement . Then one evening , about a month ago now , she had had a revelation . In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , as the Bible says , she saw something that she could no doubt have seen a good deal sooner if she had known in the least what she was looking for . It had probably been staring her in the face on many previous evenings while she sat there crocheting on her strips for the afghan she had nearly finished and mulling over her problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening she suddenly did . Gilbert , as usual , had been catching up on his newspapers , and Carlotta , also as usual , had come in to ask him something about her algebra , which was the only one of her studies she ever needed any help in . That was the setting for the revelation  --  Gilbert , his eyes on the book , explaining away that the ratio of any value of A to the corresponding value of B  --  or whatever it was  --  and Carlotta , her eyes on his face , listening . Only this time it was as plain as day , from Carlotta 's transfigured expression , that what she was hearing was not algebra but the song of songs . Mrs. Richards , wondering why she had not seen it sooner , began suddenly to wonder what she could do to keep Gilbert from seeing it now . " Was that the telephone , Gilbert ? " she demanded frantically  --  absurdly  --  at least it was better than throwing the afghan over his head . MAGAZINE T HAT was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew already , or how long she had known it , was of course another matter . Gilbert , presumably still wallowing in ignorance , must at any cost be left to wallow . She had tried to imagine the probability of enlightenment having reached him in some manner of which she was not aware ; and now she tried again to calculate the chances of Carlotta 's having written other letters before the one she had left on her table . It was impossible to do it  --  as impossible as to imagine this one ever coming into his hands . There was an elusive quality about the whole experience that made it difficult for her to hold it in relation to her waking life ; it seemed appropriate only to a dream . It was not a dream though ; the revelation had at least taught her what to look for , even if she did not always know the significance of what she found . Finding that Carlotta , under all the serenity , was sometimes acutely unhappy could not surprise her , and reflecting that unhappiness can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , it had seemed safe at least to try the subject out a little . " ? Because you know Gilbert promised your father to tell him right away if you were the least hit homesick ; or if there were things about America you did n't like  --  which of course there are bound to be , at least until you get used to them . He wants you to feel free to come home for any reason at all . " Watching Carlotta while she made her this little speech , she had been almost startled to see her turn so pale . " But I tell him all the time  --  and my mother too ! I do n't know what I 'd do if they made me go back , " she said . " In that case I am sure there is no danger ; so we are all right on both sides . " Mrs. Richards smiled reassuringly . " What made you think of it  --  what gave you the idea there was anything the matter ? " A wave of color had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guilty conscience , I suppose . I have been thinking that , with you here , we ought to try to be younger ourselves ; we ought to play more , now that we have you to play with us . We are terribly stodgy ; you know we are . I want us to be gay . " She said it gaily , but Carlotta did not smile . HIGHBORN " The thing I like the best , " she said in her grave voice , " is the way you never do anything to make me feel as if I have not been here always ; as if I could ever go away . " The earnestness with which she said it should have been enough , Mrs. Richards thought , even with no other key to the situation , to show her there was something very unusual in Carlotta 's state of mind . ... I asked only to be near you  --  near enough to see you smile  --  to hear you speak . In my heart I believe I shall never be anything but near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for me now , but then it would still be your shadow falling on it . . . . Not bad for fifteen , Mrs. Richards reflected ; at first she had even thought it a good deal too good ; but now , putting everything together  --  recalling a lot of things she had forgotten  --  it began to seem less like English composition than she thought it did ; it began to seem exactly like Carlotta . But the point was should Carlotta be like that ? L6 ow would you like to go with me to look at some old bricks I am thinking of buying for a wall around the garden ? " she asked her when she came home from school that afternoon . " It is such a pretty day  --  we both ought to be out in it . " " I would love it , " Carlotta said . " What kind of a wall ? " She looked out at the garden , which had only a hedge around it now ? " Why do you buy them old ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not in the end ; by the time you work over them the way you have to , they really cost a good deal more . They just look so much better ; in an old place like this new bricks would be dreadful ; you could see them for miles . Gilbert says I always get things for my ancestors anyway and not for me . " Mrs. Richards smiled . " He does n't mean the useful things  --  egg beaters and aluminum ware and things like that . He does n't mean the automobile either , but all the same , it is n't too far to walk , and I do like the ancestors ' legs . It 's an old house that used to be in the country ; they 're pulling it down to make room for more city . I will tell you as we go along about the people who used to live there ; the Beaumonts . " She had forgotten it was such a melancholy story ; and yet , talking to Carlotta , one was always tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her face , with its quick changes , drew one on . " Has anybody ever written it  --  in a book , I mean ? " Carlotta asked her . They had turned in between the broken gateposts by that time and were sitting in an arbor on what used to be the lawn , where little blue hyacinths were already blooming in the grass . The house with its eyeless windows and abandoned doorways was before them , and though the menacing city was as yet too far to break the peace of the spring afternoon , it seemed more desolate , Mrs. Richards thought , on that very account . " And yet it 's been a long time , has n't it , since you had a war ? " Carlotta asked . " Almost a hundred years . This poor old place has gone down under ' improvements ' , " Mrs. Richards said . " I do n't suppose you know which room it was that the girl was sick in , do you ? " Mrs. Richards shook her head . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in almost every room someone had died . The youngest daughter had been the only one of all the family to survive . " And what became of her ? " Carlotta asked . Mrs. Richards tried to think of what , if anything , had become of Anabel Beaumont . " What does become of people ? " she said . " We always ask that question  --  I. asked you the same thing about your grandmother , you remember , and you said she went home ? . That is what the little boy said when somebody asked him what he would do if the end of the world came-1 would go home . ' In one way or another I believe that is what we all do , when the end comes . " C ARLOTTA thought this over . " And then I suppose the question comes up  --  where is home ? Does it always have to be the place we started from ? ? I do n't mean the actual place , of course ? " " I know , " Mrs. Richards said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought about it a good deal . It seems to me that is where our ancestors come in ; we go to the place they have prepared for us , so to speak . I. do n't mean actually , either ; I mean we fall back on ourselves  --  on what they have made us ? " Carlotta was silent . " Gilbert always laughs at me about my ancestors  --  you have heard him . He says I find more use for them than anybody he ever saw . I ask him how lie managed to get rid of his . Ancestors are one thing we have to have whether we want them or not , I tell him . As somebody said ? It was thus the amoeba rose to greatness . ' " " You mean we have to do what they did , whether we want to or not ? " Mrs. Richards shook her head . " Not what they did ; I believe that what business changes more than anything ; it 's more a question of how ; it is what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to us  --  like sealed instructions ; tremendously important , too . I always tell Gilbert I depend on my ancestors for doing the best I can  --  for not giving up . I believe if we could go back  --  if . we could realize what it probably cost them to do as well as they did , or even sometimes no worse than they did  --  if we could see them managing to go on lots of times when there did n't seem to be anything left to go on for  --  after the most terrible sorrows  --  the most terrible sins even ? " she paused . " It seems to me sometimes that every one of us in a way has a right to call himself nobly born . Though as far as I am concerned , I would hesitate to call myself anything  --  I have been put to so little in the way of a test . " Carlotta was looking at her intently . " I have never known anyone before who was happy like that , " she said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if they were , some of the time , they were always afraid it would not last . I wonder if you feel that way about love too ? " The color was rising in her face : she took her eyes away . Mrs. Richards hesitated ; she had not meant to talk about her own experience . But after all " You mean do I feel that way about Gilbert ? Why should n't I  --  the way we have loved each other all our lives ? I would just as soon think of worrying for fear the sun , might not come up some morning . No ? " she shook her head ? " whatever I found to worry over , it could not be that . I used to think sometimes I might be unhappy over not having children  --  which is one trouble my ancestors did n't have , or I should n't be here , I suppose . " She smiled . " Seriously though , I really have been happy . ? Dear child ! " she exclaimed , " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough for all of us ! You say there is nothing left for you any more in your own country  --  which . I do not believe  --  but even so , I would rather have you find your HIGHBORN happiness here ; I want you to let me see you being happy ? " " There is nothing here for me either , " Carlotta said in a low voice . " It seemed at first ? but that is already long ago ; I have been in a dream . I am awake now ; I know that for me the world is empty . " " Then we must find something beautiful to fill it with . Think of the years you have ? " " It is when I do that , that my heart breaks , " Carlotta said in the same low tones . " That girl you told me about  --  that Anabel  --  did she think about the years ahead of her , do you suppose  --  do you suppose she saw this ? " Her eyes were on the desolate house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did ! " Mrs. Richards exclaimed . " Little as I know about her , I am sure of that . It was long after Anabel 's time that the neighborhood began to go down . She was probably a beauty and a belle right there in that very house . And I was certainly an idiot to bring you here in the first place . Come  --  let 's go home , where we have something cheerful to look at ? . " She put her arm around Carlotta and drew her to her feet . What if she told her she did not want to go  --  that , for her , home was the waste land more than anywhere ? AS she had bad news or something ? " Gilbert asked that evening when Carlotta did not come to dinner . " She may have caught cold ; I expect we sat too long in that damp summer house , " Mrs. Richards said . " How were your bricks , by the way ? " " Beautiful ; the loveliest shade of pink ! " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ate their dinner  --  just the two of them  --  the way it used to be before Carlotta came . And all the while she could hear herself saying something else : " The child has fallen in love with you , Gilbert ; we will have to send her back . " He would not believe it , of course ; not unless he got the letter ; but suppose he did  --  suppose everything : that he got the letter , that he believed it , and that they did send Carlotta back ? what sort of end did that make to anything ? As far as she and Gilbert were concerned , they Would be back just where they were before  --  she looked at him sitting there at his end of the table , and at Carlotta 's empty place . ' What would they see there instead of Carlotta , after they had sent her home  --  back to a family where the women had always been unhappy , and had probably done all sorts of things besides the one her grandmother had done ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances , run the risks  --  to trust the quality in a human being as one would trust it in a metal , or a gem ? . The difficulty of this course , she realized in the days that followed , was that she would have to do her trusting so alone  --  without letting anyone even suspect she was doing it ; she could not tell Carlotta she was trusting her , nor ask Gilbert if she ought to  --  and how far . More and more it began to seem to her as if she ought n't  --  except for the fact that she saw less and less what she could do instead . It occurred to her that it might even be a relief if Gilbert got the letter  --  so he would know everything she knew and be able to advise her . If only Carlotta would behave more the way a moonstruck girl is supposed to do  --  if she would just come right out and pine in the open , so to speak , instead of going on exactly the same  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Richards thought , if she stopped trying not to change . " You say she is n't homesick ; but are you sure ? " Gilbert asked her . " Have you noticed her writing very much to anybody over there ? " " Very little  --  besides the regular letters to her family ; it is n't anybody over there  --  at least I ? " " And you have n't noticed anything over here  --  anything like one of those school crushes , for instance ? " She shook her head . " Well , naturally I do n't want to act as if I noticed anything , " Gilbert said . His efforts not to notice anything were unceasing . Mrs. Richards wondered sometimes how much he really managed not to see . Did he notice that Carlotta never looked at him these days ? He had always had that way of smiling at people , and Carlotta 's face had always caught it like a light ; it was really one smile for both of them . Did he notice that her face caught nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look anywhere rather than at him . " You do n't suppose it could be her schoolwork , " he suggested . " She does n't ever want me to help her any more , but I notice she keeps her light on mighty late . " Mrs. Richards , who bad noticed the light without thinking of the school work , said it might be a good idea to take Carlotta for a little vacation somewhere . " I could run down to the Gulf with her for a week or two , " she said , still not thinking of the schoolwork but wondering all the same why the idea had not occurred to her before . Carlotta would probably want to wait for the Easter vacation , but it would be better to do it right away . She would propose it : to her that afternoon when she got home from school  --  Tuesday  --  she always got home earlier on Tuesday ? . F OR some reason , however , on this particular Tuesday instead of being early Carlotta was late ; later than she ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was another thing she was very thoughtful about ? " Was there anything you wanted me for this afternoon ? I may be a little late ? . " She tried to remember whether she had said anything that morning when she went out the door  --  whether she had looked back and waved her hand or thrown a kiss , as she was sure to do when she turned down the street ? . What had she been thinking about , that morning when Carlotta left ? She could n't even remember what dress she had on ? . Suddenly , with no reason in the world , she heard herself trying to tell somebody how Carlotta was dressed  --  a gray wool skirt  --  one of those pleated skirts , as I remember  --  and no hat ? . She looked at the clock again , and went to the telephone . Carlotta , however she was dressed , ought to have been back more than an hour ago . Checking on anything that might have happened at school after school is over is not like turning back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in reverse . An empty schoolhouse , Mrs. Richards decided , must surely be the emptiest thing on earth . The history teacher , finally run to earth , seemed to remember that Carlotta had missed her afternoon class . One of the girls had said her head was hurting her  --  she thought she had gone home ? . Hanging the receiver back , she began automatically , to reach for the keys to her car . She must find somebody who could tell her more than that . First , though , she would look in Carlotta 's room  --  in her closet  --  a gray pleated skirt ? . Behave yourself , she admonished the woman who kept saying that . Carlotta 's room was always neatness itself ; the door , always open , seemed an invitation to come in and see . She was the only girl in the world , Mrs. Richards told her , who did n't even make a dent . This time , however , she wanted to find one  --  find a sign of some kind  --  not a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing pad , but something --  . She went over to the closet ; she would get that gray skirt off of her mind ? . The closet was perfect too ; everything in place ; the hats on their little trees , the shoes paired neatly on their rack ; all her pretty leather things  --  the rug-roll , the twin Thermos , the fitted dressing case that looked , she told Carlotta , like some traveler 's dream . It was a Vienna shopkeeper 's dream , Carlotta said ; it was her mother 's going-away present . She was putting some of the fittings on her toilet table ? the little flat clock , the ivory comb and brush ? " I 'll just leave the others in , " she said . Mrs. Richards suddenly remembered something she had noticed among the others . Carlotta would have no use for the mother-of-pearl opera glasses with the lorgnon handle , she had told her ; they would have to wait for an opera ; and the little mother-of-pearl revolver  --  a bit of war chic Carlotta called it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She picked up the dressing case and put it on a chair . It was not locked , but her hands shook so she could hardly open it ; she knew already without doing it that the revolver would be gone . H ER knees were shaking now , but by the time she got Gilbert on the telephone she found she could control her voice . The thing that worried her  --  she heard herself lying smoothly along  --  was not imagining anything had happened ; she was only wondering why nobody had let her know ? . " Let you know that nothing has ? " Gilbert said . She could see him smile . " Well , anyhow , I want to let you know  --  in case I do n't get back by dinner time , " she said . " I 've got to run down those silly girls  --  that history class . " " They 'll all be at the movies , wo n't they ? What time is it ? " She could see him look . " Ca n't you give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver . 0 God , why had n't she told him ! What would she have to HIGHBORN KINSMEN tell him now  --  when she came back without Carlotta  --  without having found out anything ? What good would it do to ask anybody where Carlotta went ? Again she was reaching for the keys to her car . It did not take as long , however , to work through these futilities as she had thought it would . When she did come back without Carlotta , and certainly without having found out very much , it was not yet dinner time and Gilbert had not come . So , having already waited too long , she would have to wait some more  --  only a matter of minutes this time , however ? . There were minutes she seemed never able to remember clearly . It seemed to her she heard Gilbert 's voice before anything else  --  before she heard the car , even . He was on the porch talking to somebody ; then she saw the door opening , and there they were in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telling her that there they were ? . You were dead wrong about her being at the movies , " he said , when Carlotta without saying anything had gone on to her room . " Where was she  --  how did you find her  --  is she all right ? " She was searching his face for more than he could tell her . " She was out at the Beaumont place . I do n't know what made me think of it ; I just did . I remember you said something about its having sort of gotten her down  --  not that that was any reason for her going back ; rather the opposite . Anyhow , there she was . " " What was she doing , Gilbert ? Are you sure she is all right ? " " All right to go out there , do you mean ? " He was smiling at her . " It 's certainly the last thing I would want to do  --  pink brick or no pink brick ; she was just sitting in the summer house some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be rather glad to see me , for a change . " Carlotta did not keep her lights on late that night ; she did not turn them.on at all , When Mrs. Richards called her , - very softly , to her dinner , she was already sound asleep . . . . T HEY were sitting on the sand under a live oak with their feet in the Gulf of Mexico when they mentioned for the first time anything that had happened on what they both called that last day . " I could n't see why you wanted to go back there by yourself  --  without even telling me , " Mrs. Richards said . " Maybe I went to find you ; anyhow , you were there , " Carlotta told her now . " I had to decide something  --  at least I thought I did . It was remembering some of the things we talked about , there in the summer house , that made me realize  --  it was what you said about the past  --  you remember ? ? The past was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on  --  one thing that never ? " " That never lets you down ? ? as we say ? " Carlotta nodded . " I was thinking about that when I suddenly began to feel better . I am all right now , " she said , and added , " I wonder if you are still going to build your wall ? " " I think I Richards said .
