Reporters began to line up a full hour and a half before the start of President Eisenhower 's first press conference last week ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . In all , 294 newsmen were on hand , including Tass Correspondent Mikhail Fedorov . The crowd was so big that only newsmen with White House press cards were admitted , thus closing the conference to editors , publishers and other visiting firemen who may have hoped to get in . <P> When the President arrived , he was accompanied only by Press Aides Jim Hagerty and Murray Snyder , in place of the large Government staff who regularly attended Truman 's press conferences . He took his place behind the desk in the front of the room and briefly posed for the photographers ; then he clasped his hands behind his back and began talking . <P> On Stage . His first subject was one that has been bothering Washington newsmen : his own relations with the press . Newsmen had begun to worry that they would be kept at arm 's length by the Administration after Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and otherwise let the impression grow that the press would have to depend on official announcements . <P> One of the topics that have been made interesting subjects of speculation for the past few months , said the President , was the thought that he had developed a good deal of antagonism toward the press . He did n't know why people felt he had any hostility toward newsmen . He had been dealing with the press for years , and had found nothing but a desire to dig at the truth , and the press had been open and forthright about it . This is the kind of relationship , the President said , that he and the press are going to continue . Then for 16 minutes Ike delivered some crisp statements , covering five main subjects , announced that there would be some time for questions on the subjects he was discussing when he finished , but that he had to leave to keep an 11 a.m. appointment . In the 15 minutes they got , reporters managed to squeeze in 18 questions , got as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Firmness . Newsmen 's feelings were divided about Ike 's first conference . The New York Daily News headlined its editorial : REAL NICE , IKE . Others disagreed . Snapped one wire-service correspondent : " He filibustered for 20 minutes and gave us ten . " The Minneapolis Tribune editorialized that he was " pretty sharp at answering the questions he tossed to himself . " Said the Knight papers ' Ed Lahey : He was " more like the five-star general advising his staff what was going to happen at 1600 hours , and not so much like the Abilene man who tried painfully hard to be a high-minded yokel for his countrymen . " But other papers , like the Los Angeles Times , thought Ike 's firmness was just what was needed . Said the Times : At the conference he " invited the inference that policy in this Administration is not evoked by the questions of Washington correspondents . " Newshen May Craig of the Portland Press-Herald and other Maine papers , who prefers to operate at a press conference like a prosecuting attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said she , " then he dismissed us.
