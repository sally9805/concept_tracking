txt The former chief of the Federal Alcohol Tax Unit here admitted yesterday that he had solicited business for a St. Louis printing company from two New York liquor concerns while he held the office in which he exercised " complete authority " over such companies . James B. E. Olson , who resigned his $8,800-a-year job as district supervisor of the tax unit on Aug. 24 after an inquiry into his official conduct was begun , made the admission from the witness stand , in the Federal Court House before , a subcommittee of the House Ways , and Means Committee investigating administration of internal revenue laws . The 56-year-old former official said he received between $5,600 and $6,000 from the American Lithofold Company of St. Louis in 1949 and 1950 but did no work for them except to make two telephone calls to local companies . These he identified as the Jacob Ruppert brewery and Austin Nichols &; Co. , Brooklyn wine and liquor dealers , both of which subsequently ordered printing from the St. Louis company . Tells of Getting Job The witness said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revenue , were brought into the concern , the latter after he left government service , nominally as vice presidents , at the invitation of James P. Finnegan , Collector of Internal Revenue at St. Louis . They were to receive salaries of $750 monthly , Mr. Olson said , but this was later changed to a commission of 10 per cent on all business they developed . The affairs of American Lithofold also are under investigation in Washington in connection with a $565,000 Reconstruction Finance Corporation loan . William M. Boyle Jr. , chairman of the Democratic National Committee , once served as counsel for the company . The first witness sworn yesterday by Representative Cecil R. King , Democrat of California , sub // committee chairman , was Vonne V. Circele of Valley Stream , L. I. , New York area sales representative of American Lithofold . Questioned by Adrian W. De Wind , committee counsel , he said J.1 , R. Blauner , president of the company , in the fall of 1948 gave him a list of about twenty New York liquor concerns to be approached as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list had been provided by Mr. Olson , identified to him as a new vice president of the company . He was instructed to tell the prospective customers that he came under the auspices of Mr. Olson , Mr. Circele said . However , he added , Mr. Blauner implied that Mr. Olson 's connection should be kept secret from others . Tells of Conferring with Olson The witness said he conferred with Mr. Olson several times by telephone on the course of negotiations - with companies on the list , and once in person when they successfully sought Washington approval for re-design of a tax unit form that had proved difficult for American Lithofold to print in its original size . Mr. Olson , a short , stocky man with white , wavy hair and a full , florid countenance , wearing a pale blue double-breasted suit and alternately blustering and concilia7 tory , followed Mr. Circele to , the stand . He explained his failure to produce a long list . of personal and business documents subpoenaed by the committee by saying that " to the best of his recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be " another couple of weeks , " he said , before the full financial and net worth statement demanded of him would be ready . He denied having supplied the list of liquor concerns and Said he " had no recollection " of the telephone conferences on printing business with Mr. Circele . Between 1934 and 1945 , he said , he had been an official of the collector 's office in the First New York District , Brooklyn , under Mr. Nunan . In 1945 , he testified , he left Government service to accept a $25 , - 000-a-year job with the Con , andagua Wine Company " to help out where I could in public relations . " In a reorganization he obtained a 15 per cent interest in a new concern , the Wine Industries Corporation , without any capital contribution . In 1946 he organized the J. B. E. Olson Corporation to sell truck bodieb , and assumed the tax unit post in January , 1947 . " You were a partner in one company , paid well , performed very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vice president of another from which you . received $6,000 for very little effort . Then , as a public , servant , you spent only one or two hours a day in your office . " The witness protested that despite a light schedule that permitted him to " watch a ball game for a couple of hours " now and then , his " executive ability " had vastly improved efficiency of the tax unit ' here . " On the record , I 'd say you have unusual , business ability , " Mr. King remarked with irony . that was apparent to everyone but Mr. Olson . " Well , thank you , ' Mr. Chairman , " the witness ? replied . . The hearing is scheduled to be continued today .
