WE have here this week a Fresh , clean tale of business , the law , and the public  --  that vast tribe of consumers that makes business and the law the great big things they have come to be in our time . For the past year or so , an ebullient vice-president of E. H. Clark &; Co. , a firm of food brokers in San Francisco , has been us ing his Gillette razor in a fashion that sends him singing to work every morn ing . He was happy with his Gillette , but the company that manufactures that product wanted him to he even hap pier with it . Accordingly , the corn pan ) spent untold millions at the close of the summer to bring him , over tele vision and radio , the World Series ball games . The company 's campaign was a success . By the end of the Series , the man was feeling so inordinately happy with his Gillette that he sat down and wrote a letter to the com pany 's headquarters , in Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the hunch that you are inter ested in ideas , " he wrote , " and because I have had considerable enjoyment from this idea , I offer the following free of charge and without strings . Because most men like to waste a little time under a hot shower in the morn mirror installed in the shower and enjoy a fine shave with a Gillette razor each morning . Just in case it is said that the mirror would steam up  --  you may tell them that one swipe with a handful of hot water fixes that . Incidentally , this is no place for an electric razor . Several of m ) friends are now ' shower shaving ' and think it is wonderful . Hope you do , too . " Although the vice-president 's letter was addressed to the attention of the sales-promotion department , it never got there . It got to the legal depart  --  ment , where it was firmly halted . " It has long been the policy of this com  --  pany , " the legal department wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or suggestions unless and until they have been fully protected by issued patents , or at the very least by filed patent applications . In the latter case , we also require that the submission be placed on a non-confidential basis and take the form of a copy of the filed patent application without the claims . It is our further policy to refrain from considering ideas or suggestions which involve inherently unpatentable sub  --  ject matter , as , for example , subject matter regarding the advertising or sale of our products , methods of doing busi  --  ness , or the like . Since your sugges  --  tion falls into the latter category , we have not cleared your letter for consid  --  eration by the management of this com  --  pany . It will , however , be retained in the files of this office for correspondence record purposes only . Notwithstanding the foregoing , we want you to know how very much we appreciate your interest , and we particularly want to thank you for offering your idea to us gratuitously . " Buff of Buffs FIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has just wound up his first year in office with the an nouncement that there were five thou  --  sand fewer fires ' in the city in the last six months of 1954 than there were in the corresponding period of 1953 . This was an unprecedented decrease , and is to he credited , according to Mr. Cavanagh , to the unprecedented em  --  phasis his department has placed on fire prevention . We paid an anniversary call on the Commissioner in his office , high up in the Municipal Building  --  an airy , carpeted room , furnished with prints of ancient firefighting apparatus ; a framed Nick Kenny poem ( " Here 's to fire fighters all ! Always at your beck and call ! " ) ; a red-and-black chart entitled " Causes of Fire , 1955 , " which lists in alphabetical order such disparate causes as alcohol , ashes , candles , chil  --  dren , Christmas trees , fireplaces , tele  --  vision , and vapors ; a Fire Department short-wave radio receiver ; and a set of Fire Department bells . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  wave radio came a voice saying , " ... under control ... " Commissioner Cavanagh , smooth-haired , pink-checked , and wearing a gray flannel suit , a white shirt , and a dark-blue-and-gold tie , managed to look both debonair and concerned . " That radio is on all the time , " he told us . " I have another one in my official car , a third in my personal car , a fourth at home , and a fifth at my country place , in Glen Cove . I have the bells at home , too , so I know about any fire , big or lit  --  tle , as soon as it 's reported . I 've been an ardent fire huff all my life . The fact is I 'm a firefighter by nature . For three decades , we 've witnessed a terrifying upward climb in the number of fires in this city  --  over fifty thousand last year , compared to twenty-seven thousand in 1944 and fourteen thousand in 1924 . Every month , a hundred and fifty fire  --  men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireman gives his life in the line of duty ; every year , a hundred and fifty people are killed in fires . I have only one 24 MARCH 5 , 19 5 5 creed , and that is that ninety per cent of all fires are preventable . The time to stop a fire is before it starts . Do you know what our Ere-prevention program boils down to ? Good housekeeping . No rub  --  bish in the house . No improper wiring . None of this business of three or four lamps attached to one socket , with the wires running under a rug . Poor house  --  keeping is our greatest single cause of fires . Careless smoking runs it a close second . " The radio sputtered and a voice an  --  nounced a fire in an apartment house on Riverside Drive . The Commissioner picked up a telephone and asked to be notified as soon as the cause of the fire had been discovered . " I 've a feeling it was caused by careless smoking , " he said . He was plainly ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and numerous floor outlets , but we gat him off on a personal tack in  --  stead . " As a child , I lived in a house on Bedford Avenue , Brooklyn , around the corner from Engine Company 211 , " he told us . " My earliest memories are of whistles and bells , and horse-drawn en  --  gines pounding by . Thank goodness , I was burn in 1908 and am old enough to remember fire horses . I happen to have a photograph of the well-known fire horse Idaho being run over and crushed to death as a result of having fallen while pulling a fire steamer at a fast gallop in 1912 . That was the year I saw my first fire  --  the Equitable Building , one of the greatest fires we 've ever had . My father has been a fire buff all his life , too , and he carried me over from Brooklyn to watch the Equi  --  rabic burn . Somehow , my mother has never been as keen about fires as Dad is . A week or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad went out to buy a paper and darned if this twenty-story hotel did n't catch fire , and firemen came and helped Mother out of a win  --  dow and down a ladder . Dad was green with envy . What he would have given to be on that ladder , with the flames licking at him ! " The Commissioner attended schools in Brooklyn , and in 1929 graduated from Georgetown University , where he wrote a thesis on fire prevention . " Mv theme , " lie said , " was good house  --  keeping . " He went to Harvard Law School for two years , worked with his father in the real-estate business for a year , and graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1933 . After practicing law for eight years , he joined the Army Air Forces and rose to be a lieutenant colonel and Director of Intelligence for the Air Technical Service Cornmaned . In 1945 , he became counsel to the Wright Aeronautical Corporation . Two years later , he resigned to accept the post of Deputy Commissioner of Marine and Aviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he switched to Deputy Commissioner of Hospitals . He was Commissioner of Marine and Aviation from 1950 until 1953 , when Mayor Wagner , an old friend of his and well aware of his monomania , of  --  fered him his present post . The Com  --  missioner is married and has four chil  --  dren . The children take no particular interest in fires , but his wife is every  --  thing a fire buff 's wife should be , listen  --  ing to all the alarms and sometimes reaching the scene of a fire a minute or two ahead of her husband . As we were leaving the Commissioner 's office , his telephone rang . It was a report on the Riverside Drive fire . The fire was un  --  der control . The cause of the fire was careless smoking . INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE : The editors of W ha 's Who in America have decided not to include among the accomplishments of one biographer the fact that he was designated a Man of Distinction by the Lord Calvert people . Cat Story FACT with which everybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional sign of true devotion to human beings is bringing to them , and leaving with them , gruesome offerings , such as mice , rats , birds , that they have caught and killed . Even when the person so hon  --  ored knows who the cat is , he is faced with a problem that is n't easy to solve . Well , we ran into an old-fashioned artist friend of ours the other day who lives on the top floor of an old-fashioned five-story building in the southernmost part of Greenwich Village . The build  --  ing , he tells us , has long been infested by both rats and cats . The cats hold a slight edge and , conscious of their worth and function , lounge around on the stairs of the building when they 're not working , and have to he stepped over by the ten  --  ants , all of whom prefer the cats to the rats . Our friend swears he has never owned one of the cats himself and has n't even petted one or spoken to one , but somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy to him and has been hon  --  oring him , every two or three days , by toiling all the way up to the top floor during the night with the offering that might be expected and depositing it just outside his door , where he ca n't help seeing it first thing in the morning . He 's thought of trying to make all the eats hate him by kicking at them on the stairs , but he 's a gentle chap , and besides , he says , the stairways in the building are very badly lighted . He does n't know what to do . His attitude toward the matter leads us to suspect that any day now the poor fellow may be driven to abandon his studio and that loving , unknown cat . Neighborhood Affair LAST May , in our effort to keep up ff with hot developments in the financial world , we told you how the Union Dime Savings Bank 's new branch , at Madison Avenue and Thir  --  ty-ninth Street , became the first local bank ever to have wall-to-wall carpeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you how the same dynamic scion of the same venerable institution has become the first local bank ever to conduct a do-it-yourself show of pow  --  er tools for wood and metalwork right on its banking premises . Yes , that 's what we said ; the show began last Monday , and demonstrations were scheduled to go on , every banking day between the hours of twelve and two , for three weeks . We went around to the Union Dime 's branch one noontime last week , and almost the moment we felt the familiar buoyancy of the carpet under  --  foot , we heard in the distance the whir of power saw against pine , caught a faint but unmistakable whiff of saw  --  dust , and were greeted by our old friend THE NEW YORKER Walter R. Williams , Jr. , the Union Dime vice-president responsible for the carpet . " The day 's demonstration is just get  --  ting under way , " said Mr. Williams . " It 's right downstairs , in our expan  --  sion area , which we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ev  --  erybody has a shop down  --  stairs these days . Why not us ? In case you want to know what we think we 're doing , our idea is to make the bank a friendly com  --  community center in Murray Hill , and thereby bring in business . Most of our ex  --  hibitors in the show  --  American Machine &; Foundry , Johns-Manville , Patterson Brothers  --  are Murray Hill people , and although by law we are n't allowed to accept the ac  --  counts of business firms , we want to make this a neighborhood affair . Of course , there 's been a cer  --  tain amount of resistance to the project . Banking tradition of austerity , not to say stuffiness ! But public response has been gratify  --  ing  --  nearly five hundred visitors the first day . Do n't you find the sound of that saw rather stimulating in a bank ? " We said we certainly did , and Mr. Williams in  --  troduced us to Ruth F. Irish , a lively silver-haired lady who , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made all the arrange  --  ments for the do-it-your self show . " When I was lining up dem  --  onstrators , I started with American Machine &; Foundry , because they 're right upstairs in this building , " Miss Irish told us . " They were a little taken aback by the proposition at first , but after thinking it over they decided that a bank is actually the ideal place for a do-it-yourself show , because you 've got a tellers ' counter to separate the visitors from the power tools . That way , nobody gets hurt . Then I be  --  gan sounding out other companies . I 'd see a man from Johns-Manville come into the hank , and I 'd walk up to him and say , ' Want to take part in a machine-tool show , right here ? ' Well , everybody we asked wanted to take part . " Miss Irish excused herself , pushed a couple of banking papers to one side of her desk , and said to a man who was approaching it , " Oh , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plywood ? " We waved goodbye to Miss Irish and went downstairs to the expan  --  sion area , which is also carpeted from wall to wall . On the public side of the tellers ' counter , forts or fifty men and three or four ladies were standing and watching a demonstration that , accord  --  ing to a program handed us at the door , was of " Common Joinery " and was being given by John Pranter , of Your Workshop , a do-it-yourself emporium on East Seventy-fifth Street . In the safety of the tellers ' area , Mr. Pranter , a tall man with a shaggy black forelock , was making a picture frame with a De Walt power tool , explaining each operation as he performed it . In another part of the tellers ' area , a young man identifiable by the program as John F. Carluccio , of the Reynolds Metals Company , was standing , surrounded by pieces of aluminum , and waiting for his turn to perform . " You see , you mitre out a forty-five-degree angle here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lady entered the room and asked firmly , " Where do I deposit five dol  --  lars ? " A guard headed her back upstairs . Presently , Mr. Pranter finished his picture frame , and Mr. Carluccio began to construct a metal window screen , with commentary . He made the job Took easy , and when it was done , in no more than ten minutes , he announced a ques  --  tion period . " Can you hang a half screen , using those brackets ? " a man demanded . " Yes , " said Mr. Carlucci ? . " I thought you were going to show us how to make money , " a lady said . " Let 's get on to sheet stock , " said Mr. Carlucci ? , and he did . Thumb A MOPPET named Sarah , who will probably be President one day but is currently devoting herself mostly to sucking her thumb , was recently taken to the neighborhood druggist by her frantic mother , the mother hav  --  ing explained that the druggist was go  --  ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her break the habit . The druggist did the job efficiently and impressively , and by the time they left the store the mother felt pretty bad about the whole matter and proceeded to apologize , saying , " I 'm really terribly sorry I had to do this to you , Sarah , and I hope you 'll forgive me . " " Oh , that 's all right , " said Sarah . " I gave him the wrong- thumb . " Control JOSEPH HAYES , author of the hit play " The Desperate Hours " and the best-selling novel on which the play is based , and of a screenplay of the same name , already filmed and scheduled to be released next year , is a tall , lean , sandy-haired , candid , financially adroit , and perfectly happy ) ' dung man . We met Mr. Hayes last week , just before the curtain went up on a matinee of his scary play . He was where any happy playwright ought to he  --  at the back of a crowded theatre , among people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us that he had driven down from his home in Brook  --  field , Connecticut , with Marrijane , his wife , and Gregory , their nine-year-old son . " We were planning to take in the United Nations before lunch , but we got a flat on the Merritt Parkway and that held us lip , " he said . " Marrijane  --  I guess she 's the only Mary Jane in the world who spells her two names as one  --  and Greg are at Teter Pan . ' I came here because I have n't seen the show since opening night . I 'm not wor  --  ried or anything ; I just want to see if a certain emotion comes over in the first four scenes . If it does , then I know the rest of the play will he O.K. That 's how it worked out on opening night . Robert Montgomery , who directed the play , and Howard Erskine , my co-pro  --  ducer , could n't hear to watch it . They waited next door in a bar . I stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had what we 'd tried for . That-first  --  night audience was great . At the end , they even shouted ' Author ! Authorl ' " " The Desperate Hours " is Mr. Hayes ' second play an Broadway . The first , " Leaf and Bough , " was put on in 1949 and closed after three perform  --  ances . " The critics tore it apart , and they were right , " said Mr. Hayes . " I learned then that an author has to fight to keep control of his work . In ' Leaf and Bough , ' I did n't fight hard enough . Now I do . I 've got a big kick out of dis  --  covering that I could write a novel and a play end a screenplay . " He sighed with what we assumed was pure aesthetic contentment , but the content  --  ment turned out to he partly fiscal . " I had the novel all worked out in my mind and typed it in six and a half weeks , down in Florida , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terrible . Marrijane said I was wrong and mailed it to my agent . Random House read it one day and bought it the next , giving me a fifteen-hundred  --  dollar advance . Two clays later , Collier 's bought the serial rights for fif  --  teen thousand . Then a couple of book clubs took it . Now I 've got contracts for publication in every country outside the Iron Curtain , including Japan . All told , I suppose the book has brought in about seventy-five Thousand dollars . On the movie , I 've been given a down pay  --  ment of fifty thousand against a per  --  percentage of the gross take , which should bring me at least a quarter of a million , and the play , of which I 'm co-producer , should net me another hundred and fif  --  ty thousand this first year . re , being put on soon in Chicago , London , Paris , Rome , and Stockholm . It would n't surprise me if ' The Desperate Hours ' ended up being a million-dollar proper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in annuities and such , for the benefit of my family . Marrijane and I are n't going to let it change our life one hit . " Mr. Hayes was born in 1918 , in Indianapolis , which is the setting of his play . His father is in the furniture busi  --  ness there . When the younger Hayes was thirteen , he entered a Benedictine monastery in southern Indiana . " What a crazy idea ! " he said . " You know how kids are . I was supposed to he study  --  ing for the priesthood ; I was a Catholic in those days , which I 'm not now . I wrote my first play in the monastery . It ? ? was laid in Mexico , where I 'd never been . " After two years of monastic life , he returned to the world , finished high school , and started hitchhiking around the country and doing odd jobs . Later , he attended Indiana University , where he met Marrijane . They fell in love , got married , quit college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York . " I located two jobs , " Mr. Hay es said . " One in a warehouse , the other as a reader for Samuel French , the play publisher . I took the French job . One day , an accountant tossed a check on my desk . He told me it repre  --  sented six months ' royalties to a writing team that turned out plays for amateur production . I 'd never heard of the team , but the check was for twelve thousand dollars . I thought , ' Hell , I 'm on the wrong side of the desk ! ' I told Marrijane about the check , and she said , ' Let 's write a play , ' and we did . Then we wrote fifteen more  --  all do  --  mestic comedies , with family feeling . We made enough money at them so I could leave French . I 've done all kinds of writing , from short stories for slicks to TV stuff . We have a nice house in Brookfield , with our own pond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides Gregory , there 's Jason , who 's three , and Daniel , who 's ten weeks and so new . They 've all got red hair and look alike . We 've just added what we call a ' Desperate Hours ' wing to the house . It has a study in it for me , and in the study is a nine-foot-long desk that I built myself . I 've another novel half finished , and Marrijane and I are doing a humorous family book together . I 'm a very lucky guy . " The theatre went dark , the curtain rose , and Mr. Hayes stared hard at the stage . At the end of the second scene , he whispered to us , " They 're holding . I can feel it . " At the end of the fourth scene , he whispered " It 's O.K. , " and slipped away from standing-room-only and out to the street . ? CONVERSATIONAL exchange between a short man and a tall woman on a sunny day outside the Public Library : " Naturally he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it . " " Of course he has to say it . " " No , he does n't . He could say , ' Blab , blah , blab , blab , blah . ' " " Naturally he could say Blab , blab , blab , blab , blah , ' but he does n't . " " That 's exactly what I mean . "
