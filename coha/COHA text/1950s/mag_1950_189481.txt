This week , 32,000 U.S. troops will begin dropping in parachutes or landing in troop-carrier planes on the green hills around Fort Bragg and Camp Mackall , N.C. Jet fighters will whisk overhead , giving them air cover . Cargo planes will fly in with all their supplies , for " Operation Swarmer " is designed to prove that a combat area , e.g. , an island base for strategic bombers , can be taken and held by airborne troops entirely supplied by air . <P> Operation Swarmer will also demonstrate something more important : the nation 's unpreparedness . The simulated attack on a peaceful section of North Carolina will involve just about all the Sunday punch the U.S. can mobilize in the first critical hours after a cold war becomes hot . <P> The 32,000 ground troops in Swarmer will be the 82nd Airborne Division ( now at 75% strength ) , the 11th Airborne Division ( down to two regiments ) , and their headquarters , supply and engineer troops . Opposing them will be one regimental combat team of the partially ready 3rd Infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. troops anywhere to be found are all tied up . They are two half-strength combat-ready Marine divisions , one on the East Coast , one on the West ; the 2nd Army Division , widely deployed over the U.S. and wholly unready ; and five divisions on occupation duty ( four in Japan and one in Germany ) which could not be counted as available . One armored " command " ( the equivalent of a regiment ) is ready . The U.S. 's other troops are 27 National Guard divisions , but the best that could be hoped of them is that most could be made ready by a year from the outbreak of war . <P> For Operation Swarmer the Air Force has assembled virtually all the troop-carrier and cargo planes that would be available if the U.S. were attacked this week . Nevertheless , the Air Force 's able , 43-year-old Lieut . General Lauris ( " Larry " ) Norstad , in command , has had to tailor his plans to his restricted fleet of aircraft , dropping one regiment at a time on the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force nearly four months to set up Swarmer . The U.S. has no war headquarters to direct such mock warfare , much less run a real war . Norstad had to borrow his headquarters supply command from the New York Port of Embarkation.
