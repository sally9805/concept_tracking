The chief collector of revenue for the Peruvian government leaned back in a chair in his oak-paneled office one morning last week , held up a slip of paper and chortled . " This , " he remarked genially , " is the biggest private check ever paid in Peru . " Then , turning businesslike , he handed a receipt to the lawyer who had just given Peru $3,000,000 on behalf of Aristotle Socrates Onassis , shipping , gambling and whaling tycoon . <P> The record check was in payment of a fine levied against Onassis after Peru caught five of his whaleships hunting within the 200-mile offshore limit that Peru claims to control . But in Paris Onassis was just about as pleased as the Peruvian government . He had come out of his troublesome tilt with Peru not only unscathed but possibly money ahead . <P> Bombs &; Bullets .

Planes and patrol vessels captured four catchers after machine-gunning two of them , and other aircraft forced the fleet 's 13,000-ton factory-ship into a Peruvian port after dropping two bombs close aboard . The staggering fine followed . <P> Laws &; Limits . After Onassis had paid up , his ships hastily provisioned and sailed that night . Then the shipowner turned suavely to the insurers and was , he reported , " immediately reimbursed . " Moreover , the insurers paid $1,000,000 for the ships ' lost time .
