txt Amidst a continual stream of heckling , Mayor Hynes today renewed his appeal to Massachusetts legislators for sales-tax revenues to prime Boston 's sputtering financial pump . City Councilor James S. Coffey heckled the Mayor during 24 of the 26 minutes of the speech . The East Boston councilor spoke out some 35 times , upset the Mayor 's delivery on several occasions , and was gaveled down seven times by the presiding officer . Sticking to his prepared text , however , Mayor Hynes gave no ground to detractors who had pummeled his administration throughout 1958 for failing to make economies in its own operation . Groups Organize Later in the afternoon the City Council and School Committee organized for the year . By a 5-4 vote Councilor Edward F. , Jr. , was elected president of the City Council . John P. Regan was voted chairman of the School Committee on a second ballot . In the main the Mayor 's address to the council took the traditional form of a listing of accomplishments . These centered on what the chief executive termed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the upsurge of the tax rate . " he said , " Boston 's incipient or minor building boom could undoubtedly grow into a reconstruction cycle such as our city has never before experienced . " Projects Listed To document this contention , the Mayor listed all of the major construction projects now underway or about to be started in the city . He called it the most activity in this field in many years . During the year , he added , " building permits have increased by 25 per cent . " In making this verbal inventory of changes in the skyline and the slums of Boston . he disclosed only one new project not previously made public . This disclosure consisted of a rather vague reference to " several " housing developments " now in the exploration or initial planning stage . " He compared these to the recently announced project in which a private , limited-dividend group of the city 's leading businessmen would construct some 800 middle-income apartments on city-cleared land . No indication was given as to whether the " several " such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or similar groups of businessmen or by an outside developer . Heckling Begins At this point early in his address Councilor Coffey began his running barrage of heckling . The Mayor termed the tax load on real estate " a deep , impassable pit in ' the roadway to economic progress . " But he also averred that despite its being " forbiddingly high because of obligations , requirements , and factors over which the city government can exert but little control , the fiscal situation of our municipality is not as precarious as might be assumed . " Some political eyebrows were raised over the fact that Mayor Hynes ' text contained no mention of the city 's new single assessor . A major battle was fought during the last five months of the year over the appointment of such a tax czar to institute assessment reforms . During that period ; although his administration was committed to back a single-assessor plan , the Mayor was accused by opponents , and rumored by some associates , to have but scant interest in risking the political upheaval that might result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lax front . where his administration has been repeatedly attacked , the Mayor did speak out . He asserted that " our tax-collection record is good and is another indication of the city 's basic financial soundness . " He stated that collections for this year had reached 90 per cent of the total levy and for past years had reached approximately 96 per cent . Official tax listings from other major cities indicate a more usual level of collections reaches about 98 per cent . The annual message further stated that departmental and stale revenues for 1958 exceeded estimates by more than five million dollars , leaving a surplus of three million dollars at year 's end . This , however , must be held as a reserve against uncollected taxes . The Mayor dwelt at length on a comparison at Boston 's plight with the relatively better economic position of similar big cities . He said that 70 cents of every dollar Boston raises to meet It 's total budget " comes from the real estate owner , the lessee , or the rent payer . . . Partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
