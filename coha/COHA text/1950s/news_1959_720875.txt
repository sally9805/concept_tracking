txt ACHESON DECRIES DANGER ' TO WEST IN SUMMIT PLANS Terms for Talks With Soviet Could Mean Major Defeat , He Tells NATO Group DISCERNS LACK OF WILL Favors Discussions of Arms Control as Most Likely to Produce Results The text of Acheson 's speech is printed on Page 12. gS ** J. JOBBB. , 7 ? ? 7 . SI:rectal to ' rime Nev . Verrls Times . WASHINGTON , Nov. 18 ? ! Dean Acheson warned today , that talks with the Soviet Union on the basis of terms now being considered could represent a major defeat for the West . To withdraw Allied forces from Berlin , as the Russians demand , could be the prelude to the collapse of the Western defense system in Europe and a ringing victory for the Communists , the former Secretary of State said . He won applause from a gathering of legislators from members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with hiss denunciation of what he termed ; a surrender to Soviet pressure.1 Mr. Acheson said the West . did not seem to have the will necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decisions He said this was a time for urgent decisions , a time for NATO to meet squarely the needs for adequate nuclear and conventional power . To do otherwise , he suggested , would mean the eventual disintegration of the Western alliance and Communist domination of the world . Mr. Acheson 's address was made at the fifth annual conference of members of parliaments of the NATO nations . The legislators also heard the alliance 's Atlantic Fleet cornmande ? warn that Soviet submarines would be capable of a significant threat with missiles within a year . Admiral Jerauld Wright , who heads NATO 's Atlantic Fleet units , said there was " conclusive evidence " that the Soviet Union was building ballisticmissile submarines . He said they would be able to carry out an attacl- on NATO within a year , with a " serious threat developing by 1963 . " The admiral also said NATO had evidence that the Soviet underwater fleet was showing " an increased interest in the // east coast of North America . " He said the industrial complex along the coast was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO as well . The meeting also heard a report on air . defense from Gen. Laurence S. Kuter of the Air Force , top man in the North American defense command . Mr. Acheson did not speak for the United States Government , but as a distinguished guest who had been active in developing NATO . In fact , his remarks were an extensive criticism of , policies now being followed by the Eisenhower Administration and other NATO governments . In criticizing the present approach to negotiating with the Soviet Union , Mr. Acheson did not oppose talks as such . He said , however , that talks should be " mutually beneficial " and not represent one-sided concessions . The most promising area for true negotiations , in Mr. Acheson 's opinion , is that of controls over the armaments race . He said that strategic nuclear power should be brought under strict international control and There should be reductions in conventional forces in the Soviet Union , so that they do not become " an adventurous menace , " he added . " The whole purpose of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are ample for defense , in fact are almost impregnable to attack , but have not the capacity to be aggressive , " Mr. Acheson said . " Total disarmament , " as prescribed by Mr. Khrushchev , is not only impossible but undesirable , Mr. Acheson said , for it would cause more instability than it would relieve . Former President Truman 'S Secretary of State made tWo other suggestions for NATO 's collective decision . First , he said , NATO should Aecide , " and decide for a decade , " that it wants to sot up a defense force in Europe and ( that it will " make the effort and sacrifice to do it . " He said this effort had repeatedly been ( delayed in the last decade by debate and disagreement . " Do not dig this tree up every year and look at its roots , " Mr. Acheson said . Second , he said , NATO should " look at Eastern Europe . " It should be NATO policy to look forward to a tithe when governments throughout Europe will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not talking about " liberation " of Eastern Europe , he remarked . " But I 'm saying we must deny and publicly deny and make it clear we have denied what Mr. Khrushchev is wanting us to do , which is to accept the division of Europe and believe that the future is going to be based upon the acceptance of that division , " Mr. Acheson said . A Historian 's Analysis Mr. Acheson said a historian looking back at the present era would see that there was in Western Europe and North America productive capacity and manpower " three times that of the Soviet ? Union " to create a " counterbalancing power " to Moscow 's . The question Was whether there.vat the will td do so , he zaid . The former Secretary said " judging from the policies which are in operation , the historian would conclude that the will did not exist , The West can either correct the shift of power to the Soviet side or deny that it is significant , Mr. Acheson continued . The latter is possible , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them " benign , " or at least " not so dangerous as to require precaution against the capacity to carry them out . " Mr. Acheson said the latter conclusion apparently had been reached in the West . This , in turn , has increased the demand for " what is called a negotiated settlement , " he explained . He said the danger was that the word " negotiation " would be used as a " cover for surrender . " It is the Russians who are drawing the issue for negotiation , he said , and that in itself is a. victory for them . ? In proposing his terms for negotiations , Mr. Acheson declared , Premier Khrushchev is saying : " I do n't have to cut all your throat ; I only need to cut half your throat . " This is the trap the West is being led into " by the incredible view that any sort of negotiation is good per se , " Mr. Acheson said .                @ @ @ @ @
