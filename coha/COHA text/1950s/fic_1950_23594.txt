FORTY-EIGHT , Vogelsang had a profitable T dry-cleaning plant , a house in Armonk , a wife his own age , and a son named Kermit who was attending a boys ' college in Massachusetts . The son was not fat , but a prevailing rotundity made him seem so . He had a round face in which two pink cheeks misrepresented him as cherubic , and he wore glasses , which he kept on when he went in swimming . One Sunday when he was down from school , the family spent some time discussing what next to do about the mother , who had a stomach complaint which had baffled two doctors . Vogelsang became aware of a repressed eagerness in the boy , who caught Vogelsang 's eye at length and beckoned him upstairs to his room with a jerk of his head . " I want to talk to you , " Kermit said , in his room , shutting the door . " Sit down . " " Thanks , " Vogelsang said ironically , taking the chair that Kermit waved to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using an abbreviation which set well with nobody . " These doctors ca n't find anything and probably wo n't . It 's something functional . " Vogelsang hesitated . " Psychological . " " You mean upstairs ? " Vogelsang said , entertained . He tapped his temple with two fingers . Kermit shook his head . " There 's no up-stairs . The body and the mind are one . " Information such as this was borne regu-larly southward from Massachusetts . The boy knew that the origins of monogamy were economic , that religions are deflections of the sexual nature , that symmetrical living had perished with the ancient Greeks . Now he knew this . " There 's no upstairs ? " Vogelsang said softly , in mock reverence . He was really waiting it out . Muffing words like " functional " had bred in him a wariness  --  the last time it had applied to architecture . He had once gone halfway through a bitter argument with Kermit under the impression that erogenous zones were vice districts . " I do n't want to s@e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , as Vogelsang , who had been looking forward to a fresh cigar and a still unopened copy of Esquire , glanced unhappily at the closed door . " You 're speaking of a clinic . Well , ninety per cent of the cases that get to clinics are psychic . And ninety per cent of those are stomach cases . What 's at the bottom of Moth 's condition is most likely an emotional disturbance . Believe me . The thing to do is to get her to an analyst . " Kermit had drifted over behind a small writing desk which was tumbled high with reading matter , so that he offered the illusion of standing waist-deep in books . It was a kind of tableau which Vogelsang worked up in his mind , then resisted . Kermit continued his explanations for five or six minutes , then he said : " Well ? What do you think ? " Vogelsang had been thinking that Jake Vanderrrteer , a friend of his who owned a chain of dry-cleaning stores and a country place near Darien with sixty acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to than Kermit would probably make in his lifetime , and had not finished eighth grade . The reflection was a siding from which to watch the streamlined verbiage go by . " Malingering , " " psychic , " " neurasthenic " streaked past like the names of coaches of which Vogelsang had not even got the spelling , With a small gold penknife , he pruned a panatela , dropping the hull into an ashtray , or rather missing , so that it fell to the rug . He checked the draft of the cigar with an experimental suck , but delayed lighting up till he should be at peace . " Like what kind of emotional disturbance ? " he asked . " Who knows ? " Kermit shrugged . " Some , oh , lack  --  frustration  --  boiling up in Moth 's time of life , " he said . " It would have to be dug into , probably in relation to the family picture . That 's what those troubles are part of  --  the family picture . " Vogelsang surveyed his son from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded . Kermit went over and picked up the cigar hull and dropped it in the ashtray , like a bug . " Oh , one approach might be that Moth is a sort of business widow . For years you 've been buried in either your work or a maga  --  ine . You 're a good guy and all , but you could n't exactly say you wore your heart on your sleeve , " Vogelsang folded the knife shut and pocketed it . " Has n't my heart always been in the right place ? " he said with resentment . " It 's not that . You know how women are . " Vogelsang fidgeted forward in his chair . The virgin cigar grew tattered in his clutch , " No , " he said derisively , " I do n't . How are they ? " " They live for affection , and if it 's denied them  --  well , any part of the body can become an attention-getting mechanism . That , in a nutshell , is psychosomatic medicine . " Vogelsang felt an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footed the monthly bills . He turned and smiled one-sidedly , as though to a third party in the room . " Why spend another buck when we got a psychiatrist right here in the house ? " he said . He immediately regretted " buck , " which had been vaguely retaliatory . Kermit made a gesture of defeat . " That bourgeois superstition over the very word ' psychiatrist , ' " he said . Vogelsang rose . " Maybe there is this new kind of medicine that 's going around . And maybe I 'm anyhow seeing signs of what you think you 'd like to he , " he said . " Well , when you 've made out in life half as good as some of the people you lump in that class , bourgeois , why , we 'll decide how good your advice is . " He walked to the door . " And I 'll tell you this . There 's two words I 'm damn sick of  --  bourgeois and psychosemantic ! " Wounded in spirit , he withdrew to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his tongue repairing the lesions in his cigar , he sat thinking of Jake Vandermeer , whose house had twenty-seven rooms and who also had a swimming pool with an island in the middle of it on which guests could eat , and with a catwalk for the servants to bring . the food on . It was a thought from which he frequently drew encouragement . p urrtnic his wife in the hands of a top stomach man , as Vogelsang instantly did , was an act of self-defense . It was as though his honor , having somehow been indicted , was now on trial . Since the conversation with Kermit , Vogelsang had had a plummet of misgiving . A bookkeeper in his own office , now that he came to think of it , had told of an aunt who had been troubled with headaches , dizziness , and repeated nausea , all inexplicable  --  until a mother-in-Jaw had been removed from the house . Then it had cleared up . Vogelsang wondered how anybody could survive such farcical injury . The new specialist phoned Vogelsang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative . " We 'll take others , " Vogelsang said . " There 's lots of them  --  a series . We 'll spare no expense . " He sat watching his wife narrowly . " Have n't I always been that way  --  spare no expense ? Car of your own , the best in kitchen equipment , a maid the minute I could afford it ? " His wife nodded mechanically , finding these protestations elliptical , but grateful for the growing solicitude . He poked a thermometer in her mouth with a tender tyranny and went to the kitchen to make some tea , with his own hands , though the maid was in her room . The thermometer read ninety-nine and eight-tenths . Kermit , home for the next week-end , told them not to worry too much about it ? " Low-grade fevers can be functional . " Vogelsang , whose exasperation with this nettle of a boy was exceeded only by his anxiety for his wife , told himself that when this was all over he was going to take him out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , carrying a hairbrush or strap . News came of what was presumably the last of the X-rays . It was negative . Vogelsang wet his lips and gave his belt a hitch , sensing Kermit beckon him into the living room . He saw his wife at the analyst 's , unwinding the cerements of secrecy from the chronicle of their marriage bed . " Psst , " Kermit called . Vogelsang went over . " Fortescu , this chap at school I think I 've mentioned , knows a good psychiatrist . They had him for his aunt , " Kermit said . " Now let 's simply go ahead and make a date for Moth . " Something in the sequence of syllables , the juxtaposition of " chap " and " Moth , " rallied Vogelsang 's resistance . He answered in the tone of a sentenced prisoner declaring that he will fight his case to the highest court . " We 'll take it to Mayo Brothers , " he said . " Mayo Brothers ! " Kermit said , with a frown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you call the mother who bore you ! " Vogelsang said in a loud voice , glancing out the door to see if his wife was anywhere near and had heard . She had , and came in . Seeing a chance to convert retreat into an offensive , Vogelsang quickly pointed at Kermit and said , " He claims it 's all in your head . " Protesting that this phrasing put them back a hundred years , Kermit insisted on stating the matter himself . His mother heard him out , and agreed with unexpected compliance , if with a shrug , that they might as well try that next . " The doctor 's name , " Kermit said , with a glance at his father , " is Strogonoff . " Strogonoff , a lean , weary man with exquisite haberdashery , sorted patients instinctively into two categories  --  those who had read Freud and company and those who had n't  --  not that he was sure in his mind which was better . Mrs. Vogelsang at any rate fell smoothly into hers as , thickset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bundles from a round of shopping , she entered the office looking around for the couch made familiar by stage and screen . Strogonoff had bought one because it was expected . He was oppressed by a sense of vogue , of too many people as-piring to be patients . Mrs. Vogelsang made her way with smiling interest toward the couch , on which had previously lain a sculptress whose husband tortured their infant son with ice cubes , and before that a young meteorologist who wondered whether he should buy a house in the country because there he continually picked up twigs and broke them in half , then into quarters , then into eighths . " Shall I take my shoes off ? " Mrs. Vogelsang asked , having dropped her parcels on a chair . " Go right ahead , " Strogonoff said . He had already abandoned the case . Her shoes shucked off and nudged out of sight , she lay down with a grateful sigh . " When I was a little girl I used to like to ? " " Over the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What is the matter with you ? " She commenced a recital of her difficulties . Strogonoff cued her to trace them backwards through the years , interrupting only enough to keep her , as with the deft pressure of a snaffle , on the subject of her symptoms . A half hour passed , three quarters . Strogonoff 's ear picked up something , and he straightened in his chair . " This pain you say you had ' more on the right side , ' the night your husband took you to the bowling match , " he said . " Was it sharp , and up here perhaps ? " He laid a hand on his trunk , well away from the stomach . She raised herself up to see , and nodded , doubtfully at first , trying to remember . " A little baking soda seemed to help , at least it went away , " she said , nuzzling a. stockinged arch over an instep . " Have you ever had your gall bladder checked ? " Strogonoff asked . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up out of the patient 's past to go on , the family doctor got in touch with a gall bladder specialist , who explored exhaustively , in his fashion , thought about it all , and suddenly decided to operate . Vogelsang stepped into a Western Union office and dispatched a wire to Kermit running : " Trouble gall bladder stop specialist set operate Wednesday stop expect you here . " He pressed the pencil so hard that when he left the place , the indented message was legible on the next sheet of the pad . ERM1T , who arrived too late Tuesday night to talk to the specialist , sought him out at the hospital the next morning a few minutes prior to surgery . Vogelsang trailed a step behind him , going down the hospital corridor , performing the introductions when he drew up . " May I ask what the X-ray showed ? " Kermit asked the doctor , an urbane , elderly man named Smollett . " Nothing , " Dr. Smollett replied agreeably . He had a chart cradled on one arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a lapidary rather than a medical man , are sometimes translucent , and thus escape detection . Second , they migrate . " He paused and jotted something on the chart with no impairment of his courtesy . " Then how do you know they 're there ? " Dr. Smollett looked up and explained , " Diseases often travel incognito . I 'll grant you the bulk of the symptoms here are dyspepsia , but that 's one of the guises assumed by the disorder it 's my job to find . You do n't always grease the wheel where it squeaks , do n't always grease the wheel where it squeaks , " he went on , as though he had obtained his education from a cracked phonograph record , but he was only being elementary , and thus repetitious . " I 'll stake my sixty-two years on this case , " Vogelsang stood by as though witnessing a thrashing he had authorized . It was like the end of the thrashing when Doctor Smollett said " digestive constellation , " words which reached Vogelsang heroically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Smollett might as well have been talking Choctaw . " The stomach , " Dr. Smollett finished , in modulations Vogelsang could only worship from afar , like an island in a swimming pool , " has been called the greatest liar in the anatomy . " Kermit glanced from the doctor to Vogelsang and back again to the doctor , like young men Vogelsang had seen in motion pictures , then shouldered his way off between them . That was ten o'clock in the morning , the hour scheduled , and by twelve Dr. Smollett had not yet come down to the lobby where Vogelsang and Kermit were waiting . They would get up out of a chair and pace , or get out of one chair and into another . Kermit had a book with him , from force of habit . which he did n't open . Vogelsang drifted over and glanced at the title  --  twice , because he had forgotten what he 'd read the first time , or even that he had looked . Something about semantics . Suddenly Vogelsang broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to a bar across the street . " Rye and soda , " he ordered . He had an urge to release his anxiety in talk , any kind of talk , and did . To a bartender inured to obscure circuits of association , he related something of the affairs of Jake Vandermeer . " There 's a terrace on this place , " he said , by way of concluding a lengthy description of it , " with a statue of Venus that 's got a radio built into her . Like those clocks are , you know . " The bartender continued impassive , as though something more were needed . " James Melton was there , " Vogelsang said . He saw that twenty minutes had gone , gulped his drink , and galloped back to the lobby . Still no Dr. Smollett , it was plain from Kermit 's posture  --  his feet spread out and his head back on the chair  --  as well as from his expression as he rolled an eye at Vogelsang without moving his head . An apprehension clawed Vogelsang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Vogelsang could see him , put to rout in his sixty-second year , an effigy of self-possession . Then the elevator doors slid open , and there he was . " Everything is okay , " he said . He pinched his eyeballs in toward the bridge of his nose in that gesture which is one of the ciphers of fatigue . " l found about what I expected  --  not much , but enough to have caused the trouble . We 've got the culprit at last . " W HEN Vogelsang drove home , late that night , Kermit sat beside him , looking out of the car window and saying nothing . Vogelsang steered onto the drive , at last , and across the gravel which gave forth its welcome scrunch and into the open garage . He slid the fenders carefully to rest alongside a protruding row of firewood which was stacked against one wall . Kermit opened his door and got out . " Just a minute , " Vogelsang said . Kermit , who had started away , turned back . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat and handed it to him . Kermit took it and went in the house . The maid fixed them a bite of supper  --  their first food since a sketchy breakfast though it was nearly midnight . They sat in the living room waiting for it , Vogelsang with his coat off and his tie loosened . Kermit put his legs straight out ahead of him on an ottoman , his feet side by side , the flat of the soles toward Vogelsang . Vogelsang looked at him , then looked away . He thought of how the boy went in the water with his glasses on . " That book , " he said , pointing at a table where Kermit had set it when he entered . " It 's about this new stuff , semantics , I see . " He hooked a chair toward him with his toe and slung a foot on it . He fished a cigar from a nearby humidor and dressed it . " What the devil is that all about , semantics ? Explain it to me . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . The first time I saw the word I thought it was all about pottery . " Death Went Away MARK VAN DOREN T HE little fox , demanding to be seen In the cut field that fall , was not so little To the first eves he found , the middle-old ones , The still ones over the wall , that saw in secret Faraway death  --  huge death , the silent sender Of neat four-footed omens saying Now , Or pretty soon , make ready ; this is the last Surprise ; nothing more comes out of the woods In your time , ailing fellow .
