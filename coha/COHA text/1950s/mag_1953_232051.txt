The National Security Training Commission last summer was told by President Eisenhower to bring order out of confusion in the nation 's military draft and reserve system . Headed by Julius Ochs Adler , vice president of the New York Times and an Army Reserve major general , the commission went to work , last week submitted its report . Result : confusion compounded . <P> The commission had no trouble finding inequities of the present system , e.g. , more than 600,000 U.S. veterans of World War II were called back to duty and thrown into the Korean war , while about 2,500,000 qualified nonveterans were not sent to Korea . But the commission brought forth some odd answers . <P> Bucking the logical trend away from emphasis on raw manpower as the basis of national defense , the NSTC plumped for universal military training . It urged that alternative programs be adopted : a six month training course for some 18 year-olds , and two years of actual military duty , to begin at not less than 18 years , for others . Whether a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a continuing lottery . <P> Adverse reaction was soon forthcoming . Dr. John A. Hannah , Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower , took issue with the assumption that the half-trained UMTees would be valuable in any future war . To Missouri 's Representative Dewey Short , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a longtime enemy of UMT , the idea was ridiculous . Said Short : " A lottery with dollars at stake is bad ; a lottery involving control of human lives is doubly bad . " For all practical purposes , House Speaker Joe Martin wrote a terse obituary for the plan . Said Martin : " I do n't think the program would have much chance . "
