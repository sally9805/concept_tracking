On the eve of a dinner for Louis XIV , according to Mme. de Svign , the grand chef de cuisine at the Chteau Chantilly killed himself rather than face the Sun King without enough fish for his pice de rsistance . Fortunately , no such tragedy marred last week 's visit of Britain 's Queen Elizabeth to France , although one great cake prepared in her honor collapsed from the heat before she got to it and had to be hurriedly propped up . No one 's life was held forfeit , and the first visit of a reigning British queen since Victoria was such a success ( except for a royal umbrella lost at Orly Airport ) that even the Communist newspapers who had scoffed at first were reduced to sweeping deep editorial curtsies . <P> Under the continuously watchful eyes of some 4,000 metropolitan policemen , 1,700 special security troops and 36 squadrons of the Garde Rpublicaine in shining new casques , the matronly young Queen planted a tree , pushed buttons , laid a wreath , accepted gifts , saw sights , made pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 3,400 ladies of France . In more private moments , she slept in Napoleon 's bed , bathed in Empress Eugnie 's bathtub , sat in an armchair used by Louis XV , and ( according to the calculations of Frenchmen experienced in such calculations ) found time to spend just 1 hours out of the three-day visit alone with her husband . <P> Everywhere the Queen and Prince Philip went , Parisian crowds gathered to gape and cheer . Outside the opera the welcoming hordes pressed so close that the mounted guards had to drive them back with drawn swords . At a huge reception in the Louvre many of the 2,000-odd distinguished guests vied with each other for vantage points on the pedestals of world-famed works of art as museum guards shook their heads in despair . " I expected Marcus Aurelius to topple over on me at any moment , " said one grande dame nervously . As the party broke up , even the footmen and wine stewards toasted the great occasion in surplus wines and spirits . <P> In fair return for the lavish displays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor at every turn , Elizabeth dazzled her hosts with her own rarest jewels , including an emerald tiara intertwined with diamonds formerly owned by the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna , wife of the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia , and the famed 26-carat pink diamond from the mines of Tanganyika that was a wedding gift to Elizabeth . Beneath her glittering tiaras , the Queen 's smile was invariably radiant . But perhaps the diplomatic device by which Elizabeth most thoroughly endeared herself to the exquisitely gowned ladies of Paris was to accept their curtsies in gowns some of which , according to catty French experts , were at least a couple of years behind the fashion .
