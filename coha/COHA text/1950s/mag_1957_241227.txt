Geologists have warned the city of Long Beach , Calif , ( pop . 303,000 ) that if it does not do something fast , most of its harbor district , centering on the powerhouse of the Southern California Edison Co. , will sink far below sea level . <P> In the ' 30s Long Beach rejoiced to find that it was sitting on top of the Wilmington oilfield , the richest in California , which has yielded $1.25 billion in 21 years . The town , on Los Angeles ' southern edge , grew black with close-standing derricks and loud with never-sleeping pumps , but no one objected much . <P> Down , Down . Then , inch by inch , a snake crept into this oily Eden . Surveyors checking their lines during construction of a Navy drydock in 1941 , noticed that the ground had sunk a little . Long Beach sages , only slightly alarmed , suggested various causes . It was an earthquake , maybe , or the result of dredging and filling in the harbor area . Few liked to mention the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by extraction of the oil that was making the city rich . <P> Up flowed the oil and down sank the city . Soon the Navy , Ford Motor Co. , the power company and the oil producers themselves were building costly levees to keep the salt sea away from their doors . As the sinking continued , one or two feet each year , the earth began to move sideways . Pipes broke and gushed water , oil or sewage . Pavements cracked . Bridges had to be rebuilt to keep them above the water . Such work has cost so far about $90 million . <P> At last the threatened city looked its enemy in the face . The geologists ' reports left no doubt : the Wilmington oil sands , more than 1,000 ft. thick , have no strong rock over them . When the oil flowed out , the sands shrank slowly , and the surface sank , forming a great bowl , 24 ft. deep and more than 20 sq . mi. in area , that now reaches from the business center of Long Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor district is laced with dikes and retaining walls to keep the sea off the land . The Ford plant and the power station are protected by levees 20 ft. high . If nothing is done to stop it , says Geologist Frank S. Hudson , the sinking will continue until the center of the depression has sunk 72 ft. below high-water mark . If this happens , the harbor department alone will have to spend $60 million on subsidence remedies . <P> Reversing Sea Water . Geologists believe that Long Beach has two possible recourses , both expensive . It can stop oil production and thus keep the ground from sinking as much as it would if all oil were removed . This measure would be unpopular , and probably impossible . <P> The other alternative is to pump sea water down abandoned wells under high pressure to replace the oil in the sands before they collapse . Something like 900,000 bbl. per day will be needed , and the total cost is something that no one likes to think about ( the pumps alone might cost $50 million ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop sinking . The land would never rise again , no matter how much water is forced into the sands . But pipes would stop breaking , pavements would stop cracking and dikes would not have to be raised every year or so .
