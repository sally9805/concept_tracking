Treasury officials were pleasantly surprised last week by the summary of U.S. savings bond sales in the first four months of 1953 . Sales were up , notably in farm states , where crop income has been declining . In six states-North Dakota , South Dakota , Iowa , Kansas , Nebraska and Montana-bond sales showed gains of 44% to 92% over a year ago , while the nationwide increase in the same period was only 29% . <P> The apparent paradox of more savings on lower income was due to the fact that farmers are 1 ) putting money aside against the day when replacement of tractors , automobiles , refrigerators , etc. , becomes imperative , and 2 ) are no longer heavily buying real estate . They feel that the land market is at a peak , are saving to start buying again when prices drop .
