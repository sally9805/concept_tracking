Ever since the U.S. thoughtlessly suggested five years ago that the United Nations try to legislate freedom of the press throughout the world , U.S. editors and diplomats alike have regretted the proposal . Nations where the press has little freedom quickly seized on the proposal as a method to hamstring press freedom rather than help it ( TIME , March 10 , et seq . ) . Last week the restrictionists won their first , clear victory . <P> Over U.S. and British opposition , the General Assembly passed a " Right of Correction Treaty . " If the U.S. Government ratified the treaty , for example , it would be required to distribute to the press " corrections " from any other government that feels it has been misrepresented by U.S. papers . U.S. Delegate Charles Sprague , ex-governor of Oregon and publisher of the Salem ( Ore . ) Statesman , called the treaty a " hazardous step " because it would force a government to distribute to its press any propaganda other countries wanted to foist upon it . The Russians and their satellites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are still pushing for a treaty that will stop the " warmongering of the Western press , " i.e. , any news the Communists do n't like . Even though the U.S. , Britain and other countries will refuse to sign the treaty , and thus will not be bound by it , it stands a good chance of being ratified by other member nations and becoming a part , however little honored , of the international law that U.N . writes from time to time .
