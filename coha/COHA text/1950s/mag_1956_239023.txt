After reading a Commerce Department survey of 35,000 stores , which showed that retail sales for June soared to a record $16.6 billion , some 4% better than the June peak in 1955 , a Commerce Department economist said : " The U.S. consumer is not afraid of anything . " <P> The consumer is obviously not worrying about a slump . With more employment and fatter paychecks , consumers from coast to coast had money enough to pay off installment loans on what they had bought in 1955-and then buy still more . The sales increases were not all spectacular . Nor were they evident in every line or city . But they did show the overall pattern of slow , steady growth . Buyers in 1954 and 1955 had concentrated on hard goods-autos , furniture , refrigerators , etc. ; now they are concentrating on clothes and small appliances , and spending more for food , entertainment and other nondurables . <P> While sales of air conditioners , big TV sets , etc. , were down slightly in some areas , most department stores reported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department store , June was the best month in its 66-year history : starting in April , small-appliance sales climbed 69% over 1955 , jumped another 22% in May and still more in June . After a cold , wet spring , Dallas , Chicago and Boston stores found a summer fillip in June 's warm weather and clear skies , were even starting to move such heavy appliances as fans , air conditioners and power lawn mowers . Denver 's steady population growth kept both soft and hard goods at boom levels , while in the Southeast discount houses were invading traditional department-store markets , forcing prices down and sales up all around . Though established stores moaned that they lost money on big appliances , Atlanta 's Rich 's department store noted that July sales were about 10% higher than June and generally ahead of last year . Estimates were that total retail business in the Southeast was 6% to 7% better than in 1955 . Much of the buying was on credit , but few bankers worried ; repayments were strong and repossessions low . <P> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the pinch was starting to hurt retailers in some steelmaking areas , though many were trying to bolster sales with generous credit terms ( see cut ) . The Federal Reserve Board reported that department-store sales for the week were down 1% in the Chicago area , down 6% in Pittsburgh . But it will still be some time before sales are badly hurt . One of the most notable things of 1956 so far is the way Detroit merchants keep on selling in the face of heavy auto layoffs totaling 280,000 Michigan workers . While sales usually dip with the employment curves , FRB reports overall retail business in the Detroit-Cleveland area was up 5% for the year .
