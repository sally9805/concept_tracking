This year 's European Bridge Championship was played on a new stage . It presented a new cast of characters and a brand-new script . But it turned out to have the same familiar plot with the same old ending . // The setting was Palermo , and Sicily provided its usual perfect September weather . The makeup of all three of the principal contenders ' teams had been altered from last year . Both France and Great Britain were confident that their teams had been strengthened , while Italy was defying the cardinal axiom of competitive sport : Never disturb a winning lineup . But at the end , it was the Italians who once again were in the lead . // No American tournament is conducted in quite the same way as the European Championship . // The Vanderbilt and the Masters , generally considered the most important U.S. team championships , are played on a knockout basis . Session-long matches are fought team-against-team , and a team can lose only twice before it is out of the tournament . It takes about a dozen sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament is a round-robin affair . Each team meets every other team for a full session of 40 deals , scoring two points for each match won and one for a tie . Another difference : in Europe , a match won by fewer than six International Match Points is a tie . // Many expert observers believe that Europe 's plan gives the best team the best chance to win , and I am inclined to agree . And Europe 's best continues to be Italy . // The resignation of Guglielmo Siniscalco and Massimo D'Alelio represented more than the loss of two players to the Italian champions ; it broke up two of Italy 's three fixed partnerships . Fortunately for Italy , Eugenio Chiaradia and Pietro Forquet speedily developed a partnership that seems to be at least as strong as either of the two it replaced . Both men played brilliantly . // We are so accustomed to reporting exactly how bright the Italian play can be that it is a refreshing change to describe a hand in which Forquet demonstrated that even he can sometimes err . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will meet the Italians in the spring . // This was the deal , played during the match between Great Britain and Italy . And although Italy eventually won by a huge score , it was only the sixth board of the match  --  too early for anybody on either side to relax . // Except that failure to open the bidding with one club limits the strength of the opening bid , this Neapolitan pair bids in almost standard fashion after an opening bid of one in any othersuit . Thus , Forquet 's jump to two no trump after a pass indicated just about what he had  --  11 or 12 points in high cards and the unbid suits well stopped . Having opened an absolute minimum , Chiaradia was n't even tempted to go further . // South opened the 9 of spades , covered by dummy 's 10 , and North 's king forced declarer 's ace . Of course Forquet immediately tackled the clubs , leading the jack from his hand . But when South followed with the 7 , Forquet committed the indiscretion of letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned a spade , killing East 's immediate re-entry while the high clubs remained in dummy to block the run of that suit . Before Forquet could get back to his hand , the defenders were able to win two hearts , two spades and the king of diamonds ; added to the king of clubs , that was enough to set the hand one trick . // There was nothing wrong with leading the jack of clubs ; even a finesse would have been permissible if the suit had been unblocked by covering the jack with the queen . The defenders then would be unable to keep East from regaining the lead in time to run four clubs , two spades and , with a successful finesse , two diamond tricks . Making the contract would have scored 120 , holding a tie in IMPs against the 130 which Great Britain scored by making four clubs at the other table . Going down one trick , however , cost a total swing of 230 , worth four IMPs . // It turned out Italy could well afford the loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly apart against Italy and France . While no one member of the English team was to blame , Boris Schapiro , suffering from the effects of a severe attack of turista , was far off form , especially by comparison with the magnificent display which he and Terence Reese had put on in the early rounds , when Great Britain won her first 10 matches . // A healthy Schapiro would never have been guilty of the error which Boris Schapiro made in the following deal from the match against France , placing that country second ahead of Great Britain . I cite the deal because it includes a simple point all players should consider . // The bidding was identical at both tables , and so was the opening lead of the king of spades . // In the other room declarer simply held up the ace of spades until the third round of the suit , then led a low club to dummy 's queen . East took his ace and the defenders got another spade , but declarer then had nine tricks . When Schapiro played it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , fearing that the opener might hold five spades , he tried to run nine tricks by winning a heart finesse . When this lost , he was down one for a total point loss of 700 , or 6 IMPs . // Why did the French declarer play the club to establish his ninth trick rather than rely on the heart finesse ? True , he would have lost the contract if West had had the ace of clubs and five spades  --  but he could not win it under these conditions unless West also had the king of hearts . Since West had passed initially , this was entirely impossible ; in fact , the ace of clubs was pretty well marked in East 's hand , making the contract a laydown as long as South held off the spades until the third round . // At least one match every day was shown on the Bridge-O-Rama  --  an electrically operated device for letting large audiences follow the bidding and play . The exhibitions were well attended and I have reason to know that the audience had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was invited to serve as commentator after the first few matches . Since I spoke only in English  --  and I frequently have trouble describing the exotic French and Italian systems even in my own language  --  obviously the fact that I was urged to continue through the meet must be credited in large part to the excellent portrayal of events provided by the Bridge-O-Rama itself . // One of the hands I described during the match between Great Britain and Italy illustrates the fact that both the Neapolitan Club and the Roman Club can , upon occasion , operate less than flawlessly . Unfortunately , the British did not take full advantage of their opportunity . // Two of the Italian pairs  --  Giorgio Belladonna and Walter Avarelli , and the new pair , Roberto Bianchi and Giancarlo Manca  --  play the Roman Club . This method calls for an opening bid of one club on any of three different types of hand : a balanced hand of 12-16 points or 21-26 points , or an unbalanced hand that is the equivalent of our strong two-bid . The opener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case , of course , Belladonna 's club opening was the scratchiest of minimums. // Reese 's double was a conventional bid for a take-out , showing a good hand . With eight points , Avarelli was compelled to ignore the intervening double and , with a choice of suits , to prefer his four-card major . East 's raise to two hearts announced both that he had four-card support and a minimum hand . // Reese now jumped to three spades and , though Schapiro huddled for quite a long time , he eventually decided to pass . My own feeling is that the spade king and the doubleton queen of hearts justified his taking some action , and that action could not be anything but a raise to four spades . As I play , the double followed by a jump bid is a request to carry on unless partner 's hand is entirely worthless , which Schapiro 's was not . // In the other room , the bidding also stopped short . // EAST ( Konstam ) // PASS DOUBLE PASS PASS // SOUTH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEST ( Meredith ) // PASS 3 Club PASS // NORTH ( Chiaradia ) // PASS PASS PASS // Here , the Italian North-South pair was using the Neapolitan Club , so that any bid other than a club indicated a hand of fewer than 17 high-card points . Distributional points are not counted in measuring for a club bid , so South 's opening bid of one spade did n't begin to reveal the power of his hand nor , in my opinion , did his rebid of a mere two spades over East 's double . Anyway , on this kind of auction there could be no question of North 's making a bid . So both sides played at three spades and , with the heart finesse succeeding , both were able to make five . // Although the tourney finished very much in accordance with the experts ' selections  --  Italy , France , Britain and Sweden , in that order  --  there were some upsets and several close calls before the final results were in . They added spice to a tournament which , despite its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden was the only team to defeat Italy , but Egypt  --  the architect of last year 's upsets when it walloped France  --  threw a healthy scare into the world champions when the half-time score showed them leading by 21 IMPs . Italy managed to recover , and the shock so unnerved the Egyptians it impaired their effectiveness for the rest of the tourney. // The French team had huge ups and downs , defeating Britain by a colossal 58 IMPs and then losing to Italy by an even wider margin , 84 to 17 . The French match against Belgium , played on the Bridge-O-Rama was a most exciting one . After four-fifths of the deals had been played France led by a mere 2 IMPs , 38 to 36 , when along came a hand on which France bid and made a small slam while Belgium stopped at a mere game contract . // What of the future ? // I did not have much opportunity to observe the performance of the newcomers to Italy 's team , since that wily campaigner , Carl'Alberto Perroux , Italy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Bridge-O-Rama but , on results , I should say that the Italian team is as strong as ever and again it will be the team to beat in the forthcoming World Bridge Olympiad. // Both France and Great Britain will probably change their lineups once more , and the U.S. will have no fewer than four teams in action . But whether any of these can beat the Italians is in the lap of the Olympic gods .
