Fidel Castro 's revolution had never moved at higher speed . Grinding out decree after decree last week , the Prime Minister ordered some 500 prisoners turned over to civilian courts , promised to restore the right of habeas corpus within 90 days , reopened the University of Havana , confiscated the holdings of 117 firms ( mostly construction companies that gave kickbacks to the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista ) . This week , Castro transported the entire Cuban Cabinet into the Sierra Maestra country , where his revolution began , and promulgated his pet law-land reform . He brought along $1,000,000 to make the first farm loans . <P> " Cuba now enters the creative stage , " announced Castro . " We must begin leaving behind the bitter stage of executions and punishments . " Last week was the first since Jan. i in which not a single Cuban died in front of a firing squad . Castro also seemed more willing to quarrel with the Reds around him . His mouthpiece , Revolution , denounced the Communists for trying " to climb on the bandwagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Undeterred , a top Chilean Red , Luis Cor-valan , declared : " We must march with the bourgeoisie , and Cuba is the example . " While Communists praised the revolution , many moderate Cubans who supported Castro from the start are losing faith . " It 's a swindle , " said a prosperous Havana professional man . These former Castro supporters deplore his confiscating land decrees , the conduct of some of his men and the course of his government . Castro soldiers careen about the city in Jeeps with guns in their belts and girls at their sides . Armed Forces Chief Raul Castro is living in a $220,000 mansion confiscated from a crony of Batista.
