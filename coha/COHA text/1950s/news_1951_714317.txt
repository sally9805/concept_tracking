Letters to The Times Federal Tax Reduction Urged Henan to Free Enterprise Seen in Current Revenue Rates To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMESI If the system of free enterprise is to survive in the United States monetary incentives must not be destroyed by tax rates which take away a large part of what a man makes or earns . Unless the Reed amendment now before Congress is enacted , or a similar Congressional amendment to place a limitation on federal tax rates , our country will shortly be socialized . The Reed amendment sets a federal tax top rate of 25 per cent , provided that Congress , by a vote of threefourths of all the members of each house , may fix a rate not in excess of 40 per cent for periods either successive or otherwise not exceeding one year each . However , in case of war the Congress , by a vote of three-fourths of all the members of each house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspend such limitation , Many people may have the impression that such a limitation would greatly reduce the Government 's revenue . That this is not so is shown by the American Taxpayers Association , which presents the following informa-tion : " A. 100 per cent tax on all taxable income above $25,000 ? that is complete confiscation  --  would yield only $700 millions a year more revenue . A similar tax on all taxable incomes of $10,000 would yield only about $500 millions . These figures represent the maximum possible yields , on the assumption that people would be foolish enough to go on earning what they could not keep . " I am firmly convinced that present tax rates have diminished , rather than increased , the income of the Federal Government by defying the law of diminishing returns . This was demonstrated after the First World War when tax rates were reduced . The Federal Government then received more revenue from a reasonable tax program than from one which squeezes the last possible penny from the citizens . This applies both to the taxes taken from the wage-earner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corporation . By reducing the tax rates the revenue to the Government was greatly increased , and the national debt was substantially . reduced . It is a fair question whether our present high taxes are honestly intended to raise revenue , or are primarily designed to socialize our country by slow and subtle pressure on the spirit of enterprise , ambition and desire for accomplishment which made this a great and free nation in the past . HAROLD F. PITCAIRN . Philadelphia , Dee . 7 , 1951 . Hanover Square Park Favored To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Hanover Square is steeped in history . At the juncture of Hanover , Pearl and William Streets this old square was once the center of stately residences , occupied by New York 's wealthy merchants . Following the French Revolution many notable . French emigres made their homes here . Facing it today is the interesting and picturesque India House , with antique lamps guarding its exclusive portals . When the Third Avenue elevated is removed Hanover Square will be given an opportunity for a new lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage for parking cars of the privileged few or will it be beautified in keeping with its traditions and potentialities ? Edgar Williams , prominent architect and president of the Municipal Art Society , has suggested that it be converted into another " green spot " by the extension of Battery Park , which is a short distance to the west of this charming little triangular intersection . With a little imagination Hanover Square could become one of New York 's most delightful Squares  --  an oasis of green and beauty in the midst of canyons of steel and stone . It is hoped that Park Commissioner Robert Moses , with his keen insight into such matters , will sense the possibilities of Hanover Square , and will tackle the job of its improvement with his customary vigor . J. OWEN GRUNDY . New York , Dec. 8 , 1951 . Farm Labor Pamphlet Explained To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : An A. P. dispatch from Denver carried in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Dec , 8 reported that Governor Thornton of Colorado had branded as " vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tale , " issued by the National Child Labor Committee . May we ask space in your column to explain the nature and purpose of this pamphlet ? At the request of Walter W. Johnson , who was Governor of Colorado in 1950 , the National Child Labor Committee undertook a comprehensive field study of migrant farm labor in the state . A factual statistical report , including fifty-six tables embodying the findings of the study and several'pages of recommendations , was submitted to the present Governor , who accepted it and stated that he was " particularly pleased " with it . Realizing that widespread popular interest and support would be needed to implement . the recommendations and that few people would read a 30,000-word research document , the committee also published a brief pictorial pamphlet of twenty-one pages highlighting the findings . The latter is the document attacked by the Governor . Every fact in the pictorial presentation is based on and was checked with the factual material presented . in the full report . The photographs which depicted the worst conditions  --  such as housing  --  were unposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pamphlet were " A Nicer Home " ? " A Place to Play " ? taken in migrant areas in Colorado  --  as illustrative of what a few , but only a few , migrants have . Every photograph not taken in Colorado was checked as to its validity , as a portrayal of conditions found during the study . Colorado newspapers have Commented on the fact that the full report , which " pleased " the Governor , is an " even stronger indictment of Colorado 's treatment of its migratory laborers " ' than is the pictorial report . We accept the Governor 's charge that the report is " propaganda "  --  but the only " vicious " thing about the rem port is the conditions it plortraysk Dozens of letters have been received by the committee from people in Colorado and from church , welfare and eivid groups throughout the country praising the excellence , the truth and the sincerity of " Colorado Tale . " " Propaganda " has been defined as " the opposing point of view presented with such clarity that it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Secretary , National Child Labor Committee .

Effect of Forests on Climate Wholesale Deforestation of an Area Said to Induce Changes To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK ' Masi Ernest Salvitti 's interesting hypothem sis in his letter published Dec. 7 concerning the cause of the present di+ math ) fluctuation is , I regret to say , in+ adequately supported by the facts . In , the first place , " the enire eoliths nent " was not covered by virgin forests in Columbus ' time . Then , as now , the high plains were treeless except for the " galleries " lining the river bottoms , and the basins of the intermontane region of the West were unable to sups port anything more woodlike than the mesquite scrub and Joshua trees . As to the climate of Columbian times , we are on rather less certain ground , though if we rightly interpret the find , ings of tree-ring , verve and pollen analysts , then it would look as though the seasons were approximately the same in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , for which information is somewhat more ample , the summers were unquestionably as hot as they are now and , if anything , drier . Since that time climatic ) conditions have continued to fluctuate  --  as indeed they have been doing for at least the past hundred million years  --  and while each major fluctuation has been accompanied by a significant change in the vegetative cover , there is no reason to believe that the converse was true . Certainly man could have hail nothing to do with the earliest of such changes ! At the same time , the premises on which Mr. Salvitti bases his contention are sound , since the wholesale deforae ? tation of an area can , and often does , induce changes in its climate . The Cop ? per Basin region in Tennessee provides an excellent case in point . Here is an area of 7,000 acres which was once heavily forested but has now been completely denuded by smelter fumes . The land all around is covered , by a hard wood forest similar to that which originally occupied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadly homogeneous disk trict show that during both summer and winter the daily temperature aver ? ages between three and four degrees lower in the forest than in the open , that evaporation in the denuded area is twice as great in winter and seven times as great in summer , and that the precipitation is anything up to 28 per cent greater in the forest than outside . The moral is clear , and here no one , surely , would join issue With Mr. salvitti , His final sentence expresses the common aim of every conservationist ? . and climatologist  --  in the land : " t0 protect to the utmost the forest preserves still remaining to us .

Staggered Working Hours Favored To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Times : Many proposals have been made in an attempt to find the solution to the subway problem . Perhaps , in due time , this situation will be alleviated . However , the time is now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reached . Is there not one large-scale business in this great city of ours magnanimous enough to pay more than mere lipservice to interest in the welfare of its employes ? Is it such a difficult task for modern management to devise a stagger system for workers in reporting to and leaving work , and , at the same time , to keep business in full operation ? It would be to the advantage of any employer to have his employes report to work in a pleasant frame of mind , which is now impossible after emerging from the nerve-racking and aggravating experience of rush-hour subway travel .

Problems of Middle East To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMM ' May I be permitted , as a Lebanese who has sought haven in the United States and as a former editor of the Journal o ? the Arab World , which was suppressed by a dictatorship , to express my great admiration for your Nov. 88 article " Unrest in the Middle East " ? As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five years , I feel that I have never read a more courageous and wise comment on the complex problems of the Middle East . These problems are clearly and objectively presented , within the narrow limits of an editorial . ( Msgr . ) Lours KHALIL . Brockton , Mass. , Dec. 1 , 1951.
