txt Letters to The Times own judgment . W.E . LOWTHER.PAUL S. DALLA TORRE , SYLVA BENNETT ... Letters to The Times Far East Policy Discussed Areas of Agreement , Statement on Red China Examined To THE EDITOR OF THE NSW YORK TIMES : You might have added to your lead editorial of May 9 on " Areas of Agreement " certain diminishing areas of disagreement . We-have applied economic sanctions to Red China and are now asking other members of the United Nations to do likewise . It appears that Great Britain will withdraw from the anomalous position of waging war in Korea while at the same time supplying vital war materials to Red China through Hong Kong . We are now sending arms and munitions and military advisers to Formosa . No longer will we stand mute while Red China seeks admission to the United Nations but will , according to General Marshall , not permit Red China to shoot its way into the United Nations . ? We will now bomb Manchurian bases if Red China attacks our troops from . the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ground troops from a long line of trucks laden with soldiers and arms from these bases and attacks from the air coming from the same boles ? It may be that General , instead of being a force of disunity , will prove to be a unifying force . At any rate , as a result of this great debate people are better informed and in a better position to formulate their own judgment . W. E. Lowniva . New York , May is , China in the U. N. To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I note your editorial comment on General Marshall 's testimony in Washington with reference to the State Department policy toward Communist China in the United Nations , and Formosa . It sounded very fine indeed , and we hope that this policy is maintained . However , only in January of this year the United Nations , including the United States delegation , offered to give Formosa and China 's seat in the U. N. to the Chinese Redd in return for a cease-fire in Korea . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no moment . , The offer was made in apparent good faith . If it had been accepted , what then could be said of the Far East policy that Secretary Marshall claims was established even before he took office in September , 1950 ? If Secretary Acheson reiterates the claim to this policy , as you hope , it will only lead one to believe that there are two Secretaries in the Administration whose memories , if not their veracity , is open to serious question . PAUL S. . Brooklyn , May 9 , 1951 , L'Osservatore Romano Editorial To THE EDITOR OF THE ** YORK TIMES : After my article entitled " Let Us Clear Up Misunderstandings " appeared in L'Osservatore Romano , on April 22 , I received several letters from the United States showing that summaries of it published in the United States did not give a correct idea of its meaning . I stated first of all that I did not want to evaluate the political and military views of General ; indeed , I stressed that only the future could pass final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to the General on the " struggle against communism " in Asia and in Europe . In this connection I said that in my opinion if these statements referred to the struggle against the Communist nations the latter could quote the General 's words to prove before public opinion sod the workers of the world that they were not the aggressor but the victims of aggression , as they have always maintained . If , on the other hand , the General meant that war should be waged against the ideology ? the political , social and moral conception  --  of communism , one should not forget , I said , that ideas are not , and have never been , conquered with weapons but with propaganda illustrating the opposite principles , and , above all , with just and productive social reforms . It is clear , therefore , that those remarks , the meaning of which is so obvious , could not be construed to represent  --  as has been done  --  an " attitude " . taken by me in regard to the recent developments .

Need for East Side Park To THE EDITOR Of THE NNW YORK TIMES : Why does the administration ' of the City of New York , so concerned with every other aspect of its complicated mechanism , ignore its greatest stronghold  --  its future citizens  --  our children ? Two years ago , a resident at Fiftythird Street and First Avenue , I worked for months with other mothers of this area in an attempt to regain the only park where we could take our children , suddenly closed by the city for what was termed necessary work on the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive . I refer to the small park which ran from Forty-ninth to Fifty-first Street on Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive . After weeks of work and anxiety we were assured that the at first complete closing and subsequent partial closing of this park was only temporary . However , after waiting through a long , harassing period of walking the sidewalks amid the dangers of First Avenue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further word , I left New York and moved my household to the country . Revisiting this section a few days ago , I was shocked to find that there still-is not an adequate park , that the mothers are still hoping and working toward getting one , and that they are still walking the sidewalks with their children . I was more shocked after talking to some of the mothers to learn that apparently the park will never be fully restored and that the former promises made to us have been forgotten . The city also intends to further obstruct what is left of this small park by constructing a crosswalk over it at Fifty-fourth Street . Since the United Nations is building a similar crosswalk at Fifty-first Street , there will be two crosswalks within three blocks . The total cost of both , I understand , will be about $150,000 , and neither will have a ramp for baby carriages . Farther uptown there are only six crosswalks for sixty-four blocks . One hundred and fifty thousand dollars spent for two crosswalks within three blocks for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this section can continue to use the streets and sidewalks SYLVA . BENNETT . East Stroudsburg , Pa. , May 7 , 1951 . Food for India Aroused Public Opinion Asked to Speed Legislation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish to commend you on your editorial " Aid to India " in the issue of May 4 , in which you state : " The real reason for granting this aid is the same that it always has been : the humanitarian feeling of the American people toward their less fortunate brothers in India . " In these times of storm and stress , of fears and hates threatening all friendly relations between peoples , this is a note of creative and enlightened self-interest and sounds the necessary warning to the peoples of our great country to hold " steady . " But a coalition of reactionary Republicans and Southern Dixiecrats in the Rules Committee have now shelved the bill to provide wheat for the peoples of India . It will take an aroused public opinion to get the bill out of the committee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion and vote . A flood of letters and telegrams ' should be sent to the chairman of the House Rules Committee , Representative Adolph Sabath ( Democrat of Illinois ) , and Senator Tom Connally , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , supporting legislation for aid to India . If it is a sound thesis that the United States must build up allies among peoples committed to the democratic way of life , if progress is to be made in halting the expansion of Russian communism , then it makes sense for the great democracy of the West , the United States , to create and maintain friendly relations with the new and great democracy of the East , India . The world of color is aflame with nationalist revolutions and wars . The United States , as moral leader of the democratic forces of the world , can ill afford to lose the respect and confidence of India by denying her wheat . Reports from New Delhi state that women of the Darbange district of North Bihar are feeding their children cakes of soft mud to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thousands of persons too poor to buy the rationed Government grain are keeping themselves alive by eating grass , snails , lotus roots and herbs . Instead of becoming impatient with Prime Minister Nehru 's statement that India would refuse to barter away her self-respect or freedom of action even for something she needs badly , the United States should applaud him for this fine expression of integrity which reflects the deep currents of our own social faith and life .

Ambassador 's Statement Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was deeply disturbed to read this past week the statement by Ambassador O'Dwyer in Mexico indicating that he has qualities in his delicate task which were not inherent in his predecessors . I consider this to be an unjustified reflection on four men under whom I served in Mexico : James R. Sheffield , Dwight W. Morrow , J. Reuben Clark and Josephus Daniels . It is likewise a reflection on two career men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Walter C. Thurston . ARTHUR BLISS LANE .
