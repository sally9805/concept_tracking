Conscientious Labor Secretary James Mitchell works hard at trying to be a good Republican shepherd to all U.S. workingmen . With prosperity and union organization , most of his flock live fat in the fold-but he worries over one nagging exception . Wandering up and down the nation 's agricultural circuits , from California to Washington , Texas to Michigan , and Florida to New York , more than 500,000 migrant farm workers , following trails of seasonal planting and harvesting , work and live in scrabbling poverty which Mitchell calls a " national disgrace " : average earnings in 1957 of $892 , hourly wages as low as 16 , flagrant violations of child-labor laws , substandard housing , dangerous transportation , inadequate sanitation and health facilities . And he thinks the Federal Government should do something about it. * <P> Conscientious Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson strives to be a good Republican shepherd to U.S. farmers , hopes mightily to lead them out from under the oppressive fold of Government regulation , so that they can profit by their own ingenuity and hard work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience clashed with Jim Mitchell 's conscience over migrant labor in one of the few public Cabinet rows of the Eisenhower Administration . <P> Mitchell wants the Labor Department to deny U.S. agricultural labor recruitment services to farm employers who do not pay migrants the prevailing local wage rates , do not provide adequate housing or safe transport facilities . In two days of public hearings in Washington last week , farm employment groups battered his plan ( earlier 29 farm-state Congressmen , mostly Southern Democrats , had branded the proposal " illegal , immoral and impracticall " ) . Alone among farm organizations , the National Farmers ' Union came to Mitchell 's aid , and the Very Rev. Msgr . George G. Higgins , of the " National Catholic Welfare Conference , praised Mitchell for " the greatest kind of courage . " <P> At week 's end , Ezra Benson called in the press , read a letter he had sent to Mitchell . Its gist : " The proposed regulations . . . retain the concept of federal intervention and administrative control and regimentation that is contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repugnant to agriculture . " Benson 's remedy for the migrants : more study . <P> *Farm labor is specifically excluded from wage-and-hour provisions of the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act , from minimum wage laws in every state except Wisconsin , and from unemployment insurance in every state but Hawaii .
