Man shares most of his diseases with lower forms of life , but for a long time it seemed that the commonest of his ills , the common cold , was his and his alone . Then researchers found that chimpanzees , most manlike of the apes , could catch man 's colds . However , this did little to advance research because chimps are scarce , expensive ( $500 each ) and temperamental . <P> Last week five University of Maryland researchers reported that they had broken through the mucosal barrier and succeeded in giving colds to a common , cheap and docile laboratory animal : the suckling hamster . The researchers took nasal washings from colleagues with fresh colds , dropped them into the noses of six-day-old hamsters . Two-thirds of the infant animals got human-type colds . Cold researchers rejoiced , hoped now to make faster progress against humanity 's stubborn medical nuisance by giving hundreds of hamsters runny noses .
