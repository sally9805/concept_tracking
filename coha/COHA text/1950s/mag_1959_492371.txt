// My father , Col. James Monroe Merritt , was the very model of a southern lawyer . In addition to his law practice , he taught at the University of Georgia . My mother was Irish . She was born Carrie Lou Rylle . They were nice . They were strict  --  very , very strict . We returned to Athens when I was ten . Just before my fifteenth birthday I ran off to get married to a man named Frank Bishop Hodgson , aged thirty-three . His people were wealthy cotton brokers , and he owned the Holland House , a small residential hotel . I looked older than fifteen , but I 'm afraid I was not even fifteen in all other ways . Mr. Hodgson was every minute of thirty-three , and he was n't exactly the type to sit around the house all day with a child bride . A year and a half after we were married , my daughter Julia was born . Mr. Hodgson was right pleased , but not enough to save a marriage that was doomed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before that I had left town . Determined to be a model , and protected by twenty-year-old Marie Martin , a colored friend and maid , I went to New York in November of 1920.1 had a letter to Howard Chandler Christy , the famous artist . 1 did not realize , of course , that Christy was constantly besieged by hopeful young women , most of them with letters from somebody . But Christy at once was obviously enchanted  --  with Julia , the baby in my arms . He called the next morning at 7:45 to growl , " Be here at nine , " 1 got ten dollars a day for posing from nine A.m. until the sun went down . I posed for other artists of the day also , but most of my work came from Christy . In 1922 1 thought I 'd like to try the stage , a natural step for a model , then as now . I got a small job in Dew Drop Inn , a musical show that broke in at the National in Washington . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me , " Would you like to go to the ball game ? The Yanks and Babe Ruth are in town . Babe 's a friend of mine . I 'll introduce you both to him . " I said sure , why not ? I had always liked baseball , I had a solid interest in the game , knew it better than most women . I was quite certain that as great as Babe Ruth was , he would never equal my friend from Georgia , Ty Cobb . We got there early . Jim called Babe over to the box and introduced us . Babe took off his hat , smiled a rather sweaty smile , said what I thought was a perfunctory , and certainly a gruff , " Hello . " He concentrated his talk to Barton . He was twenty-eight and to me he looked every year of it . His face and stomach were Fat , his legs like a chorus girl 's . As he and Jim talked , I realized his " Hello " was really not gruff . He simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , and when I arrived at the National Theater a little gnome was waiting . He was Eddie Bennett , bat boy for the Yankees . He had a note for me .

" 1 said to Eddie , " Tell him I 'll have dinner with him tonight if I can bring my girl friend . " In very little time I got a phone call backstage . " I 'll be delighted to have you both , " the Babe 's voice boomed . He gave me the name of his hotel and his suite number . I asked him , civilly if coolly , if there were n't any restaurants in Washington . " Lord , Miss Hodgson , " he replied plaintively , " I ca n't go into any restaurant . " " And why not ? " " Because get mobbed every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he fully realized what was in my mind , and his laughter shook the telephone . " Do n't worry . You and your girl friend wo n't have anything to worry about . My suite 'll be lousy with people . " Then , a little sadly , he said , " It always is . " So Bobbie Kane and I had dinner in ' his suite . And it was lousy with people  --  people who were utter strangers to me and , as I quickly realized , virtual strangers to Babe . My host , I soon perceived , was morose . There was liquor in his talk , but there was no drunkenness . The Babe was not then , nor was he ever afterward , either a drunk or a teetotaler . He liked to drink , but they never made enough beer or whisky to turn Babe mean or nasty . In fact , this flight into moroseness was a rarity . He usually just got a little louder and laughed even more . As we talked alone in the corner of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year he hit fifty-nine home runs , batted .378 and knocked in 170 runs . That was when he proved that 1920 , a year almost as fabulous , had been no freak , and that he was the chosen of chosen as far as baseball talent went . But the year before our meeting1922 ? had been disastrous . He had got in trouble with the baseball commissioner , Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis . He had fought with the owners of the Yankees . He had fought with the ballplayers  --  real fights , with fists and blood . He was in perpetual warfare with his manager , Miller Huggins . Babe was reviewing all these things with a woman he did n't know very well . There was always a drink in his haoid . Somebody he did n't even know see to that . The Yankees went to St. Louis and our show to New Haven . Much to my surprise , the Babe called from St. Louis . He called every other night for the balance of the Yankee tour . But if he was wooing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest it . As far as I could judge , he was a guy very much in need of a sympathetic ear . When the show opened in New York and the Yankees returned , he called . He was lower than ever . I invited him to my home . He met my mother  --  who had conic to live with me after my father 's death  --  my daughter and my two brothers , Eugene and Hubert . The Babe and I fell in Love . But the Babe was married , and his religion forbade divorce . Second wives writing about first wives are always tedious , and I do n't see how I could be anything different . So these are the facts as I knew them . I was not breaking up a home . It was broken . Babe had net Miss Helen Woodring when he was with the Boston club in 1914 . She was a waitress in Landers ' Restaurant there . She was , I am told , very beautiful . She was sixteen and he was twenty when they married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living there when the Babe and I met . Ours was a long courtship  --  nearly six years  --  filled with frustration and not a little humiliation . No woman likes to hide her love , but this woman had no choice . Babe was not just another married man out of love with his wife . He was Babe Ruth , the idol of kids everywhere . March ' 7 , 1959 I could never even have a picture of him in my home . We could n't go out to dinner . It was an absolutely miserable position for me . It was bearable only because I was in love , and because he , too , found the position intolerable . On January I I , 1929 , Mrs. Ruth was burned to death in a lire at Watertown , Massachusetts . We found out about it when my doorman called to tell me the lobby was crammed with newspapermen and photographers . Babe went up to the funeral and left immediately after it for the Yankee training camp in St. Petersburg , Florida , arriving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked hard , behaved and got into first-class condition . When the team returned to New York he wanted to get married . So did 1 . But he wondered about marrying so soon after his wife 's death . 1 suggested he talk it over with Father Hughes , of St. Gregory 's , on West 90th Street . Father Hughes paid me the great compliment of advising the Babe to get married to me as soon as he could . We were married on April 17 , 1929 ? opening day , no less ! Dorothy , a girl Babe and his first wife had taken from an orphanage in infancy , naturally came to live with us . Everything that happened to my husband in his own childhood was bad except one thing . This was the fact that a certain six-and-a-half-foot man saw something in the Babe that nobody else could see . He saw that Babe was inherently a decent human , although outward appearances then were all to the contrary . The six-and-a-half-foot giant was a Xaverian Brother named Matthias . The Xaverians work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their mother house is in Belgium . Brother Matthias was a teacher at St. Mary 's Industrial School in Baltimore when Babe and he crossed paths . Babe was sent there after being officially judged " a hopeless incorrigible " by the courts of Maryland at the ripe old age of seven . He was the first-born of George Herman and Katie Ruth . He spoke virtually no English as a child . German was his normal tongue . There were eight Ruths in all , including two sets of twins . George Herman Ruth , Sr. , owned a struggling barroom at 426 West Camden Street . His son , George , was hanging around it when he was five years old . He was chewing tobacco when he was seven , and drinking whisky before he was ten ! He was committed to St. Mary 's at the request of his parents . He was in and out of the place five times between the ages of seven and nineteen . There is no doubt in my mind that he came to love the place  --  but hated every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously rough and hard . The discipline was strict ; it simply had to be , The food was of the plainest , there being virtually no money . The Xaverians had no choice but to run a taut and economical operation . Brother Matthias was with the Babe from the beginning . Each time the Babe left , he left with Brother Matthias ' advice and prayers . Each time he returned he found compassion and understanding . " Brother Matthias was the greatest man I ever knew , " the Babe said often . He was flatly convinced that had it not been for Brother Matthias he would have wound up in jail . The Brother taught Babe to read and write ; the difference between right and wrong ( and there was a job ) ; and he taught Babe a game called baseball . In time Babe became a pitcher at St. Mary 's , always playing on teams composed of boys three and four years his senior . The man who got him into baseball was Brother Gilbert , a friend of Jack Dunn , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brother Gilbert told Dunn of Babe 's remarkable skills . Dunn signed papers with the state of Maryland , making him responsible for Babe until Babe was twenty-one , and on February 27 , 1914 , Babe left St. Mary 's for good . He was then nineteen . Babe started the 1914 season with a 5600 contract . Jack Dunn doubled that within a month , then quickly made it 51800 . Babe was in the minors less than three months when he was bought by the Boston Red Sox , of the American League . There was no question that the Babe would be with Boston in.1915 . From then on he never played another minor-league game in his life . He became a national baseball idol before he could vote , and he just was n't equipped for it . Very few are . This was a robust man , and he wanted all the things robust men should want  --  unfortunately , in excess . Life for him quickly began to consist of the " good guys " and the " bad guys . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack Barry and Col. Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston . Carrigan and Barry were his first big-league 74 SATURDAY EVENINCs POST managers in Boston ; Colonel Huston shared ownership of the New York Yankees with Col. Jacob Ruppert when the Yanks bought the Babe from the Red Sox in 1920 . The " bad guys " were Ed Barrow , Miller Huggins , Jake Ruppert , Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis and , in time , Joe McCarthy . Discipline . naturally , was what separated the " goods " from the " bads " ? although in Babe 's eyes , Brother Matthias and Carrigan were strict men . They , in truth , kept him in bounds far better than more dedicated disciplinarians , because they mixed understanding with the training rules . Barrow , as Babe 's last manager in Boston , and later as general manager of the Yankees , was his particular b  --  te noire . Barrow was a tough man , wise in the ways of baseball and reasonably wise in the art of handling men . He scared them all . He challenged Babe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babe , at twenty-three , did not choose to fight a man of fifty . When Barrow took over the Red Sox in 1918 , they had won two pennants in three years , and Babe had been their best pitcher over that span . But Barrow took the Babe , who might well have become the greatest pitcher of all time , and made of him the greatest hitter of all time . This was not the obvious move it now seems . To be sure , even before Barrow came on the scene , Carrigan and Barry occasionally took advantage of Babe 's bat by putting him at first base or in the outfield . But neither man ever dared think of Babe as anything but a pitcher . Taking Babe off the mound was like telling Paderewski that he should switch to the violin , but Babe was willing to try the experiment when Barrow suggested it . Both men recognized that his hitting potential in every game made him more valuable than his pitching potential in every four or five games . In 1918 Babe appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hit the stupendous total of eleven home runs  --  enough to gain him a tie for the homer championship of the league . The next year Babe was in 130 games and pitched in only seventeen of them . He belted twenty-nine home runs , then the all-time record . He was to pitch in only five more games from 1920 until his retirement in 1935 , mostly in meaningless contests . If for nothing else , the Babe and his friends owed gratitude to Barrow for having the courage of his convictions . And frankly I can think of nothing else to be grateful to Ed for . On January 3 , 1920 , the New York Yankees bought Babe Ruth for $100,000 , plus a $350,000 mortgage loan to Boston owner Harry Frazee on his ball park . The Yankees had never won a pennant ; had never amounted to anything but a poor relation to the glorious and beloved first team of New York City , the Giants . It took Babe no time at all to capture New York , and he never lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were far faster to forgive him his mistakes than were the men who grew famous and rich from their patronage . The year 1920 was typical of many that lay ahead for Babe and the Yankees . He played baseball in the daytime  --  hitting fifty-four home runs  --  and just played at night . But the Yankees almost won their first pennant in 1920 , and set a record of attendance at home of 1,289,422 ? an American League record it took twenty-six years to beat . In 1921 the Babe escaped death by a sheer miracle in an auto wreck . He flouted training and refused to live with the team on the road , or even travel with it on short hops . For all of that he had one of the best years of his career . The New York Yankees followed him to the first of their many pennants . The next year also started off nicely enough for Babe . He got himself a $22,000 raise to $52,000 , after bickering that was smoothed out by the ever-friendly Cap Huston  --  who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following year . However , Babe and his teammate Bob Meuse were n't allowed to play until May twentieth . Judge Landis had suspended them for the first thirty-nine days for defying him by going on a barnstorming trip after the 1921 season . When the Babe finally went back to work on May twentieth , he was out of shape , to put it gently . He drew a couple of additional suspensions that season  --  one for going into the stands to chase a fan who was heckling him , the other for calling a revered American League umpire a string of unprintable names . In the end , the 1922 Yankees nosed out St. Louis for the pennant , but in the World Series against the hated Giants , they could n't win a game . The season had been bad for the Babe , with his average falling from .378 to .315 and his homers from fifty-nine to thirty-five . The Series was a disaster . The Babe hit .118 , with only a single and a double in seventeen times at bat . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the famous speech in which he told Babe that he was letting down the " dirty-faced kids in the streets " who loved him . This was the background of the man I was to meet in 1923 and marry in 1929 . The seasons of 1923 and 1924 were great ones for the Babe . In 1925 he felt well , was working hard at training camp in St. Petersburg and was confident he could make it three good years in a row . Then he arrived in New York before the season started  --  on a stretcher . In New York I read of the Babe 's collapse in the Asheville , North Carolina , railroad station . All the stories agreed that the Babe 's stomach had rebelled at his Gargantuan appetite for peanuts , hot dogs , soda pop , and so on . was aware of that appetite and was quite prepared to believe what I read . The Babe was taken to St. Vincent 's Hospital in New York . I was not yet Mrs. Ruth , so it was some time before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta . He slid heavily into first base in an exhibition game and incurred a painful groin injury . 1 do n't know why the club did n't say , in effect , " Babe Ruth did n't gorge his way into a hospital . He is just another ballplayer painfully injured trying to win . " This was 1925 , a long time ago in our mores . Perhaps the club felt that in the interests of delicacy the exact nature of the Babe 's injury should not be publicly stated . It was simpler to let the public think that the great star was just a hog . He was a weak man when he rejoined the club in May , and the great Yanks had completely collapsed . The players took to fighting among themselves , with their angry manager , Miller Huggins , the prime target , In August the Babe was hitting a miserable .246 when the club got to St. Louis . He did n't use his hotel suite two nights running . When the Babe arrived in the dressing room an hour late one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do n't bother dressing . I 've had enough of you and your excuses . You 're fined $5000 and suspended indefinitely . " Babe came home , granting ridiculous interviews at every stop his train made . was bitterly disappointed . But my job at this time was not recrimination . I listened , sympathized and patted the unhappy little boy on the head . I also said , " Stop talking  --  particularly to newspapermen . " The Babe went to see Colonel Ruppert for a showdown . The colonel backed Hug all the way . It was not much of a chore to talk Babe into accepting Colonel Ruppert 's ultimatum : " Apologize to Hug or remain suspended . " The apology was accepted gracefully . Babe finished out the year with a .290 average , and the Yankees finished seventh . Christy Walsh , his business manager , and I talked the Babe into making as certain as possible that the disaster of 1925 was not repeated . One of our ideas was that he get in shape even before spring training . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1926 Babe boosted his average eighty-two points to .372 , belted forty-seven homers and enjoyed a season of peace and quiet on and of the field as the Yanks won another pennant . The 1927 Yankees were the greatest baseball team that ever played , and my husband was the greatest player on that team . The pennant race was over by the first of September , but Babe was fighting to break his home-run record of fifty-nine . He did it , of course . The sixtieth was made in the Yankee Stadium against Washington . Tom Zachary , a left-hander , was the pitcher , and the homer came in the final game of the season . The year 1928 was almost as good . The pennant race was a lot closer , but Babe 's fifty-four homers helped win it . Then came his greatest World Series . It was against the St. Louis Cards . The Yankees won in four straight , just as they had against Pittsburgh the year before . The Babe got ten hits in sixteen times at bat for a phenomenal .625 average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resounding homers and making a spectacular catch for the final out . ( Continaed on Page 76 ) 71 ) ( continued from Page 741 The next year we were married . I freely , in fact proudly , admit that I moved in and changed a lot or the Babe 's habits . 1 traveled with him on the road . 1 cut down on his eating , his drinking , his late hours and his friends . Every year from 1929 through 1932 he hit over .340 , batted in more than 135 runs and hit anywhere from forty-one to forty-nine homers . And in 1929 Babe Ruth already was thirty-four years old . So if I curtailed a few of the Babe 's pleasures , I certainly did n't curtail his greatest pleasure  --  playing major-league baseball and playing it well . Babe Ruth and kids went together . Babe was bluff and blunt , but he ' could reduce the shyest of kids to the status of a bosom companion in three minutes or less . I think Babe 's own childhood gave him an affinity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress . I believe he went to see more sick kids than any other man who ever lived . Bill Slocum , one of the Babe 's ghost writers , had a bad moment one morning at breakfast in his own home . There was a picture in the paper of the Babe at a hospital , surrounded by grinning kids . One of Bill 's sons , speaking from the great wisdom and cynicism of his eighteen years , pointed to the picture and said , " Pop , the Babe 's sure a great guy . Always visits kids in hospitals . Accompanied by a photographer . " The elder Slocum set down his coffee cup and regarded his pride and joy with loathing . " For every picture you see of the Babe in a hospital , he visits fifty without publicity , " Slocum said . " Every road trip it 'll happen three or four times . " He explained that if any newspapers knew about it , the hospital told them . Babe did n't . Nor did Slocum . Babe was never a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dorothy , whom Babe and his first wife took from an orphanage and whom Babe and I legally adopted the day we married , He was a good foster father to them  --  perhaps a little strict in some thing , but also overindulgent . His strictness never showed up until young men started calling . Then he could be a tartar . Lord knows he approved of boy meeting girl but , like a lot of men , he felt differently about it when the girl was his own . The girls had a lot of fun with the Babe , though . He was meticulous in seeing that neither girl ever had any reason to feel slighted . A present for one meant a present for the other . A trip for one meant a trip for the other , or we all traveled together . In a sense , Dorothy was brought into our home by Babe , and Julia by me . They were both his daughters to him  --  and , to the very best of my ability , to me . Dorothy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lives in Connecticut and is the mother of four children , a fact that simply would have delighted Babe . Julia married Dick Flanders , who ran an inn up in Kearsarge , New Hampshire . Dick died on January 8 , 1949 . After Dick 's death , Julia married Grant Meloon and had a son , Tammy . They were divorced in 1955 . Today Julia and Tammy live on the beautiful chicken ranch owned by her present husband , Brent Stevens , in Eaton Center , New Hampshire . Naturally I wonder often if any of the Babe 's grandchildren will become ballplayers . I hope they will and I hope they wo n't . Those will be frightening footsteps to follow . He , of course , would have been mad for a son or grandson who could play ball . Babe Ruth was a rich man when he died . He had been a rich man for at least a decade before his death . That fact must have astonished a lot of people  --  none more than Mr. Ruth himself . Until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was twenty-two he was making the remarkable sum  --  for 1917 ? of $10,000 a year . In 1921 he made perhaps $50,000 , including his outside earnings . From 1922 through 1926 , his baseball salary alone was $52,000 a year . and his endorsements in the last couple of years probably more than doubled that . In 1927 and 1928 the Yankees paid him 570,000 a year . plus a winning World Series cut , and he picked up perhaps 575,000 annually in endorsements . And there were no taxes to speak of in those days . Yet , when we were married in the spring of 1929 , he was broke and in debt . That took some doing , but Babe was up to it . Christy Walsh , Babe 's manager for many years , had done a superb job at handling Babe 's affairs . But managing the Babe was something else . Babe spent money as fast as Christy collected it . Christy continued to bring the money in after the Babe and I were married . I handled the Babe . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that a bride can do an awful lot with her husband of a few months that a wife of ten years ca n't do . I got the Babe to abandon the tiresome chore of signing household checks . I said that any time he wanted a check , I would sign it , and I kept my word . But the Babe had to do an awful lot of explaining to pry a check from me that was good for more than fifty dollars . We lived very well . He paid at least $250 for each of his dozens of suits , and I encouraged him in such extravagances . We had a lot of $200,000 years , including 1930 and 1931 , when he was paid 580,000 annually by the Yankees . He also badgered them into giving him $2500 plus 15 per cent of the gate at exhibition games . It is an obvious irony that the second-hardest hitter who ever played baseball spent most of his career in the shadow of my husband . Lou Gehrig was a shy , handsome giant of only twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the streets of New York , but had in him the naivet ? of a farm boy . He attended Columbia University , but always cheerfully insisted , " The only B , A , 1 have is a batting average . " He and the Babe had much in common  --  their religion , their German ancestry , their mutual boyhood poverty , their love for baseball and , of course , their remarkable skill at bat . They were to become fast friends , and bitter enemies  --  and friends again . The one thing that might have been expected to provoke enmity between them was jealousy . But it was an even more common human frailty that split them . It was women who , in my retrospective opinion , talked too much . The Babe and Lou had ten years as teammates . They were the most devas tating back-to-back sluggers ever to make life seem utterly hopeless to a pitcher in a tight game . If the Babe did n't break up the game with a tremendous belt , Lou often did . And more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all that Babe and Lou had in common , there were some contrasts too . Babe 's " parents " had been a home for boys . Lou 's father and mother were earnest , hard-working German-Americans who were janitors in a middle-class apartment house during Lou 's childhood and youth . Babe wanted to go on the town when he could . Lou wanted to build a home for his folks in the suburbs and get back to them just as soon as the ball game was over . Babe hated authority ; Lou accepted it as just and right . Babe loved people ; Lou was a loner , his early shyness replaced by suspicion that came with success . We lived in New York . Lou lived in nearby New Rochelle . Babe and Lou were mad about fishing and spent many hours at it together in the winter . During the season , the New Rochelle house was a handy retreat for Babe , Benny Bengough and Tony Lazzeri . Babe and Benny really understood Mom Gehrig 's inspired German cooking , and her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a constant visitor in New Rochelle . Lou liked her , and Mom Gehrig was crazy about her . And that 's where the trouble started . Dorothy was the kind of child who got very fond of the same two or three sweaters and dresses . Every time she went up to visit in New Rochelle , she brought along the same clothes . Mom Gehrig was outraged that her favorite Ruth girl was n't as well dressed as my natural daughter , Julia . However , her obvious conclusion was wrong . Each child had a rich wardrobe , but Julia was a dresser and Dorothy was all for comfort , particularly in the country . The remainder of the story is predictable . Mom Gehrig said something to a ballplayer 's wife about " poor , little , underfed , badly dressed Dorothy , " The ballplayer 's wife lost the least possible time telling it to another ballplayer 's wife . And you know who heard it next . I told my husband that Dorothy was never going to New Rochelle again in her life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again I 'd  --  oh , you know the rest . The next day the Babe and Lou met in the clubhouse . There was no Ruthian outburst . This was 1933 , and the Babe was too filled with troubles of his own and the pain of playing to tear a clubhouse apart . He simply told the story to Gehrig , and then said , " Never speak to me again off the ball field . " It was that simple , that final  --  and that stupid . This was not a highly publicized breakup , but there was an occasional note in the papers . Usually the writers guessed erroneously that Lou 's wife and I did n't get along . Actually , Lou did n't get married until the fall of 1933 , after the breach had occurred . The new Mrs. Gehrig and I just did n't meet , except on ultra-official occasions where we beamed affably at each other . And so it went until 1939 , several years after the Babe had retired . Babe and I were amazed to hear the unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballplayer go so fast . " His trouble turned out to be far worse than just growing old , of course . Lou , the man of iron , was dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a degenerative spinal disease similar to multiple sclerosis . In May of 1939 he asked Joe McCarthy not to start him in a game in Detroit . It ended the longest playing streak in history-2130 consecutive games , On July 4 , 1939 , the Yankees sent for all of the great stars who had been part 01 the Gehrig saga to pay tribute to Lou . Babe was among the many who took part in the ceremonies at Yankee Stadium . The spectacle of a man who is going to die , talking to 60,000 people , is an awe-inspiring one . Lou was up to it . He spoke of his mother and father , of his wife and of being a Yankee  --  the four things he loved most on earth . Then he said , " I consider myself the luckiest man in the world . " I was conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babe . He walked over to Lou and threw his arms around him . Lou returned the greeting and smiled . Later Babe told me , " Damn it . I went over there because I had to . I wanted to laugh and cheer him up . I wound up crying like a baby . " Two men such as they never deserved to be charged with so base a sin as jealousy . They were too big for it . It 's a shame that all their womenfolk were n't just a little bigger than they were one hot afternoon in 1933 . The finish of Babe 's own playing career had come more slowly . By the end of the 1932 season his legs were gone . He could still hit them a mile  --  and did . And his remarkable arm was as deadly as ever . But he was covering a dime in the outfield and knew it . When 1934 came around , Babe found himself in an intolerable situation . He was unhappy in the field because he knew he was doing badly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of Manager Joe McCarthy , a man he loathed and who loathed him . The mutual loathing between McCarthy and the Babe can be explained succinctly : McCarthy was manager of the New York Yankees , and Babe thought the job should be his . Babe also felt , as did many experts , that anybody managing the players McCarthy had would be a winner . Furthermore , McCarthy had never played a single inning in the big leagues . To Babe , McCarthy was a " busher . " His fellow players shared his dislike for McCarthy . When McCarthy was hired in 1931 to replace Babe 's good Friend , Bob Shawkey , Babe felt he had been slighted . He was furious whenever the question , " How can Ruth manage a ball club if he ca n't manage himself ? " got back to him . He had quieted down considerably since his rollicking youth , and he was dead certain that his of-the-field conduct was , at the very least , equal to McCarthy 's . Finally , in 1932 , Ed Barrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of managing the Newark team in the International League . The Babe could see no reason why he should have to start out in the minors . He rejected the offer . By the 1934 season the Babe 's salary was down to $35.000 . He was thirty-nine years old . He played in only 125 games , batted only .288 and hit only twenty-two home runs , For 1935 the Yankees sent him a contract calling for one dollar . The Babe was through as a Yankee . Meanwhile the Boston Braves were teetering on bankruptcy . Their owner , Judge Emil Fuchs , got permission from the Yankees to talk to the Babe . Babe 's understanding of his deal with Fuchs was clear . He would in time succeed Bill McKechnie as manager . He was technically to be Bill 's boss , because he was signed as a vice president , no less , of the Boston National League Club . He would also play right field whenever his aching body permitted . It was is bad , bad deal for Babe . It was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been bad for 5350,000 . Fuchs was determined to make his investment ( Continued on Page 78 ) ( Commuted from Page 76 ) in Babe Ruth 's managerial hopes pay off to the last dime . He scheduled exhibition games out of all cocie . On May - fifth the Braves were in Pittsburgh , and Babe Ruth hit three towering home runs . It was a remarkable performance for any man , and particularly for an old and heart-sick athlete . He knew this was the moment to quit . I begged him to quit . So did Christy Walsh . " I ca n't quit , dammit ! " Babe roared . " I ca n't . I gave that double-crossing old so-and-so in Boston my word I would n't quit until alter the Memorial Day double-header in Philadelphia . " On June second he called in the newspapermen in Boston and announced that he was through . That third homer he smashed in Pittsburgh had been his 714th big-league home run  --  and his last . Now Babe was out of work . Not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , there were endorsements and  --  when he felt like it  --  lucrative personal appearances . But he heard not a single word from organized baseball . I know no words for his despondency . He kept himself busy with hunting and fishing and golf . Whenever he entered the house , there was always the same unspoken question plastered all over his big , tanned face ? " Any phone calls ? " Sometimes , rarely , there was rage . Now and then there were hot tears of frustration . Oh , how I hated baseball and everything in it in those years ! Why was there no place in baseball for Babe Ruth ? Let 's assume he ca n't manage . II never assumed it , and nobody ever found out. ) // And let 's assume that baseball is a bus , ness , and let 's further agree that baseba had been good to Babe . There still should have been a job Is him . Why not a coaching job ? Some big league coaches are mere pensioner Did n't Babe Ruth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew hi was n't tit to be a really great coach ? One night in 1938 Babe came homy from a fishing trip around nine o'clock He looked at me , and I said , as normall ; as my voice would allow , " Larry Mac Phail is trying to get in touch with you . ' Babe was excited at once . Larry Mac Phail was the general manager of thi Brooklyn Dodgers . Babe called MaePhai at once , then almost ran from the phone " MacPliail wants to see me right now , ' he said , heading toward the door . Babe was back at one in the morning He was bubbling . " MacPhail wants mi as a coach for the rest of the season . I told Larry I 'll appear in all the exhibi. tion games I can , and I 'll give a ten minute hitting exhibition before eact regular and exhibition game . I 'll be the manager next year ! " MacPhail treated us both well that season . There were only two unhappy sides to 1938 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  the Dodgers wound up in seventh place . The other was Leo Durocher , who was play . ing shortstop for the Dodgers . Leo had been a brash rookie with the Yankees when Babe was king . They had disliked each other then , and nothing through the years had changed those feelings . Leo was a remarkably gifted shortstop . Anything his hands could reach they grabbed . It was Babe 's feeling that deft shortstop play was the sum total of Leo 's attractions , During the season , Leo let word get out that Babe had missed an important signal that cost the Dodgers a game . Assuming Babe did miss it  --  just assuming  --  Leo still was guilty of dirty pool . All ballplayers miss signals , and traditionally they confine their mutual recriminations to the privacy of the clubhouse . Babe waited to see if the ax would fall on Burleigh Grimes , who managed the club in 1938 . It fell , as expected . Babe found out about it in the newspapers , and he also found who would succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of baseball once more . He took to the golf course , the fields and streams and the woods . The war came , and the Babe was always available to help sell bonds or do anything else he could . In 1945 the estate of Colonel Ruppert sold the Yankees to two millionaires  --  Del Webb and Dan Topping  --  and Lam MacPhail . Babe took hat in hand , figura. lively , and went to the Yankees begging for a job . He said he would go to Newarl if that was what the Yankees wanted . Hi wrote a couple of letters to that effect te MacPhail and got no answer . Then he telephoned . Larry was mon than cordial . They hung up on Larry ' ; " Sit tight , Babe . You 'll hear from us . ' He did n't . On September 20 , 1946 Babe wrote an abject letter pleading fo anything at all with the Yankees or thei farms . Three weeks later Babe got an answer It was a brush-off , filled with gratuitou advice that Babe work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document , written on the stationery 0 the New York Yankees : October 8 , 194 Mr. Babe Ruth 110 Riverside Drive New York City Dear Babe : I left for Canada on Septernbc 20th and your letter reached me on my rc turn yesterday . It is apparent that some of the veteran material responsible for winning in 1941 , ' 42 , ' 43 will not he available over all of the next five-year period , therefore we will have a major job of rebuilding . It is my carefully considered judgment that the rebuilding of this Club could best he handled by a Manager with considerable experience . When Mr. McCarthy resigned during the season it was practically everyone 's opinion that Dickey was entitled to a chance with the Club . Lack of experience handicapped Bill in meeting present problems and would , I am convinced , similarly handicap anyone else who had not managed here or elsewhere . No one appreciates more than I your contribution to Baseball . After you retired I gave you an executive job on a higher salary basis than most managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Yankees I believe there is a place for you in baseball on a basis which should be acceptable to you . I had this opinion in 1938 , I feel the same way about it today . There is an important job to be done in the Metropolitan New York area in connection with the promotion and development of sand-lot and amateur baseball . I believe the three Major League clubs should aggressively support and subsidize these activities , If you would like to discuss this with me some time , 1 will be glad to meet you at your convenience . With best regards , With this letter the Babe 's hopes died . Soon he began to die . In November of Count among careful drivers the man who is showing his wife how to operate the new Car . S. OMAR BARKER 1946 Dr. Philip MacDonald sent Babe to French Hospital to see if the mystery of agonizing head pains could be diagnosed . It took surgery to diagnose cancer . The Babe did n't know this then . He was never to be told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Yet perhaps he did and was making it as easy for me as he could . After the operation his health improved enough for a trip to Florida for some fishing and a little golf . Then in the spring of 1947 Babe got a baseball job . He got it from an automobile concern , the Ford Motor Company , which was sponsoring American Legion Junior Baseball . Babe was to be the titular head of the program . He would visit ball parks and meet kids . A doctor and a nurse flew with us as we visited such cities as Detroit , Chicago , St. Louis , Billings , Montana ; Seattle , San Francisco . Los Angeles and others in between . After Los Angeles he had to go home by train . Babe underwent some drastic experimental treatment in New York , and it helped . He put on weight and felt somewhat better  --  well enough to accept the Yankees ' invitation to a brilliant promotional stunt , " Babe Ruth Day . " More than 60,000 people showed up . Babe spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , and extended his thanks to everybody who had paid tribute to him that day . Then he trudged slowly back to the dugout , his eyes tilling with tears as he listened to the roaring salute the fans fired back at him . And this time Babe did not cry alone  --  not by many , many thousands did he cry alone . He was to make one more appearance at the stadium On June 13. 1948 , the New York Yankees celebrated the silver anniversary of " The House That Ruth Built . " As in all these promotions , the Yankees . who at times did n't even seen , aware that Babe had a telephone in his home , were clever enough to find his unlisted number and invite him to participate . He stood out there near home plate , so very thin and bent . He had is bat in his hand . Now the bat was no longer a weapon of destruction . It was a thinly disguised support for his trembling body . They cheered and cheered . He took off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the field . The game began . Thirteen days later Doctor MacDonald again took the Babe to a hospital . On the steps Babe looked up , read a sign and said , " Doc , this is Memorial . Memorial is a cancer hospital , Why arc you bringing me here ? " Doctor MacDonald explained that not all patients at Memorial were cancer victims , which was true  --  but not in this case . At the hospital on the evening of August fifteenth I kissed my husband good night , and he said , " Do n't come back tomorrow . I wo n't be here . " I did come back the next morning , and he was there , but only for a little while . He died that morning at 8:01 . I used to think that I was the only one who loved him . In the years to come I was to learn more and more that I was n't . A nation loved him  --  not just because he hit 714 home runs and did all sorts of wonderful things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was one of them . He had their faith and their weaknesses . They loved him because they sensed that he was , above all else , a great human being . And they were  --  and are so right .
