Raskob estate ( TIME , Jan. 7 , 1952 ) , he has , in his own words , " sort of crawled up " the world 's tallest structure . At the start he had a 25% stock interest . Then one evening he had a talk in his suite atop Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria with Railroader Robert R. Young , who had 19% . <P> Said Young : " Henry , you 've got 25 and I 've got 19 . Does n't it make sense for one of us to have 44 ? " Crown agreed , and suggested a price of $45 a share ( v. $30 paid by both ) , gave Young the choice of buying Crown 's holding or selling his own .
