Reported the Department of Agriculture last week with an urgency that broke through the cold officialese : " In many places in the Great Plains , moisture conditions are the worst in recorded history . " The result : after only one month of the normal ( November-May ) annual " blow " season , the acreage of crop and range land damaged by soil-eroding winds in the ten-state area was already three times larger ( almost 2,000,000 acres , one-third of them in Kansas ) than in the same period last year . Moreover , with the peak of the high-wind season yet to come , some 29 million additional acres-up almost 10 million from December 1955-were " in condition to blow " because of pulverized-soil conditions , depleted soil-moisture reserves , inadequate cover and crop residues . <P> On Jan. 13 , announced the White House at week 's end , President Eisenhower will begin a threeday , seven-stop flying tour through the worst-hit of the drought areas , the skeleton-dry southern Plains states , to assess for himself the extent of the damage . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened meeting of farm , business and local government representatives to discuss possible improvements in the Government 's already extensive relief program . No matter how high the new totals may go , ultimate relief can come only from a source uncontrolled by man : the saving beneficence of drenching rain or heavy snow .
