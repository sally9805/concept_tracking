Among the early Marquises de Portago , one helped to drive the Moors from Spain , another conquered the Canary Islands , a third sailed with Conquistador Pnfilo de Narvez unsuccessful expedition to Florida . The current and 17th Marquis de Portago does his dangerous living in the world of sports . At 28. lean and swarthy Alfonso de Portago has been a champion jai-alai player , a fine swimmer , a superb polo player , a leading gentleman jockey , an Olympic bobsled star , and is one of the best sports-car racers in the world . When he rolls his sleek , shovel-nosed 3.5-liter Ferrari up to the starting line for the Florida International twelve-hour Grand Prix of Endurance at Sebring this week , he will be one of three or four favorites in a field of many champions . <P> Fear &; Faith . His passion for sports , Portago says , made him " a dismal failure " at schools in England , France , Spain and Hollywood . No game or adventure proved capable of holding his interest steadily until he discovered car-racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockpit of a Grand Prix racer he knew exactly where he was heading . <P> " Every person wants to do his best , " says Portago , " and I know I am best as an athlete . I knew before 1 raced that I would drive well , and I do . I do n't get afraid , so I have an advantage by going into sports where others might be scared . Adventure is like religion . And in religion you have to have faith . I have faith in myself . " Alfonso is confident that in two years he will be the racing-car champion of the world . <P> Alfonso is frank to admit that he also has another healthy advantage over many competitors . " I have the good fortune to have a private income . Without private funds , drivers have problems with sponsors and such . " As if his income were not enough to keep his American-born wife Carol , a son and a daughter in proper style , the marquis earns about $40,000 a year on the international racing circuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Portago . Before one of his first races ( at Sebring in 1954 ) , he and his co-driver took their car 's gear box apart . When they got it together again , there were 54 nuts and bolts left over . Practical knowledge of their machine 's innards helps other drivers get the most out of their engines . Alfonso keeps a steady foot on the throttle , a sure hand on the wheel and leaves the rest to luck . In a race like this week 's test at Sebring , so much can go wrong that he feels luck is unusually important . The 5.2-mile course has so many tight turns and wicked switchbacks that brakes heat up and fade , clutches tend to wear out under constant shifting .
