Commissioner Bert Bell of the National Football League last week offered a radical suggestion for scoring the professional game : eliminate the point after touchdown and score each touchdown as seven points . As it is , said Bell , the extra point is a " waste of time " ; by eliminating it , " we will do away with the one-point spread in which gamblers are so much interested . " In case of a tie game he proposed an extra " sudden-death " period at the end of the four conventional quarters . After a scoreless extra period , a tie would presumably be called a tie .
