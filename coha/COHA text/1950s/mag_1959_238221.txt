As far as East Germany 's real cool cats were concerned , those Communist cubes over at the Ministry of Culture must have flipped . The music for the Lipsi , the German Democratic Republic 's newly authorized , ideologically correct song-and-dance craze , sounded like a South American nightmare with a boogie beat . It was nothing but a hopped-up minuet in 6/4 time - bogue* , man , real bogue. - The dance steps themselves looked like a mixed-up rumba , laced with old-fashioned open steps that led to a kind of shimmying amble-ticky , man , real ticky. + <P> Bogue or ticky , or just plain goofy , the Lipsi ( a contraction of Lipsia , Latin for Leipzig ) is what East Germany is dancing this week . Its nervous rhythms have been shuffling across the country from Rostock to Dresden ever since last summer when the Ministry of Culture sighted in on rock ' n ' roll . Enough of this " vulgar , Western riot music . " decreed the Culture cubes . And the songwriters got their orders : Give us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of East Germany 's more enterprising pop composers , turned out a sort of double-time waltz . Dance Instructors Helmut and Christa Seifert fitted Dubianski 's efforts with some quickstep choreography , and the comrades from the Culture Ministry announced a " Soviet innovation . " <P> Other songwriters picked up the beat , the nationalized publishing house rushed their efforts into print , and reluctant bandleaders began to climb on the wagon . Even that old turkey-trotter Gerart Eisler turned up to grace a Lipsi demonstration , and his comments suggested that there might be further refinements to come . " Somehow , 80% to 90% of all popular songs deal with love , " complained Gerart . " One can create very comical political lyrics , too . " <P> Today in East Germany , dancing the Lipsi has become a demonstration of Communist faith . Press and radio alike are pushing its doubtful charms . Even the hipsters who still do n't dig it are reading the published directions , in self-defense . " Lipsi can be danced on very small , overcrowded dance floors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just always remember : keep moving in the direction that the man is facing , to avoid unpleasant collisions . " <P> <P> *Basic English translation : phony , + Corny .
