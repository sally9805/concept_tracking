In Washington last week , that eminent scientist , Dr. Vannevar Bush , was called to the telephone by a reporter who wanted guidance on what the new Russian atomic-bomb explosion meant . " I 'm listening to the World Series , as you should be , " retorted the doctor hurriedly . He added , politely : " Giants ahead , six to nothing , " and hung up . Once more the U.S. celebrated the seven days of the long lunch hour , the surreptitious telephone call , the quick office bet , and-to feverish New Yorkers-of the hunt for the ducat , the pasteboard , the seat at the game . BASEBALL FEVER , the sports pages dutifully reported , GRIPPED THE COUNTRY . <P> The U.S. had seldom got the fever so acutely or fallen so wildly in love with one team . The Giants ' astounding last-second playoff victory over Brooklyn threatened to make the World Series itself an anticlimax . But it also captured the nation 's imagination , and when the Giants ' Monte Irvin stole home in the first inning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series was suddenly exciting too . <P> Television brought the games to the biggest baseball audience ever . In Denver , which not only saw its first Series but its first TV , the Series was a sensation . Eighty sets , installed in the lobbies , private suites and show windows of the Brown Palace and Cosmopolitan hotels , drew such crowds that police were forced to throw up barricades to keep them in control . In Chicago , Cleveland , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , New York and dozens of other big cities , TV watchers were almost as excited-they clotted up around dealers ' show windows , jockeyed cunningly for position at bars , ate with their eyes upraised in restaurants which had video screens . In Boston , even a bank-the Statler Branch of the Second National-installed a set . It got crowds too , and the tellers had a hard time keeping their eyes on the money . Wall Street traders followed the games , although stocks were at their highest levels in 20 years . <P> Los Angeles never used to get excited about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and traffic was tied up . Church advertising for Sunday morning was up 20% in an effort to meet the competition . When Sunday 's game was called off on account of rain , one preacher said : " I would call it an act of God . "
