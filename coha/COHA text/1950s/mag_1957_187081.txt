Fifteen of the 20 Latin American countries allow illiterates to vote , furnish colored ballots or party symbols to guide them . Last week Brazil , one of the five remaining holdouts , * moved to drop its literacy requirement . The main force for reform was no left-winging politician but a stiff-backed army officer . Acting more and more like a man who hopes eventually to be elected President , General Henrique Teixeira Lott , 62 , War Minister and staunch army prop of the current regime , got a friendly Congressman to introduce a constitutional amendment killing the literacy test . He has already backed such a measure with a public declaration of faith in the masses . <P> If passed , the amendment would more than double the electorate-from 15 million to about 35 million . It would shake the country 's power alignments so drastically that politicians from the backlands to the halls of Congress are deep in awed speculation about the future . Within the two-party coalition that elected President Juscelino Kubitschek. the amendment would bring new votes to the leftist Labor Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . Consequently , Vice President Joao ( " Jango " ) Goulart , P.T.B. 's boss , quickly announced his support . The gain for the conservatively inclined Social Democrats ( P.S.D. ) - Ku- bitschek 's own party-might well be proportionately less . But on the theory that the measure will hurt the rightist , oppositionist National Democratic Union even more , President Kubitschek unhesitatingly came out for the amendment last week . Though some of his own P.S.D. Congressmen will balk , sentiment adds up in favor of passage . <P> <P> * The others : ' Peru , Chile , Ecuador and Honduras .
