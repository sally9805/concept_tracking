Under giant paired portraits of Nasser and President Voroshilov , strapping paratroopers mounted honor guard . " Hail , leader of the Arab world ! " shouted a drilled student group . Thousands excused from work lined the roads to the city , carrying Nasser pictures and waving little United Arab Republic flags in the bright spring sunshine .
