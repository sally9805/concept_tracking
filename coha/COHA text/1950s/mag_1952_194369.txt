WESTERN EUROPE <P> " As the world is knit together today , there is nowhere where American influence does not count , nowhere where it may not be markedly beneficent , " wrote London 's Spectator last week . " Nothing indeed demonstrates that more clearly than the sense of vacuum created when <P> America has for a brief interval to mark time in her diplomatic activity . " In Paris , the Socialist Le Populaire waited less patiently for the U.S. election to be over : " This period of uncertainty . . . has been largely responsible for the many misunderstandings between European states and the U.S. in ... the last few weeks . " <P> " Unhappy State . " The sense of vacuum resulted partly from the State Department 's tendency to postpone hard decisions ; but shrewd foreign offices abroad also hesitated to accept promises from or make commitments to a State Department whose mandate was hanging on an election . And so , without effective prodding from the U.S. , the European Army plan languished , unratified by the two most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its grievances against the U.S. ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) ; NATO adjured its member nations to meet their 1952 armament targets , and feared they would n't . In Britain last week , Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden announced that he would visit the U.S. and seek an interview with the new President . Proposed agenda : 1 ) " the unhappy state of affairs " in the Atlantic alliance ; 2 ) a " rather fundamental reconsideration of the attitude of the Western allies toward each other . " <P> Self Reliance . This rather fundamental reconsideration has been going on for months as one European nation after another found its feet and began chafing uneasily under its " client-patron " relationship with the U.S. European governments , reported New York Times Correspondent Michael Hoffman in Geneva , " are awfully tired of feeling dependent on the United States . " <P> Sometimes the surge toward self-reliance bursts into the kind of truculence , resentment or restiveness that sets American taxpayers to muttering about rank ingratitude . In Britain , the yellow press makes cheap capital out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manning U.S. bomber bases there . In Italy , a U.S. official reported that he could detect " by osmosis " that Italians are getting a little tired of U.S. advice . <P> But , much more healthily , Europe 's businessmen are conducting an all-out campaign for " Trade , Not Aid . " Last week , five U.S. allies-Denmark , The Netherlands , Canada , Australia and New Zealand-charged that U.S. tariff restrictions on imported dairy products are a flagrant violation of the worldwide General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . " It is incomprehensible , " said a Danish delegate to GATT , " that the U.S. prefers to continue to assist us through dollar grants from the American taxpayer . . . instead of allowing us to pay in goods for dollars we urgently need to buy American products . " The Dutch , even angrier , slapped a retaliatory tariff on U.S. flour imports . <P> In short , part of the vehemence reflects the fact that the patient is getting well enough to feel cantankerous.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
