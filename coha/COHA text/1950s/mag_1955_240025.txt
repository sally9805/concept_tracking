THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION 1917 ( 691 pp. ) -N . N. Sukhanov-Oxford ( $ 10 ) . <P> <P> Nikolai Nikolayevich Sukhanov was the first candid cameraman of the Russian Revolution : in seven volumes , he chronicled its events with movie vividness . As an original member of the Executive Committee of the first Soviet , he also co-directed the early scenes . Sukhanov was an economist , the editor ( under Maxim Gorky ) of the radical newspaper New Life , and a maverick Marxist . Although he himself knew almost everyone who made the revolution , he is today virtually forgotten except among professional historians . His seven-volume work was first published in 1922 , but it has just now been pruned to a single volume and translated into English by Joel Carmichael , onetime OSS officer . The book does little to change the familiar picture , but , unlike most such tomes , it has an eyewitness excitement that makes it even harder to lay down than to lift . <P> " Stations Everyone ! " It is difficult to believe , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare . In late February 1917 , hoodlums , soapbox orators and strikers swirled through the streets of Petrograd . By a kind of spontaneous combustion , troops joined the demonstrators and fired on the police . Anarchy and heady illusion were in the air : " Ahead everything was completely different , unknown , wonderful . . . Surely all this was an illusion , nonsense , all a dream . Was n't it time to wake up ? " <P> The revolution woke up with two heads : the Provisional Government led by Social Revolutionary Alexander Kerensky , with the ideal of a Western-style democratic regime ; and the Soviet of Workers ' and Soldiers ' Deputies , a clashing spectrum of radical parties ( mostly Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries , with a few Bolsheviks ) holding Socialist aims . On this Socialist family drama , Author Sukhanov lavishes the meticulous attention which an American sometimes devotes to a close pennant race . He also studs his chronicle with high-level vignettes . Among the more vivid : <P> Kerensky , then 35 , skittishly mistaking a few stray shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a counterrevolution , leaps to the windowsill and bellows hoarsely : " Stations everyone ! . . . Listen to me-I , Kerensky , am speaking to you , Kerensky is speaking to you ! Defend your freedom and the revolution . . . Stations everyone ! " <P> Trotsky , making his maiden speech before unfriendly Deputies of the Soviet . " He did not expect any sympathy . And to make it worse-his cuff kept constantly shooting out of his sleeve and threatening to fall on the heads of his nearest listeners . " <P> Lenin , arriving at the Finland station in the famous " sealed train " in the middle of the night while a band blares the Marseillaise and a searchlight knifes the sky and startles the crowd . " Lenin came , or rather ran , into the waiting room . He wore a round cap , his face looked frozen , and there was a magnificent bouquet in his hands . " Lenin toys with his flowers , stares at the ceiling , and gives a short pep talk , ending with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
