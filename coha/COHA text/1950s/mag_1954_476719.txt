Marriage prospects , social customs , hobbies , and buying habits of this generation are being radically upset by that most prosaic of men ? the Daily Commuter . The two articles which examine this little-understood upheaval are the last writing job completed by the late editor of Harper 's . A FEW months ago the editors of Fortune went into a huddle and , after elaborate and careful calculations , produced the statement that as many as nine million people have moved to the suburbs of American cities since 1947 , and that as a result there are now thirty million suburbanites in the United States ; a record number , and by a large margin . The growth of Suburbia , said the editors , " is portentous even in a country accustomed to talking of growth in superlatives . " The accuracy of their count may be open to challenge , but there can be little doubt that they put their finger on one of the major ' hanges of our time , which seems destined to alter the face of the land and affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The editors of Fortune did not classify as suburbanites everybody who lives on the outskirts of our big cities , or their figures would have been much larger . They included only those who work in the city but " prefer to live where there is more open space " : those who are attempting to enjoy , if not the best of two worlds , at least something of the respective blessings of two worlds , the world of the city and the world of the country . In our modern civilization , the metropolis is an almost irresistible magnet . For generations there has been a continuing drift of men and women from the countryside to the cities , and especially to the biggest ones . For the metropolis is where . by and large . the big money , the big decisions , and the big reputations are made . It is the nucleus of power . It is GHQ . It is the place to go for shows , crowds , dazzle , and adventure . And so , decade after decade , it pulls toward it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers of excitement , the young men and women who want to be at the center of things , where opportunity may be around the next corner and there is a feeling in the air that anything may happen . ' Barn , whang , whang goes the drum , tootle-te-tootle the fife . Oh for a day in the city square , there is no such pleasure in lifer And also , because of its very size and anonymity , it offers that comparative privacy which to some wears the face of loneliness , but . to the independent-minded offers freedom to choose their own kind of living . But likewise ? and especially since the beginning of the automobile age ? the metropolis has repelled a considerable number of those whom it drew to it : repelled them with its noise , soot , fumes , barren pavements , traffic tie-ups , nervous pressures , and inhuman dimensions , and especially with the apparent unsuitability of the . life it imposes upon small children . It has not repelled many of these people all the way back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ; what it has done has been to hold them within its sphere of influence like so many planets ? or , more literally , to drive them part way out of town , to attempt to live by the city and yet in the country : to enjoy the power and glory of the city and yet at the same time , by daily travel , to enjoy quiet in place of its noise , clean fresh air and uninhibited sunshine in place of its soot and fumes , greenery and gardens in place of its barren pavements , living space in place of its congestion , peace in place of its nervous pressures , a neighborly village life in place of its vast anonymity , and an environment in which children will be able to work and play naturally . Such a combination of contrasting values seems temptingly easy . Rapid transit systems , good commuter service on the railroads , and above all the automobile make it , for the time being , at least physically possible . But for his effort the commuter pays a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obvious one is the sheer cost , in time and energy , of commuting , of repetitive , self-canceling travel . Suppose a man lives 25 miles from his office ( not an excessive distance for a commuter ) : that means some 50 miles of travel a day , 250 miles a week , 12,000 miles a year ? perhaps nearly half a million miles in a lifetime of commuting , without getting anywhere he has not been before . Or to put the cost in terms of time , a man who puts in three hours a day in transit , over a period of forty years , will have devoted considerably over three of those forty years to the mere business of getting there and back . He may have utilized much of this time in reading the paper , or looking over reports , or enjoying bridge games ; but these arc mitigations of an interminable slavery to the 7:59 and the 5:25 . And there is a curious spiritual cost , too , in that his life is strangely divided . He belongs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-dues-paying , and therefore onlypartly responsible member . He belongs to his suburb , but only as a part-time person who spends the best of his daylight hours , and of his energies , in exile from it . As my wife once put it , his heart and his treasure are twenty miles apart . He becomes something like a split . personality , playing one role by day and another by night and over the weekends . And even his wife , though she may spend nearly all her time in the suburb , is subconsciously aware that during the day it is only half a community , an unnatural manless matriarchy . No wonder she busies herself furiously in organizations of all sorts , as if to rid herself of the frustrating feeling that the place where things are really going on is somewhere else , and that meanwhile she is condemned to play the part . of a conscientious and hard-working waiting-room attendant . The Unbalanced Suburb N OT only is the life of a suburban com- community out of balance during the day ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of balance all the time . Take , for instance , the make-up of its population . The standard , traditional pattern has been for young couples to move to Suburbia after marriage ? most likely when their first child approaches the active age and they are confronted with the problems of play-space and schooling . When the children are grown , the parents in some cases return to the city . IE they do not , their unmarried daughters seem more likely to remain with them than their sons are . Perhaps , too , widows and divorcees are more likely to remain than their male equivalents . Anyhow , the result is likely to be a shortage of young and middle-aged males in Suburbia . This , of course , is by no means a uniform phenomenon . A careful study of the 1950 population figures for the areas where the Census Bureau has broken these down by age groups , shows no heavy preponderance of young women in some towns which had a considerable semi-independent life of their own before they attracted commuters in quantity . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walpole , Massachusetts , census tract , for example , women in the 20-to45 year bracket outnumber men in the same age-group only slightly-1,768 women to 1,588 men ; for the Lincoln , Massachusetts , census tract the figures are 476 women to 380 men ; in Cohasset , there are 683 women to 603 men ; and in Weston the numbers arc almost even-921 women to 885 men . But in some of the long-established suburbs outside other cities the preponderance of young women is striking : in Winnetka and Highland Park outside Chicago , for instance , and in Shaker Heights outside Cleveland . In the four census tracts in Shaker Heights , for example , women between 20 and 45 outnumber men by 2,250 to 1,567 . BUT it is in some of the New York suburbs prosperous communities which have been almost completely suburban in character for a generation or more ? that the disparity in numbers between the young people of the two sexes tends to be most acute . In Bronxville , for instance , according to the 1950 figures , women between 20 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two ; in Scarsdale and Bedford , more than three to two ; and there was actually one census tract in Scarsdale ? lying between the Bronx River and the White Plains Post Road ? in which , between the ages of 20 and 45 , there were 842 women to only 453 men ! Polygamy not being in good repute there , the situation of the surplus women might seem a little unfavorable . ( Where , - you may ask , arc the men ? Well , , some are at ' college or doing graduate work ; for the first ' time , the census of 1950 listed such people at their places of study rather than at their home addresses . Some are in the armed forces . Some are at work in far places , or in industrial areas ; some simply prefer the independence of the city , though not in sufficient numbers to prevent women from outnumbering men in every one of the five boroughs of New York . In any case , the shortage of unmarried men in many a suburb produces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one other tends to be out of balance : of similar houses which appeal to people in the same income bracket ; and also zoning regulations ; and also , of course , the natural preference of most commuters , who feel more comfortable when surrounded by people of more or less similar status . We all enjoy , naturally , having the bulk of our intimate , day-to-day contacts with those who look at things with eyes like our own ; but the tendency , today , to group together large numbers of people of the same economic status in housing projects , housing developments , and suburban areas may tend to insulate them from the problems and preferences of those in other sections of the population , and thus hinder that approach to the classless civilization which is such a source of American strength . A NOTHER special characteristic of Suburbia is that the suburban region inevitably is always changing . Now of course change is everywhere in American life=in the city and in the countryside as well as in the suburb . But it is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place of residence with a hopeful eye to peace , space , and stability , and all these values are threatened by the changes about him ; and also , of course , because the transformation of Suburbia is so particularly rapid . Men and women who bought houses with delightful prospects over hill and dale find the prospects cut off by new housing developments ; the grove of trees beyond the garden becomes Woodmere Acres or Colonial Estates . Men and women who wanted to live in a settled community find neighbors moving away and new ones coming in . Parents who join the Parent-Teacher Association and go diligently to school meetings , and who think before long that they are acquainted with the leading dramatis personae of the village disputes , discover , the next year , that a new group of people they 've never heard of have organized a new attack upon the school problems . And the change is continuous and relentless . The more families flee the city for the deep tangled - ivildwood , the less deep , tangled , and wild does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations with all his heart . They represent , it is true , a kind of governmental interference with private enterprise which in another context he might regard with black disfavor ; but in fact they appeal to the most conservative instincts in his nature , as protectors of the status quo . And it is fortunate that they do appeal to him ; for zoning is one of the few effective instruments available to impose some sort of orderly restraint upon the otherwise disorderly growth of Suburbia . Yet even zoning regulations can not stop the influx of newcomers , though they can divert and channel it ; and in ? one way or another the process of change continues , placing new and unexpected difficulties in the way of the family which moved out in the hope of being able to combine the opportunities of the city with the peace of the country . Five Chapters of Change T HE headlong changes of today have had their antecedents . I think we might divide the story of Suburbia to date into five chapters ? overlapping chapters , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began late in the nineteenth century , when the number of year-round commuters first became considerable . Up to that time , many well-to-do people had had country places outside the city to which they repaired for at least part of the year , and of course some of them had had large estates in the outskirts ; but it was not until the latter years of the century , generally speaking , that numerous people who had lived part of the year at , let us say , Milton outside Boston , or on the Main Line outside Philadelphia , or at Lake Forest , or at Webster Groves , began to remain in such places for the winter ; that , contrariwise , the sons and daughters of the outlying villages began in large numbers to take city jobs to which they traveled daily ; and that the regular commuters , who chose to live " forty-five minutes from Broadway , " invaded these outlying villages in such numbers as to give them a truly suburban quality . ( The date was later for the younger cities than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles and Detroit the pattern ? especially the subsequent pattern ? was distorted : in Los Angeles several suburbs came to rival the city nucleus in importance , and in Detroit the outlying industrial areas likewise became the tail that wagged the dog . ) This first period we might call the horseand-buggy era of Suburbia , for the commuters were pretty well confined to the narrow belts of land within walking distance of railroad stations and trolley lines , except for those fortunate few who could afford a coachman to harness the horse and drive them to the station , and , after the turn of the century , the growing number of those who could swing the cost of that unreliable luxury , the a utomobi le . THE second chapter brought a striking change . It began at about the close of World War I ? say about 1919 or 1920 ? and covered roughly the nineteen-twentiesthe era of the automobile revolution , during which the number of cars registered in the United States , which had been less than 21/9 million in 1915 and had increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to 261/9 million in 1930 . When the automobile became something that almost anybody might own , and the open car gave way to the closed one which you could leave at the station in any weather , and there was a terrific spate of road-building and road-improving , all at once large areas of previously inaccessible land were opened up for suburban living . The subdivider appeared in force ; farmer Jones 's pasture was crisscrossed with paved streets to become Lakehurst Gardens ; the short plat-. form at the railroad station was lengthened , and lengthened yet again , to make room for the growing army of candidates for the 8:10 train ; and community after community began the long stern chase to keep up with the parking problem . Many a town which had previously regarded itself as partly independent of the city suddenly found its original inhabitants outnumbered by the " city people , " who  - -  to the rage of these original inhabitants in some cases ? captured control of the school system and imposed new-fangled zoning regulations upon the community . Suburbia was growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteen-twenties built houses , they tended to be romantic about it , and what . their architects and builders produced for them was , by and large , eclectic : an English-type half-timbered house would rise alongside a Spanish villa , with an American federal-type mansion or a Dutch colonial one cheek-by-jowl . Could the owners of those houses have better expressed their wish to get away , by night , from the ugliness of the commercial world that supported them by day , and to recapture gracious ways of living that they associated with English country houses , or European estates , or the mansions of an earlier , supposedly unspoiled America ? with , of course , up-to-date plumb-ing ? In the minds of some of the commuters the suburban dream included something else , too ; they wanted to he able to put their roots down . When a man built an ample English country house in an American suburb and carved the date 1922 over the front door , was n't it part of his dream that he was founding an estate that would go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surroundings ? Yet already the automobile age was beginning to frustrate that dream , for every new subdivision that was opened up was destined to change those surroundings beyond repair . FTER the panic of 1929 the process of change slowed down , and presently , as the Great Depression deepened , it came almost to a halt as we entered the third of our five periods , the fifteen-year period of Depression and World War II , which we might call the era of fringe development and of filling in the chinks . During the early nine-teen-thirties the economic paralysis of the nation brought new building nearly to a standstill . During the latter nineteen-thirties there was considerable construction of modest houses and of suburban apartment houses ( where these were permitted by zoning regu-lations ) ; the more outlying parts of the cities themselves tended to spread until the gaps between them and the more favored suburbs were almost closed ; and there was continuing activity along those interurban highways which Lewis Mumford and Benton Mackaye once called " Roadtown , " with their filling stations , used-car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ramshackle dwellings . The government meanwhile poured money into the construction of ma-jestic parkways , bridges , tunnels , trunk high-ways , and cloverleaf intersections . Then again the process of change was slowed by the wartime shortages of the early nineteen-forties , except where the government built clusters of war workers ' housing . The net result was that between 1930 and 1945 the change in Suburbia was less than sensational , and the growth of the suburban population just about kept pace with the growth of the population at large . But since World War II the change has been swift . We have entered the fourth and fifth chapters of the history of Suburbia . These are overlapping chapters in point of time , but they represent two such strikingly different kinds of change that I should like to discuss them separately . Chapter IV is the postwar boom in housing for GI veterans and other young families , which may have passed its peak though it is still continuing ; Chapter V is the discovery of the suburbs by business , which began a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear . The Mass-Produced Suburbs T HE postwar boom in GI housing has been a nation-wide phenomenon , comprising developments both large and small ; but to see it on the grand scale you should visit one of the new mass-produced suburbs such as Park Forest outside Chicago , or Lakewood outside Los Angeles , or Levittown , Long Island . These have been observed and described with such faithful care by W. H. Whyte , Jr. , writing in Fortune , and by Harry Henderson , writing in Harper 's , that I shall not attempt here a long account of them . Suffice it to say that they are wholly astonishing places . Finding a large . almost unoccupied piece of land within striking distance of a city , the developer has built on it a whole town of very similar houses , applying the economies of mass producion to the fierce demand for housing which was caused by the halt in building during the war and by the rising marriage rate and birthrate of the nineteen-forties . These suburbs were built for the young people of an intensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their parental duties seriously ; who can not afford servants and would not know what to do with them if they had them ; who enjoy sharing the work in and about the house ; who fully subscribe to the do-it-yourself credo of a generation of household tinkerers ; and who subscribe equally fully to the current cult of informality , getting into slacks or shorts as soon as they reach the suburb and continuing to wear them until they leave for town . These new towns have been laid out with a more thoughtful eye to the realities of the automobile age than most of their predecessors . Levittown , for instance , has wide boulevards for through traffic , well separated from the houses , which stand along narrower , curving roads ; the houses themselves arc not severely crowded , having ample front grass-plots and room in the rear for gardens ; and there is a commendable variety in exterior design and especially in texture and color , so as to mitigate the endless monotony of thousands upon thousands of basically similar houses on fiat land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch-type , of which the latest variant is " split-level " ; they tend to be one-story or storyand-a-half houses , with agreeably long roof lines . One that I went through in an outlying part of New Rochelle , New York , was selling for $25,750 , a rather high price for such communities ; it had , typically , a picture window for the living-room , a dining area off the living-room , a kitchen waiting for the latest mechanical equipment , and , up a few steps ( above the garage ) , three bedrooms and two baths . The garage was built for two cars , not one . The walls were shingled , and prospective purchasers were informed that they might have " optional brick front on living-room pane/ . " To a visitor from another area , or from an earlier decade , such houses would seem very small but pleasantly simple and unpretentious , and extraordinarily mechanized ; I noted that by in.ying some $1,250 extra one could get the house I looked at fully air-conditioned . Physically , they represent a characteristically American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery ; spiritually , they represent an abandonment of the dream of old-world charm that flourished in the twenties , and of the dream of old-fashioned American cottage living that accompanied it and then tended to supersede it in the thirties . Today 's dream looks westward to California , and ? even on Long Island ? envisions a happy family in Technicolor slacks and Hawaiian shirts having a barbecue feast onthe terrace , all smiling as in the latest ads . These are very gregarious communities , in which people wander in and out of one an-other 's houses without invitation , and organize themselves into everything from car pools to PTAs and hobby clubs of numerous sorts ; and in which the churches are much more important institutions than anyone who was brought up in the twenties or thirties would have imagined they would be . Such gregarious communities are paradises for the well-adjusted ; by the same token , they are less inviting to residents who prefer a modicum of seclusion and resist being expected to live up to ? or down to ? the loneses . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time being at least , are on one economic level ? according to Mr. Henderson , the incomes range mostly from $4,000 to $7,000 a year ? but are occupied by people who , again for the time being , nearly all belong to the same age-group . The passage of years will undoubtedly modify somewhat this latter peculiarity ; but at present these new suburbs tend to combine that segregation by income level , which I have already referred to as a somewhat dubious suburban tendency , with a segregation by age-group , which has become at least a temporary feature of much recent mass housing . A firm believer in diversity , who would like to see more , not less , mixing together on easy terms of people of different economic fortunes , different age-groups , and different occupations and pre-occupations , can not help wondering if these larger new suburbs can escape being natural breeding grounds for conformity . Business Discovers the Suburbs S IMULTANEOUSLY with the postwar boom in housing we have been witnessing another phenomenon which I call Chapter V of the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always , of course , suburbanites have been served by local markets , local grocery and supply stores , and other local enterprises for their day-to-day needs ; but in earlier days they went to the city for their major purchases . In the nineteen-thirties , however , some of the major department stores and luxury stores began to establish suburban branches to snare out-of-town shoppers in at least the neighborhoods of their own lairs . The movement became successful , was interrupted by World War II , and then was resumed at an even faster pace , especially in the New York area ; so that as long ago as the end of 1951 , when the Regional Plan Association compiled a list of suburban branch stores in the environs of New York , it was able to count as many as eighty ? thirty of them in Westchester and Fairfield Counties , twenty-one in northern New Jersey , and twenty-nine on Long Island . And presently the movement took on a new and portentous shape with the advent of regional shopping centers . THE idea of the regional shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , to the experience of Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward with their **26;895;TOOLONG retail stores , built in the nineteen-thirties , and to the success of small shopping centers. in southern California , which had demonstrated that plenty of room to park was more of a magnet for shoppers than proximity to the glitter ? arid congestion ? of crowded urban centers . These successes led to the location of Bullock 's department store at the edge of Pasadena , and to the building of the Crenshaw shopping center and others in the Los Angeles area . But as embodied at Shoppers ' World near Framingham , outside Boston , and at Northgate outside Seattle , the regional shopping center is really something quite new : a group of stores , usually including one or more big department stores , situated all by themselves , remote from any city center ? even sometimes in otherwise open country ? but provided with convenient access from highways , very ample and convenient parking space , and facilities for rest and festivity . ( Victor Gruen , one of the leading architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might include " greenhouses , play areas , band shells , outdoor theaters , outdoor fashion shows , miniature zoos , outdoor shows of painting and sculpture , flower shows , picnic grounds . " ) By now the idea has become so epidemic that it would be wearisome to list all the regional shopping centers which are under construction or in contemplation outside one or another of our major cities . Suffice it tomention the biggest : one in immediate prospect , which may have opened before these words see print : Northland , outside Detroit . Its principal feature is a department store operated by the J. L. Hudson Company , but according to the plans it will include also some seventy other stores , will cover in all over 450 acres , and will be able to park 7,000 cars ! HERE , surely , is a revolutionary step toward that " urban decentralization " which the regional plan experts have been hopefully talking about for a generatiOn . And now still another step , of another sort , is being taken , however uncertainly . Branch stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be already there ; but the movement of business headquarters to the suburbs is something else again . And this , too , is under way , especially in Westchester County outside New York , where the county association has reported that sixty-nine corporations , employing more than 20,000 persons , are establishing new buildings in the area . Here again there are precedents for what is happening . There have always been major businesses which did not think it necessary to have their focus of operations in a big city . Nevertheless it is news when such a big national outfit as the General Foods Corporation decides to move its headquarters ? with 1,200 people ? from New York to White Plains , some twenty-three miles to the north ; when the American Telephone Company decides that its long-distance lines shall he managed from White Plains ; when Union Carbide &; Carbon at least acquires land for a move , even though the move is now stalled ; when General Electric buys a tract of territory north of White Plains ; and when a long list of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westchester or are flirting with the idea . Drive east from White Plains toward Port Chester along Westchester Avenue and you can see the portents of the change . On your right , on a hillside , stands the severe brick triple building which will house General Foods . Across the way , in the woods of the former Whitelaw Reid estate , the trucks roil in with materials for the rising headquarters of Allstate Insurance ; and deeper in those woods we are told that we may find , later , the central offices of Standard Vacuum Oil Company . How far will this new movement go ? That is anybody 's guess . Clearly a move to a suburban location would be folly for a business whose chief officials need to be in frequent contact with bankers , lawyers , advertising agencies , news sources , buyers , or other visitors to the metropolitan crossroads . ( Clearly , too , the movement is so young that some of the problems which will emerge can not now be envisioned . Some of the social problems for the personnel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women employees in regions where there may be shortages of eligible men . ) But there are types of concerns which do not need to live at the crossroads ? such as experimental laboratories , which may need to receive only occasional contracts , or insurance companies , which build their businesses largely through agents . For such concerns the potential advantages are clear ; clean air , light : , quiet , and agreeable places to live within easy motoring distance . And in the thinking of some executives , comparative safety from atomic bombing isan undeniable element . Guess as you will about the future of this trend ; I would venture to say only that I think it is more likely to continue than to come to an early end . Well , there you have the five chapters of the story of Suburbia : first , the horse-and-buggy era of settlements along the railroads and trolley lines ; second , the opening of new areas by the automobile revolution of the nineteen-twenties ; third , the era of fringe development and filling in the chinks during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mass-produced housing for young couples ; and fifth , the discovery of the suburbs for business , for branch stores , for regional shopping centers , and for business headquarters . These latter changes , since 1915 , are bringing about , at full gallop , a transformation which seems bound to alter profoundly the living conditions of those who now inhabit the suburbs , and even to affect strikingly all the rest of us wherever we may live . ' What shape this transformation is likely to take , and what the prospect demands of us right now , before it is too late , I shall try to show in another article next month .
