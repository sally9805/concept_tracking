Like much of the U.S. population at the turn of the century . Theodore Roosevelt suffered periodically from what was unhandily called cholera morbus-an acute inflammation of the digestive tract , with diarrhea , cramps and vomiting . He took " cholera " medicine with him on his hunting trips to Wyoming 's Big Horns . But it was not until after T.R. became President that the prime cause of cholera morbus became known : spoiled food . <P> Spoiled food was a result of urbanization . In the 19th century U.S. farms and small towns , every housewife was an alert guardian of the freshness of the food she fed her family . But the growth of U.S. cities meant packing food and shipping it unrefrigerated for long distances . <P> It took a lot of education to convince most citizens ( including T.R. ) that good food could turn to poison . One such educator was a testy Department of Agriculture chemist . Dr. Harvey Washington ( " Old Borax " ) Wiley , who got a volunteer " poison squad " to eat spoiling food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In The Jungle , Muckraker Upton Sinclair rubbed the nation 's nose in the filth of Chicago packing plants . On June 30 , 1906 , Teddy Roosevelt rode to the Capitol and ceremoniously signed the first U.S. Food and Drugs Act , to protect the people 's stomach from willful or careless poisoning . <P> Last week a robust Food &; Drug Administration celebrated its 50th anniversary . Each year it passes judgment on the edibility , potability or safety of products worth more than $60 billion . Each week it removes an average of 98 tons of contaminated food from the market-enough to feed poisonous meals to 131,000 people . It has driven from the nation 's drugstore shelves such once popular devices as eye-cup-like gadgets to restore sight , has purged labels of fanciful prose ; e.g. , one imaginative drugmaker touted ordinary sarsaparilla as a cure for everything from " female complaints " to syphilis . Today it approves license applications for 600 new drugs a year , modifications in 4,000 to 5,000 others . It certifies every batch of insulin made and marketed in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A policeman is rarely popular , but reputable makers and marketers of foods and drugs are deeply grateful to FDA for bringing peace and order to a once chaotic business . Its top job has traditionally gone to career men , and industry has violently opposed any attempt by politicians to make it a patronage plum . Current FDA boss is George P. Larrick , 54 , who entered the service as an inspector , was promoted to the commissionership in 1954 . <P> In 1955 FDA took 1,300 cases to Federal courts , won 98% without contest , won four-fifths of the 2% contested . Among last week 's batch of decisions : <P> New York City 's Stella D'Oro Biscuit Co. was found guilty of selling baked goods fouled with rodent hair , was fined $3,000 on each of four counts . <P> Herbalist William H. Cruez of East St. Louis , Ill. , who sold worthless concoctions to FDA inspectors posing as sufferers from arthritis , diabetes and swollen feet , was sentenced to a year in jail .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
