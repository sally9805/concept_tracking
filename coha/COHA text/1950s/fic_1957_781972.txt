Having carried out your own responsibility in the matter , you could with a clear conscience leave us on the faculty to deal ? But I 'm sure you follow my meaning . " " Yes , sir , I follow it perfectly , " said Paul , without the trace of a smile . " I 'll certainly cooperate with you the same as everyone else . " Thorley beamed . " Thank you , King . I was sure you 'd feel that way . Now then , I have several more appointments , I 'll be talking to you again . " They both got to their feet , and old Thorley actually came around the desk and led Paul to the door . " Oh , one more thing .

( : ooei afternoon , King . Is my threefifteen appointment here , M iss Pepper ? " For the last ten minutes Pall had limn bolding it in .

The Dramatics Club was trying to decide on the big spring  | play , but his jokes nearly broke up the meeting several times . And then , when that homely Carol Fleming , the chairman , tried to get them back to serious business , he was ten times more serious than anybody else . And in the end , just to amuse himself , just for the hell of it , he forced through Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar against everybody 's opposition . Going home in the subway that night he started a friendly fight with Mike Fuller . They wrestled on the floor of the car for ten minutes . And when it was over , he was hardly tired out at all . Then he was alone on the crosstown bus . It was twilight . The shop windows were blinking on , people were rushing along the streets . He stared out of the bus , gobbling up every sight , and still there was n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tossed his books across his room from the doorway . A perfect shot , right on the bed . A big hug and kiss for Mother , till she gasped and laughed , " Darling , my permanent ! " A funny look on Ellen 's face . What did he care ? He kept up a running chatter all through dinner . What happened at school , the robbery , his talk with old Thorley . All sorts of funny details about the way old Thorley clasped his hands and cleared his throat . Dad roared at them , and came out with some of his favorite remarks about the incompetence and impracticality of people who went in for teaching . The coffee was brought in . Paul took a sip , opened his mouth to start another story ? and suddenly discovered that all the energy , all the elation had gone out of him . Just a flat empty feeling in their place . It always happened this way , he thought . In the twinkling of an eye ? just when he was starting to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . " Why does the coffee in this house always have to taste like dishwater ? " " Tastes pretty good to me , boy , " Dad said . " I do n't notice it , dear , " Mother said . " Maybe you 're right , though . Come to think of it ? "  | " Lousy coffee , " Paul said . " Lousy food . Dull ! Why does everything have to be so goddamned dull ? " He jumped up from his chair and walked out of the room . In his own room he threw himself down on his bed . He tightened his fists , as if he was getting ready for something . For what ? What did he want ? Did he want to cry ? Did he want to yell and pound the pillow ? What the hell did he want ? He wanted things to be good again . Like the good old days , when he had the secret club . IIe wanted the Assistant Grand Mogul again , somebody you could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's the matter with you anyway ? " He whirled around and sat up on the bed . Ellen was in the room , looking down at him . " Why are you acting this way ? Going into tantrums like a little baby . " With anybody else he would have snapped back immediately , Mind your own business ! Who 's the baby , I 'd like to know , making a big deal out of nothing ? But Ellen 's cold look took the fight out of him . Suddenly all he wanted was to drive that cold look off her face . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I just ? I had a tough test in school today . " " You were feeling pretty good vheu you first came in . " " Well , the strain c , nmht imp wit Ii no ' . You know how it is . " She did n't answer this . After a while she said , " What is it , Paul ? What 's on your mind lately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the books say about ? " " Never mind the jokes . You do n't have to make jokes with me . If you do n't want to talk to me , all you have to do is say so . They stared at each other for what seemed like a long time . It was as if there was something they both wanted to say ? the same thing ? but neither of them could find the way to say it .  | He broke the silence at last , with a smile . " Listen , sister dear . I 'm fine . I 've never been better in my life . I 'm going out to a dance tonight , and I 'll have a wonderful time . I 'm touched by your concern ? " he was on his feet now , he went over to her and put an arm around her shoulder ? " but believe me , you do n't have to worry . " He could feel her slowly relaxing .

But before you leave this house you apologize to Mother and Dad . Otherwise sister dear is going to give you a walloping , the way she used to do when you were a lot smaller , though certainly not more childish , than you are today . " " I 'll apologize , " Paul said , giving her a kiss on the cheek , " if you promise to give me the walloping anyway . " An hour later he left the house , and climbed into the car next to Carl . They drove in silence up to Mamaroneck . He did n't even ask to take the wheel . He was calmer now , his anger was gone . But he was still feeling restless , he still had that vague sense of moving in the wrong direction , of going real fast without getting any closer to what he wanted . Well , maybe he would find some nice sweet innocent little thing at the dance tonight , and she would help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better . V THE Spreading Chestnut Country Club was located in Mamaroneck , among those flowing hills and long vistas which seem to have been created by God for the express purpose of providing mankind with golf courses . The club building was white and  | sprawling , with impressive colonial pillars in front and a view of the eighteenth hole from the screened-in dining room in back . On sunny days this view was a glittering picture postcard , in all shades of green and white . At night the colors softened , became misty and melancholy to suit the gentle spring breezes . The club had just built a new open-air dance floor behind the dining room . It had been paid for by five years of extra assessments on the membership , and the inevitable questions were already being asked : How the devil had the House Committee managed to expend so much time and money with such comparatively insignificant results ? Five years , thousands of dollars , and was this all they could show for it ? But no trace of this bitterness infected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social event to make use of the new dance floor , and everybody was determined to be gas ' . Under a canopy of orange light , confetti streamers , Japanese lanterns bobbing in the air , the dancers moved , slow and solemn , or fast and frantic . The girls were dressed in fluffy low-cut evening gowns , the boys were holding their heads up stiffly over bow ties , shirt studs , and their fathers ' cuff links . Around the square of light the spectators stood , their faces partially shadowed  --  the intent calculating faces of the stag line , the beaming indulgent faces oI ' a handful of proud parents . And still further from the center , shadowy figures , gray and purple , strolled among the trees , two by two , with one head tilted down earnestly toward the other head . Occasionally one of these shadow-couples would come to a stop , and the heads would merge for a moment . Off at the corner of the club building , in a small lighted circle of its own , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , pouring , stirring , measuring , wielding shakers , slapping down one order and moving right on without a break to the next one . There was a steady crush of people , mostly boys , pushing up to the counter , shouting till they got what they wanted , then being  | elbowed away by the next in line . At the extreme corner Barry Morris had taken over one small area for himself . There he had planted himself , heavy and immovable , for almost an hour . Nobody tried to challenge him for his place . He was starting on his fourth rye and ginger ale . How he hated the stuff ! He choked a little at every swallow . And the taste of the ginger ale was n't even covering up the taste of the whiskey any more . But he forced himself to gulp down another mouthful . He was going to do it no matter how much it disgusted him . He would keep on drinking all night , until he was too sick to think , until the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . What he needed was more air . Clear himself up a little , then he could make a fresh start . He turned from the bar , and still holding his glass he started to push through the crowd . It was no effort at all , they seemed to melt away in front of him . Then he was out on the lawn , he was steadying himself against a tree . His stomach felt funny . Not used to this . Going to be very sick . All right , fine , what could be better ? " What could be better ? " His voice sounded funny . Thick . He tried it again , louder . " What could be better ? Get sick . That 'll show them . " Just as funny . Seemed to put off the sickness , though . Only temporary . The sickness was coming back , nothing could stop it . Maybe if he shouted loud enough . " That 'll show them ! Normal ! I am normal ! " Girl over there , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her away . Why was his head going around so fast ? Not just one direction , every direction all at once . He felt himself falling , then something hard under his arm . Tree again ? No , it was n't . " Take it easy , kid . " Ile looked up . Face , sging back and forth in front of his eyes . Like those awful Japanese lanterns . Familiar face , strong hand under his arm . Light hair , thin lips , eyes laughing at him . A shiver went through him , his head was almost clear for a second .  | Could it really be ? After all his waiting ? No , no , was n't that at all , things were whirling again , all mixed up again . " Come on , we better get you to the john . Now hold it in just a little longer , for God 's sake . " Hand on his arm , helping him along . " Yes ? I 'm holding it in ? just a little longer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer , how much longer ? King . That was who it was . Paul King . Never said five words to me before . Cots around with the seniors . No longer , just ca n't do it . " Just ca n't do it ? " " Sure you can . We 're alnx , st there now . " " Yes , I can . If you say so . Anvthing you tell me ? " In the bar of tl , e West Side Chess and Checkers Club , Henry Morris and Charlie ( : liliord sat at a corner table and drank highballs . Henry was still liaising along his first one while Charlie was finishing up his third . ( ; liurlie 's chinking had increased lately , and Henry could n't hell ) wondering if this was such a good thing for a doctor . It did n't seen , to bother Charlie , though . His mind seemed to be as char as ( ' yer . I IV was never at a loss for cynical wisecracks. his reputation as a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charlie was saying . " Why is it that they always have to do things backwards ? A hundred tines a day my time is wasted by hysterical females whose hearts are as sound as the U.S. Treasury , every one of them insisting she 's a bundle of murmurs and thromboses , and she 's going to drop dead on the street if I do n't load her up with pills . And meanwhile , what about her husband ? He 's got a heart that is liable to run down at a moment 's notice . Who would n't , after thirty years with that woman ? But will ' he  | take my advice and give himself a good long vacation for once in his life ? Oh no , that would be too easy ! IIe just grunts and makes insulting remarks about doctors , and early next morning he 's down at his office again , driving himself into his grave . He just ca n't wait to pop off so that his widow can collect his insurance money and spend it annoying half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her bed at the age of ninety-three ! " He signaled the waiter for another drink . " Tell me , Henry , do n't you ever get sick and tired of this world full of Mongoloid idiots ? " " Well , I see what you mean , Charlie . Only ? there 's something else I 'd like to talk to you about just now . Sort of serious . " " Shoot . You know there 's nothing I like better than giving free advice . As long as it is n't about your heart , of course . In that case , I 'll have to charge my usual fee . " " No , it 's nothing to do with my health . I could n't be healthier . It 's ? well , it 's about my boy . I 'm worried about him . " " Why are you worried ? He 's a good kid , from all you 've told me . Gets good marks at school . Does n't make a lot of racket . If you ask me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had when we were their age . Now if someone would only teach them to use them ? " " Yes , he 's a fine boy , there 's no doubt of that , I do n't have any complaints about him . What it is ? Charlie , I think maybe the boy is n't very happy at home . " " Now why should n't he be happy at home ? Where do you get some of these ideas of yours ? You give him everything he wants , do n't you ? And if you 've still got that same cook you had five years ago , at your anniversary party ? well , any time your boy wants to move into my hotel , and let me take his place at your dinner table ? " Yes , but it 's not that , Henry . We give him things ? but it 's the  | way he acts sometimes . He looks so worried and tired sometimes . He looks as if he 's carrying the whole weight of the world on his shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids that age are the same . Big idealists . They think they can personally cure all the troubles of the world . Time enough later on for them to find out how wrong they are . " " Yes , but ? you see , I 've been wondering if it really is the same with Barry as it is with other boys his age . I mean ? there 's his mother , you see . I mean , she knows so much about psychology and adolescence and so on . But sometimes I wonder if I do n't leave things up to her too much ? " " Waiter ! " Charlie said . " I'ni finished with this an hour ago , how about a refill ? Now you 're talking a lot of nonsense , Henry . Naturally a mother spends more time over her kid than a father does . He 's out winning the bread , do n't forget . But that does n't mean you do n't exercise a great influence on the boy . I 've known plenty of fathers in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're one of the had ones ? " Yes , hilt ? You 're sure about this , Charlie ? You 're sure the boy is happy , and there 's nothing for me to worry about ? " " I 'm positive of it . At the age of sixteen every kid thinks he 's got problems . By the time he 's seventeen he 's forgotten all about them , he 's busy with a whole new set . " " You 're not just trying to put inc in a good mood or something ? " " Would I go out of my way to put anybody/ in a good mood ? You 've got nothing to worry about , 1 give you my personal guarantee . " Henry looked at his friend hard , but Charlie was busy with his glass , his eyes were turned away . After a moment Henry sighed and took a sip from his own glass .  | " Are you feeling better now ? " Paul asked . A faint " Yes " came from the figure kneeling in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . Do n't get tip till you 're sure it 's all right . " Paul took a step back and lit a cigarette . That was funny , he was usually pretty careful who saw him smoking . His father did n't want him to do it , so Paul did it only in privacy or in front of his closest friends . He took a slow puff and began to study the new acquaintance at his feet . A fairly miserable-looking acquaintance at the moment . Face slightly green , teeth chattering , shoulders shaking . Nobody looks his best , God knows , when he 's on his knees on a bathroom floor , vomiting into the toilet . Especially a big awkward kid like this . And Paul could n't help smiling a little . Now why was he playing the Good Samaritan like this anyway ? It was n't exactly the kind of entertainment he had planned for this evening . He had been at the dance for a couple of hours , and time had n't been hanging heavy on his hands . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with parents or older in-laws . And he had done a lot of cutting in on girls with dates . He had been amusing himself with one of his favorite casual party pastimes , trying to talk them into deserting their escorts and slipping off with him for the rest of the night . Once or twice he had come pretty close to success . He could tell from the brightening of the girl 's eyes , the slight parting of her lips . All he had to do was press his advantage a little further . But tonight he had n't cared to go any further . And pretty soon he had got tired of the game . Then he saw this kid leaning against a tree , in the shadows around the dance floor . He saw him swaying , and he came up to break his fall . Just another kid . Jonathan Herbert 's cousin . Paul was n't even sure of his name . Barry or Larry something . He had  | seen him earlier today , outside the dining hall , there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head was raised , he was speaking in a weak voice . " I think I can get up now . " " Sure you can . Not exactly used to the stuff , are you ? " " Yes , I ? No , I guess I 'm not . " Paul put a hand under his arm and helped him to his feet . He was still a little shaky , and there was n't much color in his face . " The best thing for you right now is a little fresh air . " They went out of the washroom tnmcl started down the corridor together . The sound of the band , loud and jumpy , was in their ears again . The kid stopped short . " II ' you do n't mind ? maybe , until I 'm all better , if I could stay away from the crowd . " " Good idea . We 'll go oiit to the front porch . " They turned away from t he music and headed for the front entrance , with its tall white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ' ; nml could see a touch of color coming into the kid 's cheeks . They moved down to the end of the porch where the light was cline . They leaned against the railing and looked out at the driveway with its rows of poplars . " You do n't have to stay herd with me , " the kid said . " You probably want to get hack to the dance . " " Nobody 's waiting for mime at the dance . I might as well hang around till you 're okay . " He heard a small intake of breath at his side . A sound of relief ? The kid was glad that he was n't going to be alone ? " I was getting bored with this affair anyway , " Paul said . The music from the dance floor sounded faintly through the cool air . Something soft and sentimental was being played now , with that babyish whine that Paul heard in most of the music he danced to . He took out his cigarettes and offered one .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Paul shrugged and lit his cigarette . " As a matter of fact ? " The kid gave a sudden laugh , a little nervous . " I 've never had the courage to try . Smoking , I mean . " Paul looked at him curiously . " Why do you need courage ? " " I do n't know . You do n't , I guess . Its ' just ? I always think I 'll get sick from it , and start coughing or something . I do n't like the taste of it anyway . " " Nobody does at first . You have to take a chance . Otherwise you do n't get any fun out of things . " " Well , I do n't get much fun out of things , I guess . " A moment later the kid added quickly , " I mean , I have plenty of fun , I 've got lots of friends and all . I just get into moods sometimes . I 'm no different from anybody else really . " He turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything , " Paul said . " All you need is somebody to show you how . " His voice was a little absent and mechanical . He puffed his cigarette and gazed out at the driveway again . For a long time they were silent , with only the muffled sound of the music in the distance . Paul dropped his cigarette and ground it out under his shoe . " We might as well go back now . " He took a step along the porch , then realized he was n't being followed . " Are n't you coming ? " The heavy figure was still , the face blurred by the shadows . " I do n't think I will . " " Are you still feeling sick ? " " I 'm feeling fine . I was feeling fine before , when we left the washroom . " The voice trembled a little . " I do n't want to go back there . The way I acted in front of people . You go ahead , and thanks . " Paul did n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll call a cab and go back to the city . " For just a second Paul hesitated . When he finally spoke , it was  | as if he had known all along , quite naturally and easily , what he was going to say . " My car is waiting . My father 's car and chauffeur , that is . He 'll drive us back . " " But it 's early yet . You do n't want to leave the dance . " " I guess I can decide for myself what I want to do . " " But ? " " You certainly make life complicated for yourself , do n't you ? " Paul laughed , then gestured in the direction of the driveway . " Follow me . " He walked down the porch steps arid along the driveway , conscious of the heavy uncertain footsteps behind him . Just before they reached the lighted parking space , the footsteps quickened and the kid was by his side . " Wait ? listen ? " They stopped again . ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking into . There was color in it now , a smile twitched at the corners of the muth . " You should know who you 're giving a lift to , should n't you ? 1'nm Barry Morris . " lie held out his hand . " I 've seen you around , " fail said . " I 'm Paul King . " " Yes . " A flush came into Barry Morris 's face . " I know who you are , of course . " Paul looked at hint with an extra little jump of interest . They shook hands quickly . The room was dark . Harriet King could hear her husband 's breathing from the next bed . She could n't be sure if he was asleep or not . If he was , he would be awfully annoyed if she woke him up . And anyway , there was no reason why she could n't wait till morning to speak to him . Another three minutes went by , and then she spoke up , " Arthur , are you asleep ? " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | She heard a low sigh come out of him . " Not now , anyway . " " I was just thinking , dear . That was a funny thing at dinner , was n't it ? " " What was funny at dinner ? The way that cook of yours never seems to remember how I like my steak ? Sure , that was hilarious . " " I mean , about Paul . Losing his temper like that . " " Why should n't he lose his temper ? He gets it from his old man . That struck you as funny , did it ? " " Well ? I do n't know . I was just thinking ? Those things that Ellen said this morning . That there 's something the matter with Paul . Acting funny lately and all . " " What about it ? " She could hear the tenseness coming into his voice . She paused for a moment , confused . Then she went on , " Well , I mean ? do you think there could be anything to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She observed wrong this time . There 's nothing to it . " " Yes , but she 's been studying psychology at college , and ? " " And I 've been studying psychology all my life . How do you think I ever got anywhere in business ? " " Yes , but ? " " Drop it , Harriet . These college girls nowadays all get their heads filled with a lot of crazy ideas . Am I supposed to run my life by that ? There 's nothing the matter with our boy . He 's a terrific kid , a real leader . Everybody says so . Drop the subject , and let me get some sleep . " " Yes ? but Arthur , suppose we 're wrong . Suppose there is something that we do n't know about ? " " Shut up ! " he said , and even without seeing his face she could tell how terribly angry he was . " I do n't want to hear any more about it ! "  | Silence closed around them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her heart was beating fast . But she did n't say another word . Paul and Barry sat in the back of the car . Mostly they were silent . Every once in a while Paul gave a direction to the chauffeur . " Take the East Side Drive , Carl . Less traffic this time of night . " Barry was amazed at the cool confident tone Paul used . Barry could never have used such a tone to his father 's chauffeur . Even when he was absolutely obliged to give the chauffeur an order , he always had a guilty feeling abort it . As they turned off the East Side Drive in the city , Paul leaned forward again . " I 'm not going home yet , Carl . Drop us off at the corner of Madison . " Ile turned to Barry . " There 's a coffee shop there . You could use a cup of coffee , could n't you ? " Barry nodded .

Then they went through the glass doors and to a booth in back . " Two coffees , " Paul said , when the waitress hovered over them . The waitress moved away . Paid laughed , and suddenly he clapped his hands together . In that moment , as if in relief from the silence and restraint of the car , an air of celebration was established . He took a breath and started talking . Nobody had ever talked to Barry like this before . There were plenty of talkers among his friends , and he had sat in on his share of windy bull sessions , but the talk had never before been turned so directly , so warmly on him . At first he just listened , with a vague smile on his face . And then , after a while , in the spell of  | the laughter and the sweeping gestures , he started talking back . They talked about school . Paul had his opinion of all the teachers , and an impersonation went with each opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreed with one or two . Then Paul defended them , he brought out a string of reasons , he turned Barry 's answers into jokes , friendly but devastating , until Barry had to give in . They talked about books . Paul was a tremendous reader . This surprised Barry . He had always thought of Paul King as the athletic type , the dumb nonreading type . But Paul had gone through the widest variety of books , he had read a novel by Dostoevsky , and a book about dreams by Sigmund Freud , and every single one of the Ellery Queen stories . He had read books that Barry had never heard of . Barry made a mental note of the titles , he would take them out of the library first thing in the morning . Then they talked about the dance tonight . Paul confessed his contempt for such affairs . A lot of babies pretending to be grownups , silly girls getting an innocent thrill out of playing around on the edges of sex . Barry nodded in agreement , though this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . The talk turned to girls in general . Paul grew louder and more excited . He told stories about himself which made Barry 's eyes widen . If anybody else had told him such stories , he probably would have felt terribly uncomfortable , even a little frightened . But the way Paul told them , dashing them off sort of half intense and half joking , they sounded just wonderful . Then Paul trailed off into silence . More coffee was ordered . Barry started the talk up again , softly now , hesitantly . " Things come so easy for you , " he said . " Take girls . I watch them . I think what it would be like . I do n't know anything about them at all . Except that I 'm afraid . " He broke off , blushing . " I 've never told that to anybody before . " Paul kept up the quiet tone . " I 've told you things too . It 's silly  | to be afraid of things . I 've never been afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The books say it 's the way your parents treat you , " Barry said .

She gets mad at me sometimes , but it 's all for my own good . " " That 's the trouble maybe , " Paul said . " Whenever they want you to do things , they 'll tell you it 's for your own good . It 's for their good really , you have to remember that . You have to know how to handle them . " " Do you know how to handle them ? " " I 've always known how . It comes naturally to me , I guess . It is n't parents that bother me . Or teachers , or counselors , or anybody else . It 's keeping yourself from being bored to death . " Barry was a little puzzled at tlhis . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't get bored . " * Barry nodded . " You heard what happened at school last night ? Somebody breaking in and stealing things and all ? That was me . I was the one who broke into the school . " He stopped talking again . The clinking of cups and silverware sounded very loud in Barry 's ears . When he started in again , Paul 's voice came faster . " I planned it for three weeks . You have to plan these things carefully . I broke a window in back . Then I forced open old Thorley 's office with a screwdriver . IT bet you do n't know how hard it is to force  | a door . A dozen times I was sure I heard footsteps and I was going to be caught . But I did n't run , I did n't let it get me . When I got into the office , I did n't know exactly what I was going to do there . I had n't figured that out yet . Then I saw that collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stuffed my pockets with them , and ran out of there , and I threw the pipes in a trash basket at the subway . And nobody knows a thing , nobody suspects me for a minute ! " He stopped talking . His breathing was coming fast . He and Barry watched each other across the table . Finally Barry said , " Were n't you awfully scared ? " Paul smiled , his manner became casual and easy again . " No time to notice if I was scared . I would n't be scared to do it again , I can tell you that . " He smiled in silence for a moment , then he leaned forward and his voice grew solemn . " You promise you wo n't tell anybody about this ? " Barry 's eyes were wider than ever . His gaze never turned for a moment from Paul 's face . " I promise , " he said . " Anything you ask me to do . " " We 've got a pact then . " They did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his answer was almost a whisper . " We 've got a pact . " It was after one o'clock when they left the coffee shop and said good night on the sidewalk in front . The city was silent as they turned and moved off in opposite directions . Half an hour later they were in their own rooms , less than ten blocks apart . It was a long time before either of them could fall asleep .  | ... We live in an age of scientific explanations . No matter what men do , no matter what monstrous acts of cruelty and violence they commit , science is ready with an explanation . We must not let ourselves be confused by this . We must not be tricked into believing that an explanation is an excuse . All the scientific explanations in the world can not excuse what these two boys did in the woods that terrible afternoon . The counsel for the defense may bombard us at length with complexes , frustrations , wish fulfillments , and other psychological jargon , but our answer simply is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense may move us to tears with his eloquent pictures of neglectful parents and lonely children , but our answer remains unchanged : the woods that afternoon ! . . . ? From District Attorney Frank L. Patterson 's summation , The People vs . Barry Morris and Paul King  | IT WAS June , and school would be over in a week . The last days of school are always full of a special excitement . For the senior class this is a time of trying on caps and gowns , exchanging business letters with deans and bursars , " facing the future " and " accepting the responsibilities of maturity " and " straightening out the mess which we the older generation have made of the world . " For the lower classes this is a time of taking tests , going to the final play , observing an unaccustomed air of joviality in Mr. Thorley , watching teachers unbend and tell jokes . But nobody is quite as excited as the junior class . For they know that , at the end of summer vacation , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will be able to strut through the halls , condescendingly accepting the awe of the lower orders . As keenly as the present senior class may be looking forward to straightening out the mess which the older generation has made of the world , the junior class is looking forward even more keenly to straightening out the mess which the senior class has made of the school . Barry Morris was feeling lighthearted along with everybody else . A big load had just been lifted from him . He had finally managed to get his own way about this summer vacation . In the past Mother and Dad had sent him up to Camp Moheekee in Maine for the summer . This was an expensive boys ' camp on a lake , run along " progressively psychological " lines ? that is , if you did n't want to play baseball , you did n't have to , you could work in the  | arts-and-crafts shop instead . Barry had liked it well enough up there ? he was n't the type of boy who got homesick . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as ever . And then , in the middle of May , he told her he wanted to stay in New York instead . He could get a part-time job with the Museum of Natural History . They were looking for interested high-school students to help catalogue the mineral collections . He could n't remember when he had ever seen Mother get so upset over anything . For an hour she told him , in a dozen different ways , how unreasonable he was being . She even came close to betraying a touch of unreasonableness herself . Somehow it seemed to be much harder these ( lays for Mother to keep up that calmness and coolness of hers and prevent other things from peeping through . Anyway , Barry held out against all her logic , all her talk about the healthy outdoor life , the importance of getting along in the group community , the abnormality of poking around among rucks at his age . He told her that he enjoyed poking around among those rocks , and that was what he wanted to do for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what she said . In the end , only three nights before the close of school , she gave in . She put on her serenest smile and told him that his father and she , having thought the natter over , agreed that the experience of independence which this nncseuul job would give him might possibly outweigh its disadvantages . Therefore , they would grant him their permission to remain in the city this summer , provided he spent his week ends at the country club , where he could get the benefit of fresh air , exercise , and the company of other young people . " As long as this is what you really want to do , " she said , and there was just a trace of perplexity in her voice . " Frankly , I never imagined this rock business was so important to you . " The morning after this victory he used his first free period to look for Paul and tell him the good news . He found him in the  | school auditorium at a rehearsal of the final play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute or two of conversation with him , because Paul was playing Marc Antony and he was needed up on the stage most of the time . " Well , it 's all fixed , " Barry said . " They 're letting me stay in the city . " He waited a little anxiously , until he saw a sign of enthusiasm on Paul 's face . Just a slight twitching of his lips under that casual air , but it was enough to show Barry that he was pleased . " Did n't I tell you ? " Paul said . " All you had to do was hold on tight , do n't let them move you an inch . Make up your mind you wo n't give in , and pretty soon they have to give in . That 's how I 've always worked it . " " Well , you were certainly right , " Barry said . " Only , I 'll bet it never takes you such a long time . " " Practice , that 's all it is . " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of charm . Treat them to the right kind of smile , and they 'll fall all over themselves to do favors for you . " " That 's the part I 'll never learn , I guess . You have to be born with that . " " Paul started to answer when a voice called out from the front of the auditorium , " Marc Antony , wanted on stage ! " " See you later , " Paul said . And then , with a sudden smile , " We 'll have a great summer . " Barry slipped into a seat in the back and watched the rehearsal for a while . It was Paul 's big scene , where he meets the conspirators over Julius Caesar 's body . He had all sorts of emotions in this scene . He had to be grief-stricken for his dead master , full of hate for the murderers , terribly crafty in pretending to approve of what they had done . He certainly threw himself into these emotions . His voice trembled with grief , he waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he came to the crafty part ? well , nobody had ever been so crafty , so full of hypocritical  | smiles and screwed-up eyebrows . It was the most wonderful acting in the world . How could he do it ? How could he stand up on a stage in front of people and go through all those contortions and never feel the least bit scared or self-conscious ? The bell rang , free period was over . As he slipped out of the auditorium , Barry could hear Paul 's voice bellowing after him : Cry " Havoc , " and let slip the ( logs of war ? And so Barry started off on his first summer in New York since he was seven . He worked hard at the museum , and the assistant curator told him he had " a genuine scientific mind . " On Sundays he went up to the country club with Mother and Dad , learned how to play golf and how to drive the car , and let himself be bored stiff by people like his cousin Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of off-color jokes to a new girl every week . The rest of ' the time , whenever he could , he was with Paul . They got together nearly every night , sometimes having dinner at each other 's homes , sometimes meeting somewhere after dinner or driving somewhere in Paul 's car . His father 's car actually , but Paul had his junior license now , and he was allowed to go driving whenever he liked . Paul and he never did aniv thing particularly unusual when they met . Sometimes they went to the movies . They went to everything  --  westerns , historical dramas , religious spectacles , sentimental little tales about a boy and his dog . They spent most of the time popping chocolate-covered raisins into their mouths and making wisecracks about the picture , to the annoyance of the people sitting around them . Barry used to amuse himself like this with Johnnie Dykeman ? Johnnie could be especially hilarious at the boy-and-dog pictures ? but it had never been as much fun as it was now , with Paul . Sometimes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a dance or a party . They got a little drunk , and  | maybe picked up a couple of girls and took them out in the car . Or if the girls had come with other boys , sometimes they doubledated them later on . Barry had always worried about the shyness which he felt with girls , so the first time Paul suggested one of these exploits he fidgeted and tried to get out of it . But Paul just laughed and asked him what he was scared of . " They 're human , just like you , " Paul said . " But I 'm not really much of a ladies ' man , " Barry said . " Every man is a ladies ' man . All you have to do is keep in mind that they 're ten times as anxious to impress you as you are to impress them . You 're doing them a favor . Keep that in mind , and you 'll have a good time . " When Barry still made excuses , Paul said , " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 're not going to spoil things for me . If you want to come along with me , okay . If you do n't ? well , good-by . " It was the first time Paul had ever showed annoyance at him . He answered uncertainly , " All right , if that 's how you feel , Paul ? " Paul 's voice softened immediately . " I did n't say that was how I felt . I want you to come along . But look , you have to stop making such a big thing out of nothing . It 's just a way of having a little fun . It 's like going to the movies , it does n't mean anything . Come on now ? " his hand was on Barry 's shoulder ? " leave it to me , put yourself in my hands . You know what you told me once . Anything I asked you to do . " The shyness was as strong in Barry as ever . But some things are stronger than shyness . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief came over him , the way you feel when you lean back in the water and let yourself be floated along . After that there were lots of dances and parties , and lots of girls in the car . Pretty soon Barry stopped feeling afraid of them . After all , it was always the same thing , no different from what you expected ,  | nothing more than a habit , and how can you be afraid of a habit ? You can be disgusted by it a little ? but then , just because it 's a habit , you do n't have to think about it too much . Besides , half the time , nothing really happened between the girl and him . And things did n't happen so often between Paul and his girl either , Barry was a little surprised to see . Not so often as Paul had led him to suppose , anyway . One thing never quite became a habit to him , though ? the craziness that sometimes took hold of Paul when he got behind the wheel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his moods . Yes , Paul got into moods , Barry found out about them soon enough in the course of their friendship . They 'd be going along fine for an evening , with Barry quite sure they were having a good time , and all of a sudden Paul 's lips would tighten and his eyes would narrow , and he would give one of his outbursts about boredom . The sickening unbearable boredom ! My God , it was more than a person could stand ! And his foot would squeeze down on the gas , his hands would clench on the steering wheel , the sharp jump of speed would bring a hump to Barry 's throat . " Paul ? listen , " he would say . " Are n't you going a little too fast ? " But a quick laugh and another jump of speed would freeze him to silence . He would just have to sit quietly , as the road ripped under the car , until hit by bit Paul 's mouth would relax and the speed would begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to tell Paul what this sort of thing did to him . But the only answer he ever got was a laugh . " You 're a little baby , are n't you ? Still a baby , after all . " And after that , Paul would be in such high spirits , so full of jokes and plans , that Barry could n't keep himself from loosening up too . Before long the whole episode in the car would fade out of his mind , and he would be enjoying his friend 's company as eagerly as ever . There was one thing that mattered to him more than anything  | else ? and it seemed to matter just as much to Paul . Whatever they may have done , whomever they may have been with , eventually they would separate themselves from everyone else and end the evening together . If they were on a date , they would see the girls home and then be left to themselves . If they had argued , no matter how bitterly , they would never stamp off in anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , until the anger had passed , and then they would settle down in some bar or coffee place and talk for one final hour . They would talk a little about the movie they had seen or the girls they had been with . They would talk about the detective story Paul was reading , or the music Barry was listening to . He followed Paul 's book recommendations faithfully , though he could never get Paul to give more than halfhearted attention to music . Then they would fall silent for a moment or two , preparing themselves for the subject they always arrived at before they separated ? their friendship , what an amazing thing it was , what a piece of luck , how easily they might have missed each other at that dance in the spring , how different their lives would have been if they had . The fascination of this subject was so deep that few words were needed . Only enough to call up a smile or two , and they both seemed to feel that the day might now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their coffee , and Paul would drive Barry home , both conscious of the dark empty streets around them and the tall buildings rising up on every side . They loved New York . Barry did anyway , and he was sure that Paul did too . Why had n't he ever felt it before , this quiet contented love for the city ? Why had it grown up in him so suddenly over the summer ? Finally the car pulled up at Barry 's door , and he and Paul said good night . And their handshake , no matter how quick or casual , always seemed to be a renewal of that solemn pact they had made in the spring .  | What was that pact really ? What did they get from each other which held them together so tightly ? It was a terrible mystery to Barry . Whenever he thought about it , he ended up convinced that they did n't get anything from each other . At least , Paul did n't get anything from him . Paul was so popular and sure of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What could he possibly get from a dumpy , awkward , out-of-place nobody like Barry Morris ? Suppose it was all a whim on Paul 's part , just an offhand bit of amusement , because it was summer and most of his friends were out of town . Suppose , when the summer ended and school started again , Paul decided to drop him as abruptly as he had taken up with him ? But Barry never let himself think about this for long . The summer was still in its prime , it would n't be over for ages . And then it was the last week in August . The days were shortening . The nights were growing cool . People were coming back into the city , the traffic was getting heavier . At dinner one night Mother told him that the school had just sent her an official announcement of its opening ( late . Summer was over now . He could n't pretend that it was n't . Paul thought , " Why ca n't things ever last for me ? " That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd be going along with something , getting a kick out of it , thinking , " This is right , this is what I want , I 'm happy . " Amid all of a sudden , from nowhere at all , it was n't right , it was n't what he wanted . End of being happy , beginning of the itch inside of him , the little itch that started out light as a feather but grew and grew until it was a torture to him . So what was he going to do about it ? Do something about it ? pretty soon this got to be the biggest thing in his life . Hurry up and do it , so things could be right again . The first week of school brought it all back to him again . The  | summer had been wonderful , no getting around that . There were moments , of course ? Only moments , though , they passed away quickly . And the rest of the time it was like being free as a bird . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soaring up above everybody else , all the room in the world to move around in , wave his arms , shout and laugh as loud as he pleased . And Barry Morris right by his side all the time . Sometimes he felt a little twinge of uneasiness when he thought of Barry . Never much trouble to shrug this off , though . He remembered the bright look in the kid 's eyes . The kid , why did he think of him as the kid ? There was only a few months ' difference in their ages . Happiness , that 's what the bright look meant . Paul was glad to see it . It proved he was n't just being selfish , did n't it ? This was friendship , the first real one he 'd ever had . Give and take . Friends have to do things for each other . Look what he did for Barry . Everybody noticed it , the big improvement in him over the summer . Poise , charm , self-confidence . Where did they suppose he picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend . And for the summer , this was enough for Paul . Just the driving around together , going on dates together , sneering at movies together . Nothing else necessary . None of the old craziness , for instance . The nighttime trips . And then the summer was over . Well , what 's a person supposed to do anyway ? Are you supposed to grit your teeth and let the boredom drive you crazy ? Are n't you supposed to get any fun out of life ? Other people get fun out of life , all the fun they damn well like , and nobody tells them there 's anything wrong with it . Do n't they show up at their offices next morning , slapping backs , giving orders , looking smug and pleased with themselves ? It 's a hard world , you have to take what you want . Was n't he Paul King , Boy Criminal ? Well , that was play-acting , of course . But just the same ? The only thing was , what about Barry ? Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid . Paul could imagine the big  | scene . Big shocked eyes , gasps and gulps and other assorted expressions of horror . He had to go along , though . No good if he did n't , not after this summer . Well , what was the big problem anyway ? Was there anything Paul could n't make him do ? It would only take some maneuvering . The first step was to get him a little worried . Put him on the defensive , make him think he was out of favor . Later on , then , he 'd be only too happy to make things up , he 'd be ready to agree to anything . He did it in little ways . Little ways are always the most effective . Just the slightest cooling in the tone of his voice . And a trick he developed of turning away and talking to somebody else just as Barry was about to tell him something . And a lot could be done with the busy-man act . " Paul , I 'm glad I found you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , I 'm in a hurry , only a minute to history ? " Or , " Sorry , ca n't drive you home tonight , important meeting of the ? Two weeks of this treatment , and he could see the effects already . Lines on Barry 's face , shadows under his eyes . Beginning to lose his sleep , was he ? And a funny trembling in his voice every time he came up and said a word . Almost ready now , but not quite . A week or two more , a few more twists , not quite painful enough yet . Not painful , not really . Not as if he was doing it to give pain . Better for Barry in the long run . Because it could n't be good for their friendship , this itch inside of him . The itch had to be stopped . Friends should help each other in their troubles . One more week of it , that ought to do it . Saturday night they had dates , a couple of girls from the junior class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dull . On Friday afternoon , he stopped Barry in the hall . " I ca n't make it tomorrow night . I already told Agnes . You can take out Barbara by yourself . "  | " But Paul ? " " Have fun . Do n't do anything I would n't do . " He walked off fast . He could imagine the eyes opening wide behind him , the face turning pale . His phone kept ringing that night . IIe told his mother not to disturb him , he was busy with homework . The next day , Saturday , he left the house early and went to the first football game of the season . One of the fellows gave a party that night , and Paul stayed late . Dull party , dull people . He guzzled liquor and imagined what Barry was going through . Saddled all night long with that silly girl , forced to talk to her , keep her amused , and all the time worrying and wondering , asking himself what he had done to offend his friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it just as hard on Paul ? Was he supposed to be enjoying himself , pouring whiskey down his throat so he could stand the stupid yapping of these idiots ? Did n't he want to be happy again too , the way he had been in the summer ? Sunday morning he waited for a phone call . It came at ten thirty . " Hello , Paul . Listen , I have to see you . " " What 's that ? You 're talking too fast , I ca n't understand a word . " " I have to see you . Are you doing anything for lunch ? We could meet ? " " I 'm busy for lunch . " Paul did n't have the slightest idea where he would be for lunch . " You caught me at a bad time . It 'll have to wait till school tomorrow . " " What about tonight ? I 'm supposed to have dinner with my parents , but I can get out of it . " " I 'm sure it can wait till school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all according to plan . But somehow , all of a sudden , it  | was n't so satisfactory . School tomorrow , that was a long way off . And even then they 'd have to wait till lunch before they got a minute to themselves . Maybe if he called Barry back ? But that was just what he could n't do . No anxiety . Cool and indifferent , no matter what . Crazy to spoil things so close to success . They saw each other at lunch the next day . Paul was stiff and distant . Three or four times Barry tried to catch his eye from the next table . Each time he pretended not to notice . At the end of the meal he rose to his feet , stretched himself , and started to the door . He knew what would happen . Out of the corner of his eye he saw Barry gulp down a spoonful of ell-o , jump up , and start after him . In the hall Barry caught up to him . " Paul , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . ' Palk . " " Ca n't we go somewhere ? Where there are n't so many people around ? " Paul shrugged . " Whatever you say . " Barry led the way outside and up the hill to the volleyball court . Ile kept looking over his shoulder , to make sure Paul was still following him . ghincl the volleyball court was an open space under a canopy of elan trees . In the spring , classes were sometimes held here . But now , towards the middle of October , there was too much of a chill in the air . They sat down under a tree . Paul leaned back and took out a cigarette . It was a risk ? smoking was n't allowed anywhere except in the senior common room ? and he knew how nervous it always made Barry . That was why he did it now . As he lit up , he did n't miss the flash of anxiety in Barry 's eyes , and the effort he made to keep from showing it . They were silent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Barry raised his head and began , and Paul could tell how  | hard he was trying to keep his voice steady . " Paul , what is it ? What have I done ? " " Done ? " " The way you 've been acting lately . " The voice trembled a little . " Why are you mad at me , Paul ? " Another puff of smoke . Then Paul turned his eyes away and gave a soft sigh with exactly the right touch of exasperation in it . " You just do n't understand me , do you ? " " Do n't understand you ? ? " " In your quiet unassuming way , you 're terribly self-centered , are n't you ? " " Self-centered ? I guess I am self-centered ? " " You just never see anybody else 's point of view . You notice I 've got something on my mind , but you ca n't be bothered to figure out what it could be . You automatically assume it must be something you 've done . It never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it might not have anything to do with you at all ? " Barry wet his lips . He seemed uncertain whether he ought to be upset or relieved at these words . " But if it is n't me ? I do n't want it to be me , you know that . But who are you mad at ? " " Who am I mad at ? " Paul allowed another soft sigh to escape and waited one slow beat , which he had carefully calculated ahead of time , before he turned squarely to Barry and burst out , " I 'm mad at myself . I 'm mad at the two of us together . Do n't you see , I 'm sick and tired of the whole rotten way things have been going ! " He watched Barry looking bewildered , the words forming hesitantly on his lips . " But Paul ? things have n't been going so badly , have they ? I thought ? things seemed to be going pretty well . " " Dull ! " It was n't just through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . " My God , what 's the matter  | with us anyway ? " He jumped to his feet , hurling his cigarette away . " Look around you , will you ? Look at the people we have to live with every day of our life ? Look at the dopes in our class . Thickheaded football players , or scared rabbits , not an ounce of guts or imagination in a single damn one of them . And squealing girls , blinking their fool eyes off , trying to convince everybody what sexy little morsels they are ? and if anybody dares to act on the conviction , oh , how demure and refined they get ! And take a look at our teachers , our wise and distinguished teachers that we 're supposed to feel such respect for . Dried up old prunes ! Hypocrites too . Pretending to be so superior and intellectual , but you should hear them squabbling and backbiting in the faculty common room . And let 's move a little nearer home . Let 's take a look at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in . What culture they have ! The men follow the baseball scores , and the women are experts on the latest canasta rules . And what high ideals they have ! They would n't think of stabbing their best friend in the back  --  not unless they could make an extra dollar on the deal ! And what fascinating lives they lead ! Golf in the slimmer and television in the winter , and every one of them too dumb to realize that they 're boring themselves to deathf ? " But what are you getting at ? ? " " What am I getting at ? " Paul went up to him and grabbed his arm . " Are we supposed to lw friends ? " " You know we 're friends . " " Why are we friends ? Is it because we 're dopes and clods like the rest of them ? Is there anything more to our friendship than that ? Do we have a little imagination , a little life to us , a little courage to do things that the dopes and clods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess ? " " You guess ! We 'd better have . We 'd better have , you hear me ? Our friendship is n't worth a damn to me if it 's just like everybody  | else 's . If that 's all it is , then it might as well be over with right now ! " " That 's not all it is . We are different from the others , and our friendship is something special . If I did n't believe that ? Well , I know that it 's true . " " Then what are we doing about it ? We do n't do anything ! Why the hell do n't we do something ? " " But what can we do ? If you 'll tell me what we can do ? " Paul did n't answer at first . He turned away , unclenched his fists , let the tension ease a little . Behind him he heard the heavy anxious breathing , but still he held off for a moment . And then , in a slow thoughtful voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pipes ? " He turned around , in time to see the vague nod that greeted his question . Quietly , smiling a little , he went on , " You should 've been with me then . It was like nothing else I 've ever felt . It was the danger , and the darkness , and expecting to get caught every minute . And after it was over , and you knew that you 'd done it , and everyone was talking about it , but none of them would ever find out ? I want that feeling again . I do n't see why I should have to go without it . " His tone became almost injured for a moment . Then , leaning forward , " I want it with you . You 're my friend . I want you to have it too . " Barry 's face was pale . " What were you thinking of ? " Paul spoke faster . " I was driving up around the country club the other day . Do you know the Coleman place ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who thinks he 's such a great golfer . The one with the little blonde wife . They 've got this big white house five minutes from the club . They 're off on a cruise till November , kids and servants and all . The place is all closed up . " " There must be somebody watching it for them . The state police ? "  | " Can the state police spend every minute watching Coleman 's house ? We 'll get in there while it 's not being watched . " " But how do we know when that 'll be ? Suppose we pick the wrong time ? " " We wo n't . We 'll scout around in advance . We 'll use our heads . " His hand was on Barry 's arm . " That 's the thing about us . We 've got heads , we can use them . " " Yes , but ? why will we do it , what will we take ? " " Maybe nothing . Depends what we find . We wo n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " " Yes , but ? " " Yes but , yes but ! Do we do it , or do n't we ? Are you in on this with me ? I want an answer right now . " Barry gave a wave of his an n . " I do n't know . It does n't sound ? If we got caught , it would be awful . " " We wo n't get caught , we 'll use our heads . " " I do n't know , I do n't know . I never did anything like this before . " " Neither did I , once . " " I would n't be any good at it . I 'd only spoil it for you . I 'd get panicky . " " You would n't get panicky . I 'll be there , and I 'll look out for you . " IIe squeezed Barry 's a nn . " It wo n't be the first time you 've left things to Inc . You 're always scared at the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's nothing to it . " " I do n't know ? " " Listen to me . Listen to me , kid ? I want to do this ! " " Yes , but I just do n't know . " With a gasp Paul let go of his arm . " All right , you do n't know . But I know . I know you 're no friend of mine . I know you 're a dull dope , like all the others . I know it now , I 'm glad to find it out . " " Paul , please ? "  | " Never mind that . It 's over with us now . I 'll do this by myself . Who needs you , for God 's sake ? I 'll find someone else . " " Paul ? " " I 'll find someone else . So long . " He turned and started across the volleyball court . " Paul ! " He did n't slow up his pace . He let Barry catch up to him . " Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . Please do n't find someone else . " Paul held himself rigid another moment . Then he let himself relax , he turned and gave Barry his warmest smile . " I knew it would be like this . My God , you 're my friend , I knew I could count on you . Barry 's head was lowered , he was breathing hard . " You can count on me . " And suddenly Paul felt terribly worn out . This last month had been a strain on him . As much of a strain as on Barry . " We 'd better get back to class now , " he said . " We 'll work out the details tonight . " " Yes ? tonight ? " " It 's okay , it 's okay , " Paul said , taking his arm , using his most encouraging voice . " I would n't really have done it without you . I would n't do anything without you . " It was Friday night . Paul was having dinner with his mother and father at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they came here once a week anyway . Paul knew why . His father got a kick out of showing him off to his friends and their wives . A pretty dull crowd . Businessmen , lawyers , bankers , maybe a doctor or two . All with plenty of money , but not so many topics of conversation . A pretty poor bunch to show off in front of . But  | his father did n't feel that for a minute , his father thought these were the greatest men in the world . Why not ? His father , let 's face it , was exactly like them himself . His father was a smart man in his way ? in a kind of shrewd-businessman way ? but when it came to real brains ? well , what was the point of kidding him-self ? All through the meal it was a regular procession up to the table . Old Joe So-and-So , the paper-box magnate , one of my biggest pals , boy . And this is Mrs. So-and-So . Very nice to meet you , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her . She 's got a figure like a paper box . And you remember old Matt Such-and-Such . You remember my boy Paul , do n't you , Matt ? Yes , he sure has grown since you saw him last . He 's doing fine up at his school now . They just made him head of the Dramatics Club , or did I tell you already ? It was a bore , but 1'anI got through it well enough . Smiling , shaking hands , bobbing up and down ? he spent more of this meal on his feet than he did in his chair . He never had much trouble turning on the social charm . It was second nature to him by now . He could do it mechanically while his mind was busy with something else . With the big plans for tonight , for instance . " Say , there 's Walt Harmon and Doris , " his father was saying . " Walt ! Over here ! " A minute later Walt Harmon and his wife had come up to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour-faced fellow , bags under the eyes . Mousy little wife , never opened her mouth . " I can remember the day you were born , young man , " Walt Harmon said in a solemn voice that nearly made Paul laugh . What did he expect anyway , eternal gratitude for his good memory ? " I 've never seen your father so excited before or since . He assured us that the future President of the United States had just come into the world . " Dad laughed and put his hand on Paul 's shoulder . " He has n't  | turned out too badly , " he said . " Did I tell you , they just made him head of the Dramatics Club up at his school ? " " If only he would n't be so secretive with his parents , " Mother said . Dad gave her a dirty look . " Why the hell should a boy run to his mother with every little thing ? I 'm damn glad I have n't got one of those mama 's boys here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think you 've done badly , Arthur . Doris and I would n't complain . " He exchanged a look with his wife , and there was a long silence . The Harmons had once had a son themselves , Paul remembered . He died of polio or something many years ago . The silence passed , the Harmons said good night all around , and then they were gone . Mother started in right away on how pale and tired Walt looked . Definitely not a well man . Leave it to Mother to turn the conversation in a gloomy direction . Dad was n't listening to her , though . He was looking at Paul , beaming at him in that proud way of his . Someone else was standing over their table . " Is this the young King heir ? It 's a pleasure to say hello . " Everybody up on their feet again . His father introduced him to Jerry Phillips , another one of his " greatest pals in the world . " A little bald round-faced man , sort of brisk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Jerry Phillips said . He pointed at this small skinny boy at his side ? kid about eleven . " Shake hands politely , Pete , " Jerry said . " This kid is a terror . I 'm training him to get along in civilized society . " The terror was blushing . " Oh , come on , Daddy ! " Jerry Phillips winked at them . " He does n't like me to brag about him , he says it embarrasses him . So now , just to oblige him , I only tell people terrible things about him . " The terror blushed harder and giggled . Then Jerry Phillips was turning to Paul . " Young fellow , I 've  | been wanting to congratulate you ever since last June . You know , my boy here goes to the same school as you , and he dragged me up there in June to see your play ? what was it ? Julius Caesar . I thought it was going to be a terrific nuisance , but you made it a pleasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friends , Romans , countrymen ! ' Artie , you 've got the makings of another Barrymore here . " " He was pretty good , " Dad said . " You know , they just made him head of the Dramatics Club up there . " " So my boy was telling me . Pete here knows everything about your son . Apparently he 's by way of being a celebrity in the school . " The kid began blushing harder than ever . " Daddy ? " Paul looked him over with a little more interest . He could n't even remember seeing the kid around . And yet his admiration was all over his face . " I know Pete , " Paul said . " I 've seen him around plenty of times . " Pete swayed ( ) II his feet in an agony of blushes . " Come on , Butch , " Jerry Phillips said , grabbing him by the hand . " Let 's get you home and take your temperature , you look like you 're up to about a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mother was off immediately . Poor Jerry Phillips , she felt so sorry for him , he was all wrapped up in that boy now that his wife was gone , it was really the most touching thing to see . There was n't enough family affection in the world today . She remembered when she was a girl in Memphis , how devoted she and all her sisters were to poor Papa , and how she cried and cried the night before her wedding , because she knew she 'd be leaving them all for good . " Say , there 's Mike Winston , " Dad cried . " Have n't seen him in years . Say , Mike ! " Paul got to his feet quickly . Enough was enough , even of a good thing . " It 's after eight o'clock , I have to pick up Barry , we 're  | going to a party . You said I could have the car , did n't you , Dad ? " " Absolutely . If you want Carl to drive you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him the night off . " He shook Dad 's hand and kissed Mother , and hurried off . Mother 's voice followed him across the room . " Be careful with your driving , dear . And do n't stay out too late . Ellen will be in from school early tomorrow , she 'll be looking forward to having breakfast with you ? " All through dinner Barry had been squirming . There were guests at the table ? this Dr. Mattson and his wife ? and Mother just would n't stop saying awful , embarrassing things in front of them . It was so bad that it almost took his mind off the thing that was ahead of him later on tonight . She was talking now about Paul . " Arthur King 's boy , you know . King and Connors , the prominent brokerage house . Oh yes , a very fine family . He 's in Barry 's class at school , they 're very close friends . " Barry tried staring down at his plate and shutting his ears to the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent sort of voice , and it had always been able to get straight to him in spite of himself . " And a brilliant family too , so I 've heard . The youngest daughter is making a remarkable record at Wellesley ? I heard that from the little Stone girl , Barry , her sister is going to Wellesley now with Paul 's sister . Mrs. Stone is on the Child Guidance Council with me . " " The Child Guidance Council , did you say ? " A deep rumble came from Dr. Mattson . " Now there 's an organization I 'm not entirely unfamiliar with . They had me in to address one of their meetings several years ago ? " Dr. Mattson creaked into a long involved story during which he kept forgetting details and recalling  | them to himself again . It was very dull , but Barry could n't have been more grateful for it . Maybe , by the time it was over , Mother would have forgotten what she had been talking about . " Wo n't you have some coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattson 's story . " How many lumps ? And how about you , Lottie ? " There was a lot of confusion as Dr. and Mrs. Mattson took their coffee , and at the end of it Mother slid smoothly back into the subject that interested her most . " Did you say Paul was picking you up here tonight , dear ? Well , that 's good , because I 've been meaning to bring something up to Paul . With you and him such close friends , it really seems a shame we never get together with the Kings . Oh , we run into them occasionally at the school , or up at the club , but I was thinking , Barry dear , I 'm sure the Kings would appreciate it if we had them over for dinner some evening ? " Mother was always making this suggestion . Barry could n't remember how many times she had ( lone it . And every time it had the same effect on him , it brought the same sick feeling to his stomach . As yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a lot like his childhood ( lays , when she used to bring up those " little matters " ? " Muriel dear , " Dad said , " I , ottie here has been doing some interesting work with the Philharmonic Symphony Board . I 'm sure you 'd be interested ? It was a good try on Dad 's part , and Barry was grateful to him . But it did n't do much good . Mother let Mrs. Mattson say a few words about the Philharmonic Symphony Board , and then she broke in , " Barry 's friend , Paul King , is quite a music lover too , you know . And he 's also a very clever young actor , everyone was talking about his performance in the school play last year ? " Barry tightened his fists under the table . Would n't this dinner ever end ? Would n't eight-thirty ever come ?  | " It 's a very interesting psychological study , " Mother was saying , " this friendship between Paul and Barry . I mean , Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't mind my saying so , do you , dear ? While Paul , on the other hand ? " Just before eight-thirty the doorbell rang . Barry could n't keep a gasp of relief from coming out of him . It was Paul . Mother pounced on him , introduced him around , made a big fuss over him . This was how she always acted with him . But somehow this did n't embarrass Barry so much . Paul and he had talked to each other so freely about their parents , there was nothing Mother could do that Paul did n't know about already . Besides , it was a funny thing , how well Mother and Paul seemed to get on together . " You 're looking very handsome tonight , Paul , " Mother was saying . " I hope you two young Don Juans are n't going to break too many hearts tonight . " " Only two or three dozen , Mrs. Morris , " Paul said . " Just to console myself for your lack of interest . " Mother laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're fooling ? I know you young people , you think anybody over thirty is as old as the Egyptian pyramids . " There was more joking back and forth , and Dr. Mattson rumbled into a story about the Stock Exchange and got bogged down in the middle trying to decide if it happened in 1924 or 1926 . Paul gave Barry a sideways look . Immediately it all came back to Barry , where they were going tonight . " We 'd better go now , " he said . " We 'll be late for the party . " His heart fluttered a little as he told this lie . " Yes , yes , you young people run along , " Mother said . " Have a good time , and behave yourselves . Well , try to behave yourselves . "  | Then everybody was saying good-by , and Barry found himself off to the side with Dad . " Have you got enough money ? " Dad said . " Yes , I do . " " And you 're using Paul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad shifted from one foot to another . IIe looked at Barry a little harder , but not quite directly . " Everything all right ? " Barry lowered his eyes . " Yes . Fine . " A moment later Mother pushed in between them and kissed him , and then he was out in the hall with Paul . The car turned off the parkway at the first exit in Mamaroneck . In a few seconds they were on country roads , surrounded by dark lawns and shadowy trees and clim two-story houses . Paul had been talking all the way , going over and over the details of the adventure that lay ahead of them . " It 'll be a cinch , " he said . " I drove up here to look over the place last night . There 's a big garden in back , fenced in by trees . Very convenient to keep the neighbors front seeing us . So we take the car up the driveway to the back , and break in through one of the windows . I 've got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once we 're inside , we keep the lights out and the noise down , and there 's no reason why we ca n't take as much time as we like . Actually , there are only two risky moments , the moment we turn up the driveway and the moment we come out of it again . Those are the only moments when the neighbors might notice the car and make a note of the license . But there 's nothing we can do about that , so we might as well relax . A little bit of danger makes it more interesting anyway . " Barry hardly said a word . He was driving the car , keeping his eyes on the road and his hands tightly on the wheel .  | Paul nudged him . " What 's the matter with you anyway ? You are n't exactly overflowing with enthusiasm . " " Do I have to be overflowing with enthusiasm ? " There was a pause , then Paul snapped out , " Yes , you do ! Why do you think we 're doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a funeral trip . We 're not supposed to go into it as if we were on our way to the dentist to get a tooth pulled . " Barry did n't say anything . " You do n't have to go along , if you do n't want to , " Paul said . " I 'm not forcing you to do this , am I ? You could get out of the car right now . Go on , get out , I 'll do it myself . I do n't need you now or any time . " Barry turned his face to him . " Please ? I do n't want to get out . I want to go along . I 'm just a little nervous , that 's all . " " You want to do this just as much as I do ? " " Yes . Just as much . " Paul sat back and grinned . " Well , that 's all right then . I knew I could depend on you . It would be a hell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on you ? " Barry grinned too , not quite as broadly . Bit by bit , as they drove along in silence , he stopped gripping the wheel so tightly . He was drifting again , floating with the current . Leave it to Paul . Put himself in Paul 's hands . Beyond that , what did it matter ? One more turn , past the Spreading Chestnut Club , and then they were on a wide pleasant street with soft yellow lamps flickering in the middle . " It 's the house at the end , " Paul said . They came to the driveway . " Now make your turn , " Paul said . " Not too fast . We do n't want to attract attention . That 's the way . Okay , we 're out of sight now . " Barry turned off the motor . They got out and stood for a moment , looking at the back of the dark house . " Here , " Paul said , shoving a small flashlight into Barry 's hand . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll do the rest . "  | They moved along the back of the house to a pair of long French windows that looked on to a sun porch . A wrench and a screwdriver were in Paul 's hands . " Now watch the expert 's technique , " he said . " Just a matter of ? finding the right spot ? and using a little ? leverage . " There was a loud cracking noise , and the French windows jumped open . " Somebody must 've heard that , " Barry said . Paul laughed . " I ought to warn you , for the first few times everything 's going to sound a hundred times louder than it really is . " First few times ? " Barry said . " Come on , what are you waiting for ? " Paul held the French window wide and made a sweeping gesture . " Wo n't you be my guest ? " They stepped into , the sine porch , and from there into a long living room . They stood ( lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flashlight played along the floor and the walls . It gave them ; III odd broken-up view of the room . A heavy antique chair suddenly flashed into sight , then an old bronze lighting fixture curling out from the wall , then a gleaming gold mirror , then a cluster of thick red drapes . " Nice stuff , " I ' , nol said . " My mother 's thinking of doing our house over , 111 tell her to ask them the name of their decorator . " " What are we going to do ? " Barry said . " Are we going to take something ? " " Oh , we can come up with a more original idea than that . I 've got a lot of faith in our ingenuity . " They explored the house slowly . In the foyer , across from the front door , was a tall square mirror with a simple silver frame . In the dining room , two walls were completely lined with mirror glass . At the top of the stairs was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it . " Coleman 's wife collects mirrors , " Paul said . " She 's always dragging  | them into the conversation at the club . " A thoughtful smile began on his face . " I 'm beginning to get an idea . I knew it would come to me , once we were here . " " What idea ? " Barry said . " People should n't be so fond of looking at their own faces . The deadliest sin of all is pride . " Paul laughed . They moved along the second-floor landing and pulled open the nearest door . It was a little girl 's room , pink and woolly , with dolls and little plastic animals and picture books . Two mirrors were right next to each other on the far wall , both of them with long white ears sticking up , like rabbits . " Is n't that cute ? " Paul said . " I think I 'll be sick . " They moved on to the master bedroom . There were three mirrors on each wall here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's fate , " Paul said . " It 's the only thing we can do . " He spread his hands . " We 'll just have to smash the mirrors . " Barry stared at him . " Poetic justice , that 's what it is , " Paul said . " Life is too short , people have no right to waste it collecting junk . People like that should be taught a lesson . It 's our moral duty . " " But to smash the mirrors ? " " Every single damn one of them . And nothing else , you follow me ? We do n't steal so much as a hairpin , we do n't muss a single bedspread . That way , our message will be clear . " " But the noise it 'll make ? " " Yes , the noise will be considerable . " There was a glitter in Paul 's eyes . " We 'll have to hurry up about it and drive away fast , or else we 'll get caught in the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you hear him now ? Disgraceful vandalism . Irresponsible young hoodlums . Wanton disregard for private property . " He laughed out loud and waved his arm . " So come on , let 's get started . Well , are you coming ? " After a moment Barry nodded . " Yes , I 'm coming . "  | " Now how to go about it ? My wrench here . The very implement . We 'll get a double use out of it , that 's what 's meant by being businesslike . We 'll begin here , and work back the way we came . " Paul walked up to the mirror nearest him ? an oval with china fruit around it ? and swung back his arm and hurled the wrench with all his might . A loud crash , a shatter of glass , and Paul jumped back with a laugh . He moved along to the next mirror . his arm swung back , the wrench swung forward , and again the crash , the shatter of glass , the laugh . And right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look at it , " he cried , raising his arms to the wilderness of glass that covered the floor . " Vanity of vanities ! Do n't you feel like an Old Testament prophet ? On to the next temple , let 's destroy a few more idols ! Well , what are you standing there for , do you think we 've got all night ? " They went hack to the little girl 's room . The two little rabbit mirrors succumbed easily to the wrench in a delicate tinkle of glass . After that came the round mirror on the landing , and then they were running down the stairs , as if somebody were chasing them . In the dining room Paul stared around at those two mirrored walls . Then lie gathered up his strength , and the look in his eyes made Barry think of a hungry man about to plunge into a feast . The wrench went flying in all directions . With a great roar the walls cracked away in large jagged slabs . " Only a little more left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better go , " Barry said . " The whole neighborhood must be up . " " We 'll go when the job 's clone . It would keep me awake all night , thinking of one of these smooth little bastards remaining intact in all the wreckage . Gloating , feeling superior . " " But that 's a crazy idea , " Barry said , looking at him sharply . " So it is , so it is ! " And Paul was running out to the foyer , right  | up to the long silver mirror facing the door . He planted himself in front of it , made a low ironical bow , and in an almost casual manner shattered it straight down the middle . Then they were back in the living room , where they had started . " This one is a beauty , " Paul said , waving at the gold mirror on the wall . " I 'll tell you what , I 'll show you what a good friend I am . It 's the last one , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the wrench to Barry . " Go ahead , you 'll see how good it is for the soul . " He shoved the wrench into Barry 's hand . " We 're in on this together , are n't we ? " " Yes , we are . " " Well , prove it . " He gave Barry a quick push towards the mirror . Barry did nothing , he just stood there with the wrench in his hand . " Hurry up ! " Paul cried . " The cops are closing in ! " Barry stared at his image in the mirror . He wet his lips , then he brought his arm back slowly . It was like the summer up at camp when he learned how to dive . He just shut his eyes and told himself it was n't happening to him at all , it was happening to someone else . Then he let his arm swing forward . He heard the crash and Paul 's shout of joy . He opened his eyes . The mirror was smashed , the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one large chunk of glass in the frame . He could n't leave it sticking there like that , it bothered him somehow . He brought the wrench forward again . That last chunk split into a dozen pieces . They shivered a moment in the frame , then they crumbled to the floor . Paul was yanking at his arm . " Come on , come on , must n't outstay our welcome " They pushed through the open French windows , ran across the hack lawn , and scrambled into the car . A few seconds later they  | were careening down the driveway and out to the street . It was n't long before they reached the parkway and lost themselves among the cars streaming into the city . Paul let out a deep sigh . " How do you feel ? " he said . " Different than you 've ever felt before , I 'll bet . " " Do you think anyone saw us ? Did they get the license num-ber ? " " Not a chance . There was n't a noise on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked in bed , or out at the movies , or playing gin rummy . It takes more than a small earthquake to make them interrupt their gin rummy . " They were silent awhile . Then Barry said , " I 'm shaking a little . Maybe you better drive the car . " Paul laughed . They pulled tip to the grass and switched seats . " What you need is a cup of coffee , " Paul said . " We 'll go someplace , and we can talk . " So they went to a place downtown , and they talked and sipped coffee . They talked about their friendship , how close they had come to never meeting , how lucky it was that they had . Gradually Barry 's shaking went away . They left the coffee place , and Paul drove hint uptown to his building . " It was n't too bad , was it ? " Paul said . " You 're glad you went along ? " And he smiled with more warmth than he usually let himself show . Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , knowing only that his friend was pleased with him . " Yes , it was n't too bad . " " You 'll see , " Paul said . " It 'll come to you easy now . " Paul started the car , and soon he had disappeared around the corner . Later on , when he was alone in his room , in his bed , Barry started shaking again . Dear God , what had he done ? He had n't intended any harm by it . It was only because it meant so much to Paul . How could he disappoint Paul , how could he take the  | chance of turning Paul against him ? God knew everything , did n't He ? So God ought to understand . . . . When Paul reached his bedroom , his heart was still beating hard . Beating with happiness and excitement . He had never had an evening like this in his life . Wonderful as it had been in the past , it had never been as wonderful as this . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it beforehand , what a difference it would make for Barry to be with him ? He found a note on his pillow . DARLING - Do n't bother getting up early in the morning . Received a wire from Ellen , she wo n't be coming till next week . Herb Goldsmith arrived in Boston unexpectedly , she 'll be spending the week end with him . Love , MOTHER He read this note twice . Then he crumpled it up and threw it into the waste basket . All right , so she would n't come till next week . What was the difference anyway ? When he got into bed later on , his heart was n't beating so hard any more , the happiness and excitement were all gone . In his imagination the glass began to shatter again . Not enough of it , he told himself . There should have been ten times as much of it . II IT WAS a long winter . A week before Thanksgiving New York was assaulted by the first snow ? a ragged threadbare sort of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , by the end of November , the wind began ? that fierce icy wind that lay in wait for people as they stepped through their doorways ,  | roared and raged at them from every corner , pursued them as they crossed the street . Towards the end of December the snow came again , giving the city not a white Christmas but a dirty gray Christmas . And then , in honor of the New Year , there was a slashing cold rain , the temperature dropped to zero , and the sidewalks were sheeted with ice . It was a long winter , and even by the first of March the end did n't seem to be in sight . It was a long winter for Barry too . So many things were packed into his days , so many different kinds of things with different feelings and worries for each of them . First , there was the biggest thing that makes life hectic for a high school senior . All of a sudden he finds a sword hanging over him ? will he get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the time of the College Board exams , looms in the distance , and nobody will let him forget it . He works and works . His mind is a whirl of French verbs , he devours Hamlet 's soliloquy with his dinner , the formula for the refraction of light slides in and out of his dreams . And then , there are his extracurricular activities . After all , he is a senior , and this is his year to shine ? to flex his muscles for the football team , write masterpieces for the literary magazine , sway the world with his oratory at Student Council meetings . And of course he ca n't neglect his social life . However busy he may be in a hundred other ways , he has to go to all the dances , show up at all the parties , cat his share of all the midnight hamburgers . Barry was loaded down with these responsibilities just like everybody else . He was n't nearly the important public figure that Paul was , of course , but he did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . IIe was vice-president of the Science Club , and he was on the editorial board of the Yearbook , and he found himself being asked to all sorts of parties and outings that he had never been asked to in his junior year . One of the girls even told him once that he was " cute . " He could n't exactly  | understand why things had changed for him , but he was too busy , caught up in the change , to think much about it . Along with the activities that everybody else took part in , Paul and he had certain activities of their own . Paul 's prediction turned out to be true . After the first time it came a lot easier to Barry . Not that it ever came as easy to him as it did to Paul . There was always one moment when he felt a catch in his throat and a small wave of fear . But this moment never lasted long . Pretty soon he got so he did n't mind it too much , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . They went out on one of their expeditions every few weeks during the winter . For a while it was the same sort of thing . They found a house with the owners on vacation , and they forced the back door or broke a window . Once they were inside Paul would look around until an idea came to him , and then he would start to improvise . It was n't always such a good idea as the first time . Sometimes he could n't really think of anything at all . Then he would get annoyed , and he would plunge into general destruction of whatever caught his eye . They would slash pillows and mattresses , break china and glassware , until the energy had gone out of Paul , and then they would go away . It was surprising how safe it turned out to be . Nobody ever caught them at it , or even got a glimpse of their car . The Westchester papers carried an occasional item about the " disgraceful exploits of teen-age vandals , " but that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Barry . His mind filled with images of uniformed policemen bursting in on him at the dinner table . But Paul just shook his head angrily . " Vandals ! How can they leave it at that ? Show me the vandals that ever did what we 've been able to do , and got away with it so slickly , and had the selfcontrol to keep their mouths shut about it ! " Shortly afterwards Paul suggested his first variation of their usual procedure . " It 's crazy to go on like this , " he said . " The same  | damn thing over and over again . What are we , just a dull little pair of teen-age vandals ? And it 's too damn easy . No danger at all , no intelligence required at all , a moron could manage it as well . " " We do n't want it to be too dangerous . If we ever get caught ? " We 're not going to get caught . We 're just going to try something new , something a little harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Paul 's idea was that they should stop just going into places and smashing things up , they should start stealing things too . Not for the money , of course ? otherwise they 'd just be a couple of mean little crooks ? but because it looked as if people would pay attention to them only if they stole things . And then , just to make it all the more spectacular , they would send what they stole right back to the owners , in a package with ordinary wrapping paper and the address in printing , so it could n't be traced to them . " That way , " Paul said , " we 'll show them we do n't give a damn about their paltry little possessions . " So this was how they ( lid it for the rest of December . Paul got a big kick out of it at first , especially the part where they looked through the house and tried to decide which was the most treasured possession . " ' Fake the thing they care about most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time before they forget you . " Pretty soon Paul got to be really quick at picking out this thing . He could glance through a sideboard full of expensive bric-a-brac and make up his mind in a second or two which little china cat the lady of the house was most attached to . Early in January he began to get dissatisfied again . Barry could see it growing on him for a week , he kept his fingers crossed and hoped the mood would pass away . But he knew that Paul 's moods did n't pass away that easily . " It is n't right , " Paul said one night . " We steal the stuff , and  | we send it back ? but the people are down in Florida or away in Europe , so they never really feel the loss the way they should . You know what I mean ? What 's the point of doing it , if they do n't really feel the loss ? " " But there 's no way of making sure of that , " Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people have n't gone away . " The wave of Paul 's arm was casual , but not the gleam in his eyes . " You know , you 're right , " he said . There was a long silence , while Barry stared at him uncertainly . Finally he said , " Why ca n't we go on the way we 've been doing ? It has n't been so awfully bad , has it ? " " Yes , it has been , " Paul said , losing his casual manner immediately . " It 's been boring . Boring ? do you know what I mean ? We 're doing it this new way , or we 're not doing anything any more . " In the end , when Barry gave in , Paul grew cheerful again . " Do n't worry so much , " he said . " You 're safe with me , are n't you sure of that by now ? " And Barry nodded . He was safe with Paul . Through January and February they did things the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear dry nights when people were most likely to be out of the house . When they found a house with all the lights out , and not too near the house next door , they took a deep breath and went ahead . Barry was terrified every time they did it . There was no way of knowing , as you raised that window and climbed through , whether or not your guess had been right . Were the people really gone ? Or did they simply go to bed early ? Or maybe there was a child in the house , or servants , or an old grandmother ? And if somebody suddenly barged in , what could be done about it , with the car trapped in the driveway ? It almost happened once . Paul and he were upstairs in one of the bedrooms when a car pulled up to the front of the house , and the front door was opened . Luckily there was a back stairs , and  | they were able to run down it and out to the car before anybody found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barry had dreams about police whistles and prison bars . But Paul had liked it . Barry could tell from the way Paul kept talking about it afterwards , simply would n't forget about it , and finally announced that he wanted something like that again . This led to all sorts of new variations . One night , for instance , they searched deliberately for a house that was n't empty . They waited down the street until the people had gone to bed upstairs , then they broke in and took a hag of silverware from the dining room . Another time they did n't go to the suburbs at all , they broke into a house right in the city , only a few doors away from where Paul lived . And Barry had never seen Paul so excited as he was a few days later , after a policeman came to his house to ask if anybody had heard anything or seen any suspicious characters . Barry could imagine how hard Paul had frowned , how conscientiously lie had xTinkled his forehead , before he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a thing . Towards the middle of February they slackened up on their nighttime expeditions . Along with the rest of their class , they grew suddenly aware that the College Board exams would be held in less than a nnnith . Their chance of being accepted by the college of their choice depended a lot on how well they did in these exams . It was a matter of special importance for them . They had to be accepted by the sauce school . What would they do if they could n't go to college together ? Because of this , Paul was willing to call a temporary halt to their other activities and give himself up to his studies . They did a lot of their studying together . Barry had a knack for organizing the material , and he had a wonderful memory , so he was able to be a big help to Paul . Those evenings of studying together were the nicest Barry had ever spent . Finally it was the day of the exams . The senior class filed into  | the school auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours there were no sounds but the scratching of pens , the rustling of papers , the scraping of chairs . Then it was over , and Paul and Barry met in the corridor outside the auditorium . They both knew that they had done pretty well . And so they had a wonderful lighthearted hour together . They wandered through the halls , remembering all the different questions , laughing over the ones they had got right , skipping hastily past the ones they were n't so sure of . They went outside and watched the little kids throw snowballs . Everybody was ganging up against one little boy , a small dumpy boy with glasses . Barry happened to know him ? he was Horace Mattson , and his father was Dad 's friend Dr. Mattson ? so Paul and he took the little boy 's side , and pretty soon the opposition was routed . " Thank you very much , " Horace Mattson said , looking as solemn and owlish as his father . " You really saved my life . " " Any time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Expert Life Savers , always at your service . " The little boy shook his head . He was n't going to make a joke out of a serious matter like this . " Well , thank you , " he said . " I hope I can do the same for you some day . " And then he went running off , howling " Hey , wait up for me ! " after his attempted murderers . A little later the buzzer sounded for lunchtime . Paul said , " Well , thank God that load is off our minds now , and we can start in again . " " Start in ? ? " " Just the way we were doing before . Only better now . I 'm full of new ideas , things we should 've tried a long time ago . " " What sort of ideas ? " " I think I 'll keep you in suspense awhile . We 'll wait till the week end . We 'll get together Friday night , and I 'll spring them on you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , are n't you ? "  | " Yes , I 'm with you . Only ? if you could give me some hint ? " " Friday night , " Paul said . " Come on , let 's eat . I 'm so starved I could even go for Mrs. Mayberry 's Spanish omelette ! " It was the last week in March , and the winter 's fury seemed to have worn itself out . Instead of the slashing rain there were timid little drizzles . And one day , all of a sudden , the sun was shining , a soft breeze was blowing , and Central Park was filled with people who miraculously had no work to do for the afternoon . To everybody 's relief spring had come . Paul had never been quite so contented with life . It was after midnight , and he was just getting home from an evening with Barry . Nothing special , not aIurtller expedition . Just an ordinary evening at the movies , and afterwards one of their long talks . They talked about this hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playboy who wants to kill his rich uncle and inherit his money . Only , if he kills him in any simple everyday way , he 'll be suspected immediately because of his motive , so he has to figure out a foolproof alibi for himself . Well , he fixes up his telephone so that whco his girl friend dials for the correct time , what she guts is a phonograph record that gives the time fifteen minutes earlier than it really is . Paul loved stories of this sort , puzzles and mysteries and the ins and outs of perfect crimes . And Barry always caught the spirit of them , and listened and asked questions with just the right tone of interest . Paul opened the front door of the house now and stepped into the foyer . Then he stopped short , his face lighting up . His sister Ellen was in the living room archway , smiling at him . " Well , look who turned up , " Paul said . " The prodigal sister . Exhausted by her life of dissipation , she drags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only to find , " Ellen said , " that her smart-alec brother 's sense of humor has n't improved a bit . " Then they were in each other 's arms , hugging each other tightly . It was almost two months since Ellen had come in from college . She was in her final year , and she said that her work kept her terribly busy . Paul held her at arm 's length and looked her up and down . " Not bad . You may even get to look reasonably attractive in time . Just let me take you under my wing for a while . " Ellen laughed . " I can imagine your idea of female charm . Frizzly blond hair , two quarts of mascara , and a vacant stare . " " It 's the vacant stare that makes a woman irresistible , " he said . " That 's where you make your big mistake , sister dear . The surest way of staying an old maid for life is to let men suspect that you might be smarter than they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , I probably would stay an old maid for life . " She was still smiling , but her voice had an odd note to it . Paul gave her a quick curious look , then he was laughing again . " So what brings you out of the blue like this ? Get kicked out of school ? " " I 've still got them fooled , I 'm afraid . I came down to tell all of you the news . As a matter of fact , we told Mother and Dad earlier this evening . " " We ? Who 's we ? " She reached out and took his hand , and for the first time he noticed the funny sparkle in her eyes . " Come on in , " she said , and pulled him after her into the living room . He saw his mother and father there . His mother was leaning back on the sofa . She was smiling , but her eyes were wet . His father was in the easy chair , grinning around the room as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big charge . Paul took  | in the two of them in one glance , then his gaze fastened on the corner of the room where Herb Goldsmith was standing . For almost a year now Ellen had been going with Herb Goldsmith , and she had brought him to the house two or three times before . Big , heavy , broad-shouldered , the football-player type . He had gone through college on an athletic scholarship , and now he was a lawyer , doing very well with some plushy Washington job . But that did n't make Paul like him any better . He had known this loud heavy type all his life . Knew them inside out , knew how to handle them with his eyes shut . " How are you , fellow ? " Ilcrb Goldsmith boomed at him from across the room . " You 're keeping them up late these nights , are n't you ? " Sometimes Paul could take this hearty wisecracking in his stride . But other times it went right through him , like scraping glass or squeaking chalk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Herb ? " Then Ellen was by his side , linking her arm in his . " Now do n't anybody say anything . I want to tell him . " She turned her head , she was smiling up at him . " It looks as if your prodigal sister managed to hide her intelligence just long enough . I 'm getting married , darling . Ilerh and I are engaged to be married . " It was no snrprisc to Paul . It was bound to happen some day , was n't it ? It was nothing at all to get excited about . " Well , that 's wonderful , congratulations , " he said . He kissed her on the cheek , then went up to Herb . " Congratulations , I hope you know what a lucky guy you are . " " Oh I know that , fellow . Getting such a bright young punk for a brother-in-law . " Herb was outdoing himself in the good-humor act . He raised his arm , and Paul tensed himself for a slap on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn expression instead . " Seriously , though , I hope you like the idea . I 'm deeply in love with this sister of yours , and I 'm proud to become a member  | of your family . I do n't have any family of my own , you know ? my folks passed away when I was just a kid ? but I feel close to Arthur and Harriet here already . And I want you and me to be real brothers . " Dad broke in now , rubbing his hands together . " So what do you think of your sister 's taste , boy ? An up-and-coming legal genius . And it 's always a good thing to have political pull in the family . " Paul had no trouble hearing the slight note of irony in Dad 's voice , underneath his satisfaction . But of course it was way over Herb 's head . " Anything you want , " Herb said . " I 'll talk to the President about it in the morning . " A big happy smile was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . But faces like that start to get fat and puffy in no time at all . Paul could see the signs already . And then Ellen was by Herb 's side , linking her arm in his , as she had done with Paul a moment before . " I 'm so glad you two are going to be friends , " she said . " I 'm just so glad about everything . " " Let 's drink a toast to that , " Dad said . He was on his feet , moving to the liquor cabinet . " Damn shame if we stayed sober on an occasion like this . " He poured out the drinks , and Mother served them . Then he lifted his glass and said , " I do n't mind saying , this is all a big relief for me . For twenty years now I 've been watching this little girl grow up , watching her get dreamier and more impractical every day . I used to stay awake nights worrying about what kind of man she 'd decide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a red beard and not a penny in the bank . Thank God she finally picked somebody who 's respectable . Well , almost respectable . " He gave a wink at Ilerb . " Anyway , here 's to the lucky young couple . May they have many happy years of marriage , and may none of the speeches at their wedding party be any longer than this one . "  | They all drank . Paul took a sip and put down his glass . Then Ellen went up to Dad and kissed him , and turned to Mother , and the two women wept on each other 's shoulder for a while . " Oh my darling , I know you 'll be happy , " Mother said . " It 's going to be lonely here without you ? But I just know you will ! " It went on a lot longer , until Hcrb decided it was time to go to his hotel . So he kissed Mother , and treated Paul to a hearty handshake . And this time he caught liini off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Ellen walked him to the door , and you could hear their low murmuring on the front steps . Paul had no wish to stand around and listen to that . Ile said good night quickly and hurried up to his room . Ellen was waiting for him at breakfast the next morning . He saw the tentative smile on her face , so he started right in chattering about the movie he had seen last night . All about this bullfighter who loses his nerve and runs away from the bull , until he meets this gorgeous American debutante ? He worked hard at his chattering . Before long , breakfast was over and he got up to leave . " But wait a second , fail , " Ellen said , following him to the door . " I wanted to t ; ilk to you ? " Well , it 's getting kind of late . I have to be in school . " " I only wanted to ask you ? It 's all right , is n't it ? About Herb and me ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show nl ) late for math again , Mr. Winfield will throw a fit ! " Paul was out of ' the house before she could say another word . She went back to her breakfast slowly . A worried frown was on her face . And then , in a little while , the frown went away . Everything was all right , she was sine of it . This just was n't a time for anybody to be sad . There were so many reasons to be happy .... Paul went up to Barry at lunchtime . " I 've got the car . Let 's take a ride after school . "  | " But today is your Dramatics Club , is n't it ? " " To hell with the Dramatics Club . " He saw the pleased smile on Barry 's face . He turned and went to his own table . A little after three they started off in the car . Paul headed for the parkway and then turned off on a long tar road with only a sprinkling of houses on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry said . Paul did n't answer . He pressed down on the gas . The speed felt good , and suddenly he started talking . " What 's the hardest thing in the world ? The hardest thing to do , that is . " " I do n't know what you mean exactly . " " If you wanted to do just one thing , one big thing that nobody had ever been able to do before . So if you could do it , then you 'd prove once and for all ? " He turned suddenly to Barry . " Do you remember that book I was telling you about last night ? " " You ought to keep your eyes on the road , " Barry said . " You 're going sort of fast . " Paul looked straight ahead again . His foot pressed down still harder on the gas . " You remember the fellow in that book ? He wants his uncle 's money , so you remember what he plans to do ? He 's pretty clever about it too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , in real life he probably would 've been caught right away . " " And the truth is , lots of people get away with murder . I was reading somewhere , the police records are full of unsolved murders . Somebody comes up behind somebody on a dark street , and sticks a knife into him , and steals his money , and it 's another unsolved murder . Sticks a knife into him , " Paul repeated slowly , and the car shot forward even faster . " There 's something a lot harder than that . There 's one thing that nobody 's ever got away with . I was reading about it somewhere . It 's because there are so many  | risks , and so many details to plan out , and so many ways it could go wrong . " " What is it ? " Barry said . " But I 'll bet somebody could get away with it , " Paul said , as if he had n't heard Barry 's question . " I 'll bet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a long time , and you thought of all the details , and you have the nerve and the imagination ? And think what people would say about it ! The only ones who ever got away with it ! Of course you could n't be weak about it . You 'd have to be strong enough to do something you would n't want to do . Maybe you 'd even hate the idea of doing it , but you 'd have to be stronger than your feelings . " " I just do n't know what you 're talking about , " Barry said , with an uncertain smile . " You 'd have to get rid of the kid , I mean , " Paul said , keeping his eyes straight ahead . " I le 'd identify you otherwise . " They rode along in silence . The roar of the engine was loud in Paul 's ears . They had cone to a wooded section now . No houses at all , just trees ? tall , ugly , bunched together , sickly green clumps slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the look on Barry 's face . Right away lie started laughing . " Well , that 's a morbid line of thought , is n't it ? " he said , and he began to slow the car down . " I ought to go into the detective-story business . " He could see Barry relaxing a little . " I guess you 've got the imagination for it . You know , you almost had me thinking ? " " Now where the hell have we got to ? " Paul said quickly . " I just do n't recognize this section at all . I 'd better find the parkway again , or we 'll both be late for dinner . " At the end of the street he turned the car around , and they drove back the way they had come , in silence .  | It 's a crazy idea , Paul told himself . So he was n't going to let himself think about it . For the next week he went along as he had always done . He did his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council meetings , behaved very dignified and chairmanlike with the Dramatics Club . Ile swapped jokes with his father and avoided his mother 's questions , and hurried away from both of them as soon as he could . One night at dinner , his mother said she had just received a letter from Ellen , and the wedding was set for May . He went to his room a little later . A crazy idea . Maybe so . But it was all so clear to him , even some of the smallest details . And it was so right and natural , as if he had never stopped thinking about it for a minute . Crazy ? All right , what difference did that make ? All his life , it seemed , he 'd been living with this idea , only he had n't ever realized it before . So even if it was crazy , it was too late to worry about that now . Plans , probems , details , that 's what he had to worry about now . The big problem was Barry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to plenty of things before now , it was getting easier every day . All right , this thing was a little different , bigger , so what ? Only a question of having a plan . Slowly but surely , according to a careful plan . General King , the brilliant strategist . He went walking with Barry after lunch the next day . In the middle of the conversation he slipped in a casual reference to his idea . " You know that crazy business we were talking about a week or so ago ? Well , I 've been thinking about it . There 's really a kind of fascination in it . As a sort of abstract problem , I mean , like a crossword puzzle or something . " No hint of strain or anxiety . Very light and pleasant , so Barry would take it in the same light pleasant way . " Well , you know how much I enjoy puzzles , " Barry said . He did n't really enjoy puzzles much , Paul knew . But he was willing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what his friend wanted .  | " Maybe we 'll work it out sometime , " Paul said , and that was all , not another word , switch the conversation to another subject . Patience , that 's the chief trait of genius ? he had read that somewhere once . He dropped another casual reference about a week later , when he and Barry were starting out on a date . Not quite so casual this time , a touch of tenseness in his voice . " It 's a funny thing . Sometimes you get something into your head , something that is n't important at all , only you just ca n't seem to get it out again . Did that ever happen to you ? " " Well , I think so . " " I do n't suppose it 's serious , " he said . A quick anxious look from Barry , though Paid did n't seem to notice it . Barry always got anxious if he thought something was troubling his friend . Paul switched the subject again , and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to other things . No more casual references till one-thirty in the morning , as he was driving Barry home . " It was a lousy evening , " he said . " Did you think so ? " Surprise all over Barry 's face . You could almost see the wheels working in his head , readjusting his feelings about what kind of an evening it had been . " You get something like this that bothers you ? it takes the fun out of things . " A look of concern oil Uarry 's face . " But I do n't understand what 's bothering you , Paul . I f there 's anything I can do ? " Paul smiled . The patient long-suffering type of smile . " It 's all right , kid . It is n't important . Do n't worry about it . " They stopped in front of Barry 's building and said good night . Barry gave him one extra searching look before he turned away . So far so good . Only the beginning , though . Could n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school he would be sure . If Barry came to him and brought up the subject of his own accord .  | They met the next morning in history . Only two minutes till class . Barry cleared his throat . Yes or no ? Paul could n't tell , heads you win , tails you lose . " Paul ? I 've been worrying . What was it last night , this thing you ca n't get out of your mind ? " Heads . Paul felt his confidence growing . " It was n't anything , " he said , with a shrug . " Forget about it . " Barry was blinking . That confused , hurt way of his , behind those thick glasses . To Paul it had seemed pretty comical once . " You do n't have to tell me , of course . It 's only that I might be able to help ? " " Honestly , kid , it was n't anything . I 'll drive you home and tell you about it . You 'll laugh when you find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , and they had to stop talking . In the car that afternoon , Paul shrugged and said , " Well , if you really want to hear about it . It 's what we were talking about the other day . It 's been running through my head ever since . Like a puzzle . How would you go about it ? Suppose you were writing a story , and you wanted some characters to plan out something like this . And you did n't want them to be dopes either , they 're going to be smart and work out a really good plan . " " And you 've been wondering what sort of plan they 'd work out ? " Still looking a little confused . But relieved too . The old reassuring tone , it never fails . " That 's it . I told you it was nothing important . I tell you what , why do n't I try out some of my ideas on you ? And maybe you 'll get some ideas of your own . We could make a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last trace of worry from Barry 's face . That bit about making a game out of it , that 's the bit that did it . Nothing he liked better than doing things with his friend . And if it was only a crossword puzzle ? They started right in . Barry was terribly earnest , the way he was about all games . Paul made himself earnest too . Nobody could be earnest the way he could be . Just like a puzzle they  | worked it out . Now first of all , what was the objective ? Objective : to bring off successfully , without getting caught , this difficult project which nobody had ever brought off before . Why had n't they brought it off , what were the points of danger ? Danger point number one : the money , how was it to be delivered , how could contact be made without the police waiting around the corner , how could they be sure it was n't marked or something ? They could n't dismiss this danger point on the grounds that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly abstract and impersonal . They had to put themselves in the place of somebody who might actually want to do a thing like this . And why should this somebody try it , with so many odds against him , if it was n't for the money ? Danger point number two : the very first moment . Once the kid was picked , that is . It would have to be a kid , of course . People get more anxious about a kid , they 're much more willing to pay quickly and keep quiet . A kid was an emotional necessity to a thing like this . " Emotional necessity . " Paul liked the sound of these words , lie used them three or four times as the conversation went on . So once the kid was picked , how did they get their hands on him , separate hint fmm his parents , teachers , chauffeur , the whole army of that surrounds a rich kid in a city like New York ? It had to be quick and quiet , and no suspicion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kid and his family personally , they 'd have to be careful how much use they made of their knowledge . As soon as the police suspect an inside job , it never takes them long to crack the case . Paul knew that from experience , that 's how it always worked in Ellery Queen . Danger point number three : how to communicate with the family ? Did they use the phone ? Send letters through the mail ? Which way was least likely to be traced ? Minor points maybe . To a good strategist nothing is minor .  | ME And then , the biggest problem of all . What did they do with the kid once they had him ? So many headaches were connected with this . Where could they hide him ? As negotiations went on , would n't it get harder and harder to stop him escaping or attracting attention ? And how did they keep him frorn identifying them later on ? To this problem , and all the headaches connected with it , there seemed to be only one answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's only an abstract problem , " Paul said . " No human element at all . You just weigh all the factors and then arrive at the logical conclusion . Like a formula in math . " He decided they had talked about this enough for the time being . They had gone a long way , considering it was just the beginning . Why not push it even further , why not go the whole way right now ? No , he had to keep his head . Patience , General King . The weeks passed , the days grew longer and brighter . There were lots of chances to discuss the " abstract puzzle " with Barry . They went for drives in the country , now that the weather was nice . Or they wandered through the city on week-end afternoons , watching the kids play baseball in the park , smelling the fish around Fulton Street , just strolling down Madison Avenue and noticing the peculiar people they passed . The city was full of peculiar people , you saw them everywhere you looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along like this , what could he and Barry do but talk ? No trouble at all to bring the talk around to the puzzle . " Incidentally , I 've been thinking over that idea of yours , " Paul would say . " About making them throw the package of money from a train window . Now it seems to me ? " And they were off . Analyzing the fine points . Disagreeing over some part of the time schedule . Nodding , gesturing when some particular idea appealed to them both at once . The weather , that was his greatest ally just now . Such a light springy feeling in the air . It cast a spell over things . It took the  | harshness out of these talks of theirs , gave a kind of reckless gaiety to them all , so that Barry never had to feel that this was anything else but a game . An odd sort of game ? he 'd be a dope if he did n't think that occasionally , Paul knew ? but what was the harm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful April days ? And pretty soon , as he got used to the game , the oddness was beginning to go out of it . The puzzle was becoming a commonplace . Part of the ordinary routine . Marked bills , ransom notes , hiding places , the words had no more shock in them , no more meaning in them almost . And another good thing ? as long as the talk went on , there were n't any more nighttime expeditions , no more stealing , smashing , wild rides through the darkness . Paul watched . IIe saw these feelings growing inside his friend . Pretty soon he could take the last step . From the abstract puzzle to the real thing . Why should he hesitate about this ? Why was he feeling unsure of himself ? The odds were pretty good , were n't they ? The ground had been well ( prepared . Brilliantly prepared , if I say so myself . Thank you , that 's very kind of you . He had to take this last step eventually , did n't IR. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? On the last week end in April , Ellen came to the city with Herb Goldsmith . Dinner was full of talk about trousseau , engagement parties , house furnishings . Paul heard for the first time that the wedding was definitely set for the third Sunday in May , right after her final exams . After dinner , Mother and Dad settled down in front of the television set , and Ellen and Herb drew him upstairs to his bedroom . " Paul darling , " Ellen said , " Herb wants to ask you a big favor . I do hope you 'll be pleased about it . " " Listen , fellow , " Herb said . His heartiest one-of-the-boys manner . " I 'm kind of embarrassed about this . You know me , there is n't much I 'm scared of in this world . From a line of opposition  | tacklers to a battery of high-powered Washington lawyers . But when it comes to this emotion business ? Well , anyway , here it is . I do n't have any family of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and all my pals are scattered around God knows where . I 'll be wanting somebody to stand up with me next month , and give me some moral support , and keep me from making a run for it at the last minute . A best man , I mean . And I ca n't think of anybody I 'd be happier or prouder to have as my best man than you . " A big smirk on his face , full of satisfaction at his big-brotherly feelings . And Paul could n't miss the look on Ellen 's face either . Kind of eager and expectant . She was the one who 'd put Herb up to this . She was trying to be nice to Paul or something , she thought she was making some sort of a wonderful gesture . Scraps to the dog ! Was he supposed to get up on his hind legs and wag his tail and thank her for condescending to notice his existence ? He was damned if he 'd make it so easy for her . " Thanks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cool . " I 'm sorry you ca n't find anyone else to be your best man . I 'll be very happy to help you out . " Just noncommittal enough so they could n't put their finger on anything wrong with it . While they were still smiling indecisively , he nodded and walked out on them . In bed that night , he made a resolution . Tomorrow was the day . It was Sunday , he was meeting Barry for lunch ? he would take the final step before that lunch was over . Maybe it was a little too soon , maybe the whole thing would collapse on the spot ? it just did n't matter any more . He could n't stand another day like this . When Barry woke up , the sun was streaming into his room . Lovely spring weather , and no school to think about , and he was meeting Paul for lunch . They would have one of their nice days  | together . Just wandering around , talking about things in general . It was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few weeks . Almost the way it had been last summer , when they were first getting to know each other , and those crazy nights had n't started yet . Mother was at him all through breakfast . Did he have any news from Harvard yet ? Was n't it strange that they had n't sent him a letter of acceptance yet ? IIe explained to her for the hundredth time that the letters would n't come till the middle of May , and this was only the end of April . But this did n't satisfy Mother . Maybe the ordinary members of the class , who had applied to the second-rate colleges , would n't be hearing till the middle of May , but surely a boy of his caliber ? In spite of himself , her constant talking about it was beginning to make him uneasy . Not that he cared whether or not the college he got into was " second rate . " But it would be awful if Harvard did n't want him . Because he knew that Harvard would want Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding boy like Paul . After breakfast , he said good-by to Mother and Dad . Dad mumbled , hardly looking up from his Sunday crossword puzzle . Mother gave him a kiss , and of course managed to get in a sigh about his appearance . " Really dear , I do wish you 'd start to do something about your weight . Not that I believe these things are important in themselves . But as an indication of a person 's will power ? " He went to the Central Park Zoo . On these nice days Paul and he liked to eat at the open-air cafeteria there . He was ten minutes ahead of time , so he waited by the pool and watched the seals . Awhile later he began to worry . Paul never showed up for their meetings on time , but Barry always worried just the same . He felt a tap on his shoulder . He turned and saw Paul smiling at him .  | He knew right away that something was wrong . In less than a year he had become as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to them all his life . " Come on , let 's eat , " Paul said . The cafeteria was crowded . On a pleasant Sunday in spring , it seemed as if half the population of New York , and all the children under ten , showed up at the Central Park Zoo . They struggled to get their trays filled , then they moved out to the terrace in front . The only empty places were at a table with two middleaged ladies . " Oh it 's dreadful to think about it , " one of the ladies was saying . " If it ever hit this city , the destruction would be terrible . " " Terrible , terrible , " said the other one . " You know , my daughter has filled up her basement with canned goods . " They could n't talk in front of these ladies . They ate lunch in silence . They hurried through the food . Then they went down the stone steps and along the sidewalk until they were out of the zoo . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boys , babies and their colored nurses , faded old men huddled up on benches . They kept going in silence , until they reached a narrow path turning off to a less crowded part of the park . In a few seconds they had left the crowd and the noise behind them . They were walking under an arch of trees . Nobody was in sight except a pair of lovers stretched out on the grass in the distance . Paul gave a kick at the pavement . " Good old spring ! Twittering birds , smiling sun , happy faces ? ! " They walked on a little longer . In a low voice Barry said , " Can you tell me about it , Paul ? " Paul gave a sharp laugh . " You ! You 're just the one I ca n't tell . " Another silence . And then , from Barry , " Why ca n't you tell me ? We always tell things to each other . " Paul let a moment go by , then he turned suddenly . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you wo n't . You 'll turn me down fiat . "  | Barry blinked a little . " I would n't do that . If you need help ? When did I ever turn you down ? " He waited , but Paul did n't say anything . They went on walking . Paul took another kick at the pavement . " The last few weeks ? what we 've been talking about , our abstract puzzle . I want to do it . I want us to do it together . " They were coming out of the arch of trees , they were on a long winding stretch in the open . Around them the park spread out flat and dirty-green , with little figures of people as far as the horizon . " I do n't know what you mean , " Barry said . " I want to do it , " Paul said . " I 'm tired of just talking about it . " He turned suddenly and looked straight at Barry . " Why should n't we ? Are we too scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it ? Worse things are being ( lone every day , all you have to do is read the papers . And for money . At least we wo n't be doing it for some filthy reason like that . " Barry 's voice was so low he could barely hear it himself . " What would our reason be ? " " What ? What ? " Paul 's arms were waving . " Because we want to . Do n't we have a right to do something we want to do ? Everybody else does . Everybody else running off , living their own lives , not giving a damn who they Lunt . You know it yourself , who gives a damn about yeti ? Does anybody in this world care whether you live or die ? Your mother with her kissing and her nagging , all for her own ego , not the least bit interested in what you 're feeling inside of you . And your father too scared to lift a finger for you . " Barry 's mouth was trembling . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like cry or something . " That 's got nothing to do with it , that 's not what we 're talking about . " " That 's just what we 're talking about . Nobody gives a damn for me either . Even the ones I thought ? What a goddamned fool I was ! We 're alone in the world , do n't you see that ? Alone together .  | I care for you , and I 'm the only one . Without me you have n't got anybody . " " Yes ? I know that ? " He was going to cry , how could he stop himself ? " But why does that mean that we have to ? We ca n't ? " " We can . We can do anything . " Paul had stopped walking , his hand was on Barry 's arm . " As long as we do it together . Then it 's something between us , something that belongs to the two of us alone . How can anything be wrong if it 's for the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blur of trees , grass , benches before his eyes . The voice was softer now , not so angry and pushing . " You 're upset about it now . Because it 's so new to you . You 're full of ideas about a thing like this , you think they 're important to you . But they 're not really important to you . What you care about is me and you . " Barry was shaking his head . If he could just shake away the sound of that voice . " And it 'll be so easy , " the voice went on . " That 's the beauty of it . The hardest part is done already , we 've worked out all the details already . What else have we been doing the last few weeks ? All we have to do now is put the plan into action . It 's only a question of you saying yes . All right , all right , do n't say it now , it 's too early now . Think it over , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little clearer before Barry 's eyes . He could see the smile on Paul 's face ? half boyish and gay , half ironic and superior ? the smile that had filled him with such admiration from the beginning . He heard himself stammering out , " Yes , all right , let 's not talk about it now , we 'll talk about something else ? " " Yes , all right , " Paul said . He still did n't loosen his grip on  | Barry 's arm , they still did n't start walking again . " You have to do this for me . If there 's going to be any future between us at all ? " Abruptly he turned away and started walking . At the next path they doubled back the way they had come . After a while Paul was talking again , telling a story about some girl he had taken out a few years ago . And Barry was laughing at the right moments , as usual . When they left the park the weather was n't so nice any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air . " I did n't even look at my math for tomorrow yet , " Paul said , and Barry said , " I have to start in on my history essay , " so they agreed to break up for the day . They said so long and went off in opposite directions . It 's going to work , Paul told himself , standing by the window of his room that afternoon . Is it going to work ? There was a look in the kid 's eyes . It was a look of real horror , you could n't get around that . All right , what else could you expect at the very first moment ? I tell feel different later on , it 'll be what he really wants later on . Then he 'll thank nun for what I did , and it 'll give us a big laugh that he ever should have had any hesitation . Barry stood by the window of his room too . It was funny how calm he suddenly was . Casual almost . As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And nothing had , in a way . Now that the first shock was over , he realized he had been expecting something like this all along . All of Paul 's talk for the last few weeks , this " abstract puzzle " of his ? had n't he guessed deep down , from the start , what it was leading up to ? Only he had n't wanted to admit it to himself , because everything was going along so perfectly . And maybe it was n't really so . After all , how could he have been sure ? It would have been crazy to spoil things because of something that might turn out to be in his imagination .  | Well , it was all out in the open now . Paul would expect an answer from him tomorrow . There was no doubt what the answer had to be , of course . It was a terrible thing , what was going on in Paul 's mind . People did n't do things like that . He would n't do a thing like that . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? Paul had made that pretty clear , had n't he ? That was the end of things then . They would stop seeing each other , and that would be the end . No , he could n't really believe that . This whole thing was a kind of joke that Paul was playing on him , just to see how he would react . Or if it was n't a joke , it was simply a bad mood he was in . A temporary mood , it would n't be long before he got over it . Maybe tomorrow , when they talked about it . If Barry laughed a little , and pretended he had n't really taken Paul seriously , then Paul would start to laugh too . And if he did n't , Barry thought . If he was really ready to break up their friendship over this ? A sudden stinging sensation made him look down at his hand . He saw that he had gripped the window sill so tightly that his fingers were red . " I wo n't do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might happen . Sunday was the cook 's night off , so Mother and Dad took him out to a restaurant . French and sort of fancy . Mother liked French restaurants , she was always comparing them to " those noisy dirty steakhouses " where so many of her friends liked to eat . Barry made up his mind to enjoy himself tonight . He ordered the most exotic dishes on the menu , he talked much more than usual . Why should n't he spend a pleasant evening out with his parents ? He was n't any different from anybody else his age . His high spirits lasted him right on to the next morning . He did n't see Paul till lunch . As soon as the meal was over , he went to Paul 's table and said , " Let 's get out of here , we can have a talk . " Paul 's answer was n't unfriendly , just sort of quiet . " I 've got a  | meeting of the Dramatics Club in five minutes , we 're giving out parts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? " " I 'll see you after school , " Paul said . " I 'll drive you home . " It was an effort for Barry to keep up his high spirits through the afternoon . At last he was sitting by Paul 's side in the car . After a while , in the same quiet voice , Paul said , " Did you think it over ? " Barry laughed . " I 've been thinking all right . I 've decided your scheme is n't ambitious enough . As long as we 're going to be master criminals , we ought to do something that 'll really make a splash . Like blowing up the Empire State Building or stealing the gold out of Fort Knox . " Paul looked at him sharply . " Are you joking or something ? " " Am I joking ? You 're a fine one to talk . You know , you really had me fooled yesterday . You put up such a good act , with that serious expression and all ? " Paul slammed his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop so suddenly that Barry was thrown forward . When he regained his balance he turned and saw the fury in Paul 's eyes . " So its all a joke to you , " Paul was saying . " Your friend is in trouble , he comes to you for help ? you think that 's a big joke . Get out of the car . " " But Paul ? " Get out of the car . You do n't want to ride with me any more . You think I 'm some sort of a moron. 1'in a clown . I do n't have any feelings . " " I do n't think that , Paul . Yoii were n't joking , I see that now . " " Get out of the car . " Barry edged back to the door and stepped out to the street . Paul slammed the door shut . A moment later the car jerked forward . It was almost a minute before Barry realized where he was . Up  | in the Bronx somewhere . There was a subway entrance a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later that evening he said a quick hello to Mother and Dad in the living room and hurried off to his own room . He stayed there , stretched out on the bed , until Mother knocked on the door and told him the dinner guests had arrived . Dinner guests ? he had forgotten all about them . The last thing in the world he felt like doing tonight was making polite small talk in front of strangers . The guests were Dr. Stone and his wife , from Dad 's hospital . They were nice enough , they did n't gush over you in that hypocritical way that older people had . Their daughter Nancy was with them . She was a year younger than he was , a dark seriouslooking girl who would have been fairly pretty except for her glasses . He had met her a few times at the country club , and he had nothing against her . But how was he supposed to sit around tonight and think of sociable things to say to her ? Dinner was all right , because everybody stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talking . Barry could sink into his chair and put on an interested look , as if he were following the conversation . After dinner , Mother said , " Barry dear , we 're going to be playing bridge tonight , why do n't you and Nancy go out to a movie or something ? " They decided to see the new French movie on Fifty-eighth Street , and Dad grinned and reached into his pocket for money . Mother gave a few girlish little laughs and said , " You young people enjoy yourselves , do n't get home too early . " Then they left the apartment . In the cab riding downtown , Nancy said , " I 'm sorry . " He looked up at her . " What about ? " " About tonight . I know you do n't really want to go out tonight . " " No , that 's not true . I 'm very glad ? " He broke off , blushing a little .  | She went on , " I know how it feels , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 're saddled with somebody . I 'm sorry " He looked at her curiously . He had n't really looked at her yet . Then , to his own surprise , he found himself smiling . " I guess I 've been awfully rude . But it 's all right now , I 'll enjoy the movie . " She smiled too . " I 'm the one who ought to apologize . I was annoyed at you . Because you were n't turning handsprings at the mere thought of taking me out , I guess . So I decided to speak up and embarrass you a little . " " Well , you succeeded all right . " " I 'm always doing things like that , " she said . " I 've got a mean disposition . And I 'm a terrible egotist . I think it 's everybody 's duty to like me and admire inc . " " I guess everybody 's that way , " Barry said . " I 'm that way myself . I 'm always telling myself that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really amounts to the same thing , does n't it ? " She looked surprised , behind her glasses . " Why should you think that people do n't like you ? Everybody says what a nice boy you are . " He felt a funny little pang of pleasure at this . " No , I do n't believe that . " The cab pulled up at the movie theater , so that was the end of their conversation . After the movie they did a lot more talking , over coffee and ice cream . She told him about this school she was going to , this sort of finishing school where all the girls were so silly and uninteresting . He told her about the classification and significance of rock formations . She was amazed at his knowledge , she was always amazed at people with scientific minds , because her own mind was so sloppy and unscientific . What she loved best in the world was music , and especially going to the opera . He cried out that he loved the opera too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when two opera lovers get together ? they were busy comparing the merits of singers , sighing ecstatically or groaning angrily over this or that performance , plunging into their own version of the tenor 's aria from Aida . And then , when they had exhausted themselves on opera , they slipped into a low serious conversation about their common experience of wearing glasses since childhood . It was midnight before they knew it . They had to hail a cab and hurry uptown , because their parents would be worried about them . The bridge game was over . Mother was full of sly little remarks on the lateness of the hour , then the Stones said good night . Barry shook hands quickly with Nancy . " I 'll give you a ring , " he said . He lay awake in bed that night . Everything 's going to be all right , he kept thinking . He was n't so different after all . The world was full of things that he could enjoy , other things besides Paul King and what he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . That crazy idea of his , it was giving Paul real pain . What was a friend for , if not to help you in your moments of pain ? He would talk to Paul gently and persuasively like a friend . He would make him see that he did n't have to carry out this crazy idea of his , he could find just as much happiness in other ways . He would talk to Paul first thing in the morning . He got to school a little early , because he wanted to find Paul before the first class . As he was putting his books away in his locker , he felt Paul 's tap on his shoulder . He saw the worn gray look on Paul 's face . " Listen , kid , " Paul started right in , " I 'm sorry for yesterday . Kicking you out of the car like that , that was a crazy thing to do . " " That 's all right . Everybody loses their temper once in a while . " It was n't my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my control . I do n't know what I 'm doing these days . It 's this thing that 's on  | my mind . But you know all that already , we 've talked about it too much already . " " And I wanted to talk about it some more , Paul . I know how you feel and all , but it does n't have to be that way . I realized something last night ? " " We 've talked about it too much already , " Paul said . " Talk is n't any good to me . There has to be something else now . You have to help me now . You have to say yes , and we have to do this together . " Barry turned a little pale , he could feel his confidence weakening . " No . It 's a terrible thing . " " It 's a terrible thing . All right , it 's a terrible thing . But it 's a terrible thing to hurt a friend too . That 's what you 're doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? You 're killing me . " But that 's so silly . Why do you have to be like this ? Everything would be so wonderful , if you only were n't like this . If you 'll let me tell you about last night ? " " I 'm not silly . " Paul raised his voice . " You 're killing me is that silly ? You 're a bastard . Bastard ! Dirty bastard ! " A couple of girls turned to look at them from the end of the corridor , then hurried away . " That 's not fair , " Barry said . " You know how I feel about you . I would n't do a thing to hurt you . Nobody means as much to me as you do . " " Then stop doing this to me ! " There was a desperate , almost begging note in Paul 's voice that Barry had never heard there before . " For God 's sake , stop doing this to me ! " Then Paul turned sharply and walked down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning were all gone now . His head was whirling again . Was he really doing something awful to Paul , hurting him , killing him , the way he  | said ? For a moment he thought , Why not ? What did other things matter ? Was there anything more important than Paul and him ? With a shudder he shook this thought away . No , I wo n't do that . Whatever happens . I 'd break up the whole friendship first , stop seeing him once and for all . Maybe that was the answer , he thought . Put it to him point-blank , right after lunch . You give up this crazy idea of yours , or that 's the end of things between us . That was the answer , of course . You have to start acting like a man eventually . Lunch came , and he gulped his food . Just as soon as he had finished he was by Paul 's side , telling him firmly that he wanted to have a talk with him . They left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , behind the volleyball court . No words were spoken between them , but as they walked Barry felt his resolution softening . To stop seeing Paul once and for all ? There was a friendship between them . How would Paul feel if his friend suddenly came out and said , " This is the end of things . " You ca n't do something like that to your friend . By the time they reached the volleyball court he had changed his plans . He would n't break things up now , he would give Paul another chance . He would try , just as patiently as he could , to talk him out of this crazy idea . He turned to Paul and started to smile . " Now listen to me , " Paul said , while Barry 's smile was still forming . " I 've been thinking it over . I 'm calmer now , and I 've made my decision . I came to you as a friend , and you turned me down . Okay , that 's your privilege , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear . There 's no more friendship between us . We 're in the same school , so we ca n't avoid seeing each other , but we do n't have to talk to each other , we can stay out of each other 's way . There 's only a few more months to the term , then we 'll both be going off to college . If you get into Harvard , I 'll just go to my  | second choice . After that we 'll probably never run into each other again . Anyway , let 's hope so . Now good luck , and so long . " Barry 's mouth was dry . He heard his voice come out with an unfamiliar hollow sound to it . " But ? you do n't mean that ? " " Yes , I do mean it . It 's the best thing for both of us . So what about it ? " For a moment Barry could n't answer . And then , gathering up all his strength , he said quickly , " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , we wo n't be friends any more . " " All right then , " Paul said . " All right , " Barry said . They stood there for a moment , looking at each other . Then Paul turned and started down the hill . Barry waited a minute , counting the seconds under his breath . Then he started down the hill too . III IT WAS a lucky thing the Dramatics Club held its first reading of The Tempest after school . That was what Paul needed more than anything else right now , a chalice to raise his voice , wave his arms in the air , pour out his feelings . He was Prospero . That meant lots of long speeches to make , impressive poses to strike , a wonderful feeling of standing on top of the world , looking down on the ants far below , making the elements do his bidding with a flick of his wand and a rolling phrase . A wonderful feeling , only he could n't seem to work himself into it at the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very virtue of compassion in thee , I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered ?  | " No , no , Paul dear , " said little Miss Spengler , the dramatics teacher . " More feeling , more feeling . Remember , Prospero is a great magician , and very proud and boastful . Now you know what I mean , dear , this is the sort of thing you generally do so well . " Paul mumbled an apology , and the reading went on . He read the lines on the page , but his mind was back on the hill behind the volleyball court , back with the pale , pained face of his friend . All right , if that 's the way he wants it ! All right , if he thinks he can get along without me ! The voice of Miranda , that scrawny little Vera Simmons from the junior class , came whining into his thoughts . Sir , are not you my father ? Thy mother was a piece of virtue , and She said ? thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Oh dear me , no , " Miss Spengler broke in , shaking her head . " We 'll have to cut that , I 'm afraid . You see , there 's the great difficulty with Shakespeare . You have to keep your eyes open every single moment , or else something is liable to slip by . " Miss Spengler had been against The Tempest all along . Her own choice had been The Admirable Crichton , which the Dramatics Club had done so successfully five years before . The cut was made , they went on . All right , Paul thought , he thinks he can get along without me . Well , we 'll see how long it lasts . He 's made his big moral gesture now , thinks he 's being real strong and manly . How is he going to feel tomorrow , when he has to get through the whole day and he knows there wo n't be a word or a look from me ? And the same the day after tomorrow . And all the days after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and my trust ,  | Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was ? " Yes , that 's much better , Paul dear , " said Miss Spengler . " You 're beginning to get the spirit of it now . " My false brother , Paul thought . He wanted to shout it out even louder than he was doing . My false brother ! Then Miranda drifted off to sleep , and he clapped his hands with an air of great authority ? Approach , my Ariel ; come ! Then , for a while , it was little Howard Knapp who had the big speeches . Little ham . Why did he have to read everything in such an exaggerated voice ? And that silly old Spengler female just could n't coo ecstatically enough over his so-called acting . Well , Paul got some of his own back at the end of the scene , when Prospero 's big speeches came along . Thou best knowest What torment I did find thee in : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts Of ever angry bears ? And did n't Paul make the most out of those groans and howls ! Just to show that little I loward Knapp the way it ought to be done . By the end of the first act , he was feeling a lot better . Why should he have got so upset in the first place ? After all , he had known from the start that Barry was going to strain and struggle a lot harder than usual . From the start a complete break was inevitable . It was the only thing that would make him desperate enough to give in at the end . So why let it bother him when it finally happened ? Driving home later on , he repeated all this reasoning to himself , laughed , and stepped up the speed way over  | the limit . Just to remind himself he was n't the type who got scared at things . During dinner Mother was all upset . Another crisis in the wedding plans ? every night there was a new crisis in the wedding plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago , and now , out of nowhere , she remembered a whole branch of the family that she had completely forgotten to invite . What could she do ? If she sent invitations to them now , and if they compared notes with other members of the family and discovered they had been afterthoughts , they would be terribly offended . On the other hand , if she did n't invite them at all ? Dad looked up from his plate and said , " This subject is beginning to bore the hell out of me , Harriet . Suppose we drop it and finish our meal in peace . " Mother subsided , but the worried look was still on her face . After dinner they went back to the living room . Mother said , " Are you going out now , dear ? Did n't you mention you were going to study tonight with Barry ? " " I 'm studying alone tonight , " Paul said . Mother started in on Barry . What a sweet boy he was , how bright and well-mannered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy like that . " That mother of his is a crazy woman , " Dad said . " She 's always bending my ear at Parents ' Day up at the school . Psychology , for Christ 's sake ! " Even so , Mother went on , Barry was a lovely boy . It certainly was n't fair to judge a boy by his parents ? " I 've got homework to do , " Paul said . He got up quickly and went out of the room . He went upstairs , planted himself in front of his desk , opened up a book . But it was no use , it was all starting up again . So he thinks he can get along without me ? He told himself now how stupid he was being , he went over and over that neat little chain  | of reasoning which proved once and for all ? He was on his feet , pacing the floor . Maybe you better give it up , he was telling himself . Give it up , go on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got , something you can depend on . And you 'll still have Barry at least . Call him up right now , and tell him so . He was out of his room , starting down the stairs to the phone . But he stopped at the sound of his mother 's voice , drifting up from the living room . She was talking on the phone herself . " But what should I do about the invitations , dear ? ? Yes ? ? Yes , of course , why did n't I think of that myself ? Thank you so much , darling , now I 'll hang up , it 's long distance . Oh , would you like to say hello to your father or to Paul ? ? All right , I 'll tell them you 're very busy ? " Paul 's knuckles were white against the railing . He turned quickly and started up the stairs again . I 'm damned if I 'll give it up , he told himself . I can hold out as long as he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much it hurts me . Every minute it 's hurting him more . Barry was in the living room with Mother and Dad . The television was on . " Of course , I do n't suppose there 's any real chance of it , " Mother had said as she turned it on , " but maybe something not too idiotic will show up on television tonight . Let 's take a look , out of curiosity . " That was two and a half hours ago , she had been taking a look ever since . Whenever she caught herself laughing at some joke from the screen , she always added in the next breath , " It 's so childish and silly , you have to laugh when you think that people are paid all that money for such nonsense . " Dad was sitting back in his easy chair , with his fingers touching lightly over his stomach and a mild amiable smile on his face . He seemed to be watching the television too . But Barry could tell , from the way his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts were far away . Daydreaming about that Chess and Checkers Club of his , Barry supposed . And that friend of his , the heart specialist , whose jokes Dad was always repeating . Barry watched the television intently . He hung on every word , laughed at every joke , stared and stared at every face . His fingers held on to the edge of his chair , as if he needed all his strength to keep from being pulled out of it . Pulled where ? It was the telephone at the other end of the room that dragged at him like a magnet . If he forgot to keep his attention riveted on the screen , if he let himself relax just a little bit , then his gaze would snap back to that telephone . No , I 'm not going to call him , he told himself . Whatever I do . " Why so quiet , darling ? " Mother said . " What 's the matter with you tonight , why are n't you talking ? " It always annoyed him when Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motherly interest . Why should he get this feeling of casual , almost lazy malice hidden inside of it ? No reason at all . There must be something terribly nasty and unnatural about him . " I 'm fine , " he said . " I just do n't have anything to talk about . " But Mother had lost interest already . She was yawning and saying how tired she was , what a hectic day it had been at her Music Appreciation Group . A little while later Barry was lying in bed . " There is n't any more friendship between us , " Paul said . " Good-by and good luck , " he said . And his face was so calm and indifferent . He might have been saying good-by to a stranger . Well , all right , why not ? If he can be calm and indifferent , why ca n't I be calm and indifferent too ? More so , even more so . I 'm better off without him anyway . There was always something a little crazy with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much better to be out of all that . New people will come  | along , new interests to fill up my life , pretty soon I wo n't even remember what it was like with him . Nancy Stone . Call up Nancy Stone , call her up first thing tomorrow night . Now there 's a wonderful girl . They got along perfectly right from the start . Going out with a girl like that ? the fun they could have , the evenings together . Nice normal evenings , the way a person is supposed to have . And the past forgotten in no time at all . His fears rushed back to him next morning as he started off to school . He had three classes with Paul today . He had no idea how his fine resolutions would hold up , with Paul so close to him . So that he could catch Paul 's attention without even raising his voice , so that he only had to reach out and touch him . He walked into his first class . Paul was only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . He got a sense of Paul turning his eyes away too . From then on he plunged into French verbs with special energy , so that Mademoiselle Fontaine told him he was making " much progress . " It was just like the television last night . As long as he kept himself absorbed in other things ? In the hall , after lunch , Paul went marching past him flanked by a couple of fellows from the baseball team . They were laughing loudly at something . Paul 's laugh was the loudest of all . Barry felt his face growing hot . No , it was n't easy , but eventually the day came to an end , and he had done it . There was a kind of pleasure and satisfaction in that . It lasted him through the subway ride back home , and then he went straight to the phone and called Nancy . She was glad to hear from hint . She did n't get all gushy and breathless , like some girls , but she did n't put on that bored supersophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him quietly that she would enjoy going out with him Saturday night . She did n't seem to feel that any tricks were necessary with him . The only problem now was to get through till Saturday night .  | Well , why should n't he be able to ? It ought to come easier from now on , with his date with Nancy waiting for him at the end . In the days that followed , he made more and more use of that date . After his brushes with Paul in the school corridors , he would say to himself , " You 're seeing Nancy Saturday night , everything will be all right when you see Nancy . " And in the long evenings , with the television droning away , Mother smirking or snapping , Dad serenely drifting out of it all , he could check his impulse towards the telephone in only one way . " Do n't he a dope . Saturday night is almost here . You can certainly hold out till Saturday night . " Saturday night finally came . He let Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind . She chattered away quite cheerfully , telling funny stories about the snobbish principal of her school , laughing at the stories herself , not at all affected by Barry 's silence . It was just as if she knew he was in a mood , and she was trying to help him through it . How grateful he was that she was n't the type of girl who feels obliged to " draw a man out , " to widen her eyes at him and make him talk about himself . Towards the end of the meal he began to join in on the conversation . He asked questions at first , then he tried out a story of his own . And then , before he knew it , they were chattering and laughing together . After dinner they went to a double feature . The first picture was a western , with lots of fighting and yelling and shooting , and long slow shots of the same mountains and deserts that show up in every western . Barry tried a wisecrack about halfway through , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't the sort of person who thought that a movie theater was like a church , and you had to maintain a religious silence every minute . But then the western was over , and the main picture came on . It was a revival of Camille with Greta Garbo , and from the first moment a sort of hush came over Nancy . No wisecracks now , Barry  | knew , and he settled back to lose himself in the story as completely as she was doing . Once or twice , at the start , it crossed his mind , Should I take her hand ? Should I try putting my arm around her ? But then he felt annoyed at himself . It was n't that sort of date , or that sort of girl . Where you went through the routine maneuvers , A , B , C , like an exercise , without having to put your feelings into it at all . A sweet dying strain from La Traviata rose up in the background as Greta Garbo gazed despairingly into Robert Taylor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Greta Garbo was so beautiful that you could n't pay much attention to anything else . She told Robert Taylor that they must n't dare to fall in love , it was sheer madness , he had his whole future ahead of him , and what was she ? But he simply leaned forward to kiss her . She shook her head in agony , then she sighed , then they came together . La Traviata rose up again and seemed to wind itself around them . Something mule Barry turn his head . Even in the dim light he could see that there were tears on Nancy 's cheeks . He reached out and found her hand . She did n't draw it away . It rested softly under his . Greta Garbo broke out of Robert Taylor 's arms , did a little pirouette across the room , gave a warm mocking laugh . When the picture was over , Nancy and Barry stood up in silence and moved with the crowd out to the street . He took her arm and they started up Lexington Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block before Nancy broke the silence with a giggle , and then spoke in a husky voice , " Do we dare to stop for a cup of coffee ? Or would it be sheer madness ? " He answered , " What do I care ? I will give up everything for this one wild moment ! " And they turned into the coffee shop at the corner and spent the next hour with Camille , laughing at how silly it was , sighing at how beautiful it was . She lived across the park , on Central Park West . In the bus  | they were silent again , soothed by the soft spring breeze through the window and the quiet streets around them . It had been a wonderful evening , Barry told himself . It had been a wonderful evening , just the way he knew it would be . Healthy and normal , and everything just right . A few more evenings like this one ? " We 're here . " Nancy was nudging him . He helped her out of the bus , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long gray awning loomed closer , he felt a small chill deep inside of him . No , he did n't . It was n't anything at all . Everything was perfect , wonderful . They were in the lobby of her building , they were riding up in the elevator . Then they were standing outside her door . I-Ier hand was in his . " It 's been a wonderful evening . " IIcr hand started to slip away . Another moment , and she would be through the door , out of his sight , and he would be riding down in the elevator alone . " We 'll see each other again , wo n't we ? " he said . She nodded and started to answer , but he went on , " Next Friday maybe . And maybe we can have Saturday too . " Again he did n't wait for an answer . He leaned forward and kissed her quickly on the cheek , then he turned and pushed the button for the elevator . The trip down was slow , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should his heart be sinking ? He had just spent the happiest night of his life . He had proved to himself that he could enjoy himself like everyone else , he did n't depend on anyone . Outside the air had turned colder . He walked to the bus stop quickly . Not a bus in sight . He waited , pacing a little . In his mind he made himself live through the happy moments of this evening . He told himself the stories she had told him about her school . He laughed again at that stupid western . IIe looked deep into Greta Garbo 's eyes and heard her husky voice in his ears . He laughed and sighed over his coffee ?  | The last cup of coffee at midnight . Friendly talk , a joke or two , and always , before the evening was over , those quiet words that brought such a feeling of warmth and peace . " How amazing it was that we met . What a wonderful piece of luck . How easily we might have missed each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How awful and empty ? " He broke off with a shake of his head . No , that 's over with , he told himself . That is n't necessary any more . There 's something else , there 's something much better . Keep your mind on next Friday night . He was startled by the screeching and rattling of the bus as it suddenly pulled up to the corner . He had n't noticed it coming at all . Tuesday morning there was a school assembly . A lady gave a lecture on Australian folk music , accompanying herself on a zither . The classes always filed in alphabetically for assemblies , and today it happened that two girls whose names began with L and M were absent , so Barry was sitting right next to Paul . He seemed to be enjoying the program thoroughly . His laughter at the Australian lady 's jokes rang in Barry 's ears . When he shifted in his chair Barry could feel the touch of his knee or his elbow . They did n't say a word to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night Barry went to the phone and called up Nancy . IIe knew their date was n't till Friday , but would she see him tonight too ? She was n't sure if she ought to . She did n't usually go out on dates in the middle of the week . Not that her parents would object or anything ? especially since they liked Barry very much ? but there was her homework and all . " But I 'd really like to see you tonight , " he said . " It 's sort of important , I mean ? " Well , why did n't he come over to the apartment after dinner ? she suggested . He could help her with her  | memorizing of the Ode on a Grecian Urn . That was good enough for Barry . So he spent the evening listening to her recite poetry and telling her when she made a mistake . Her little brother Stanley , who was twelve , kept popping into the room . He was a nice kid , but sort of fresh . His parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , Barry , " he said , " who has thicker glasses , you or Nancy ? " Three or four times he popped in to ask this question . Finally Barry yelled at him , and then felt ashamed of himself for it . But he also felt better inside . He could even tell Nancy all about the Australian lady and her zither , without any foolish trembling in his voice . On Friday night they were together again . Another double feature , and a long session of talk afterwards . It was the nicest night they had spent together yet . And they would be seeing each other on Saturday . The weather was especially pleasant on Saturday . Barry walked through the park to Nancy 's building . On the way , a thought came into his mind ? less than a year ago , he thought , he would have been exploring the city with Paul in weather like this . He tried to force the thought away , but his mind would n't let it go . The movies wo n't be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more active , with crowds of people , with lots of noise . His father had slipped him an extra ten dollars the other day , why did n't they go dancing somewhere , maybe at one of the hotel supper clubs with a famous band ? Nancy blushed and said that if he could stand her dancing she would n't object . He laughed and said that he was a lot worse dancer than she could ever be . So they went downtown , and they danced a little , and Barry drank a lot . It made him slightly dizzy . And noisy . He had never made so much noise in his life . And then , at one o'clock in the morning , when he was on his way uptown in a cab with Nancy , the liquor wore off and he sank into silence .  | " What 's the matter , Barry ? " she said . " Is there anything I can do to help ? " His head snapped up . " Help what ? " " Well , I thought ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good to talk things out . That 's what I always do with my mother , when something 's upsetting me . " " You 're not my mother ! What a crazy thing to say ! " Right away , he could have bitten his tongue for talking to her like that . He saw the hurt look coming into her eyes . He went on quickly , " Nancy , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to ? I 'm just under a strain . School and all , and waiting to hear from a college . I just did n't want to bother you with my troubles . " " But it 's all right , for Heaven 's sake ? " The hurt look went away , and she laughed . " It 's this stepping on each other 's feet all night that did it . Let 's face it , we 'd better stick to operas and French movies . " " A couple of hopeless highbrows , " he said , smiling a little . And for the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just announced its repertoire for the fall , and they agreed to hear all the Verdi and all the Mozart together . Then they got into an argument over Madame Butterfly . Barry thought it was " awfully sentimental , " and Nancy told him that was a typical male point of view . " It hurts your ego that the hero should be such a terrible person . " But Barry objected strenuously to that . He was crazy about Rigolctto , was n't he ? The second week of May began . There were the long days at school , keeping his eyes hard on his books , hesitating just a moment whenever he was about to turn a corner . And there were the nights , talking to Nancy on the phone , being with her , telling himself how much good it was doing him . Just like anybody else his age . Why did he ever imagine he was different from anybody else his age ?  | " Darling , I 'm worried about you , " Mother said to him one night . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like your appetite . Henry , I wish you 'd take a look at the boy and give him some vitamin pills . " " I 'm feeling fine , " Barry said . " I do n't need vitamin pills . " " And your temper is short too , " Mother said calmly . " It 's just as I thought ? vitamin pills . " At school next day an announcement was made about the annual senior party . It would be held in the auditorium next Friday night , and class members could bring dates or come alone . He was n't going to come alone . He could just see himself fidgeting on the stag line or wandering around among the crowd . Maybe bumping into people who were surrounded by a group , having a wonderful time ? He invited Nancy to the party . And then , as the day approached , he began to wonder if he should have done it . It would be the first time he had ever taken her someplace where they were bound to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over that , was n't he ? He did n't have to spend his whole life dodging and hiding . At school on Friday he went through the day almost belligerently , ready to stand up for his rights the moment anybody threatened them . He kept his chin thrust forward all through Mademoiselle Fontaine 's French class , because that was the only class that he shared with ? " Monsieur Morris , I have asked you a question . If you will please descend from the world of dreams , and answer me . " When he got home that evening , he started straight to his room , he had to dress for the party . It was going to be formal , and Dad was letting him use the car for the occasion . His hand was on the door when Mother called out from the living room , " Darling , come in here a minute . " He went into the living room with a protest automatically forming  | on his lips . But he cut it short when he saw the funny pleased way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter came for you this morning , " Mother said , and she held it out to him . He noticed that the envelope had been opened . He noticed that the return address was Harvard University . With his fingers trembling a little he took out the letter : " Dear Mr. Morris , we are pleased to inform you ? " When he had finished reading it , he looked up from it uncertainly . " I got accepted ? " Then Mother and Dad were down on him . Mother was kissing and hugging him , Dad was shaking his hand . Then there was some business about opening a bottle of champagne and drinking to the good news , and finally he broke away from them and went to his room . He dressed himself slowly for the party . A wonderful thing had just happened to him . Getting into a good college was a milestone in a boy 's life . I le was excited and happy . He ought to be , so he was . Who else got in ? he asked himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Harvard was willing to take somebody ordinary like Barry Morris , they would certainly grab an outstanding person ? " If you get into Harvard , I 'll just go to my second choice . " The words still stuck in his memory . I 'll just go to my second choice . And everything would be over after that . What could anybody possibly do about it ? He shook his head quickly . No , he would never do that . He called for Nancy at seven . She was dressed in a frilly pink evening dress . First time lie had ever seen her dressed up fancy . She looked nice . Sort of self-conscious and young-looking . But it was nice . In the car he told her his big news , and she congratulated him so warmly , and there was such real pride and pleasure in her eyes . He was happy . Ile had got into college , and he was taking his girl to a party , and he was going to enjoy this evening as he 'd never enjoyed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were floodlights  | on the parking lot in back . As they got out of the car , Nancy slipped her glasses off and put them in her bag . She gave a little grin , but said nothing . Inside , the buffet supper was being served . Ile took Nancy to the line and introduced her to his friends and made the usual sidelong comparisons with the girls they had brought . Then he looked over the crowd . No sign of him yet . They found a place with two other couples . Pretty soon they were all eating and talking . Nancy was n't having any trouble getting along with these people , it was just as if she had gone to school with them as long as he had . It was happiness that was doing it , he knew . Usually she was shy with strangers . " Oh , Paul 's here , " he heard somebody cry out . " Oh Paul , Paul , come on and eat with us ! " He saw him on the buffet line now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden Barry felt sloppy and overgrown , and wished he was wearing normal clothes again . There was a girl with him , Rita something from the junior class . She was a pretty girl , and she was an inch taller than he was . " And they do n't come any dumber , " he used to say . " It 's very relaxing . She carries all her assets right out in front where you can see them . " Barry saw him through the buffet line , saw him take a place at the opposite corner of the room . Soon he was hidden from sight by three or four people crowding around him . The dinner was over , the dancing began . It was a pretty good band , the Senior Party Committee had paid a lot of money for it . Barry moved Nancy heavily around the floor , trying to keep in step and follow the music . There was that Rita something , but she was dancing with a different boy . And he was dancing with a different girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the girls were crazy to dance with him . There was a pause while the band rested up . Barry led Nancy to the punch bowl . " Did you hear about Paul ? " he heard somebody  | saying . But he could n't catch any more . What about him ? He found Victor Loving by the punch bowl , in the stag line . Victor'Loving always knew what was going on . " Did n't you hear ? " Victor said . " He was accepted at Harvard today . And he says he 's going to refuse them . He says Harvard is too stuffy and conventional for him , he prefers to go out West somewhere . Some people will say anything to make a dramatic effect . " The band returned , the music started up again . Out West somewhere . Nancy was in his arms , they were moving around the floor again . Out West somewhere . There was a buzzing in his ears . They bumped into a couple . Apologies . One , two , back in step again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music , punch , sandwiches . Another rest for the band , filled in by comical verses about each member of the class . Written by the chairman of the Party Committee , who blushed at the applause . Back to the dancing again . A tap on Harry 's shoulder . " May I cut in ? " IIe whirled around at the voice . Saw the face , the light hair , the smile . Not turned on him though . Turned on Nancy , all for her , and he might not have been standing there at all . She gave a smile in Barry 's direction , then she was being danced off . He threaded through the damicers to the punch bowl . Stood among the stags , looked out at the floor , at the two of them laughing , turning . All of a sudden she was doing all the steps , so easy and graceful . And that smile was turned on full for her benefit . He could shut his eyes and still see it , that smile . IIe knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned away , could n't look any more . Later she was by his side , her arm in his . A few more dances . Crowd starting to thin out . But the ones who stayed were getting louder and happier . A rhumba . There he was , back with Rita again , slithering away from each other , then together . His eyes sparkling , her eyes empty in spite of her big smile . His arm  | raised , fingers snapping . No self-consciousness at all . Barry would have died first . He was gripping Nancy 's arm tightly . " Come on , let 's go . " Before she could say anything , he went on , " Head needs clearing , the party 's breaking up anyway . " She followed him quietly through the remaining couples . A few quick good-bys , see you Monday , wonderful party , was n't it ? Your senior party , one of the great events of your high school career , you 're supposed to remember it all your life . Out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car in silence , and then they were sweeping down the hill . Nancy leaning back by his side , and a happy peaceful smile on her face . " It was just a perfect evening , " she said . " Barry , it was just perfect . " He did n't answer . He kept his eyes on the road . " I do n't know how I can thank you , " she said . " I do n't think I 'll ever be able to thank you . " He still did n't take his eyes off the road . " It was a terrible evening , " he said . He heard the bewilderment coming into her voice . " But ? I thought we were having such a good time ? " " That 's what you thought , " he said . There was no sound from her . He could imagine the way she was looking at him . His foot pressed down hard on the gas . The car spurted forward , the wind whipped against his face . Pretty soon they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached over her and pushed open the door . " I 'll say good night right here , " he said . " I 'm too tired to go upstairs . " " I could make you some coffee , we would n't wake anybody up ? " Never mind , " he said . " Put on your glasses , or you 'll fall on your face . "  | He could feel her staring at him . And then , without another word , she jumped out of the car and ran up the sidewalk . She did n't look back at him once . The next morning , while Mother and Dad were still in their room , he went to the phone to call Nancy . He waited a long time while her kid brother Stanley fetched her . Maybe she would n't talk to him at all . He could n't blame her if she did n't . And then her voice was in his ear , quietly saying his name . " I thought I ought to call , " he answered . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say . I apologize , but I know that does n't make it all right . " " It 's all right , " she said . " I was acting silly all night . Floating around , playing at being a glamour girl . It 's no wonder it got on your nerves . " " No , please , " he said . " It was n't your fault . You 're a wonderful girl , 1 never met a girl I liked so much . It was n't you at all . I do n't know how to explain it . " " You do n't have to explain it . " " Yes , I do . Not just because of last night . But what I 've been doing all along . " I le paused , wet his lips , hurried on , " It 's me , do n't you see . Something inside of me . I 'm not right for people . It 's always been that way . When I met you I tried to pretend I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else . " " No , I 'm not . Last night just proved it all over again . I 'm not right for people . Even if I try to be . " " I do n't understand you . You 're the nicest boy I know . " " No , I 'm not . That 's the whole thing . I 'm not nice . A nice girl like you ? There just is n't anything for me with a nice girl like you . With nice decent people ? there 's nothing for me. "  | A moment later , in a softer voice , she said , " You do n't think we should go out together any more ? " " That 's what I 'm trying to say , I guess . Because of me , not you . As long as you understand that . " He heard her give a small sigh . " Well , I think I understand . " " Well good-by then , Nancy . " " Good-by , Barry . " He waited to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lowered the receiver . For a long time he sat where he was . His eyes were fixed on the queer slithery modernistic lamp across the room . It was one of Mother 's newest favorites . He could remember the triumphant look on her face , the day she brought it home . And now he knew the truth , did n't he ? No more pretending now . No more nice girls as camouflage to hide his feelings from himself . Now he was face to face with the one big truth ? he was all alone in the world . There was nobody in the world for him but Paul . And since Paul would take him back on only one condition ? No , he would n't do that . Whatever he did ? Well , he just had to make up his mind to it . That 's what life was going to be for him . For the rest of his life this funny thing would keep him apart from other people . When things are inevitable , then you have to accept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , good morning . " Dad 's voice broke in on his thoughts . " I hope you 're feeling tip-top this morning . " Barry murmured good morning . " Had your breakfast yet ? " Dad said . " Sit down , drink your orange juice . It 'll give you muscles . " Barry sat down at the table across from Dad . " Well now , " Dad said . " What 's the program ? No school today , is there ? I suppose you 're planning to celebrate in an appropriate  | manner . " And then Dad 's newspaper was spread open in front of him . Face your responsibility , Barry thought . But how could he do it ? His whole life with nobody in it , nobody to see at the end of the day and drink coffee with before it was time for sleep . It was n't his fault if he had this thing inside of him . Why should he suffer for it like this ? Why not stop the suffering right away ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . Whatever he did . He would fill up his life with other things . If there were n't any people for him , there were books , and records to listen to . It was a long time since he had listened to music . He got up from the table and muttered that he was going out . Music was what he needed now . He would go downtown to the record shop and listen to some things in a booth . The record shop was crowded . It always was on a Saturday . He looked through the catalogue , and with some difficulty attracted the attention of the clerk , a pink-checked young man with blackrimmed glasses . They always made him nervous , these recordshop clerks . They fixed him with their bored contemptuous stares , as if they could see right through him to the secret in his heart ? that he was less interested in buying a record than in giving himself a free concert in one of the booths . His nervousness made him stumble over his words , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? You 'll have to speak more clearly ! " Awhile later Barry slipped off to a booth with half a dozen records . He put on a Haydn symphony . There 's nothing like a Haydn symphony when you 're jumpy and upset . So classical and serene and controlled , as Herr Weinstock said in music appreciation . The first notes were heard . The low long roll of a drum , then a beautiful broad melody . So serene and classical . And full of sadness too . Herr Weinstock had n't mentioned that a Haydn symphony could be so sad . The slow part ended , a fast part began .  | Hull of energy , high-spirited and happy . It jarred with his feelings . Happiness and high spirits were n't for him any more . But no , that was being silly . Music was just what he needed now . An hour later he returned the records to the counter ? putting them down quickly and turning away before the clerk could catch his eye . He hurried out of the shop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told himself . Books would n't be any better . He could n't even imagine himself opening a book . The sun was shining down so gently . Such beautiful weather , perfect May weather . It would n't last long . Pretty soon the days would turn hot and sticky , and the streets would be terrible to walk on . He loved this weather ordinarily . Why did things have to go wrong for him just when the weather was so beautiful ? If his life had to turn sour like this , why could n't it happen in the winter , when the days were dull and bitter anyway ? He was hungry . A clock in a store window showed him it was one o'clock . He turned into the first drugstore and ate a hamburger slowly , not even noticing how it tasted . What about his rock collection ? On a lovely day like this he used to go up to the Palisades and look for specimens . He used to go with Johnnie Dykeman . But that was a long time ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you thought about it . Why , it was only a year ago , it was only last spring . He wondered , did Johnnie ever go out to look for rocks any more ? He had n't seen much of Johnnie this year , they just did n't get together . It was his fault , he knew . He had somehow made it clear to Johnnie , without saying it in so many words , that things were different between them . But there had n't been any fight or anything , they were still friendly when they ran into each other at school . Why could n't he call up Johnnie now and ask him if he was busy this afternoon ? It would be fun , going out on another rock-hunting expedition with Johnnie .  | He went to the drugstore phone booth . It was funny how he still remembered the number , even though he had n't used it for so long . It was Johnnie 's voice that answered the phone . " Hello . " The sound of it was strange in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no trouble recognizing it , but it was n't what he expected or remembered somehow . " Hello , who is this ? " Johnnie said . Barry opened his mouth . He did n't say anything . " Hello , hello , " Johnnie said . " Is this some sort of gag ? Is this you , Mickey ? Trying to be funny again ? " Who was Mickey ? Barry did n't know any Mickey . He did n't even know if it was a boy or a girl . He hung up the phone quickly , and walked out of the drugstore as fast as he could , feeling as if everybody was looking at him and snickering . He hardly knew where he walked after that . There was the park , the animals in the zoo , that chimpanzee that always spit at people through the bars . The usual crowd of squealing , waving people who seemed to get pleasure out of being spit at by a chimpanzee . Beyond the zoo now , up the hill , and there were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got dark they sat there , shabby , dirty , gazing clown at their checker games . Nothing else to ( 10 all day long . Well , maybe there were worse ways of using up the day . At least they had something to take their mind off things . Out of the park now . Feet getting sore , legs getting tired . He turned uptown . Direction of home . Though he did n't actually say to himself , " Time to go home now . " The familiar blue awning was in sight now , then the slick marble lobby , up in the elevator , into his room . Very quick , so Mother would n't notice him . The clock on his desk said three-thirty . Half the afternoon still to go . How would he ever get through it ? A year , an eternity seemed like less time to get through . He could always go to the  | phone and call ? No , there was n't any reason for that . There were still plenty of things in his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't he ? How had he lived ? He felt a sudden flicker of hope . That was the answer , of course . It had worked for sixteen years , why should n't it work again ? All right , it was crazy , stupid , childish . Maybe it was wrong even . But it was n't as wrong as other things . If it came to a choice between this and other things ? He stretched out on the bed , he shut his eyes tight . The country road , he told himself . Tall trees arching over , and from the distance the sounds of a scuffle ? The light was making blotches before his eyes . He shut them still tighter . . . . The sounds of a scuffle , a voice crying for help . He hesitates , then he runs towards the voice . He sees them . The four big men , the Prince they were beating . Boyish aristocratic face , fair hair , amused smile . No , not amused , not while the men were beating him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to open them . The light blasted into them . ile turned over on his stomach and hid his face in the pillow ... . Back to the Prince . Calling for help . He rushes forward , pulls at the men , pummels them wildly . Then they 're all gone , the Prince is on his feet . Now the smile . Gracious , royal smile . And the happy trembling inside of him , because he was able to be of service to the Prince . The happy trembling inside of him . This was the moment he waited for . Everything led to this moment . What a wonderful moment it was . It was n't wonderful now . It was n't working at all . He turned over on his back again . No warmth and peace , no ecstasy , nothing of what he had felt so long ago . What was the good of an imaginary prince when there was a real prince waiting for you ? With an address and a phone number , only waiting for you to call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up sharply on the bed . No , he was n't going to do that . He sank back on the pillow . A wave of exhaustion spread over  | him . He had n't really slept much last night . His eyes were closing in spite of themselves . . . . When he woke up , it was almost dark out . He brought himself slowly to his feet and splashed some water on his face . But the heavy exhausted feeling did n't leave him . He went out to the living room . Dad was there , reading a newspaper . Mother 's voice could be heard from the kitchen , high and droning , giving orders to the cook . He lowered himself into a chair . His mind still was n't clear from his nap . He had been dreaming of something . No , it had n't been a dream at all . The record shop , the call to Johnnie Dykeman , the Prince on the country road . It all came back to him faintly , as if from the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now he seemed to be calm and resigned . Resigned to what ? What had he decided to do ? The rustling of Dad 's newspaper made him look up . Dad was frowning over something , looking so serious and absorbed . Dad was a doctor . A very good doctor . He understood what people were suffering . I le smiled and said a few words to them , and their suffering stopped . Because he was so kind and gentle . As long as Barry could renleinher , his father had been that way . Never raising his voice , or nagging at him , or trying to hurt him . He was a wonderful father really ? " Dad ? " The newspaper lowered . " Did you want something , son ? " " Dad , I have to tell you ? " " What is it , some new honor they 've given you ? Are n't we proud enough of you as it is ? " " Dad , it 's kind of serious . " " By all means ? if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now fire away . " " If I had a problem ? if there was something the matter with me ? I could come to you , could n't I ? I could tell you about it , and you would n't get mad ? "  | The expression on Dad 's face began to waver a little . " Well , what are you talking about exactly ? I do n't understand exactly ? " " Dad ? " " Oh that stupid woman ! " said Mother , stamping into the room . " She ca n't seem to follow the simplest instructions . And then she tries to evade her responsibility by saying that I ought to speak more clearly . I ought to speak more clearly ! " Barry leaned back in his chair again while Mother 's voice droned on . He left the apartment right after dinner . He told Mother and Dad that he had a date . But he had no date , he had nowhere to go at all . He just started walking again . He was a fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along slow and heavy . Where was he going ? He seemed to know . He seemed to be making for a particular destination . It was all mixed up in his mind with Mother barking away , so superior , so reasonable , and Dad fidgeting in his chair , hardly daring to look him in the face . A pang of bitterness shot through him . Maybe it was true , what Paul had said to him long ago . They did n't care for him really . Nobody cared for him really , nobody except Paul . So why should he care for anybody ? The world had been unfair to him , why should he worry about the world ? Paul and he made a world to themselves , and in that world it was only their rules and their wishes that mattered . And their future together ? at college and later on ? a whole long happy future with Paul , stretching out ahead of him , and all he had to do ? " Am I going to do that ? It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound of his own voice startled him . He stopped walking and blinked around . Where was he ? The neighborhood was familiar . The low brownstone buildings , the neat rows of trees . And there , just ahead , just down the block ? it was Paul 's street , and he was coming to Paul 's house .  | No , he was n't . It was an accident . He would turn around and go in the other direction . Better still , he would walk right past it without even looking . He quickened his pace . And then he slowed up again . The house was all lighted up . The blare of voices and music . Some sort of party was going on inside . He remembered now . Was n't Paul 's sister getting married pretty soon ? Paul would be in there probably . Laughing among the guests , dancing . He stopped short where he was . He stared up at the big bay windows , each one a blaze of yellow , with figures passing back and forth behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That small thin one maybe , with the girl on his arm ? A low sigh broke out of him . What else can I do ? he thought . There 's nothing else I can do . At five-thirty Saturday afternoon , Ellen King was married to Herb Goldsmith . Paul stood up with them as best man . Everybody remarked how handsome he looked in his frock coat . He could tell from their faces that they were remarking it . That King boy would surely break hearts some day , if he was n't already doing so ! And look at the serious , reverent expression on his face during the ceremony . Look at how he stood on the side , with his hands folded and his lie ; md lowered , effacing himself so modestly and commendably . Without intending to , he was stealing the show right away from the groom ! It was pleasant to observe these things , to enjoy the benign smiles of the old ladies in the front rows , but it was n't pleasant enough to keep away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three days . Ever since he opened that letter from Harvard . Pretty soon he 'd have to be writing Harvard back . A refusal , the way he had threatened to do . He could n't let it look as if he had only been bluffing , as if he was the one who had  | to back down when the crucial moment came . Why the hell did this Harvard thing have to come up just now ? Why could n't they have held off another few weeks ? Everything had been working out so fine up to now . The face was getting paler every day , the eyes were getting tighter and filling with despair . Another week , two more weeks at most ? And now this Harvard thing comes along ! His neck was itching under his collar . It was an ordeal to stand still like this , with this stupid frown on his face . Goddamned wedding ! It was over at last , and everyone piled into cars and taxis to go uptown for the reception . Eager and excited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that quickly enough now that they were getting close to the real reason why they had come ? the food and champagne . Back in the house he was at the champagne ahead of everyone . He was hot , and he had a terrific thirst . And how can you enjoy a party , if you do n't fill up on your share of the liquor ? You have to be polite to your host and hostess . An hour or so later he was talking to this pretty girl , and suddenly he was face to face with his mother and father . " Having fun , boy ? " Dad said . " Do n't drink yourself under the t able . That space is reserved for your old man . " " Have n't touched a drop , " Paul said . " Champagne bores me . " Mother 's eyes were moist . " It 's such a nice party . I do n't know why it is , but wedding parties always make me cry . I remember hack in Memphis , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your father looked so handsome , everybody was so impressed with him . " Through her tears she gave a proud smile at Dad . " Oh for God 's sake , Harriet , " Dad said . " There 's the happy young couple , " Paul said . " Have to express nay happiness for the happy young couple . " He weaved away  | from Mother and Dad , and pushed through the crowd to Ellen and Herb . She was still in her wedding dress . He had never seen her so beautiful . And Herb standing next to her , with a hand on her arm , smirking down at her , watching the world admire his property . " Happy young couple ! " Paul cried . " Congratulations . Felicitations . Joyous wishes from a humble relation . " He hugged and kissed Ellen , he pumped Herb 's hand up and down . " Good old Herb . My new big brother . Just what I always wanted , a big brother all my own . If there was one thing I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , you know , I was n't kidding about that , fellow . It 's my sincere wish that you and I should stand in that relationship to each other . " " Stand in that relationship . That 's very good , is n't it ? Could n't have put it better myself . Good old Herb , got a real knack for words . Stand iu that relationship . I 'll tell you what , there 's something I 've been wanting to do a long time now . To clinch this relationship were standing in . Symbolic gesture , sort of . Now you 're not going to be embarrassed , are you ? " Herb grinned around at people who had stopped to look . " It takes a lot to embarrass me . " Paul nodded enthusiastically . " Now that I believe . That 's something I really believe . Okay , good old Herb . Here goes . " He pulled his arm back and brought his hand down hard on Herb 's back . It caught Herb by surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " Good old Herb . How 'd you like it ? Nothing like a slap on the back to symbolize our beautiful relationship . Knew you 'd appreciate it ? fellow ! " Herb had caught his breath finally , and he was straightening his tie and clearing his throat . Ellen was pale as she came up to  | Paul . " Do n't you think you 'd better lie down ? Stretch out somewhere till the alcohol wears off . " " Stretch out somewhere . " Paul 's laughter died away under her sharp angry gaze . All of a sudden his high spirits were all gone . " Stretch out somewhere , good idea . Away from the people . " He turned and started pushing his way through the crowd . " Get the hell away from the people . " He was out in the hall , free from the crowd . Stretch out somewhere , clear the dizziness out of his head . There was his father 's den , with the door wide open . But the sofa was covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He was n't really drunk . Just a little dizzy , and putting on an act . Because you can say things , when you 're drunk , that you ca n't say any other time . All he needed was a little air , walk around the block maybe , put the noise , smoke , smell of people behind him for a while . He pulled open the front door , stepped outside . He stood on the top of the steps for a moment , blinking , breathing in the cool air . Peaceful out here . The world could be peaceful sometimes . Why could n't he ever get some of it for himself , some of the peacefulness ? He broke off , tightening up inside . He could n't be seeing what he was seeing . Down on the sidewalk , looking up at him , the face forming itself so clearly before his eyes . The shock made him stupid . He just stood there , and he could n't say a word . .. . And Barry did n't say anything either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour he had been outside the house , staring up at the door , imagining the door opening , the thin figure stepping out . When it happened , it seemed so natural and easy . A last burst of fight rose up inside of him . No , he would n't do that ? And then it was swept away by the wave of relief , the dropping of the load he had carried for all these weeks , the surge of warmth and happiness .  | " Paul ? whatever you want . If we could be friends again . " The slow boyish smile told him all he wanted to know , even before he heard the voice . " Of course we 're friends again . You dope , did you think we could ever really stop ? " Then he was coming down the steps , holding out his hand , smiling even harder . Their hands were shaking . Just the way it had always been . " For God 's sake , kid , I thought you 'd never make it . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you 've been through ? ? " " Well , that 's all over with now , thank God . We 've got the future to think about . " " The future ? " " I heard you got into Harvard . I got in too , did you know that ? We 'll be going in September . My God , that 's practically tomorrow . Did they send you the forms to fill out yet ? I hope you know what you 're putting down when they ask you who you want for a roommate . " " Yes , I know what I 'm putting down ? " " Damn right you do . A few more months , and the times we 're going to have , the fun there 's going to be . Four big years . After that too . " Barry could feel himself laughing now . " Four years . It 's like forever . " " It is forever . And nothing to stand in the way of it now . Just as soon as we take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that now . Only trivial things now . We 'll have a long bull session , just like we used to have . Listen , this party wo n't last much longer . Could you see me later , around eleven ? " Could he see him later ? Barry 's head was nodding even before Paul had finished the question . " Well , okay then . We 'll meet at the coffee place , the one we like in the Village . Eleven sharp . And we 'll guzzle coffee till we 're black in the face ! "  | He laughed , and then he was running up the steps , his hand was on the front door . He turned for a moment , gave a wave and a flash of smile from the doorway . Then he was gone , and Barry was staring up at the darkness . IV FOR THE next week they were with each other almost constantly . In the mornings before school began , going borne in the afternoon , and again after dinner , they could n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late at night , though they knew they needed their sleep for school , it was always a little struggle to break away from each other . And so they would stay together an hour longer than they should have , stretching out the conversation for any slightly plausible excuse . They talked about lots of things ? the latest neighborhood movie , the final tests at school , some girl they knew , where they would live up at Harvard . Only one subject was never mentioned between them ? Maybe it wo n't be mentioned , Barry told himself . Maybe it 's been forgotten , maybe it was all a kind of dream in the first place . On Saturday night , a week after his sister 's wedding , Paul said , " We wo n't go to the movies or anything tonight . It 's nice out , we 'll take a drive in the country . There 's some things we have to discuss . " All the way out of the city Paul kept up a running chatter about the heavy traffic and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time had finally come . They turned off the parkway just above Mount Vernon but kept driving for an hour more . They were in a section of Westchester Barry had never seen before , few houses , lots of woods . At the end of a winding dirt road , with trees stretching up on  | both sides , Paul brought the car to a stop . " This is the place , " he said . He got out of the car , and Barry followed him without asking any questions . It looked terribly lonely and empty . There was a full moon , filtering through the trees , casting a pale gray haze over the dirt road . " Nice and private , " Paul said . " No houses , no people . Used to be open to the public for picnics , but the state sold it to a real estate company . They 're going to build a housing project in November . Completely deserted till then . " " What are we doing here , Paul ? " Paul smiled and motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bushes and along a narrow overgrown trail till they reached an open clearing about a hundred yards off the road . Paul pointed down at a large hole , about the size of a basketball , gaping out from a mound of earth . It was the mouth of a heavy iron pipe , a water pipe probably . It was caked with rust , and weeds were growing over it . It had n't been used for a long time . " There was a water main here once , " Paul said . " They never finished tearing up all the pipes somehow . Very convenient for us . " After a moment Barry said , " Why is it convenient ? " Paul got down on his knees and pulled aside some of the weeds from the mouth of the pipe . " Take a look in there . Stretches back a good six feet before it makes a bend . Right length , right width , right location . " He got to his feet and brushed the dirt from his knees . " The perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here . " In the car , driving around the countryside , Paul did the talking . Calm and methodical . When he put his mind to it , Paul could be terribly methodical . One by one , in logical order , he ticked off the points . First , the question of who . Well , they had really decided that already , had n't they ? When they were discussing the " abstract  | puzzle . " It had to be a kid , that went without saying . Easier and more practical . Lots of emotional strain for the parents , so they would n't hesitate about obeying instructions . And maybe the most important reason ? it was a big thing with a kid . It was a thing the whole world hated . Just the two of them against the whole world . Second , the method of contact . With a kid it had to take place in daylight . Any fuss or mistake , and they would probably be seen . They had gone over a dozen different possibilities and agreed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid who went to the same school that they did , who rode home in the subway and not in the school bus . Follow him down the hill in the car . See what train he got into . Drive downtown and wait for the train . Chances are he 'd be alone when he got off , he 'd start walking for the crosstown bus . That was the moment to make contact . Simply drive up in the car as if by accident , say hello to the kid , offer to give him a lift home . The kid would know them , of course . Big heroes at his school . He 'd get in the car , and off they 'd go , and nobody would notice a thing . Third , procedure in the car . Dangerous if they lost their head . Childishly easy if they went about it calmly . And that was the point of the whole thing , after all ? they were n't trying to stay away from danger , they were trying to meet it face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the immediate goal , in the car , was to keep the kid quiet and out of sight . Could n't afford to have him acting up during the long drive out of the city . The only question was , how to keep him quiet ? trick him with a persuasive story , or simply use force ? Well , trickery was a lot more satisfying . And artistic sort of . But it was less dependable , less predictable . A smart man cuts down the unpredictable factors whenever he possibly can . So one of them would drive the car , the other one would sit in back . The kid would slide in next to the driver . When they got into the park and could go along fast  | without stopping for lights , the one in back would reach over with a wrench or something . One tap on the head , pull the kid over the seat to the back , tie him up , keep him down on the floor for the rest of the ride . One detail ? but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up . The tap on the head would have to be quick and clean . There could n't be any bloodstains in the car . The chauffeur , Carl , would find them and tell Paul 's father about them . Just to make trouble . On to the fourth point ? out in the country . Everything 's fine up to now , they take the parkway up to Westchester , finally they arrive at the storage place in the woods . What happens next might seem to be the hardest part of all . But it was n't really , if you thought about it logically . It was a necessary inevitable step , that was the only way to look at it . They started off with the assumption that they were more intelligent than the others who had tried this before . Their ability to think of all the difficulties and dispose of them coolly would enable them to succeed where those others had failed . What a useless humiliating farce it would all be , then , if they let themselves get caught because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the stupidest thug always took . It was a logical necessity . A smart man does n't waste time arguing against a logical necessity . Barry could see that , could n't he ? Barry nodded . he could see that . Paul rushed on , raising his voice a little . So the logical necessity would be faced . Best to get it over with as soon as possible . The kid would probably still be unconscious . They would have a strong rope . Tie it around his neck , then each of them pulling opposite ends ? This was very important . Almost the most important thing ? and Paul spoke more slowly , fixing his eyes on Barry 's face . Up to then they would have separate functions to perform , but when they finally got to the big moment , they would  | do it together , perfectly equal . They would be , for that one moment , like one person . They would have that rope between them for the rest of their lives . Did Barry understand , did he see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he saw , and Paul was smiling the quiet smile that he used only for the most special moments of their friendship . Then he was talking again , growing a little red in the face . The logical necessity was now taken care of . Back to the city in the car now , separate for dinner and a quiet evening at home , then on to the fifth point ? making contact with the parents . Wait till the next morning for this , let them go through the night without their loved one , give them time to worry a little . Then make the phone call . From a pay booth , muffled voice , very short so there is n't time to trace it . State the amount of money ? a hundred thousand dollars . An arbitrary figure , they do n't intend to spend this money anyway . Then state the conditions of delivery . Which brings them to the last and trickiest point . Fifty per cent of these cases , Paul had read , blow up with the delivery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the police are n't watching the place of delivery . They might not pick you up on the spot , they would wait to see if you returned the kid , but they would know who you were , and eventually they would get you . Well , Paul had figured a way out of this . The police could n't be waiting at a point of delivery which was n't actually revealed until a few moments before the delivery took place . Suppose they told the kid 's father to put the money in a shoebox , provide himself with a car that had a telephone in it , and start driving at a steady rate of speed up a fairly deserted back road towards Connecticut . And suppose , at a certain point along the route , one of them called him up on the phone and instructed him to throw the shoebox out of the window to the side of the road and to keep right on driving . Even if the police tried to follow the kid 's father  | in another car , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no way of knowing exactly when the money was thrown out . And as soon as he was sure everything was safe , Paul or Barry , whichever of them was waiting by the side of the road , could pick up the shoebox . It was n't foolproof , of course . But what 's foolproof in this world ? That was the test of their courage , after all . You always admire a tightrope walker a lot more when he does it without a net . So once they had the money , it was only necessary to wait until night and drop it into the river . It would never show up again . The kid would n't be found till November , when the workmen moved into the woods . The case would never be solved . And the two of them would be up at Harvard together . " So how does it sound ? " Paul said . Barry nodded and said that it sounded fine . Paul laughed and said of course it did , it was going to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid and decide on a definite date . But they were back in the city again , they were turning off the parkway . " No time to discuss it now , " Paul said . " We 'll talk again in school on Monday . " Ile let Barry off in front of his building . It is n't really going to happen , Barry told himself as he lay in bed later on . Plans and ideas are one thing . But there is n't any kid . It 's a big step from the kid to a kid . He met Paul after lunch on Monday . They went up the hill to their meeting place behind the volleyball court . Paul pulled out a cigarette and puffed away at it as he paced up and down . " Do you know the Lewis kid ? " he said . " Donny Lewis , he 's in the eighth grade . Sort of short and fat , dark hair and glasses . His father 's in the export business . Lots of money . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits perfectly . Only child , family 's crazy about him . God knows why ? what a spoiled brat ! He takes the subway home ,  | gets off at Seventy-ninth Street , and waits for the crosstown bus . Best of all , he knows me and likes me . He 's sort of a second cousin of mine , and I taught him how to throw a baseball a couple of summers ago . Could n't be better , could it ? " " No , it could n't , " Barry said . Paul put his hand on his shoulder . " I thought you 'd want to hear . We 're coming along . We 're getting there . " They heard the bell ring and started down the hill in silence . All right , but there 's no date yet , Barry thought . Nothing 's going to happen without a definite date . Not so easy to come right out and say , It 'll be on this day , at this time . As he was studying for his French exam that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something I forgot to mention , " Paul said . " Ca n't go into details over the phone . It 's about the date . How about ten days from now , Wednesday the fifteenth of June ? That 's the day after graduation . The seniors will be free , but the rest of the school still has the week to go . " After a moment , Paul said , " So how about it ? Let 's hear what you think . " The last weeks of school again . The usual display of solemnity and maturity from the senior class , the usual air of impatient ambition from the junior class , the usual extra rowdiness from the lower classes . It seemed to Barry that nobody was entering into the festive spirit more enthusiastically than Paul . He was the life of the party , even when there was no party . Between classes he was surrounded by groups of giggling girls , or by his football-playing friends laughing at his jokes . During classes he w .. s on his feet constantly , expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always tell when Paul was talking nonsense , being clever just for the hell of it . And yet even Barry could n't help feeling admiration as he listened . At the same time ,  | Paul was going to regular rehearsals of The Tempest , which would be given to the whole school on Friday afternoon , three days after graduation . There were rumors about what a wonderful performance Paul was going to give . Barry had watched Paul starting some of these rumors himself . With all his furious activity , Paul still found plenty of time to be with Barry . There was only one subject of conversation between them these days . The details of the great plan never seemed to be out of Paul 's mind , he was only waiting to be alone with Barry to come bubbling out with them . Sometimes with delight , like a child planning a game . Sometimes with great seriousness , like a general planning a campaign . And sometimes a fierceness came into his voice , he laughed with furious satisfaction at the thought of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the day before graduation . It was a free day for the seniors , they were supposed to rest up for the great occasion . Paul and Barry had lunch at the zoo , then they wandered in the park for a while . Suddenly Paul said , " I can get the car this afternoon . Let 's have a dress rehearsal . " Barry looked at hiin , not understanding at first . " We 're having a dress rehearsal of The Tempest in a couple of days . To make sere we know our parts before we get in front of an audience . Afterwards it 'll be too late . Well , do n't you think that would be a good idea for our own little drama ? " " What do we do ? " Barry said . " Just follow me , " Paul said . Half an hour later they were on their way uptown in the car . Paul was driving , and Barry was sitting in back . " Have we got all the props ? " Paul said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item , and Barry said " Check " if it was on the seat next to him . Wrench . Heavy cord . Rags . One line of rope , long and especially strong . Turpentine , just in case there were  | stains . All present and accounted for . They drove awhile longer , then Paul wanted to check over the items again . Finally they reached the bottom of the hill which led up to school . " We do n't go up , though , " Paul said . " Somebody would be bound to notice us . We park on the corner down here , in plain view of the subway station . And we keep our eyes open . There 'll be a million kids piling in , all around the same time . We have to be sure we can pick ours out in the crowd . You see the importance of a dress rehearsal . " They waited in silence . Every once in a while Paul looked at his watch and then checked it against Barry 's watch . A little after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were swinging books , screaming and laughing , occasionally hitting each other . Paul and Barry straightened up and studied them , but the one they were looking for , Donny Lewis , was n't among them . They settled back again . Paul lit his third cigarette . Another batch came down the hill . " Is that him ? " Paul said , gripping Barry 's arm . " Little fat one with the brown jacket ? " But it was n't him , it was another kid who looked something like him . The new batch streamed past the car and into the subway . " My God , " Paul said , " I never saw so many fat dark-haired little boys in my life ! " And then , all of a sudden , they saw him . He was with two friends . They were all talking at once , angry and excited about something , enjoying their anger and excitement . They moved past the car and disappeared into the subway . Paul gave a nod . " So far so good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small experiment in timing now . Which goes faster , a car or the subway ? Who 'll get to Seventy-ninth Street first ? " He deliberately drove at a moderate speed , did n't try to beat the lights , took no short cuts to avoid the traffic . This was to allow for emergencies . A smart man allows for emergencies . At Seventyninth  | Street they pulled up to the curb half a block down from the subway station . " So he has to pass us on his way to the bus . " For a moment Paul frowned . Then he nodded . " I knew there was something wrong . " He opened the door of the car . " Come on , let 's switch places . " Barry was surprised . " But why ? " " It 's better that way , " Paul said , his voice casual . " You do the driving , you 're a more careful driver than I am . Less likely to speed up in the excitement . I 'll sit in back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrench ? " Paul was out of the car now , and his head was turned away . " Yes . That 's okay with me . I do n't mind . " Barry did n't say any more . He slid out the door and climbed into the front seat . They just had time to settle into their places when Paul called out , " There he is now . " He gave a glance at his watch . " The timing is n't bad . We got here ten minutes before he did . " His voice became more urgent . " Get your head down , do n't let him see you . " They hunched down in their seats . Barry could just see the kid passing by the window . IIe was whistling . He was alone . When Paul sat up again , there was a big smile on his face . " Okay , we 've stopped him , we 've talked to him , he 's in the car . Start it up now , and we 'll go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted a little more hastily . Much of it had to be imagined rather than acted out ? " the most important prop being unavailable , " Paul said . They drove along the crosstown drive , and at the widest section , where the cars sweep along fastest , Paul went through a pantomime with the wrench and the cord . " Okay , all quiet back here , " he said finally . By this time they had come out of the crosstown drive on the East Side . " Right back to the parkway now , " Paul said , " and all the way up to our storage place . " " Do we have to do that ? " Barry said .  | " Certainly we do . We have to see how long it takes , do n't we ? And if it gets dark before we 're there , so we 'll know if it 's necessary to bring a flashlight . And we have to get used to parking the car there and everything . Details , details ? how many times do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details were important . The ride up to the woods took an hour . But there was still plenty of light , it did n't look as if a flashlight would be needed . When they reached the end of the road , Paul told Barry to stop the car . Then he changed his mind . They would n't stop just yet , they 'd turn around and get the car all ready to pull out again . It was a difficult turn , but Barry made it finally . " And you ought to be glad you got the practice , " Paul said . " Suppose you had to do it for the first time the day after tomorrow . With our load back here . " They got out of the car and went through the motions of carrying their burden into the woods to the open clearing . They put it down in front of the water pipe , then Paul drew the rope out of his pocket . Barry spoke quickly . " It 's no use going through that now . " Paul looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess not , " he said . " We ca n't rehearse everything . There are some things you can do only once ? " He broke off with an odd tremor in his voice . Then he gave a quick nod . " The tough part here will be the pipe . If it 's going to be the right size . We ca n't be sure till we try , it 's liable to be a close squeeze . " Barry turned his eyes to the dark gaping hole , with the weeds , the rust , the damp earth all around it . He remembered how cold and clammy it had felt , when he had reached into it the other clay . And as the days and the weeks passed , the rot would go on , the smell would grow ? There was a sour sick taste in his mouth . " Listen , Paul ? " he said . Paul looked up . His eyes and his voice were tight , the tightness  | of a rubber band straining to snap at any moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet his eyes only a moment longer . Then he lowered his head . " We 're having an early dinner at home . I think it 's time to leave . " " Why not ? " Paul said , and Barry could see the tightness easing up . " We 've done all we can for now . " His hand was on Barry 's arm , they went back to the car and Paul took the wheel . They bounced along the dirt road at a fast clip . " Pretty successful dress rehearsal ! " Paul said . His talk was loud and cheerful all the way back to the parkway . But later on , towards the end of the ride , his smile faded , and a gloomy silence settled over him . " That damn graduation ! " he said suddenly . " Why does it have to get in the way ? " And then , after another silence , in a slower voice , " We could 've done it today , you know . It would 've gone off perfectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All through the ride uptown , Henry Morris listened to Muriel nagging at the chauffeur . The car was going too slow , the traffic was too heavy , why could n't he have used his common sense and turned off at a different corner ? Once , Henry put in mildly , " It 's only ten-thirty , dear , l really do n't see how we could be late . " But this simply made Muriel turn her nagging on him for a while , so Henry said no more . She was anxious and excited , that 's all , and she did n't want to miss a moment of the ceremonies . It was quite understandable , he could n't get annoyed at her for it . Whatever else you might say about Muriel , you had to admit how fond she was of the boy . They reached the school fifteen minutes before the ceremonies were scheduled to begin . The parking lot was full of cars already .  | On the lawn in back , a hundred people or so were milling around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . But Henry 's attention was attracted most of all by the wooden platform which had been set up against the back of the building . Seven or eight rows of chairs stood empty on this platform . Muriel pounced on two empty places on one of the front benches . She was standing in front of them , craning her neck . " Do you see anybody , Henry ? Is n't Senator Smith 's little girl in Barry 's class ? Which one do you suppose is Senator Smith ? Oh , look at that couple over there , they must be the parents of that Negro boy Barry 's talked about . She 's a very nice-looking woman , do n't you think ? You know , it makes me sick sometimes , the prejudice of people ! " She broke off suddenly , her eyes narrowing . " Henry , that man in back there , waving at us . Is n't that your friend Charlie Clifford ? " Henry looked where she was pointing , and gave a big smile in spite of himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation , and he said he might come up , if he could get away for it . " " Why should he do a thing like that ? He has n't got any children graduating , he is n't even married . " " Well , he 's such an old friend of mine , dear . He always asks after Barry , whenever I see him . I suppose he thought it would be a friendly thing to do . " " Well , it seems funny to me , " Muriel said . And then , with a note of alarm in her voice , " He is n't coming over here , is he ? " But Charlie did n't seem to be coming over , he was just waving . Muriel brightened up again . " How many years has it been since I 've seen Charlie Clifford ? He 's certainly got old-looking , has n't he ? He looks ten years older than you . Is he a well man ? I 've heard stories about the sort of life he leads ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his seat , felt  | the sun on his face , and watched the empty platform in front of him . It was nice of Charlie to show up today . It was really very nice of him . But that was the thing about Charlie . For all his sarcastic manner , he had a definite streak of sentimentality in him ? " Mrs. Morris and Dr. Morris , is it not ? " Henry looked up at the brisk gray-haired little woman who was smiling down at him . " You remember me perhaps , from the Parents ' Day ? I am Mademoiselle Fontaine , your Barry 's teacher of French . " Henry rose to his feet , and Muriel cried out , " Why yes , of course , " and immediately put on the peculiarly sweet gracious smile which she reserved for teachers , hotel managers , dentists , and other persons who could n't exactly be classified as servants . " It is of Barry that I wish to speak to you , " said Mademoiselle Fontaine . " You will leave immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other opportunity to tell you ? " She leaned forward , her expression grew more earnest . " Your son is the finest scholar I have ever known . He has application , he has taste , better than all he has enthusiasm . This is what the teacher awaits year after year , and so infrequently one finds it . You can not know what joy it is when suddenly one encounters a student , and there it is , voila ! You understand what I mean ? And your Barry is more than a scholar also . He has the fine character . He is a fine gentle boy ? " She lowered her eyes , and gave a quick little laugh . " Well , I am just a little bit fond of your Barry . I imagine this is not difficult for you to guess . Some day , when he is a brilliant student at the university , he will perhaps come back to visit with me ? " She broke off , then lifted her chin and grew brisk again . " It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Morris . I give you the very best congratulations for your son . " She reached out and shook their hands sharply , in the French  | manner , and before Henry could thank her she had turned and marched off stiffly into the crowd . " Now that was sweet of her , was n't it ? " Muriel said . " Obviously a brilliant woman . A little bit eccentric , like most of these oldmaid schoolteachers ? " A rustling and muttering were spreading over the crowd , and people on their feet were moving to the benches . A few tentative chords could be heard from the piano just below the empty platform . " They 're beginning now , " Muriel said , in a loud whisper . " Twenty minutes late , would n't you know it ? " The piano broke into some more chords , and a hush came over the crowd . The chords , heavy and stately , soon formed themselves into the Grand Chorus from Handel 's Judas Maccabeus ? it was much too progressive a school for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subdued buzzing from the crowd , the front flank of the graduating class emerged from the building and started its procession across the lawn and up to the platform . Muriel was craning her neck harder than ever , along with every other mother in the crowd . Every few seconds little explosions could be heard from different parts of the lawn ? " There he is ! " " Look , it 's her ! " And then , at last , Muriel was nudging Henry 's arm . " There he is ! Look , just coming through the door ! Look , do you see him ? " But Henry did n't need to be nudged . His eyes had been fixed on that door ever since the first figure in navy blue appeared there . And his heart had given a little skip at the first sight of his son . His son ? With his eyes he followed the boy 's slow progress across the lawn . There was nobody else marching with him . Only his son , with his chin held up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so grave and important . The music of Handel pounded away in time to his slow solemn strides . And Henry could feel the pride swelling up inside of him . And just the smallest tinge of sadness too .  | He felt the pressure of Muriel 's hand on his arm . When he looked up at her , he was surprised to see tears in her eyes . " He looks so handsome , " she said . " Did you ever think he could look so handsome ? " The ceremonies were over . The last diploma was handed out . Arthur King thought that damn class would never get through filing past the principal , but finally they did . The piano started up again , the procession went marching off , the crowd of parents was on its feet , laughing , talking , sobbing a little . Arthur was on his feet too . He gave Harriet a big hug , and he accepted the congratulations of her sister Agnes and Agnes 's husband , who had come to the graduation too . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in navy blue began to reappear , not in an orderly procession now , but helter-skelter . Arthur kept rubbing his hands together and saying , " Where 's my boy ? Where 's that boy of mine ? " When Paul finally stepped out to the lawn , Arthur was striding up to him immediately , pumping his hand up and down , holding on tight to his shoulder . " So you made it , by God ! Well , it was no surprise to me . To everybody else maybe , but not me . I knew he was his father 's son . " Harriet was hovering around . She pecked Paul on the cheek and tried to hold on to his hand . But Arthur was n't going to let her monopolize the boy . He was a man now , starting out in a man 's world . This was no time to be fussed at by women . " Come on , boy , we 've got a little celebration waiting for you at the house , " Arthur said . " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , with his arm across Paul 's shoulder . " Maybe you and I will get drunk together , " he  | said . " This establishment we 're going to has the best liquor in town . " A big buffet party was waiting back at the house , and by two o'clock the rooms were full of people , upstairs and down . There was n't a close business acquaintance or a friend from the club that Arthur had n't invited . And they all brought their wives too . It made quite a howling mob . And quite a food and drink bill at the end of the month . Nobody was going to leave that party with any doubts as to how Arthur felt about his son 's graduation . " I 've damn well made sure of that , " Arthur muttered to himself . imself . He took Paul around and introduced him to all the people . The boy was pretty good at meeting people , if Arthur said so himself . Ile knew just how to make up to the ladies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them eating out of his hand . And he was n't any worse at handling the men . He knew how to be serious and respectful with the stuffed shirts , and loud and good-humored with the life-of-the-party boys . He never made the mistake of telling a wisecrack to a stuffed shirt , or pulling a long face on a life-of-the-party boy . And then , there was plenty for Arthur to talk about during these introductions ? the terrific record Paul had made at school , the high marks , the managerships and chairmanships and so on , the popularity . " Arthur , Arthur , " Harriet came up to them , laughing and gaspfug a little , and waving a fistful of envelopes . " More telegrams , they 've been pouring in all morning . Look , here 's one from Aunt Edith in Memphis . You remember , she 's my young-looking aunt , the one who looked so lovely at our wedding , and you pretended to mistake her for one of my sisters ? " Arthur had never seen Harriet so bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul had been doing a lot of drinking too . Paul 's face was red , he kept rushing away from Arthur , pushing himself into  | one group or another , talking and laughing with them for a moment , then rushing back to Arthur again . " And here 's one from your friend Jerry Phillips , " Harriet said . " Oh , Paul , it 's addressed to you . Congratulations and good luck . How I envy you . ' Poor man , that nice little boy of his will be getting out of school in a few years , and leaving his father ? " " Poor man ! " Arthur laughed . " Jerry 's one of the biggest insurance men in the city . If everybody was that poor ? " " Oh I nearly forgot the most important one , " Harriet said . " Paul dear , here 's one from Ellen and Herb . All the way from Paris . All our love . We are proud of you . ' All the way from Paris ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should I stand here with an empty glass ? " " Go to it , boy , " Arthur called after him as Paul disappeared in the crowd . The party went on . The rooms filled up with smoke . Arthur 's head was turning a little . Sam Russo came . Sam was working for Arthur these days . IIe had gone through a bad period , right after that aluminum deal that Arthur had pulled out of just in time , and what the hell , why not give a job to an old friend ? Especially since Sam was one of the best accountants in the business . Sam shook Arthur 's hand solemnly and congratulated him on behalf of his son . " Where 'd he disappear to ? " Arthur said . " Where 's that son of mine ? " He threaded his way through the crowd . Finally he came up to Paul at the sideboard , near the drinks . " Feel like going off to the den for a minute or two ? " Arthur said . " Get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't mind , " Paul said . They fought through the crowd together and shut the door of the den behind them . It was a small room , oak-paneled , lots of leather-bound books on the shelves . When he was a kid , running  | errands on the Street , Arthur had delivered papers once to old Alastair Woodbury 's house , and the old man had been working in a den just like this one . " Sit down , relax , " Arthur said . While Paul sat down , Arthur reached into his desk and pulled out a box of cigars . " Smoke ? " ! Ic laughed at Paul 's hesitation . " Go ahead , you 're a man today ? or almost . You 've got my permission to start smoking . Anyway , you can stop doing it behind my back . " Paul grinned . " Thanks , Dad . If you do n't mind , though , I 'll have one of my own . " And he pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The kid had nerve . " I 've been wanting to talk to you , " Arthur said . " Just a few words . Away from the women . " Paul took a puff from his cigarette . " Fire away , Dad . " " Well ? " For a moment Arthur was almost embarrassed . Not really , he was n't the type . He went on quickly , " I just wanted to say ? I 'm proud of you , boy . You 've been doing okay . There was a little trouble a long time ago maybe , and some people were worried about you . But not me , I always knew there was nothing to worry about . Women get crazy ideas , you know what I mean ? " " I 've noticed that , " Paul said , with a smile . " Well , anyway ? today Is kind of a milestone for you , boy , getting out of high school , looking forward to college , new people , making a career for yourself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money myself , but I know what a big thing it is in a boy 's life . Important too ? nowadays you ca n't get anywhere without a college degree , not to mention the contacts you make up there ? " He laughed and gave his head a shake . " I 've got a feeling I 'm not making much sense . Somebody 's been spiking my drinks . " " You 're making sense to me , Dad , " Paul said . " Well anyway , here 's what I 'm driving at . Being so proud of  | you , and being such a great occasion , and all ? well , I 've got a little something here ? " Arthur reached into his pocket and brought out the check . " Sort of a graduation present . " Paul took the check and looked at it . Arthur could see the glitter in his eyes . " Just a little carfare money , " Arthur said . " If I was planning to take a boat to Europe , " Paul said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they were both laughing together over some remark . And then the door burst open , and Harriet looked in . " We 've been looking all over for you two . Arthur , old Mr. Connors is here , he wants to congratulate Paul . " " Absolutely , " Arthur said . " We 'll be right out . " Could n't keep old Vincent Connors waiting , could they ? The old man was in his eighties , he was very feeble ? but somehow Arthur could hardly wait to introduce Paul to him . " Here he is , Vincent , " Arthur would say . " This is the young fellow who 's going to take over when we 're both dead and gone ! " A complete rehearsal of The Tempest was held in the school auditorium at eight o'clock that night . The scenery was up on the stage for the first time . The important props were on hand ? except for Prospero 's ivory chess set , which would be loaned by Mr. Jenkins of the Math Department for the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally considered to be a kind of mechanical genius , was all set backstage with the thunder-and-lightning machine that he had invented . Paul threw himself into his part with extra energy . His mind was twenty-four hours ahead of himself . He wanted to close up the gap , make the time run faster . If he had been forced to sit quietly in a room tonight , listening to polite conversation , he would have gone crazy . Just thinking of it made him wave his arms and shout out his lines even louder .  | Thou poisonous slave , tonight thou shalt have cramps , Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up ; urchins Shall , for that vast night that they may work , All exercise on thee ; thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycombs , each pinch more stinging Than bees that made them . And his expression was so fierce that little Marvin Clawson , who played the villainous Caliban , blinked up at him in alarm . Meanwhile he kept thinking . Almost there now . Less than a ( lay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long stretch of time ! Suppose the kid got sick tomorrow and stayed home from school . Or suppose it rained , and his parents sent a ear for him . Or suppose Barry suddenly got those old ideas in his head ? And later on , once they started in on the plan , a hundred things could still go wrong . If the kid got suspicious and would n't get into the car . Or if somebody noticed the struggle . Or if some stray picnickers just happened to pick tomorrow to break the law and camp out in front of the water pipe . Or a hundred other things Paul could think of . And then there was the worst thing of all ? " Oh Prospero , " Miss Spengler 's voice came ringing out from the dark auditorium , " your cue ! We must keep on our toes . Remember , Friday is the big day . " " Sorry , Miss Spengler , " Paul said . Then he assumed his look of affectionate condescension and spoke Prospero 's aside to the audionce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain grace On that which breeds between them ! Miranda began to sob , whiney and nasal as usual , and Ferdinand put his arms around her awkwardly and said , in his low monotone , " Wherefore weep you ? " Prospero had no lines for a while . The worst danger of all , he went on thinking . For weeks now  | he had been trying to keep it out of his thoughts . Suppose when the moment came , when the kid was in the front seat and the car reached that wide stretch in the park and the wrench was in his hand , suppose he suddenly got scared and could n't do it ? No , that did n't make sense . After all the time he 'd been waiting ? If he was going to get scared , would n't it have happened to him weeks ago ? " So glad of this as they I can not be , " he cried , attacking the line much too hard . And he attacked them harder and harder through the next three scenes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a throbbing in Paul 's head , and he could feel the sweat on his face . Now does my project gather to a head : My charms crack not ; my spirits obey ; and time Goes upright with his carriage ? Howard Knapp , crouching at his feet as Ariel , broke in , " On the sixth hour , at which time , my lord ? " You goddamned idiot , " Paul heard himself shouting , " you did n't let me finish my line ! " Then he heard the uproar around him . Howard Knapp was squealing indignantly , somebody was muttering offstage , and Miss Spengler 's voice came floating out of the darkness , " Paul , Paul , now there 's no excuse for ? now even if Howard made a mistake ? " Paul opened his mouth to shout out something more . But a warning signal clicked inside of him . My God , he was losing his head ! Wonderful omen for tomorrow , if he started losing his head already . He took a breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , Miss Spengler . I 'm a little tired , I guess . I 'm sorry , Howie . " Howard Knapp grunted , and Miss Spengler sounded relieved . " We 're all a little tired , I 'm afraid . But the show must go on ! "  | So the show went on . " I did say so , when first I raised the ternpest , " said Prospero . .. . Barry spent the night in a double feature ? two old westerns in u dirty little theater off Times Square . They bored him terribly , lint he liked being huddled up in the darkness , thinking about nothing . At midnight he walked along Forty-second Street to his subway . A million things flashing by all around him . Lights , shouts , penny arcades , the stench of popcorn and hot dogs . A group of toughlooking boys his own age , they seemed to be spoiling for a fight . 11c gave them a lot of room as they passed . A girl , all smeared up - not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A drunk , a swaying old man , red veins in his face , cursing out loud . And the strange ones , the monstrosities , the Negro with one eye , and the thin-waisted boys with long hair , and the well-dressed elderly gentleman peering at all the girls with a fixed glassy stare . Faces suggesting horrors that he could n't even begin to understand . He tried his hardest to keep from looking at them . He was glad when he got to his subway . When he got back to the apartment , all the lights were off . He went to the living room and switched on a lamp . He was just starting to sit down when Mother appeared in the archway . " Was ft a nice party , dear ? You 're home earlier than we expected . " " I was feeling a little tired , " he said . " No wonder . I advised you not to go out tonight . But you know , you never listen to me until it 's too late . " She paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , kiss me good night flow . " Barry went up to her and brushed her cheek with his lips . She made a half-turn away from him , then stopped herself . Ile ? hand reached up and touched his shoulder lightly , as if by accident . " I was so proud of you today , " she said . " I may not show things sometimes . But you do know ? I 'm your mother ,  | there 's no doubt of my feelings ? " She broke off , then her hand tightened on his shoulder and she pulled him forward into her arms . Her face was warm against his . " Mother , " he said , " I have to tell you ? " But she had pushed him back again , she was treating him to her sweetest smile . " Now do n't sit up all night daydreaming . You 're not a little baby any more . " She turned quickly and marched out of the room . He stared after her . I 'm your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Only a moment , though . It passed away so quickly that it might have been all in his mind . Had there ever been a time when moments like that happened between Mother and him ? A long time ago maybe , when he was very small ? The phone was ringing . A call this late at night happened often enough in a doctor 's house . He picked up the receiver . " Hello , kid . It 's you , is n't it ? " " Yes , it 's mc . " " How are you feeling ? Are you all set ? " " Yes , I 'm all set . " " Well , I do n't have anything special to say . I wanted to talk to you , that 's all . " " Yes ? " A moment of hesitation , then Barry added , " I 'm glad you called . " " And we 'll meet for lunch tomorrow ? " " For lunch . " " Get a good night 's sleep . " Barry heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little later he was in his bed . His mind was empty , he was n't letting himself think of anything . That way he would soon fall asleep . Everything is all right , once you 're asleep . An hour passed , and he still was n't sleeping . He thought of praying to God . God would help him , if he only prayed hard enough ? But that was baby stuff . He did n't believe in God .  | This was n't really happening to him anyway . It was all happening to somebody else . V ON WEDNESDAY the weather turned cool . The sky was overcast , and there was a thick damp feeling in the air , but by the middle of the afternoon the rain still had n't come . " And it wo n't come , " Paul said . " It ca n't . Not today . Nothing 's going to spoil today . " They had been walking through the park , going through what Paul called a " final briefing . " Paul snapped out the questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Paul made Barry ask the questions . Then they " synchronized watches , " as Paul called it ? they checked their own time against the big clock in the zoo . At three o'clock sharp , according to the careful timetable which Paul had drawn up , they arrived at Paul 's house . The car was parked in front . The chauffeur , Carl , was lounging in the front seat . He looked p casually as they approached and let them wait a few seconds before he gave a yawn and climbed out . He stood on the sidewalk , blocking the door of the car and watching them silently . " Thanks , Carl , " Paul said finally . " We 'll get in now . " Carl waited another second , then said , " Yes , sir , " and ambled away . Paul got behind the wheel , and Barry slid in beside him , and the car started off . There was one more preliminary detail to take care of . They drove down to Grand Central Station , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they had checked a package that morning . The package contained the rope , the rags , the wrench , and the bottle of turpentine , which they would be  | needing later on . As soon as Barry was back , Paul headed uptown . After Ninetieth Street there was practically no traffic , and they clipped along at a steady rate . Always within the speed limit , of course . " This is no day to run into a traffic cop , " Paul said . The sky was beginning to lighten a little , and there was a pleasant breeze through the windows . With his eyes straight ahead , Paul gave a sudden laugh . " We 're on our way , kid . Did you think we 'd ever make it ? " Barry did n't answer . He kept his eyes straight ahead too . They reached the bottom of the hill , in sight of the subway station , and parked in the same place as they had parked two days ago , at the dress rehearsal . Paul offered a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nerves . You 'll be needing them later on . " They smoked in silence . Then it was three o'clock , and the kids came walking down the hill . Just a few small bunches at first , then a whole screaming , laughing swarm of them . The little fat kid , Donny Lewis , was in the midst of them . He had a couple of friends with biro again , different friends this time , but he was shouting at them just as loudly . " What a big mouth that kid has , " Paul said . But now the kid and his friends were swallowed up in the subway station , and Paul started the car . " End of Stage One , beginning of Stage Two , " he said . They drove downtown without a word . Paul kept all his attention on the wheel , the lights , the cars around him . There were no delays , nothing unexpected happened , but the liveliness seemed to have gone out of him . His head was shoved forward intently , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned gray again , and the air was damper and stickier than ever . They arrived at Seventy-ninth Street . A check of their watches showed that they had made the trip five minutes faster than two  | days ago . " Now we just have to hope that the subway did n't make it twenty minutes faster . " " You mean , we might have missed him already ? " Barry said . Paul turned to Barry with a tight little smile . " I do n't really think there 's any chance of that . Do n't you worry about it . " The car was parked in almost the same spot as two days ago . Then Barry slid over to the wheel , and Paul went to the back seat . He began to unwrap the brown paper parcel and make a neat little pile out of the rope and the other things . " End of Stage Two , " he said . They sat in silence , watching through the window , never taking their eyes off the subway entrance for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . " Beginning of Stage Three . " " He 's still got his friends with him , " Barry said . They could see the fat little figure , standing on the sidewalk a block away , talking excitedly to a couple of thin little figures . " They 'll separate in a minute or two , " Paul said . " They have to go home for dinner , do n't they ? " Two minutes passed , and then two minutes more . The three little figures stayed where they were , and went on talking . " Kids ! " Paul said . " All they can do is jabber and whine and waste time . Little bastards . " And then , as if Paul 's words had been a signal , the three little figures began to move apart . A sigh came out of Paul . " Okay , they 're saying good night to hiin now . See , the other two are walking up towards Eightieth Street , and he 's coming in this direction . " " Paul , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the two that 's walking up towards Eightieth Street . The one that 's coming in this direction is a different kid . " A gasp broke out of Paul . " What the hell is he doing ? Why the hell is n't he coming ? "  | " Maybe he 's going home with his friend , " Barry said . " Kids are always visiting at each other 's homes . " " Kids , " Paul said , with a wave of his arm . " Kids , kids ? " His head was shaking back and forth , his eyes were blinking as if they could n't quite focus . And then a sudden sharp note came into his voice . " I know that kid , the one who 's coming towards us . It 's Pete Phillips . His father 's a friend of my father . " And then , slowly and thoughtfully , " Jerry Phillips ? he 's a big insurance man . His wife is dead , he lives for this kid . I 've heard my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we go now ? " Barry said . " There 's no use waiting around here . " Paul silenced him with a motion of his hand . His eyes narrowed a little . " We 'll use this kid instead , " he said . Barry got a little pale . " We ca n't just ? " " Why not ? It comes to the same thing . Loving father , lots of money , the kid knows me and likes me . What 's the difference between one kid and another , when you get right down to it ? " " Paul ? " " Shut up . IIe 's coming . " Paul stuck his head out of the open window in the back . " Hey , Pete ! " " No , I wo n't ! " Barry said . Paul gave him a look . One look only . Barry got still paler , and pressed his lips together . Paul 's head was out the window again , as the kid , Pete Phillips , stopped next to the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wetting his lips nervously . " Hello ? Did you call me ? I mean ? " Paul wore his warmest , friendliest smile . " Sure I did . You 're Pete Phillips , are n't you ? I met you at my father 's club . I 'm Paul King . " The kid was shifting on his feet now , very bashful . " Yes , I know who you are . You 're in the Dramatics Club ? "  | Paul laughed . " I act a little . Do you know Barry Morris ? Barry , this is my friend Pete Phillips . " They nodded at each other . Paul said , " Are you on your way home , Pete ? Maybe we can give you a lift . You live on the East Side , do n't you ? " " Yes . Seventy-eighth Street ? " " Well , that 's just the direction we 're going . Hop in . " The kid hesitated a moment , then he said , " Thank you , " and put his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front with Barry , " Paul said . " We 've got some stuff back here , and it 's kind of crowded . " The kid climbed in , front and settled next to Barry . They exchanged quick tentative smiles . " Let 's go , " Paul said . The car started off . Slowly at first , until Paul laughed and said , " Come on , we wo n't get crosstown till next week at this rate . " Barry made the car go faster . Soon the park was in sight . They waited for the light , then they turned into the crosstown driveway . With no traffic lights and only a few cars around them , they whizzed along pretty fast . " Bet you 're looking forward to the end of school ? " Paul said . " I sure am , " the kid said , twisting around to look at Paul . " I 'm not going to camp this summer , Dad 's taking me fishing up in Canada . " " That sounds great . Say , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yourself carsick . " The kid nodded and faced front . They were coming to the wide stretch of road , the place they had decided on . Paul had the wrench in his hand . Barry tightened his grip on the wheel . " Did you ever go fishing in Canada ? " the kid said , without turning his head . " Never went fishing , " Paul said . " But I 've been to Canada . "  | " You have ? Dad says it 's the most wonderful country in the world . Do you think it 's the most wonderful country in the world ? " " It 's nice all right . " The kid leaned back , sighing contentedly . " Dad 's been promising to take me for a long time . But he had to wait till I was old enough . " " Paul leaned forward . He lifted the wrench with his right hand , then brought it down hard on the kid 's head . A gash opened up , and there was a trickle of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little scream . Paul reached over with his left hand and covered the kid 's mouth . Then he brought the wrench down on his head again . Barry turned to see what was happening . The kid was limp , and the thin trickle of blood had started down his cheek . Muffled little groans carne from under Paul 's hand . " I 'm getting him in back , " Paul said . His voice was thick , it did n't sound like his voice at all . With his hands under the kid 's arms , he pulled the limp form over the seat . The legs came last . The feet were kicking a little . The car suddenly burst out of the crosstown driveway . Barry turned left and started up Fifth Avenue . From the floor in back those groans were coming more loudly . Then they were choked off . Paul had shoved a handful of rags into the kid 's mouth . Then he tied the hands together with one length of cord . Then he tied the feet together . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a folded blanket on the floor , his parents used it to keep their legs warm on cold days . He pulled it open and spread it over the kid , hiding him from view . " End of Stage Three , " he said , breathing in long hard gulps . Suddenly he sat forward . " For God 's sake , do n't go so fast . Do you want us to get picked up for speeding ? "  | Barry noticed the speedometer for the first time . He slowed down . At Ninety-sixth Street they went crosstown again , and then onto the West Side Parkway . The traffic was slow for a while , because of the five o'clock commuters . But as soon as they got past the George Washington Bridge , they had a fairly clear road ahead of them . " How is he ? " Barry asked after a while . Paul glanced down at the bundle at his feet . " He 's quiet . " They drove for another half hour , then turned off the parkway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very dark . A drop of rain appeared on the windshield . Then another drop . And then a steady barrage . " It 's raining , " Barry said . " Thank you , " Paul said . He scowled for a while . Then he said , " Well , maybe it 's a good thing . Now we can be sure nobody 'll disturb us at the water pipe . " But his scowl did n't go away . They came to the woods , and Barry started the car up the winding dirt road . The rain was driving right into them . Puddles had formed in the ruts in the road . The car bounced and shook . It was a long time before they came to their stop . " Turn the car around , turn it around , " Paul said . " Do n't you remember a damn thing ? " It was n't easy . The road was soft and slippery . Barry made several attempts , but could n't seem to find the room . " Oh for God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close to the edge of the road as possible , Barry managed the turn . " Keep the motor running , " Paul said . " Let 's get him out of here quick . " The blanket was pulled away . Then Paul , still inside the car , got hold of the legs , and Barry , standing outside , got hold of the arms . " His face is so white , " Barry said . " Of course it 's white . He 's out cold . " They eased the kid out of the car and plunged into the woods with him . The thin overgrown trail , hard enough to navigate at  | ordinary times , was almost impassable in the driving rain . Bushes kept tangling their feet , branches slapped across their faces . Finally they reached the open clearing by the water pipe . They put the kid down on the wet ground . The rain slashed down on his face . Paul drew the heavy rope out from his jacket . " No point delaying , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Barry knelt down on the other side . Paul began to unwind the rope . Barry reached out , hesitated , then touched the kids ' cheek . " It 's cold , " he said . " Paul ? I think he 's dead . " A flash of anger was on Paul 's face . " Do n't be crazy ! It 's cold because of the rain ! " " But ? the way his head is hanging to the side . It is n't natural , is it ? " " Feel his pulse , feel his pulse ! " Paul cried . Barry took hold of the kid 's wrist . For a long time they waited , with no sound but Paul 's heavy breathing . Then Barry raised his eyes slowly . " There 's no pulse . That means he 's dead , does n't it ? " " I do n't know . Maybe you did it wrong . " Paul grabbed the wrist , there was another long wait . " I do n't feel anything ? How can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw a dead body before . " Barry put his hand quickly on the kid 's chest . His voice raised . " His heart is n't beating . That 's sure , is n't it ? " They stared at each other . After a moment Barry shook his head . " He 's dead ? should n't we get out of here ? ? " He was on his feet , taking a step towards the road . Paul was on his feet too , and his voice was very sharp . " Are you crazy or something ? Do you want them to find him here tomorrow morning ? We have to put him in the water pipe . " Barry just stood where he was , his head shaking a little . Paul came up to him and grabbed his arm tightly . " Will you get hold of yourself ? We have to put him in the water pipe ! "  | A moment later Barry nodded his head . Paul let go of him . " Okay , let 's hurry up about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head . " They bent down over the body . Barry turned his eyes away . " His hands and feet are tied . And those rags in his mouth ? We have to untie him . " " Why ? What the hell are you talking about ? " " We ca n't put him in there ? tied up like that . " " IIe 's dead , for God 's sake ! What 's the matter with your " We have to untie him . " With an angry mutter , Paul pulled away the rags and untied the cord around the hands and the feet . Then he gathered up all the stuff and shoved it under his jacket . " Are you ready pow ? " They lifted the body and moved it to the mouth of the water pipe . Paul adjusted the had in place , then they started to push at the waist . The body would n't move , the wet ground anchored it down . They had to lift it a little and then push . It got stuck around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last they got the shoulders through . It moved easily after that . It was almost all the way in , only the feet sticking out ? and then it stopped moving again . No matter how hard they pushed , it just would n't move at all . " The pipe is n't long enough , " Paul said . " They 're bound to find him like this . " He shook his brad . " But I was positive it was long enough ! " They gave anoilier push . All at once the feet seemed to break loose of their own accord and slide the rest of the way into the pipe . They sat still for a while , catching their breath . Then they got up and hurried back through the woods to the car . They climbed in . Paul took the wheel , pushed down hard on the gas , and flailed along the road . It was ten minutes before Barry spoke . His voice was very low . " We 're soaked . We 'll catch cold . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice was hoarse , as if he had hardly enough strength to use it . His face was white . There was a blur before Barry 's eyes . He tried to blink it away . Then he touched his nose . He was n't wearing his glasses . They turned onto the parkway . " I 'm hungry , " Paul said .  | ... We all feel the deepest sympathy for Peter Phillips . So vivid is our image of this boy 's poor battered body that we tend to dismiss every other consideration as secondary . But we must fight this tendency . It is not a good tendency . It is neither rational nor humane . It can only lead us to perpetrate another injustice as grave as the original crime itself . Remember , nothing we can do can bring Peter Phillips back to us . He is in the hands of God now . But his killers are in our hands . We must try , though imperfectly , to judge them as wisely , deeply , and tolerantly as their victim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brennan 's summation , The People vs . Barry Morris and Paul King  | I IT WAS seven o'clock before Barry got home that night . So many things to do first . The rope and the rags to dump in a trash basket up in the Bronx ; the wrench to clean of blood and hair , and to put back in the tool kit in the trunk compartment ; the car to park in an empty sidestreet , while they scrubbed at the bloodstains on the front seat and on the floor in back . For half an hour they scrubbed away with all their strength , and the stains grew lighter and lighter , hardly noticeable at all , unless somebody happened to be looking for them . " And why should anybody look for them ? " Paul said . " We 're absolutely in the clear . " As he drove Barry home later on , Paul 's spirits seemed to be rising quickly . He was laughing and chattering again . In front of Barry 's building he . said , " I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to talk about . But we better stay home with our parents , like nice dutiful sons . We do n't want anybody thinking back to tonight , and remembering that we were trying to avoid people . " So they agreed to see each other in the morning , and Paul held on to Barry 's hand just a little longer than usual before he turned away . Barry moved slowly across the lobby of his building . He had become very tired . That 's how it always was with him , when he went through a long period of strain and exertion . It was n't until the exertion was over that he noticed how tired he was . He went straight to his room , took out his extra pair of glasses from the dresser , and started to change his suit .  | Mother came in before he could finish changing . She sighed over his wet clothes . He told her he 'd been walking in the park when the storm began . He had taken shelter in the zoo cafeteria , and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why he was so late for dinner . As he spoke he looked everywhere except into her eyes . He did n't see how she could possibly believe him . After dinner he sat with Mother and Dad and watched television . He stared hard at the screen , and what he saw was the rain . Beating down so furiously into the dirt , ripping at the grass and leaves , slashing into his face , slashing even harder into the face far below . He shook his head and blinked , and turned away from the television . He went to bed early . The pillow pressed tightly against his head , the sheets were wet and sticky . The rain was slashing down again . He was grunting and sweating . " But I was positive it was long enough ! " Ile turned over on his side . But it is n't really what you suppose , he thought . I can explain , just let me explain . Walking along the road , cries for help , the four big men . Fists , shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cool aristocratic smile . Rise , I hereby grant you permission to be my slave . Back to the city , trumpets and royal robes , and after that ? in the Prince 's hands , everything that happened was in the Prince 's hands . The car , the wrench , the rain slashing down , the cold white face . Nothing to do with me at all . The Prince commands , so must n't the slave obey ? No , you ca n't blame the slave for obeying . Oh ca n't we ? Who says so ! And hands reached out to grab him ? He sat up in bed , eyes wide , heart beating fast . Had he fallen asleep ? Had he been dreaming or something ? Gradually his heart slowed down , he let his head settle back on the pillow . There was no rain slashing down , no cool superior Prince . He was in his own room , the comfortable familiar room where he woke up every morning and fell asleep every night . And he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of his life for as long as he could remember . He laughed a little . After all , it was only in his mind ? The laugh was choked off in his throat . The moon was shining through his bedroom window , and in the moonlight the rain was slashing down , the wet leaves , the white streaked face . He shook his head hard , trying to shake these images away . But they would n't go away . It was real this time . Dear God , it was no dream any more ! His eyes were red when he woke up the next morning . His pajamas were soaking . He had been sweating as if he had a fever . He picked his way through his breakfast . Opposite him Dad was hidden behind the newspaper . It was ten-thirty now . At eleven he would be meeting Paul . He knew how it would be with Paul . The wide sweep of his arm , the glow on his cheeks and in his eyes , the words tumbling Qut of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of things . It was different sometimes after things were over ? the gay smiling face would tighten up and grow thinner ? but not this morning , nothing was over yet , there were still a hundred things to do . All of a sudden what Barry wanted most in the world was to stay here at the breakfast table , dawdle with his eggs , sip his coffee . For the rest of the morning , for the rest of his life ? At five minutes of eleven he was in the zoo , waiting by the seal pond . Paul arrived ten minutes late . " Bright beautiful day , is n't it ? " Paul said . " Not a cloud in the sky . Could 've used this kind of weather yesterday , could n't we ? " He laughed and rubbed his hands together . Then he leaned forward and spoke in a lower voice . " We did it . Do you realize we did it ? " Then he laughed and waved his arm . " Should n't count our chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back in a few days . Lots to do before then . What do you say , suppose we swing into Stage Five right away ? Is it Five ? I 'll tell you  | the truth , I 've lost count . " He laughed , then he took Barry 's arm . " Come on , let 's find a phone booth . " Barry let himself be led up to the cafeteria . There was a row of phone booths connecting with it . As Paul fumbled in his pocket for change , Barry spoke up suddenly . " Paul ? " Paul looked up with a smile . " Something the matter ? " " We 've done so much already . We do n't have to do any more . " For a few seconds Paul just smiled in silence . Then he said , " You do n't mean that really . We started out with a plan . Our big plan , the big thing that nobody else has ever been able to pull off successfully . You remember that , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ? " " But what ? " There was just the slightest edge to Paul 's voice . " What we did last night was nothing at all . It was only a minor step . If we stop now , we have n't accomplished anything more than a hundred stupid hoodlums before us . It 's what comes now that really matters . This is when we show how much better and bigger we are . " " Paul ? " Barry hesitated a moment , and then his voice broke and the words came blurting out of him , " Paul , I did n't know it would be like this ! I did n't know it would be so awful ! " Paul 's hand tightened on his shoulder . " Shut up . You damned fool , keep your mouth shut . " A moment later , with a shake of his head , he said , " It 's been going perfectly up to now . You 're not going to spoil it for me . You 're not going to do that to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter after all ? If they went on now , or if they did n't go on , what was the difference anyway ? Nothing could stop the rain from slashing down ? " All right , make the call , " he said . Paul gave a nod . They went to a phone booth , and both of them squeezed inside . Paul dialed the number ? he had it all ready , he had looked it up first thing that morning ? and Barry  | brought his ear next to the receiver so that be could hear what was being said . There was a buzzing noise , and then a voice said , " Hello , who is it ? " " Phillips , we 've got your son , " Paul said , making his voice hoarse . " You can get him back by paying us a hundred thousand dollars . Do n't worry , up to now he 's safe and sound ? " After his wife died , Jerry Phillips moved with his son into an apartment-hotel on Seventy-eighth Street just off Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park , and daily maid service . In the mornings Jerry used to get up at seven-thirty and fix breakfast for the two of them . But two years ago Pete put a stop to that . He said he was old enough to fix his own breakfast , he did n't see why his father had to lose his sleep . For the first few weeks after this , Jerry woke up at seven-thirty anyway and listened from his bed in case Pete might be needing him . He kept himself real quiet , of course , because Pete was so proud of his independence . And then , after a while , Jerry stopped waking up . " It is n't necessary any more , " he told himself , with a sad little shrug . At night Jerry hardly ever made any dinner dates . He had gone to a child psychologist after Edna died ? he knew how hard it would be for a boy without his mother , and he had n't wanted to make any dumb mistakes . The psychologist told him that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He ought to see his father every night at dinner , just the way he used to do when his mother was alive . He should n't be palmed off on nurses or baby sitters or convenient relatives . It was a relief to hear this from the psychologist . The one thing Jerry had wanted most was to spend his time with his son . But he had n't been sure that this would be the right thing . After all ,
