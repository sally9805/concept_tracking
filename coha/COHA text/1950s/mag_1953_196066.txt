BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> The big French airfield at Nasan , between the Red River delta and Laos , lay all but deserted within its ring of trenches and stout barbed wire . It had been by passed by the Communist Viet Minh forces on their way into Laos . Under the broiling sun the colonel in command , walking disconsolately along the airstrip , looked up as he heard the sound of air craft engines . Within seconds a C-47 airplane , its wings and tail riddled by Red ack-ack fire , rolled onto the runway . The pilot braked it to a stop and his passenger , a prim , neat little man wearing the four stars of a full general , climbed out . The astonished colonel clicked to attention , saluted , and said : " I was not expecting you , general .

Their fortunes and their spirits at a dismally low ebb , the leaders of France were seriously wondering whether to cut their lines and pull out the one plug that was blocking Asian Communism from flooding through to Burma , Siam , and probably all Southeast Asia . <P> By last week new spirit and optimism had surged up in the men in Indo-China who must fight the ugly war , and the men in Washington and Paris who must see that they get the means and the will to win it . The new lift in morale came partly from the Allied governments , which had decided to plunge fresh resources into the war-more troops from France , more millions from the U.S. But in great part , it came from slim , trim Henri Navarre .
