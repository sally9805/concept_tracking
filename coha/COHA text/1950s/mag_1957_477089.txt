CONTEMPORARY American society must be more self-conscious than any other that has ever existed . Threatened from without , it constantly re-examines itself in search of reassuring sources of strength or eradicable sources of weakness . Altering rapidly within , it feels the painful awareness of self which , as adolescence shows , often accompanies swift change . In the circumstances it is hardly surprising that the investigation of society and its members has become a gigantic enterprise . With the hope of using people more efficiently , business and education and the military test and retest their captive audiences . In search of new markets , business polls and samples the audience it hopes to capture . In the name of science , researchers interview anyone they can get to stop long enough to answer a question . The analysts of social behavior have at their disposal vast sums of money ( from taxation , business , and the foundations ) and an array of techniques that strike their potential victim as ranging from the ludicrous to the terrifying . A good deal of the information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and journals , but since the war several books have appeared that use social research , both original and accumulated , in such a way as to present a vivid image of society to the general reader . The most recent of these books , and one of the best , is The Organization Man by William H. Whyte , Jr . ( Simon and Schuster , S5 ) . THE RISE OF " BELONGINGNESS " T H E Organization Man is both a highly par-. ticularized description of a narrow segment of American society and a highly generalized indictment of American society as a whole . The segment Whyte has chosen to write about is composed of the young men ( roughly between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five ) who have elected to make their careers in large corporations . He tells in abundant and entertaining detail how they are selected and trained , what they regard as the good life , how they amuse themselves and spend their money , what they expect of the churches they attend and the schools they send their children to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whyte goes on to argue that Americans have turned a corner in the moral basis of their lives , that they have abandoned , or are in the process of abandoning , what he calls the Protestant Ethic ( belief in individual salvation through work , thrift , and competitive struggle ) in favor of what he calls the Social Ethic ( belief in " belongingness , " belief in the group as the source of creativity , and belief in science as a way of achieving " belongingness " ) . In making this analysis Whyte is obviously under the influence of David Ries-man 's distinction between " inner-directed " and " other-directed " people : but where Riesnian was primarily concerned with showing a change in the way people behave , Whyte tries to go a step further and show a change in the way they think they ought to behave . Whyte is not pleased with the consequences of the Social Ethic as he sees them . He thinks that it results in the exaltation of mediocrity and discourages , in science and art and daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innovation . Man has been tamed and domesticated to serve the great bureaucratized collective that is the modern corporation ; he has become a steady uninventive producer and a steady uncritical consumer who does n't believe in making any trouble for anyone , including himself ; soon he will be as contented as a cow , with the same herd-like instincts , the same routine demands , and the same passive acceptance of being milked . The argument of The Organization Man is vigorously and intelligently presented , with a fascinating mass of fresh evidence . Anyone interested in the society he lives in will find it absorbing reading . Yet the argument need not be accepted uncritically . There is obviously a question about how well the young trainees and junior executives of large corporations represent . American society as a whole . These young men have chosen the life of " corporation men " for themselves , and the corporations in turn have carefully picked them out as the men most suitable for corporation needs . So selective a group will hardly support such a mass of generalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he adduces a good deal of evidence for his interpretation of American life from other sources , most brilliantly from popular fiction . Other more or less quibbling objections of this sort could be raised : but , as I read it , the book is open to a much more fundamental criticism . Whyte uses one sort of Social Ethic to damn another sort . The clearest evidence lies in the attitude toward gifted people that runs through the book , Whyte wants us to allow greater freedom to gifted people because in that way society will get more good out of them . He is , apparently , quite ready to accept usefulness to the group as a standard for treating people ; he simply thinks that the best cows will give more milk if they are granted a larger pasture to graze in . When we respect every man for what he is , a unique creation , talent will have its innings and so will many another human quality as admirable as talent . When we treat every man on the basis of what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human quality will surfer . Social innovation is not , as Whyte seems to assume , an end in itself or a good thing in itself . It does not clarify the argument very much to confuse respect for individuality with belief in individualism , as the framework of Whyte 's argument tends to do . Individualism is the economic doctrine that the world 's work is best done on the principle of every man for himself and the Devil take the hindmost ; it is the practical consequence of what Whyte calls the Protestant Ethic . Individuality is the unique quality every human being has ; it is what Whyte thinks the Social Ethic neglects . The two are really very different things . One is a passing idea about how to get work done and the other is an eternal wonder of the world . There were men who respected individuality long before individualism was ever heard of ; there will be such men after individualism is forgotten . When 1 , Vhyte does not merely reinterpret the morality he is opposing , he emerges as a sensitive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hint seem to he at loggerheads . The best example is provided by his discussion of the personality tests by which large corporations attempt to assess their employees . Whyte has nothing good to say for these tests and castigates them in no uncertain terms ; he advises people to evade their impertinence by cheating and provides an appendix on how to do it , Yet obviously he could not have written his book without asking a lot of impertinent questionshimself . Has a sociologist any more right to invade the privacy of others than a personality-tester has ? Yet I think Whyte is essentially right : I think that American society has turned a corner in its prevailing beliefs about what makes life worth living , and the fact that Whyte can write a book praising by implication the very qualities in human beings that were most deplored by similar writers twenty years ago proves it . The change , however , may be less a reprehensible shift in ideology than an attempt to keep Life on a human scale in a world increasingly dominated by very large organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold out to the organizations , but it would be possible to interpret their style of life as a very low-keyed and scarcely-understood but heartfelt form of protest . len and women want to feel useful , but they resent , and very properly resent , the feeling of being used . In a society dominated by such vast collectivities as business and industry , government and the army , it is very hard not to feel more used than useful . IE people who make their livings in such collectivities are turning more and more for their satisfaction in life to their membership in small groups ( the family , a neighborhood , a volunteer group ) , if they are cultivating the qualities in themselves that make for usefulness there rather than the qualities that make for more spectacular success in the great world , it may be an assertion of the human scale that is really a rejection of the great organization . OTHER VOICES , OTHER DOOMS R USSELL LYNES ' A Surfeit of Honey ( Harper . 53 ) provides a number of parallels to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Whyte 's , really a collection of incidental essays , and it makes no pretense either to thoroughness in its investigations or to finality in its conclusions . The one poll Lynes attempted to take ( on the subject of who is now considered a lady ) is both frankly na ? ve in method and refreshingly unimpressive in. its results . A Surfeit of Honey is essentially an entertaining and unmethodical series of observations on how American manners have been changed by postwar prosperity . Yet the essays as a group make a number of telling points , some overtly and some by indirection . One of the most interesting , at least in the light of Whyte 's analysis , is that the American no longer regards his job as the center of his life to anything like the extent he once did . Lynes shows young men who are more and more making their homes the center of their lives , by taking an increasing part in housekeeping and the care of children ( another aspect , perhaps , of the domestication and taming of the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their leisure hours in clothes that deny their economic functions : he offers evidence that the idea of the good life entertained by young people of both sexes is no longer primarily built on the hope of success on the job . In his most original essay Lynes discusses a social group lie calls " The Upper Bohemians . " They are brokers of ideas and culture who stand in a somewhat detached and speculative relation to their own work and everybody else 's , receptive to new ideas but not buffeted by every change of fashion , morally sensitive but committed to no program , a confraternity of taste and attitude . Often they are , in Whyte 's phrase , " organization men , " upper bureaucrats of government or business or other institutions , but they remain their own men too : Possibly this group is working out a style of lite that preserves individuality among the collectivities , though the ironic humanism they stand for is a difficult faith to maintain , and not one that is likely to he popular with the mass of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwar years has had a deleterious effect on morals and manners , but except for one essay ( on the rejection of the success-ideal by young people ) his evidence tends to be quite different . Where Whyte sees the effect of prosperity as a softening op of society , an overreliance on co-operation and groupiness , and a decline in aggression and competitiveness , Lynes sees a hardening of heart in society , with people growing more grasping and less considerate of one another than they were in the Depression . One certainty society can count on : harsh things will always be said about it , but they will not always be the same things . LUDWIG von Mises , author of The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality ( Van Nostrand , S3.75 ) , is sure that society is going to hell in a hack ( government-owned ) because it has abandoned the pure capitalism of the middle of the nineteenth century , and his book is an attempt to explain why so many people have questioned the most beneficent system ever worked out by the mind of man . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nlare where every man was rewarded exactly as he deserved to be rewarded . This showed people up for the inferior stuff they were ; they became so envious of their betters that they regarded the system as a conspiracy against them . ( It is a little difficult to tell in what tense the preceding paragraph should be written , because it is a little difficult to tell when the story Von Mises recounts is supposed to have taken place . He describes capitalism as it was perhaps in 1850 , a collection of small entrepreneurs who had never heard of a corporation ; yet he says that it put television sets and automobiles into the hands of workers , which happened a good deal later and only after the pure capitalism he describes had been considerably modified . Again , Von Mises describes how the capitalist is mistreated in contemporary fiction , but his discussion shows that he has n't read a novel on the subject written since the ' thirties . What a shock he will have if he ever comes across Cash McCall . ) One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the verdict of the market is economics . His awn theories of economics happen not to have fared very well in either the commercial or the intellectual marketplace . Virtually all his work that has been published in this country has been brought out by noncommercial presses , and the reception it has received has not been uniformly appreciative . Rut Von Mises rejects the market decision on his work not because he is envious of his betters , as the rest of us do , but because sound economics is the victim of a conspiracy ( " propaganda and indoctrination has well succeeded in enforcing its taboos " ) . It is still the anti-capitalist mentality . IN HIS collection of three lectures on education , Constraint and Variety in American Education ( University of Nebraska Press , $2.75 ) , David Riesman deals at some length with an idea that is also one of Whyte 's major conclusions in The Organization Man ? namely , that education ought to serve as some kind of brake on society . Whyte argues that DOW when society is so enamored of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage and develop ind 1 ity ; and Riesman makes much the same point in advocating what he calls a " counter-cyclical policy " for secondary education . Riesman sees more difficulty in potting such a policy into effect than Whyte does . Yet curiously enough he finds a potential source of opposition to the prevailing tone of education in young people of the very sort that Whyte considers to he setting the prevailing tone of contemporary society : " Young people who no longer seek fame and monetary success . . . . Rejecting uncongenial intellectuality , they want to work with people , to help people ... ? and so on , Such young people certainly exist , and they are just as nice as Riesman says they are , but they are not going to alter education greatly . It is useless to expect schools to be very different from the society that supplies their students and pays their bills . Riesman 's book as a whole is an introductory essay in the sociology of education , with as many ideas as a dog has fleas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every other adjective that indicates pleasure at meeting them without necessarily indicating agreement . It is not easy to grasp all the ideas as they fly past , but that need worry no reader : he will soon meet them all again in other men 's books . F E W books of social criticism are as witty as Robert Wernick 's They 've Got Your Number ( Morrow , $2.95 ) . This is an attack on the science ? or , as Wernick would say , the pseudo science ? of psychological testing . In many ways Wernick 's case against testing resembles Whyte 's , and like Whyte he suggests that the best method of dealing with tests is to cheat . ( Actually , what both writers call cheating is simply giving the tester what he wants , and everybody tries to do that anyway if there is something at stake for him in the test . The difficulty with personality testing is that the amateur has the Devil 's own time trying to figure out what the tester wants , and on that subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between Whyte 's and Wernick 's positions . with personality tests is that personnel men use the results to erect tyrannical standards of normality ; when he administered tests used in the selection of corporation trainees to the highest executives of the same corporations he found that the executives failed ? they were too eccentric or lopsided , they were not uormal enough . This does not question the accuracy of the tests ; it only questions the validity of the way the results are used . Wernick , on the other hand , questions the tests themselves . He flatly denies that anything has been proved about any mental test , and he certainly implies that very little has been proved by any mental test . And where Whyte objects to tests because , as they are interpreted , they do not Lead to the most efficient use of people , Wernick questions the very notion that people ought to be used efficiently . In the end he puts his faith in " the stubborn , untidy , unstatistical , old-Adamish remainder of humanity in us . " Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not predisposed in its favor , but anyone will enjoy such passages as the brilliant account of how to make up a personality test ? Wernick imagines art aging Don Juan who does not want to waste his flagging energies on unsusceptible ladies and constructs a test by which the Don can decide where his remaining talent can be most profitably deployed . The writing verges on the smart-alecky , but it is certainly entertaining . For instance : " The first Tester of whom we have adequate record was the Sphinx , who sat by the road outside Thebes and asked passers-by her famous riddle : what goes on four legs in the morning , on two at noon , and on three at sunset ? Those who gave the wrong answer were devoured forthwith . ( Perhaps here we see the derivation of the term raw score ' used in modern psychometrics . ) The Sphinx was only a primitive monster . and had only one string to her how , but she had hit upon one of the cardinal principles of the most up-to-date schools of testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being tested for . If Oedipus had known that the prim for the right he probably would have wasted his time cramming up on Aristotle 's Politics . " JUST LOOKING FORTUNATELY the universe contains many things besides human society and its problems . and some of them are a good deal fairer to look upon . In Forms and Patterns in Nature ( Pantheon , $7.50 ) Wolf Strache has assembled a group of about ninety photographs that strikingly recall how strange and beautiful and inexplicable the face of the nonhuman world is . Strache 's particular interest lies in the seemingly meaningless and casual way in which nature repeats forms . " Inexhaustible though Nature is in designing shapes , " he writes in his brief Preface , " she may use the same design in various aspects ? on a large scale and on a small scale . in minerals and in plants , in animals , and in the immense spaces of earth and sky . " By exploiting the resources of the modern camera , Strache has been able to reveal some of the visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photograph of tree-like forked lightning and an aerial photograph of a tree-like creek system , or he groups together a picture of the fur of a jaguar and a picture of the similarly marked cross section of a sheep bone . Strache thinks that such resemblances of tie-sign in widely different places in nature have no scientific meaning , but in some instances there must be like principles involved . For instance , the skeleton of a sole revealed in an x-ray photograph not only looks like the rib structure of certain leaves but must also involve somewhat similar engineering principles . Yet Strache is quite right in emphasizitig the metaphoric , poetic quality of his work , for its cumulative effect is to restore our wonder at the look of things . Each picture is provided with an informative description , but the reproductions are not , unhappily , quite first rate . A B 0 0 K that accomplishes much the same effect as Forms and Patterns in Nature. , though in words instead -. e AT:nra-nrin.vIc by Georges Blond ( Macmillan , $1 ) . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures . Blond does not attempt to deal with the whole of this vast and much-disputed subject , limiting himself to the migrations of birds , eels and salmon ( one goes out to sea to breed , the other returns from the sea to breed ) , buffalo , locusts , and lemmings . But these are enough to give the reader a good introduction and to encourage further reading in the field . Blond 's method of presenting his material is not always exactly felicitous . Often he tries to turn it into narrative of a rather puerile sort , his tone is sometimes portentous , and he vulgarizes the scientific theories concerning migration in a way that does not flatter the reader 's intelligence . In short , he somewhat under-rates the intrinsic interest of his material and correspondingly over-rates his own capacity to make it more interesting . But the material triumphs over the presentation ; even Blond 's ill-advised attempt to write the chapter on lemming migrations in the first person ( " I am a lemming , " lie begins ) can not make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her new novel , The Fountain Overflows ( Viking , $5 ) , Rebecca West explains how the idea for it came to her out of the blue one afternoon at tea , but the book reads like an autobiographical memoir , and on the few points where the facts of Miss West 's early life are readily available it seems to reflect them faithfully . Her mother , for instance , was a musician , like the mother in the book , and her father was a disciple of Herbert Spencer with a deep interest in social questions , like the father in the book . Speculation on this subject is less idle than it often is because The Fountain . Overflows is rather better as a memoir than as a novel . The structure has some of the rambling quality of reminiscence , and the illusion of fiction is often dispelled by extended comparisons of past and present , and by other commentary ' fascinating in itself but more at home in essays or recollections . There is failure of sympathy , in die relation between the narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recalled rather than pure literary creation . Perhaps this memoir-like quality arises from the fact that Miss Vest 's brilliant powers of characterization are more analytical than presentational ; she talks about her characters so wonderfully that what they do sometimes seems pallid by comparison , The characters are the glory of the book , but the theme developed through them is by no means uninteresting . It deals again with Miss West 's favorite subject of loyalty ; the particular problem this time is the effect on children when their parents ' loyalties are divided between domestic affection and some more abstract commitment . The father 's passion for social justice combined with his almost complete impracticality in daily life makes him a withdrawn but mythically heroic figure for his children , a man whose love they can only hope to deserve . The mother 's equally powerful passion for music has quite a different effect ; although it alienates the one unmusical child from the family as a whole , it gives the lives of the other children an extra dimension , a standard of excellence that raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in and makes their youth a thrilling apprenticeship rather than mere time to be passed . ( There is at least . curiosity-value in the fact that Heritage , the semi-autobiographical novel published recently by Miss West 's son Anthony West , also deals with the effect on a child of the division of a mother 's loyalties between her art and her offspring . The two books are not otherwise much alike . ) This is one of Miss West 's best books . In the non-fiction that has won her such a large audience it is sometimes difficult to tell where her reporting leaves off and her imagination takes over , but that consideration matters very little , if it matters at all , in The Fountain Overflows . ANOTHER very winning recent work of fiction is a book that bears the unambiguous title Stories ( Farrar , Straits , and Cudahy , $3.95 ) and lives up to its title abundantly by rniltilninnr five stories by Than St a Cford , four by John Cheever , and three each by Daniel Fuchs and William Maxwell . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard reviewer 's dodge for dealing with collections of short stories ? namely , playing off one writer against another , if possible to their mutual disadvantage ? seems even less appropriate than usual . So you will have to resort to the pleasant expedient of reading Stories for yourself to discover which of the four contributors is the best , and why , and I will content myself with calling your particular attention to the work of Daniel Fuchs , who is less well known than his fellows but no less talented . Fuchs ' stories bear a strong family resemblance : all of them create an atmosphere of denuding humiliation in which here and there a solitary figure tries to cling to some covering of decent human dignity . The best of the group , " The Golden West , " also contains the one character wholly successful at this enterprise , a superb old Jewish woman who lives with her horrible movie-making children on a hill outside Hollywood . She has survived the truth of her own life by facing it , and consequently the evasions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for her the world still , as she says , " shimmers before the eyes . " A fine story in a fine collection .
