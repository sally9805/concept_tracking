The lights went out on those three sterling characters ? Kukla , Fran , and 011ie . Fran had n't been able to resist ; she had leaned over and planted a kiss on Ollie Dragon 's cloth nose . I knew how she felt . When you dealt with a creature of 011ie 's slippery charm , how could you be sure he was n't real ? I turned to the boys with the usual question : " Is your homework done ? " One did n't answer ; he was still under the spell of the program that had just faded from the television screen . The other said , " Just fifteen minutes . You do n't want us to miss the news , do you ? " No , we did n't want them to miss the news , so we all settled back while the news of the world , complete with pictures taken that day , unrolled before us . And after that ? I said , " How about the homework , kids ? " This time they arose and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencils could be heard , accompanied by the customary evening groans and exhortations . Now I do n't say ours are model children ? although who am I to doubt the evidence o : my eyes ? ? but I do say it is possible to live in the same house with television and live at peace . And it is possible to reap benefits from the cohabitation . The evils of television are real enough . But the benefits are also real . By and large , I think that television is Mama 's friend . I believe this for reasons other than the obvious one that it keeps the children quiescent through the dangerous hours of the day , from five to eight ? that pause in the day 's occupations that is known as the zero hour . Kukla , Fran , and 011ie are one cogent reason . Fran Allison and that shadowy genius Burr Tillstrom , who lurks behind Kukla , 011ie , Madame Ooglepuss , Beulah , and the Kuklapolitans. have created something so new and fresh and heartwarming that we wonder when Mediocrity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies , will overwhelm them . We turn on our sets each evening with fear and trepidation , wondering if the little Eden has been spoiled . But each night the story unfolds and the illusion is created anew . The Kuklapolitan world is inhabited by gentle people , people of good will . Television has made us a gift of these friends . Then there is the matter of news ? something with which we lucky Americans are overdosed . It may not always be accurate , but we receive it all day long . We are so used to it that it makes little impression unless it is sensational  | . On television , news that is often unsensational makes sufficient impression to become real . Housing , rent control , United Nations , the policy in China ? these words are meaningless to children when heard or read . But when an authority , excited and sincere , sits behind a table , looks into a camera , and argues pro or con , vague issues become real . Children begin to form opinions about communism , taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask questions . And parents are driven to think about what is going on in these United States , which may not be a bad result . Under the hot lights , personalities have a startling impact . They are uncompromisingly themselves . When we hear them on the radio or read of them in the newspapers , we gauge John L. Lewis , President Truman , Secretary of State Acheson , the McCarthys , the Tafts , the Johnsons , by what they say . When we see them on television , we judge them for what they are . Television is a revealing medium , and it is impossible for a man or woman appearing before those cameras to conceal his or her true self . Reading of one public person 's denouncing another is one thing ; watching him do it , in a crowded , noisy public hearing , is another . You can evaluate more accurately the truth of the charges and the motives behind them . So , often , when the news clicks off , the living room turns into an arena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware they held . To the children , the news has become real and personal . Bill , at breakfast , lifts his nose out of his cereal long enough to ask , " Pop , what 's the lowdown on world government ? " and Pop searches ' his mind , trying to remember what he really does think . I LIKE television for other reasons , and usually am glad the ubiquitous box came to live in our living room , quarreling with the antiques and spoiling the decor , if any . It does keep the boys home . Through the football season , it also keeps the neighbors ' boys on our sofa . But that 's not undesirable . Hanging around the drugstore corner holds little appeal when at home Notre Dame is five yards away from a touchdown . It widens horizons . Surprisingly often , it brings into the home good plays , competently acted . These plays , I hope , will improve as actors become used to the medium and as the idea takes hold among television vice-presidents that the stupid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity under hot studio lights . It allows us to sit down to tea with Eleanor Roosevelt . Weekly , we follow Eisenhower on his " Crusade in Europe . " Sometimes , we go to school . An inspired teacher , Dr. Roy K. Marshall , has a program during which he explores subjects such as earthquakes , the solar system , nuclear fission . He is so good that children can not walk out on him or turn the dial , and his lessons stick in their minds . Seeing what he can accomplish in fifteen minutes proves the great potentialities of television in the field of education .  | ' Each evening , for five minutes , a certain Uncle Wethbee explains and predicts the weather . I wonder how many millions of amateur weather prophets Uncle Wethbee is developing ? Speaking of the positive benefits of television , the nuggets of pure gold , will anyone forget the wonderful night Carl Sandburg ran away with Arthur Godfrey 's program and sang to his and our hearts ' content ? " Aw , he 's not so hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on him . No , he 's no songand-dance man , but when you grow up and discover poetry , you 'll remember him . Take a good look and do n't you dare forget him ! " And they will remember that shock of white hair , that seamed. intelligent face . THEY 'LL remember , too , some of the 1 truly fine experiences that reward the doggedly faithful fan . Every once in a while , the powers-that-be in television forget how low our I.Q. is and sneak in an hour of Shakespeare . We 've seen fine productions of Sheridan , of Moliere . " Studio One " hits consistently high . Nowadays , the abandoned comic books gather dust . Why read comics when , nightly , good old Hopalong himself or one of his trusty imitators comes loping into the house ' ? In the kitchen I cook erratically to the bark of six-shooters . Are those nightly Westerns bad ? It 's true they 're prefabricated entertainment , and perhaps , as some psychiatrists gloomily warn us , they 're producing a generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westerns : they brook no argument . Right always triumphs ; the bad guys are brought to justice ; the good guys , crowned with virtue , kiss the girl or the horse and ride into the sunset . To be sure , in real life no such desirable denouement inevitably occurs . But psychiatrists or no , I 'm convinced that a generation of Western-movie fans will grow into adulthood ( I do n't say maturity ) firmly believing in the triumph of right ; aware that a breach of the code results in being abandoned , gasping and remorseful , on the nearest hot prairie . Against the positive benefits of television ? the widening of horizons , the many new friends , the sheer entertainment , the sugar-coated educational pills ? are arrayed formidable evils . Who is not aware of them ? The substitution of the acted word for the reading of books is a very real one . This danger can not be laid exclusively at the door of television ; radio , movies , and the comics came first . However , none of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as television will prove to be . A book has to overcome too much sheer inertia , and rare is the child who will tear himself away from the screen to go off by himself and read one . I think that the beautifully illustrated , brightly colored juveniles that flood the market today will have a hard time competing , and this is a blow to me , as I write juveniles . Standardization of taste is as serious an evil . The low level of the ordinary variety program is deplorable . Sometimes I think that if I have to look at one more skating or singing or balancing or dancing act , I will hurl an andiron through that expensive tube . Also , all too often , vulgarity creeps in . Heaven knows I do n't mind plunging necklines , but I do squirm when I see the boys listening to jokes and watching dances  | ' that come very close to being risque . A fundamental difficulty is involved here . Entertainment that is acceptable in the theatre has to be carefully monitored when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult entertainment . What 's the answer ? I do n't know . There 's just one ray of hope , and that lies in the fact that the televiewer , no matter what his age , quickly tires of the brash , the merely loud , the dull . How long will the Olsens and Johnsons , the Ken Murrays , the Milton Berles last ? Who will take their places ? I hope it will be comedians of subtlety and taste , whose art is peculiarly adapted to the intimacy of the medium ; the comics who depend on nuance and facial expression to portray life 's small , true ironies ; the Victor Borges , the Sid Caesars , the Imogene Cocas ? oh , long may they mug on our screen ! The other evils of television ? It is bad for eyes . Doctors will have to thrash that out ; it seems to be a moot point . Perhaps they will soon have enough evidence to arrive at some conclusions . It disturbs sleep . A nightmare often follows a horror program : " Lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So many hours of television are devoted to murder that children who are allowed to watch will inevitably become calloused to violence and death. - In our family , we 've had to clamp on the lid . Television brings into a placid home those horrifying " sports , " wrestling and boxing . Here , however , the children 's native good sense comes to their rescue . They quickly discover for themselves that many bouts are fixed , and they grow bored and walk out voluntarily . At last we arrive at one of the biggest bogeys , which has become a truism to television 's foes . Television kills conversation . I fought the idea of buying a set for months , and the untimely demise of the art of good talk was my favorite argument . WHENthe set first came into the house I was convinced the opponents were right and conversation in our home was dead . We ate our suppers in silence , spilling food , gaping in awe . We thought nothing of sitting in the dark for hours at a stretch without exchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded telephone ? " " Who 's going to let those dogs in ? " and " Who 's going to let those dogs out ? " The novelty wore off , we began to discriminate , the number of hours shrank and shrank as the dull vaudeville programs lost their charm . Our eyes lost their redness and our tongues loosened . Now I find we have more conversation than ever . We talk about the ideas in the plays we see . We argue back at pompous senators . We make more frequent trips to the encyclopedia than we ever did in the days before television . We have an interest that has tightened the family circle . Throughout the country , surveys are being conducted to determine to what extent television has lowered school grades . The findings are sobering . Mothers and fathers , as well as highschool principals , are alarmed . If the results shown in some investigations are true , television is indeed a destructive force in our life today . I can not help but wonder , however , if we are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the modern lack of discipline at fault ? Well-disciplined children are n't out on the roads driving souped-up hot rods , speeding recklessly , and killing bystanders . Well-disciplined children are n't breaking into candy stores , or making a sordid game of love down by the river . No thinking adult can deny that the in= crease of delinquency is the nation 's greatest problem . Does anyone deny that the fault lies in the home , in the breakdown of respect and affection between generations ? Similarly , if school marks have gone down because of television in the home , the fault lies with the parents , in the appallingly general lack of discipline , in the loss of the good old-fashioned art of saying no and making it stick . I hope I do not sound as though I had a vested interest in the television industry . I do not . I am interested in the problem of assimilating television in the home . I believe it is both a blessing and a curse , but most of the time I think it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligence on the part of the executives of this fascinating new industry can turn it into a thrilling and glorious means of enriching life . Whether they will do so or not is the big " if . " On the whole , I 'm glad to welcome into my house this instrument that relieves tension and helps us forget how real and earnest life is , that brings so much pleasure to be shared together , as a family unit . And we can always bear this in mind . The Declaration of Independence guaranties us certain inalienable rights , such as life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Not the least of these rights is turning the little black dial . We 're not living in George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four , and Big Brother is n't watching us . A twist of the wrist and silence descends . Is television Mama 's friend or foe ? Is n't the choice up to Mother and Dad ?  |                  @ @ @
