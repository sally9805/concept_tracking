In desperately attempting to block an armistice , Syngman Rhee had just about used up all the arguments he knew . Last week South Korea 's stubborn old man used an uglier and more dangerous tool : the mob . <P> <P> First to appear outside the U.S. correspondents ' billets in Seoul one day last week were ranks of pigtailed schoolgirls , trim and neat in starched white uniforms . While a few girls passed out handbills in English , leaders with cardboard megaphones set up a steady chant : " Puk chin , tong il ( March north for unification ) . " The leaders glanced frequently at their directions on bits of note paper . Soon one among the leaders began to sob and weep . Younger girls took the cue , contorted their faces with grimaces of rage and fury . The chant became shrill , strident , then hysterically out of hand . The girls perspired , waved their arms , shouted , clenched their fists . One little girl about twelve hurled herself at a guard , and all order vanished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " Why are you murdering our country ? " <P> Waterhoses &; Wails . U.S. guards , abashed and jittery , stepped back . Stolid Korean police took their place . A few girls fainted and collapsed on the roadway . Others threw themselves down , kicking and screaming . The mob surged toward the gate , the gatepost snapped , and the schoolgirls poured into the compound . For a moment they milled about aimlessly . Then the leaders led them down the street toward Eighth Army headquarters . <P> That day thousands of Koreans , marshaled by brassy-voiced parade sergeants , were tramping the streets of Seoul . Many were grim-faced hooligans and toughs , trotted out frequently for " spontaneous demonstrations . " Others were shuffling , disinterested older folk , householders mustered by their neighborhood ward heelers , or casual pedestrians ordered into the line of march . A long column of marchers fell in behind the high-school girls . At a big barricade in front of Eighth Army headquarters , the scratched and bleeding girls were pushed from behind , and clashed again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As the demonstrations continued all week long , hoodlums in the crowds armed themselves with clubs , staves and stones . In most rear areas , U.N . troops were ordered to carry arms at all times , and barbed-wire barricades appeared in front of U.S. installations . But though U.S. soldiers were frequently surrounded and jostled by mobs , not one American was injured . <P> Nevertheless , Rhee seemed to realize that the anti-Americanism might get out of hand . At week 's end he called off the mob . One directive , sent out by his Education Ministry , revealed how closely the government controlled the riots . It read : " . . . Students will not demonstrate against the cease-fire until and unless there are further instructions from the ministry . " The violence ceased , but the government hinted it might start again . Meanwhile , the tension and suspicion remained .
