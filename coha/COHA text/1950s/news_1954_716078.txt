txt The House of Representatives gets its first whack at the Eisenhower Administration 's $65,570 , - 000,000 budget this week . Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr . said tonight that cuts already . had been made in the first money bill of the session , the Treasury-Post Office appropriations bill , which will come up for debate Wednesday . Subcommittee consideration of the measure has ended , but the full House Appropriations Committee still has to act . The extent and nature of the cuts probably will not become known until . Tuesday , when the committee votes . Members of the subcommittee , headed by Representative Gordon Canfield , Republican of New Jersey , have been studying the appropriation measure since Dec. 8 . The consensus has been that , in view of sharp self-imposed cutbacks last year , there could be no ' " meat-ax " cuts in these departments . The Treasury has asked $578 , - 000,000 for the year beginning July 1 . The Post Office puts its needs at about $329,000,000 , but is hoping for a $240,000,000 postal rate increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment also is expected by Thursday in the Senate . And the - , rosPect is that the tempo of Congressional action , slowed to snail 's pace last week as Re- ) ublicans celebrated Lincoln 's Jirthday with party rallies , will 2ick up markedly . The House can move on to the independent offices appropriation bill , according to Mr. Martin . He reported that a subcommittee was completing consideration of it Also reported and awaiting clearance to the floor are bills for the St. Lawrence Seaway and the postal rate increase . Over in the Senate , the Republican leader , Senator William F. Knowland of California , will call up the nomination of Albert C. Beeson to the National Labor Relations Board after the Bricker amendment . He has said the chamber will proceed directly to the Hawaiian statehood bill after that . Voting will start Tuesday on the Bricker proposal , which seeks to restrict Presidential authority in treaty making . The initial votes will be on a series of amendments by Senators Knowland ; Homer Ferguson of Michigan , the Republican Policy Committee chairman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Leverett Saltonstall , the Republican Whip . Quick Action Expected These amendments probably will move quickly since ultimately they will stand or fall on the basic proposal . They explicitly declare the supremacy of the Constitution over treaties and Executive agreements and provide that votes in the Senate on treaties shall be conducted by roll-calls . At outlined by Senator Ferguson , the subsequent vote may be directly upon Senator John W. Bricker 's revised proposal for restricting the area of treaties and Executive agreements . In this version , the Ohio Republican drops the controversial " which " clause on state sanction of treaties , but requires that the Senate must say specifically that an individual treaty shall have the effect of " internal law " if it is to be so applied without further legislation . This new Bricker amendment also embraces the proposal by Senator Walter F. George , Democrat of Georgia , requiring that Executive agreements , to have the force of internal law , must be implemented by Senate legislation . If this over-all Proposal fails , Senator George probably will call up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's authority in the area of treaties but does refer to other agreements . The balloting up to this point would be by majority vote . Such a vote also would apply on the motion , expected from Senator Wayne Morse . Independent of Oregon , to recommit the whole matter . The Morse motion could be made at any point but the Senator , in line with his policy of favoring full deliberation , probably will withhold it until the voting reaches its final stage . The amendment would rehire the approval of two-thirds of those voting , then the same margin in the House , . then approval by three-fourths of the states . Once this parliamentary tangle has been cleared , Senate action on the Beeson nomination probably will proceed quickly . The Administration sought support over the week-end among Southern Democrats , but some of them were reported to have misgivings about the lack of consistency in Mr. Beeson 's testimony ' before the Senate Labor Committee . The nomination was reported from the committee by a 7 to 6 vote that followed party lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become the " swing man " on votes in the N. L. R. B. , now politically . divided 2 to 2 , can maintain a , desirable judicial attitude on labor-management cases in view of his career as a management representative in labor matters . Mr. Beeson has agreed to resign , rather than take a leave of absence from his present employer , the Food Machinery &; Chemical Corporation of San Jose , Calif. , but there was some conflict about this matter before the committee . Statehood Fight Looms The expectation is that enough support will be mustered to confirm Mr. Beeson , but that more votes will be cast against him than against any previous Eisenhower nominee . Another long fight is expected on Hawaiian statehood . Democrats will sees to put Alaskan statehood , also reported to the floor , into the same package . President Eisenhower has asked only for the admission of Hawaii at this time . As the legislative calendars were building up , Mrs. Edith Nourse Rodgers , Republican member of the House from Massachusetts , and the Congress of Industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $600 to $1,000 . Mrs. Rodgers . asserted that such a move , benefiting millions of Americans , would enable them to " buy the butter and eggs now being accumulated in Government warehouses . " The Economic Outlook , C. I. 0 . publication , proposed the increased exemption as a better means of achieving economic stability than new tax concessions . It contended that 90 per cent of these concessions were being made to " corporations and wealthy holders of corporate stock . "
