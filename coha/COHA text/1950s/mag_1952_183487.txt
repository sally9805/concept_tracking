Thumbing through the first volumes of the big new encyclopedia one evening at the Trianon , France 's King Louis XV showed frank bewilderment . His ministers had told him that the work was subversive , and the King had duly ordered its confiscation . But-as Voltaire tells the story-the King read all about the rights of the crown and promptly began to question his own decision . " Upon my word , " cried His Majesty to Madame de Pompadour , " I ca n't tell why they spoke so ill of this book . " <P> There was plenty of reason for the King 's ministers to speak ill of the book . It was edited by fiery Philosopher-Dramatist Denis Diderot , and he had made it a good deal more than a compilation of all the knowledge that was available at the middle of the 18th century . To many a Frenchman it became the voice of Reason itself-a major intellectual weapon of the Revolution , one of the brightest ornaments of the Enlightenment , the foundation stone of the new secularism . Though Frenchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ceased to revere it . Last week they were expressing their reverence officially . <P> " Turning Point . " To honor the sooth anniversary of the publication of Volume I of Diderot 's Encyclopedic , France has embarked on a year-long series of celebrations . The Archives Nationales de France have published an exact reproduction of Diderot 's prospectus . The Bibliotheque Nationale has put on a massive exhibition of his original manuscripts and illustrations . Meanwhile , the Sorbonne has commissioned six monographs on various aspects of the work ; and the Ministry of <P> Education is toying with the idea of backing a film based on Diderot 's life . The ministry has also decreed that schools must place special emphasis on the encyclopedia in 1952 . Cried Minister Andre Marie : " This work , by the spirit in which it was undertaken . . . marks the turning point in ideas which ushered in our modern times . " <P> Intolerance &; Anagrams . The ushering began in 1745 , when a Paris printer named Andr Franois Le Breton hired the impecunious Diderot to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , decided to " assemble the knowledge scattered over the surface of the earth . . . " Before he was through , he had persuaded some of the best brains in Europe to help him . <P> D'Alembert wrote on mathematics , Turgot on economics , Quesnay on agriculture , Buffon on nature , Rousseau on music , and Montesquieu on taste . Diderot himself wrote on everything from intolerance and Spinoza to anagrams and onomancy-the " science " of telling a man 's fortune by the letters in his name . He treated topics that intellectuals had been apt to ignore before . He spent hours studying iron foundries and gunpowder mills at first hand , imported workers from the factories of Lyons to help him with an article on the velvet trade .
