txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 26. - The chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission said today that tests this spring would stress weapons to " blunt an attack against us . " Lewis L. Strauss declared that there had been " very great progress " on new weapons and that the tests would help prove new ideas of weapons , composition and construction . Some strategic or offensivetype weapons also will be tested during the series , he said , but it will " be concerned mostly with smaller weapons that could be used against invading aircraft or missiles . The series is expected to begin next month . No date has been announced . On the Columbia Broadcasting System 's program , " Face the Nation , " Mr. Strauss also said he would favor creation by this Government of an atomic financing program to help underew York Times . developed nations finance atomic power plants . President Eisenhower last week authorized the sale or lease of 44,000 pounds of uranium 235 for the peaceful production of atomic power at home and of the same amount for use by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-developed nations are expected to encounter severe financial obstacles . Mr. Strauss said that while he was not committing the commission , he personally felt that there were " many cases where we can justify assistance to friendly under-developed nations . " He added that the release of the uranium , valued at $1,000 , - 1000,000 , meant that the stockpile of weapons and the rate of current production of weapons ma- // terial were adequate for foreseeable military ' demands . " It does not mean that the military stockpile is. complete for all future needs , " he cautioned . Asked what safeguards this nation would have that the uranium would . not be used for , military purposes , Mr .. Strauss said such assurances would be required . The United States , too , he said , will maintain some form of inspection and will require that fuel elements be returned to this country for reprocessing after they have been " poisoned " by waste during the reactor 's operation . He " presumed " that this would mean stationing United States representatives in the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be detailed later , The announced allotment program , Mr. .

In the discussion of the test series , Mr. Strauss- was ? asked about international efforts to limit the testing of thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) weapons because of possible radiation damage .. ? Had such efforts succeeded , Mr. Strauss said , . " we would be far behind the point we now are today in diversity and numbers of weapons . " The supposed ' damage to health that may result , he said , is " greatly exaggerated , " but in any event , " it is a calculated risk that we must take in order that our freedom be preserved .
