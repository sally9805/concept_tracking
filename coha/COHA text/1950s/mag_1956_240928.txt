As a 14-year-old student at a high school in Quitman , Ga. , Farm Boy Wesley Patrick got a class project-the care of a gilt and a boar . He did so well that he won second prize at a local swine show . Much encouraged . Patrick asked his vocational agriculture teacher how he might get into full-time farming . Advised Teacher Drawdy Willis : " Develop and expand . " <P> Patrick developed and expanded so fast that the 382,000 members of the Future Farmers of America named him the 1956 " Star Farmer of America , " and successor to igss 's winner , Joe Moore of Tennessee ( TIME , Oct. 24. 1955 ) . This week , in celebration , Patrick 's Brooks County farmer friends held a giant barbecue for him ( 6,000 chickens , i.ooo pecan pies ) . The Ford Motor Co. got into the act , picked up the food tab . gave Patrick one of its new combination pickup truck and passenger cars which the company will start producing for the farm trade next month . <P> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's success pattern has been sure and steady . Even before his June 1953 high-school graduation , he persuaded his father to let him work part of the family farm , planted six acres of oats and crimson clover , planted ten acres of sweet potatoes and corn and marketed ten hogs . He finished the first year by copping county awards in corn production and winter grazing . In 1953. after his father , Paul Patrick . 53. had moved to another farm . Wes bought the 130-acre family farm for $10,400 , promising to pay in installments . <P> <P> Wes put in cotton , oats , tobacco . 55 acres of corn , put some land in pasture . and steadfastly brushed off his family 's insistence that he go to college . ( He finally went , stayed a quarter , then quit . ) He pushed a soil-conservation program , fenced the farm , terraced the land and planted good , soil-building cover crops ; soon he had a well-managed farm with a net worth of $17,145 . Said his old teacher : " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn and determined to be the best farmer in the whole country . For its size , his farm is one of the best-run anywhere . "
