Another air force spokesman said the reduced air force budget wes not a primary consideration , either . 150 Million Paid Out Air force officials have told the senate investigators they were disappointed by Kaiser 's performance on the contract . It was let in December , 1950 , but Kaiser has completed only 57 of 159 planes called for in the contract and the government has paid out about 150 million dollars . The company is operating on a cost-plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inquiry has heard testimony that the cost per plane of the 159 contemplated would be more than 1.2 million dollars , compared with the $260,000 per plane paid the Fairchild Engine and Aircraft company , which developed the C-1192 An air force spokesman said It would be a matter of months before the ** under construction at the Kaiser plant would be completed .

The announcement of the air force cancelations came while Kaiser and his son , Edgar F. Kaiser , were defending the record of the Kaiser Motors corporation before the senate committee .

The committee retired from the hearing room with the Kaisers , and a few minutes later Bridges announced the hearing would be recessed at the call of the chair .

" May Shift Output Detroit , June 24 UP1 -- Cancellotion of the air force contract with Kaiser Motors corporation for production of C-119 and C123 planes represented another major upset in the planning of loperations at the big Willow Run plant . What its eventual effect will be was not immediately apparent to company officials at the plant today . There was speculation that some other type of aircraft production might be assigned to the Willow Run plant . During World War II the Ford Motor company built well over 8,000 13-24 Liberator bombers in the plant . Many Face Idleness However , even if some other aircraft operation is assigned to Kaiser at Willow Run , an indefinite period of idleness lies ahead for the 12,500 workers now engaged on the C-119 and C-123 contract . The CIO United Auto Workers today telegrafed to Air Secretary Talbott a sharp criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mazey , demanded the cancellation be rescinded , and that facts behind the decision be made public to justify " putting 12,000 workers on the street . " A new commitment for plane production would involve considerable retooling which could not be handled overnight or in a matter of a couple of weeks . Thus a complete shutdown of the big Willow Run plant for an indefinite period appears certain . Only Monday of this week the ccmpany announced the transfer of much of its civilian automotive work to Toledo and the Willys plant . This brought idleness to about 2.200 automotive workers . Kaiser Motors purchased the Willys concern only a few months ago for 62 million dollars . The transfer of automotive purchasing , accounting , some engineering and export operations from Willow Run to Toledo started rumors that all car production at Willow Run was to be permanently discontinued . May Produce Bodies Kaiser officials denied this . But one thing that came out of the gossip following announcement of the transfer of some operations to Toledo was a so-called good guess that bodies for Willys cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Kaiser spokesmen said such a move would depend entirely upon whether the operation could be performed more efficiently and more economically at Willow Run . Kaiser interests moved into the Willow Run plant in 1945 following the formation of the Kaiser-Frazer corporation by Henry J. Kaiser and Joseph W. Frazer , a former Chrysler official and once president of WillysOverland at Toledo . They built Kaiser and Frazer passenger automobiles at Willow Run . In attempting to start a new automobile company , they undertook something tried in the past by more than 2,500 other firms that failed to make good . They did have the advantage of the greatest shortage of automobiles in the history of the auto industry during the period immediately following World War IL The company 's biggest year was 1948 when it turned out more than 181,300 passenger cars and reported net earnings before taxes of in excess of 19 million dollars . Since then , however , the going has been much rougher and losses have been more frequent than profits . The Kaiser assembly lines at Willow Run have moved somewhat spasmodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as responsible for production curtailments . Since Jan. 1 this year *Mew Run has produced approximately 18,350 cars .
