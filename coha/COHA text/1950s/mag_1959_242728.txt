" I lead an ordinary life doing ordinary things , " said the short , sandy-haired woman waiting to be called as an honored guest to the platform in Washington 's resplendent Departmental Auditorium last week . " I 'm just doing what other people are doing . " Dr. Anne Carlsen , 43 , was right in a way . She just does " what other people are doing , " but with a difference : she does it with no arms , and with artificial legs . The President 's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped could have found no more logical recipient for its annual trophy award to the " Handicapped American of the Year . " <P> When Anne Carlsen was born in Grantsburg , Wis. , she had only stubs of arms ending above the elbow , her right leg ended above the knee , and the left was malformed , ending in a clubfoot . Left motherless at four , Anne got tireless encouragement from her father , an elder sister and four brothers . On a coaster wagon she learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At eight she was pronounced ready for school , but only after a psychologist had gone over her and solemnly pronounced her " educable . " Anne raced through two grades a year . <P> Kids Are Kinder . There was time out for a long hospital siege , to straighten out the contractures in Anne 's one knee . She went home able to walk , but only with a device so clumsy that she soon discarded it . When she was in high school , her left leg was amputated below the knee . Then , with artificial legs and crutches , Anne could really walk . But as she advanced to college ( St. Paul 's Luther Junior College and the University of Minnesota ) , Anne found it harder to win acceptance than it had been among young children , and harder still to get the training she wanted to make her self-supporting as a teacher . <P> After discouraging years of baby-sitting and of writing , which brought only rejection slips , Anne Carlsen got the break she longed for : a chance to teach at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dak . The children , she found , quickly adjusted to her multiple . handicaps , soon seemed not to notice them . Summer studies won her an M.A. , and in 1949 Anne Carlsen got her Ph.D . in education from Minnesota . The next year Dr. Carlsen moved in as superintendent of the Crippled Children 's School , which had moved to Jamestown . N. Dak . <P> Driving Is More Fun . There she lives alone in a two-room apartment over the school . The one thing she leaves to others is cooking . In the office she usually dictates letters , though she has learned to write-far more legibly than most people with normal hands-with a special pen hooked to her stump . Dr. Carlsen attends conventions all over the country , traveling easily by plane or train if it is too far to drive . But driving she loves , in a car with special controls , like those for handicapped veterans . " It 's the only thing I 'm proud of , " she says . And since Dr. Carlsen got her license in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when Vice President Richard Nixon presented the trophy last week , Dr. Carlsen had no hands to receive it . Nixon held it while , with good poise on her crutches , she made an apt acceptance speech .
