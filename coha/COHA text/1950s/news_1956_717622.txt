txt Anyone who comes into this country looking for constructive things to write about might as well prepare for a shock . He will find them ultimately . But the search will be long and it goes through some obstacles that ought to be described by the author of Pilgrim 's Progress . " Three weeks ago , " said a personal friend , a Vietnamese whom I had known elsewhere and whom I knew to be a man of integrity , " my cousin was arrested . He is a newspaperman , a moderate nationalist and in no sense either a Communist or pro-Communist . His political views are fairly widely known . " It was a classic arrest . The police came at three o'clock in the morning , two truckloads of them . They came into my cousin 's house with riot guns pointed . They took his radio and typewriter and said these were enough to incriminate him . " He is suffering from an illness which would make prison dangerous , so I went to the police . They said nothing could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinh Diem , and he said this was not something he could help with . I wrote to President Diem himself , whom I have known quite well personally , and there has been no answer . Wife Rebuffed Too " My cousin 's wife went to the police and pleaded because of her husband 's health . They said to her , ' If you cause trouble , we will arrest you too . ' Since she had four children to take care of , she left . " A lawyer was sent to him and denied admittance . There are courts , but none of them will touch a political case like this . There is no habeas corpus . There is complete censorship in the newspapers , so news of a case like this can not be spread around . There is no legal opposition to the Diem government , so no one can raise a question , so to speak , in parliament . " I talked to another Vietnamese who also happened by coincidence to be a newspaperman . At ' least he was trained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I have written articles but the moment the slightest questioning of the government comes in , the censor takes it out . We are in that fawning stage now where adulation ? of President Diem is required in almost every article . This is not journalism , so I have another job . " " Sure there are political prisoners , " said a knowledgeable American . " You must remember that some of the nationalists are in open rebellion against the regime and the security job is a Stem Clv Vienamese Casts Pictorial Ballot difficult one and the police in crude circumstances like this can not be expected to discriminate . " A larger perspective came from a generally respected Vietnamese opposition leader who is out of a job because there is no provision for parties outside the ruling group . " The most serious mistake of President Diem , " he said , " is to crack down so hard on those nationalist groups which are not Communist and which are frustrated by his dictatorship . His strategy is pushing them over into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorship like this , the word will get around the country that things under Diem are not much better than things under the French , and then Ho Chi Minh ( President of Communist North Vietnam ) and his fifth column will have another real wave of popular discontent to exploit . " Shaky economy An American official who works closely with the Vietnamese said , " There is only a bare framework of government here now . The French did everything here , right down to the smallest jobs , and they left no one trained to carry on . There is corruption here and there is a police state , but what do you expect ? This is a new country starting with almost nothing , born after 14 years of almost continuous wars and occupation . " A Vietnamese official who is also an economist said , " The government here has very little to work with . Our economy could scarcely be further out of touch with economic realities , or more artificial , with military expense eating up most of our budget , and dollar help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic reconstruction but into the much less helpful channels of commerce and services . " These varied comments are a fair sample of the first things a visitor is told here privately . An official , of course , has the responsibility of getting things done as well as defending his actions , so he will begin with , the statement that things are coming along nicely , which leaves a questioning visitor uncomfortable until he can investigate . But the average confi- : dential talk first produces a grim series of statements . It is only when conversations , reach a later stage , and come back to the inevitable fact that something has to be done , that most persons will brace themselves and find some constructive elements in the picture . " The most important thing to me , " said the knowledgeable American , " is that President Diem now realizes , I think , that he must win the support of the common people . His recent tour of the provinces helped show him that . A year ago , I frankly do n't think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of change in the situation , " said the American official . " The political decay has been arrested . A while back , I think the Communists could have really taken the country if they made a determined political effort . Now I do n't think they could . These are negative things in one sense , but they give us a chance and a little time , now , to do some more solid building . " The minority party leader said the government could n't put off publishing the long postponed electoral law much longer . When it comes , there must be some chance for constructive criticism and to bring the unconstructive sort to the surface where it can be answered by the rest of us . " The brightest part of the picture , apart from plans for the kind of economic development which will reach the common people which are the subject of another dispatch in this series , and are being pushed by both the United States and the United Nations , was the attitude toward President Diem himself . The opposition political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best man for President , in talks we had on the other side of the world , still said he was a man of complete personal integrity . He suggested that Mr. Diem tried to do too much himself , investigating even small political appointments . ( One of a series )
