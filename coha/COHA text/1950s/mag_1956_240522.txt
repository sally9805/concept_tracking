The hardy , denim-clad fishermen of He de Sein ( pop . 1,328 ) , six storm-swept miles off France 's Brittany coast , regard both doctors and tax collectors as meddlesome nuisances . For three hard-lived centuries the Senans have paid no taxes ; between last November and February they sent five doctors packing , each with his faith badly shaken in both humanity and the Hippocratic oath . Restless Paris Doctor Jean l'Haridon , 35 , wartime resistance fighter and onetime Boy Scout , hoped to avoid the fate of his immediate predecessors ; he saw He de Sein as a new world to conquer . When he heard that the island was again without a doctor , he volunteered his services . At first , Dr. l'Haridon was delighted . In his first week he set a fisherman 's broken leg , sewed up another 's gashed hand , made the rounds of 50 " economically feeble ' ' oldsters entitled by French law to free medical care . " It was a job you could grasp with your two hands . " L'Haridon explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . ' ' <P> But he soon learned that dedication was not enough . Mainland health officials paid L'Haridon only 23,000 francs ( $65 ) a month ; the islanders gave him an unheated stone house furnished only with a single candle and a portrait of Louis Pasteur and , beyond that , little but sullen acceptance . " In the beginning , " says L'Haridon , " it was like camping . I like camping , but how could I work as a doctor ? " As the weeks wore on , the young doctor was appalled by his task . The islanders refused to pay bills or take orders . Some 300 Senans were seriously ill with bronchitis , rheumatism and TB ; many of the children had whooping cough . What lie de Sein needed , L'Haridon pleaded to mainland authorities , was a modern dispensary equipped with X ray to spot TB cases , plenty of drugs , and a helicopter to remove serious cases to the mainland . Last week the mainland offered to equip a dispensary-but only if the islanders would pay their taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Innkeeper Felix Guilcher , and to a man , the aroused Senans echoed him . <P> As he made his rounds last week , Physician l'Haridon decided that the case of lie de Sein was more than a 20th century doctor could cure . Said he : " I wo n't leave until another doctor arrives . But I ca n't stay here . " To the Senans , unhealthy but untaxed. the impending departure of their sixth doctor in six months was no crisis . " So he goes , " shrugged one islander . " Another one will come along . "
