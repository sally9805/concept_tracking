Never had Europe 's beaches been so crowded with holidaymakers , or its roads so filled with cars , or its villagers , from Trondheim to Taranto , so well-dressed and well-fed . The vision of the U.S. President swapping toasts with the masters of Russia had given Europeans to believe what they long had wanted to believe : that ten years of cold war were over . High wages and full employment seemed evidence that prosperity had come to stay . All this-and the summer weather-begat a mood that the many sensed but few could rightly define . It was relaxation to the English , dtente to the French , distensione to the Italians , and if everybody else did n't feel that way , the West Europeans were n't interested in listening to the complaint . <P> French Emergency . France was the only nation to have a full-scale military emergency on its hands . Half the French army was in action in North Africa , and so were the best divisions of the mobile security police , the nation 's last line of defense against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs the French treasury close to 800 million francs ( $2,300,000 ) per day . Like Indo-China before , it has placed a strain on France 's inflated economy . Six months ago , France was enjoying something of a boom , and producing more cars , steel and textiles than ever before in its history . Production is going up , but last week , on their return from the beaches , French workers were out on strike in 17 provincial towns . Their demand was for higher wages to match higher prices . <P> Italian Flirtation . In Italy , distensione meant a continuing flirtation with the notion of an " opening to the left " - an alliance between Christian Democratic center parties and the fellow-traveling Nenni Socialists , who still refuse to break their " unity of action " pact with the Communists . The Reds , oozing good-fellowship , as much as implied that " the spirit of Geneva " required all parties to get together . Italy 's 2,000,000 unemployed are still the Communists ' best asset , but according to a series of tables euphemistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanoni , jobs could be found for them all by 1964 . The only unanswered question was : where would the money come from to finance the projects that would provide the jobs ? Vanoni obviously expected the U.S. to cough it up . <P> German Remedies . Germany was feeling what might be called the dislocation of prosperity . Burgeoning industry has sucked the labor market dry , forcing up wages and prices ; Hamburg 's shipbuilding yards and North Hessian heavy industries are plagued by wildcat strikes . Sure to find jobs elsewhere , ten out of every 100 of West Germany 's coal miners have left their underground jobs in the past six months . Result : a sharp cutback in coal production . One group of German steel mills was again forced to buy expensive U.S. coal to keep its busy blast furnaces going . <P> To prevent the German boom from faltering , Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard proposed to 1 ) import foreign labor , probably from Italy , 2 ) reduce import restrictions , thereby permitting cheaper foreign goods to compete with German products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Socialists and trade unions .
