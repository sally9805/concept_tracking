Around the semicircular bar at Nassau 's Pilot House Club , deepwater sailors were busy discussing the remarkable performance of one of the world 's greatest sailors - Emil Mosbacher , last summer 's skipper of America 's Cup Candidate Vim . " Bus " Mosbacher had taken the run-of-the-drawing-board yawl , Callooh , designed by Phil Rhodes , and driven her to apparent victory in the annual 184-mile Miami-to-Nassau race . Then they discovered that Mosbacher had not won after all . Tardily , the race committee determined that the winner on corrected time was a 40-ft. , fiber-glass-hulled yawl named Rhubarb . Not only that , but Rhubarb 's sister ship , Southern Star II , was third . Both brand new , the two boats were the work of 39-year-old William H. Tripp Jr. -a new designer who is currently the talk of ocean sailors , and who may prove to be the first real challenger in decades to the long dominance of Philip Rhodes and Olin Stephens in yacht design . <P> Tripp has been in business for himself only since 1951 . Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifelong Long Islander , has sailed everything from the family Star boat to ocean racers and frostbite dinghies , put in a twelve-year apprenticeship with Designers Rhodes and Stephens . As with all unknowns in the cliquish yacht business , Tripp at first found the going tough . In 1955 he finally got a chance to design an ocean racer , the yawl Katingo . The boat promptly won the American Yacht Club cruise two years in succession . <P> Bill Tripp set to work on the fiberglass design in 1956 for a Connecticut lawyer named Frederick Lorenzen , who was dissatisfied with wooden boats ( " I do n't like them . They leak " ) . Many small boats have been built of fiber glass , but few of ocean-racing size . At the Beetle Boat Co. in East Greenwich , R.I. , a fiberglass mold was built around a wooden mockup of Tripp 's design . From the mold came the racers themselves , including Rhubarb , Southern Star II and Lorenzen 's boat Seal . Last year the three sister yawls performed beautifully in the Newport-to-Bermuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge field of 110 boats . <P> Rhubarb and her sisters have been named Block Island Forties . They are centerboarders , wider than most ocean racers , and with a unique rounded stem . In the closemouthed tradition of naval architects , Tripp will say only that his design " follows my ideas in relation to resistance and lateral plane , ideas which are somewhat different from some my competitors hold . " Lawyer Lorenzen is a little more specific . " It 's quite a trick to get a boat with tremendous stability and not too much underbody , " he says . " Bill draws his lines very tight . His lines at the forward section are very fine . This helps particularly in going windward . " <P> So far , ten ocean racers have been produced from the Tripp-designed mold . At least four , and probably more , will follow . After last week 's triumph , many an ocean sailor was eying one of Designer Tripp 's Block Island Forties for himself .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
