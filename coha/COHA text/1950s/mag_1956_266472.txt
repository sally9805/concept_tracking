THE LOVING COUPLE ( 269 pp. ) - Virginia Rowans-Crowe// ( $3.50 ) . <P> The most remarkable thing about this book is that it can-indeed , must-be read from back to front as well as front to back . The book has two title pages , two opening chapters . In fact , to let the secret out , it is two stories . It tells the same incident-a marital quarrel-from the point of view of the husband as well as the wife. * Like " his " and " hers " towels in the bathroom , the notion is apt to be a little obvious and excessively cute . But if the reader can keep from getting dizzy turning the book over , he will still have fun , because behind Author " Virginia Rowans " hides the beard of Edward Everett Tanner III , who , under the pseudonym of Patrick Dennis , wrote the runaway bestseller , Auntie Mame . <P> The strains on John and Mary 's marriage are , luckily , all external . John is a good writer gone wrong as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an outfit that manufactures " PulseBeat Eternal Non-Magnetic " watches . Trouble arrives with Besame Bessamer , the boss 's stepdaughter , whose pulse beat , particularly when she is near John , is entirely too magnetic . Along the way of his thin plot , Author Tanner looses his most devastating attacks on flossy Manhattan restaurants and nightclubs catering to lovers of bad food , overpriced booze and rotten entertainment-the result being a sort of reverse Duncan Hines guide . Throughout , the fact that John loves Mary , and vice versa , is seldom news . <P> * Publishing gimmicks seldom appear alone . Next month two collections of essays about married life ( by Emily Hahn and Eric Hatch ) will appear in the same back-to-back book form .
