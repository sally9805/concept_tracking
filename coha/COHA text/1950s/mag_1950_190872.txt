" Your former place of sitting , " wrote King George to the members of Britain 's House of Commons one day last week , " has now been rebuilt ... It is my pleasure that you do occupy the new chamber . . . " Next day , forbidden by ancient tradition to enter the premises in his royal capacity , the King slipped into Britain 's new House of Commons for a quick look on his own. * <P> Red Lines In the Carpet . What he saw differed little in appearance from the House chamber that was reduced to rubble by Hitler 's bombers in 1941 . The new chamber , designed by Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and built at a cost of 1,750,000 , still had banks of elaborately carved , green-cushioned wooden benches ranged on either side , as before , in front of ornate oak-paneled walls . Two red lines , woven into the green carpet and thoughtfully placed just over two sword lengths apart so that overenthusiastic partisans could not prick each other , once again marked the limits beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heat of debate . <P> In 1943 Winston Churchill had won his argument for keeping the old chamber 's rectangular shape against those who favored a semicircular pattern . " The party system , " said Churchill , " is much favored by an oblong form of chamber . It is easy for an individual to move through those insensible gradations from left to right , but the act of crossing the floor to change parties is one which requires serious consideration . I am well-informed on this matter for I have accomplished that difficult process not only once but twice . " <P> New features include fluorescent lighting , a network of amplifiers and an air-conditioning system ( supervised by an engineer in the basement who can watch proceedings in the chamber through a 65-ft. periscope ) . There is more room in the galleries for journalists and other " strangers " ( i.e. , visitors ) than before , but the new chamber , like the old , still provides only 437 seats for its 625 elected members . <P> Faces to the Wall . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a family christening . After solemn prayers , during which strangers ( allowed to participate for the first time ) and members alike knelt on the benches with faces turned toward the wall , a motion was put by Prime Minister Attlee to thank the King for the new House . Seconded by Churchill , it passed unanimously . <P> " I think , " said Prime Minister Attlee as he surveyed the new home of the Parliament whose deliberations have contained the changes of centuries of history , " the British have the distinction above all other nations of being able to put new wine into old bottles without bursting them . " <P> <P> * The last British king to invade the House of Commons officially was Charles I who , with an armed escort , stormed up to the House on a chill afternoon in January 1642 in search of his rebellious Ministers Pym , Holles , Heselrige , Strode and Hampden . He entered alone to ask for the culprits . Speaker William Lenthall told him coldly : " May it please Your Majesty , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place but as the House is pleased to direct me whose servant I am . " " I see my birds are flown , " answered Charles , turning back to stride through doors held ominously open during his visit .
