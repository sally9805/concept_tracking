( See Cover ) <P> Eleven hours out of Baltimore 's Friendship International Airport , 4&frac12; hours after a refueling touchdown in Iceland , the gleaming Boeing 707 jet transport , emblazoned u.s . AIR FORCE , peacefully cruised eastbound above the sandy beaches of Baltic Latvia toward the heart of the Soviet Union . With Russian officers peering over the shoulders of American pilots , with its distinguished passengers at the windows looking down upon unfamiliar landscape , the jet flew on across the great Russian plain , the jagged pattern of Russian farm fields , an occasional blue lake and great patches of green forest , until it let down through a blur of urban haze for a smooth landing at Moscow 's Vnukovo Airport . It was 2:47 p.m. when Vice President Richard Milhous Nixon , fresh in dark grey summer-weight suit and light grey tie , emerged blinking into the sunlight from the forward hatch , followed in a few moments by Wife Pat , by the President 's brother , Milton Eisenhower , by the Navy 's Atomic Vice Admiral Hyman Rickover and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With one sweep of the politician 's practiced eye , Nixon sized up the situation : he was clearly getting the cool hello . On hand was a little group of welcomers from the U.S. embassy led by Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson , and the 56 U.S. newsmen who had preceded Nixon by an hour in a record-setting ( 8 hr. 45 min. ) , nonstop flight in a new , long-legged Boeing 707 from New York . The face of the Soviet Union was the familiar grin of <P> Nixon 's opposite number , First - Deputy Premier Frol Kozlov , only ten days back from opening the Soviet Exhibition in Manhattan and his tour of the U.S. ( TIME , <P> July 13 ) . <P> There were handshakes all round , but there was no playing of anthems , no crowd of the kind the U.S.S.R. can muster for a visiting Mongolian . Imperturbably , Nixon read through his short airport speech , drawing extemporaneously on his freshly learned stock of Russian proverbs ( " Better to see once than hear a hundred times " ) . As the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to shake hands with bystanding Russians in the manner that had served him well through Britain , Asia , Latin America and Africa . But the Russians had not the slightest idea who he was . <P> Powerful Personification . Yet within what may be remembered as peacetime diplomacy 's most amazing 24 hours , Vice President Nixon became the most talked about , best-known and most-effective ( if anyone can be effective ) Westerner to invade the U.S.S.R. in years . Officially , he was in Moscow to open the fabulous U.S. National Exhibition in Moscow 's Sokolniki Park . But Nixon did much more : he gave sharp point to the glittering achievement of the fair because-on Communism 's home grounds-he managed in a unique way to personify a national character proud of peaceful accomplishment , sure of its way of life , confident of its power under threat .
