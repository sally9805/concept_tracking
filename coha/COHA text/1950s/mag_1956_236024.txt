The scene is the ruins of Athens , among which a few gods and goddesses still philander alongside the tourists . Orpheus , a hearts-and-flowers fiddler , plots with Pluto to get rid of his wife Eurydice , although she is really very fetching in her tight red pedal pushers . While Pluto and " Eury , " as she is known to her friends , take off for a tryst in hell , trouble develops on Olympus , where an amorous Jupiter is losing the loyalty of his court ( everybody is tired of that endless nectar and ambrosia diet ) ; so he agrees to cheer up the gods by a mass junket to the gayer clime of Hades and , incidentally , to rescue Eurydice . In hell , confusion is confounded by folderol , but finally-with the help of what is probably the fieriest cancan ever written-everyone agrees on a highly satisfactory and immoral solution . <P> So goes Orpheus in the Underworld , Jacques Offenbach 's delightful spoof of Greek mythology , presented in English by the New York City Opera Company last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tilted revolving stage ) is handsome ; the staging is often funny ; and the music is as charming as it was 100 years ago . Under the firm and concise direction of Vienna-born Erich Leinsdorf , 44 , who left the Rochester Philharmonic to become the City Center 's new musical director , the brilliant score is beautifully played . The trouble with Orpheus is its new libretto , which seemed determined to turn this charming opera buffa into a crude opera boffola . <P> The book follows the original 's satiric story line but kills its spirit by relentless pursuit of the obvious gag , the single entendre , the rhyme-at-any-cost ; e.g. , " The air is full of your infidelities , " sings Juno . " No ? The hell it is , " rhymes Jupiter in one of the better couplets . And so it goes , with garter-Sparta , Hades-ladies , loony-Juny ( for Juno ) , until the elegantly frothy music is almost lost between the heavy text and the embarrassed sighs of the audience . Most remarkable fact of all : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a junior-highschool pageant with the vulgarity of a third-rate burlesque skit is Eric ( In Search of Theater ) Bentley , 40 , Brander Matthews Professor of Dramatic Literature at Columbia University and a leading snob-about-the-theater who argues that there must be theaters for the cultured few , so as to save the " intelligent " drama from commercialism . <P> Most of the cast seemed infected by the professor 's indiscretions , overdoing the broadest points , throwing away the few finer ones . Sylvia Stahlman ( Eurydice ) had the prettiest voice , at its best in The Old Time Religion ( " Bacchus my king , O let 's be romantic " ) , and Hiram Sherman ( Jupiter ) hammed his part happily , right down to losing his hula skirt . Musico-medienne Paula Laurence was the most professional of all as Miss P. ( for Public ) Opinion , " a vestal virgin with a bachelor 's degree .
