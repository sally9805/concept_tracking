 --  where the propped-up , imprisoned , decrepit lady herself may be imagined screeching , but not loud enough to drown the rhythmical yaps of the Junk setter walking from group to group  --  from a bunch of neighbors already collected on the sidewalk , near the bit of checked stuff , and back to the car which he had finally run to earth , and then to another group on the lawn , consisting of Leslie , two policemen and a sturdy man with tortoise shell glasses . At this point , I should explain that the prompt appearance of the patrolmen , hardly more than a minute after the accident , was due to their having been ticketingthe illegally parked cars in a cross lane two blocks down the grade ; that the fellow with the glasses was Frederick Beale , Jr. , driver of the Packard ; that his 79-year-old father , whom the nurse had just watered on the green bank where he lay  --  a banked banker so to speak  --  was not in a dead faint , but was comfortably and methodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , finally , that the laprobe on the sidewalk ( where she had so often pointed out to me with disapproval the crooked green cracks ) concealed the mangled remains of Charlotte Humbert who had been knocked down and dragged several feet by the Beale car as she was hurrying across the street to drop three letters in the mailbox , at the corner of Miss Opposite'slawn . These were picked up and handed to me by a pretty child in a dirty pink frock , and I got rid of them by clawing them to fragments in my trouser pocket . Three doctors and the Farlows presently arrived on the scene and took over . The widower , a man of exceptional self-control , neither wept nor raved . He staggered a bit , that he did ; but he opened his mouth only to impart such information or issue such directions as were strictly necessary in connection with the identification , examination and disposal of a dead woman , the top of her head a porridge of bone , brains , bronze hair and blood . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in Dolly 's room by his two friends , gentle John and dewy-eyed Jean ; who , to be near , retired to the Humberts ' bedroom for the night ; which , for all I know , they may not have spent as innocentlyas the solemnity of the occasion required.  |p101I  have no reason to dwell , in this very special memoir , on the pre-funeral formalities that had to be attended to , or on the funeral itself , which was as quiet as the marriage had been . But a few incidents pertaining to those four or five days after Charlotte'ssimple death , have to be noted . My first night of widowhood I was so drunk that I slept as soundly as the child who had slept in that bed . Next morning I hastened to inspect the fragments of letters in my pocket . They had got too thoroughly mixed up to be sorted into three completesets . I assumed that " . . . and you had better find it because I can not buy ... " came from a letter to Lo ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fleeing with Lo to Parkington , or even back to Pisky , lest the vulture snatch her precious lamb . Other tatters and shreds ( never had I thought I had such strong talons ) obviously referred to an application not to St. A. but to another boarding school which was said to be so harsh and gray and gaunt in its methods ( although supplying croquet under the elms ) as to have earned the nicknameof " Reformatory for Young Ladies . " Finally , the third epistle was obviously addressed to me . I made out such items as " . . . after a year of separation we may ... " " ... oh , my dearest , oh my . . . " " . . . worse than if it had been a woman you kept ... " " ... or , maybe , I shall die . . . " But on the whole my gleanings made little sense ; the various fragments of those three hasty missives were as jumbled in the palms of my hands as their elementshad been in poor Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer , and Jean had to feed her dogs , and so I was to be deprived temporarily of my friends ' company . The dear people were afraid I might commit suicide if left alone , and since no other friends were available ( Miss Opposite was incommunicado , the McCoos were busy building a new house miles away , and the Chatfields had been recently called to Maine by some family trouble of their own ) , Leslie and Louise were commissioned to keep me company under the pretense of helping me to sort out and pack a multitude of orphaned things . In a moment of superb inspiration I showed the kind and credulous Farlows ( we were waiting for Leslie top102come for his paid tryst with Louise ) a little photograph of Charlotte I had found among her affairs . From a boulder she smiled through blown hair . It had been taken in April 1934 , a memorable spring . While on a business visit to the States , I had had occasion to spend several months in Pisky . We met  --  and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was engaged to Haze , but after I returned to Europe , we corresponded through a friend , now dead . Jean whispered she had heard some rumors and looked at the snapshot , and , still looking , handed it to John , and John removed his pipe and looked at lovely and fast Charlotte Becker , and handed it back to me . Then they left for a few hours . Happy Louise was gurgling and scolding her swain in the basement . Hardly had the Farlows gone than a blue-chinned cleric called  --  and I tried to make the interview as brief as was consistent with neither hurting his feelings nor arousing his doubts . Yes , I would devote all my life to the child 's welfare . Here , incidentally , was a little cross that Charlotte Becker had given me when we were both young . I had a female cousin , a respectable spinster in New York . There we would find a good private school for Dolly . Oh , what a crafty Humbert ! For the benefit of Leslie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John and Jean I made a tremendously loud and beautifully enacted long-distance call and simulated a conversation with Shirley Holmes . When John and Jean returned , I completely took them in by telling them , in a deliberately wild and confused mutter , that Lo had gone with the intermediate group on a five-day hike and could not be reached . " Good Lord , " said Jean , " what shall we do ? " John said it was perfectly simple  --  he would get the Climax police to find the hikers  --  it would not take them an hour . In fact , he knew the country and " Look , " he continued , " why don ' I drive there right now , and you may sleep with Jean "  --  ( he did not really add that but Jean supported his offer so passionately that it might be implied ) . I broke down . I pleaded with John to let things remain the  |p103way  they were . I said I could not bear to have the child all around me , sobbing , clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react on her future , psychiatrists have analyzed such cases . There was a sudden pause . " Well , you are the doctor , " said John a little bluntly . " But after all I was Charlotte 's friend and adviser . One would like to know what you are going to do about the child anyway . " " John , " cried jean , " she is his child , not Harold Haze 's . Do n't you understand ? Humbert is Dolly 's real father . " " I see , " said John . " I am sorry . Yes , I see . I did not realize that . It simplifies matters , of course . And whatever you feel is right . " The distraught father went on to say he would go and fetch his delicate daughter immediately after the funeral , and would do his best to give her a good time in totally different surroundings , perhaps a trip to New Mexico or California  --  granted , of course , he lived . So artistically did I impersonate the calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the perfect Farlows removed me to their house . They had a good cellar , as cellars go in this country ; and that was helpful , for I feared insomnia and a ghost . Now I must explain my reasons for keeping Dolores away . Naturally , at first , when Charlotte had just been eliminated and I re-entered the house a free father , and gulped down the two whiskey-and-sodas I had prepared , and topped them with a pint or two of my " pin , " and went to the bathroom to get away from neighbors and friends , there was but one thing in my mind and pulse  --  namely , the awareness that a few hours hence , warm , brown-haired , and mine , mine , mine , Lolita would be in my arms , shedding tears that I would kiss away faster than they could well . But as I stood wide-eyed and flushed before the mirror , John Farlow tenderly tapped to inquire if I was okay  --  and I immediately realized it would be madness on my part to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and scheming to take her away from me . Indeed , unpredictableLo herself might  --  who knows ?  --  show some foolishp104distrust of me , a sudden repugnance , vague fear and the like  --  and gone would be the magic prize at the very instant of triumph . Speaking of busybodies , I had another visitor  --  friend Beale , the fellow who eliminated my wife . Stodgy and solemn , looking like a kind of assistant executioner , with his bulldog jowls , small black eyes , thickly rimmed glasses and conspicuous nostrils , he was ushered in by John who then left us , closing the door upon us , with the utmost tact . Suavely saying he had twins in my stepdaughter 's class , my grotesque visitor unrolled a large diagram he had made of the accident . It was , as my stepdaughter would have put it , " a beaut , " with all kinds of impressive arrows and dotted lines in varicolored inks . Mrs. H. H. 's trajectory was illustrated at several points by a series of those little outline figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics as visual aids . Very clearly and conclusively , this route came into contact with a boldly traced sinuous line representing two consecutiveswerves  --  one which the Beale car made to avoid the Junk dog ( dog not shown ) , and the second , a kind of exaggeratedcontinuation of the first , meant to avert the tragedy . A very black cross indicated the spot where the trim little outline figure had at last come to rest on the sidewalk . I looked for some similar mark to denote the place on the embankment where my visitor 's huge wax father had reclined , but there was none . That gentleman , however , had signed the document as a witness underneath the name of Leslie Toinson , Miss Opposite and a few other people . With his hummingbird pencil deftly and delicately flying from one point to another , Frederick demonstrated his absolute innocence and the recklessness of my wife : while he was in the act of avoiding the dog , she had slipped on the freshly watered asphalt and plunged forward whereas she should have flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk of his padded shoulder ) . I said it was certainly not his fault , and the inquest upheld my view . Breathing violently through jet-black tense nostrils , he shook his head and my hand ; then , with an air of perfect savoir vivre and gentlemanly generosity , he offered to pay the funeral-homep105expenses . He expected me to refuse his offer . With a drunken sob of gratitude I accepted it . This took him aback . Slowly , incredulously , he repeated what he had said . I thanked him again , even more profusely than before . In result of that weird interview , the numbness of my soul was for a moment resolved . And no wonder ! I had actually seen the agent of fate . I had palpated the very flesh of fate  --  and its padded shoulder . A brilliant and monstrous mutation had suddenly taken place , and here was the instrument . Within the intricacies of the pattern ( hurrying housewife , slippery pavement , a pest of a dog , steep grade , big car , baboon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vile contribution . Had I not been such a fool  --  or such an intuitive genius  --  to preserve that journal , fluids produced by vindictive anger and hot shame would not have blinded Charlotte in her dash to the mailbox . But even had they blinded her , still nothing might have happened , had not precise fate , that synchronizing phantom , mixed within its alembic the car and the dog and the sun and the shade and the wet and the weak and the strong and the stone . Adieu , Marlene ! Fat fate 's formal handshake ( as reproduced by Beale before leaving the room ) brought me out of my torpor ; and I wept . Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  --  I wept . The elms and the poplars were turning their ruffled backs to a sudden onslaught of wind , and a black thunderhead loomed above Ramsdale 's white church tower when I looked around me for the last time . For unknown adventures I was leaving the livid house where I had rented a room only ten weeks before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . On porches or in the house their rich textures lend modern drama . The house of heaven must seem pretty bare after that . A raindrop fell on my knuckles . I went back into the house for something or other while John was putting myp106bags into the car , and then a funny thing happened . I do not know if in these tragic notes I have sufficiently stressed the peculiar " sending " effect that the writer 's good looks  --  pseudoCeltic , attractively simian , boyishly manly  --  had on women of every age and environment . Of course , such announcements made in the first person may sound ridiculous . But every once in a while I have to remind the reader of my appearance much as a professional novelist , who has given a character of his some mannerism or a dog , has to go on producing that dog or that mannerism every time the character crops up in the course of the book . There may be more to it in the present case . My gloomy good looks should be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be properly understood . Pubescent Lo swooned to Hum bert 's charm as she did to hiccuppy music ; adult Lotte loved me with a mature , possessive passion that I now deplore and respect more than I care to say . Jean Farlow who was thirty-one and absolutely neurotic , had also apparently developed a strong liking for me . She was handsome in a carved-Indian sort of way , with a burnt sienna complexion . Her lips were like large crimson polyps , and when she emitted her special barking laugh , she showed large dull teeth and pale gums . She was very tall , wore either slacks with sandals or billowing skirts with ballet slippers , drank any strong liquor in any amount , had had two miscarriages , wrote stories about animals , painted , as the reader knows , lakescapes , was already nursing the cancer that was to kill her at thirty-three , and was hopelessly unattractiveto me . Judge then of my alarm when a few seconds before left ( she and I stood in the hallway ) Jean , with her always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tears in her bright blue eyes , attempted , unsuccessfully , to glue herself to my lips . " Take care of yourself , " she said , " kiss your daughter for me . " A clap of thunder reverberated throughout the house , and she added : " Perhaps , somewhere , some day , at a less miserable time , we may see each other again " ( Jean , whatever , wherever you are , in  |p107minus  time-space or plus soul-time , forgive me all this , parenthesisincluded ) . And presently I was shaking hands with both of them in the street , the sloping street , and everything was whirling and flying before the approaching white deluge , and a truck with a mattress from Philadelphia was confidently rolling down to an empty house , and dust was running and writhing over the exact slab of stone where Charlotte , when they lifted the laprobe for me , had been revealed , curled up , her eyes intact , their black lashes still wet , matted , like yours , Lolita.  |p107One  might suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited delights before me , I would have mentally sunk back , heaving a sigh of delicious relief . Eh bien , pas du tout ! Instead of basking in the beams of smiling Chance , I was obsessed by all sorts of purely ethical doubts and fears . For instance might it not surprise people that Lo was so consistently debarred from attending festive and funeral functions in her immediate family ? You remember  --  we had not had her at our wedding . Or another thing : granted it was the long hairy arm of Coincidence that had reached out to remove an innocent woman , might Coincidence not ignore in a heathen moment what its twin limb had done and hand Lo a premature note of commiseration ? True , the accident had been reported only by the Ramsdale Journal  --  not by the Parkington Recorder or the Climax Herald , Camp Q. being in another state , and local deaths having no federal news interest ; but I could not help fancying that somehow Dolly Haze had been informed already , and that at the very time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being driven to Ramsdale by friends unknown to me . Still more disquietingthan all these conjectures and worries , was the fact that Humbert Humbert , a brand-new American citizen of obscure European origin , had taken no steps toward becoming the legal guardian of his dead wife 's daughter ( twelve years and sevenp108months old ) . Would I ever dare take those steps ? I could not repress a shiver whenever I imagined my nudity hemmed in by mysterious statutes in the merciless glare of the Common Law . My scheme was a marvel of primitive art : I would whizz over to Camp Q. , tell Lolita her mother was about to undergo a major operation at an invented hospital , and then keep moving with my sleepy nymphet from inn to inn while her mother got better and better and finally died . But as I traveled campward my anxiety grew . I could not bear to think I might not find Lolita there  --  or find , instead , another , scared , Lolita clamoring for some family friend : not the Farlows , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be other people I had not reckoned with ? Finally , I decided to make the long-distance call I had simulated so well a few days before . It was raining hard when I pulled up in a muddy suburb of Parkington , just before the Fork , one prong of which bypassed the city and led to the highway which crossed the hills to Lake Climax and Camp Q. I flipped off the ignition and for quite a minute sat in the car bracing myself for that telephone call , and staring at the rain , at the inundated sidewalk , at a hydrant : a hideous thing , really , painted a thick silver and red , extending the red stumps of its arms to be varnished by the rain which like stylized blood dripped upon its argent chains . No wonder that stopping beside those nightmare cripples is taboo . I drove up to a gasoline station . A surprise awaited me when at last the coins had satisfactorily clanked down and a voice was allowed to answer mine . Holmes , the camp mistress , informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on a hike in the hills with her group and was expected to return rather late today . Would I care to come tomorrow , and what was exactly  --  Without going into details , I said that her mother was hospitalized , that the situation was grave , that the child should not be told it was grave and that she should be ready to leave with me tomorrow afternoon . The two voices parted in an explosion of warmth and good will , and through some freak mechanical flaw all my coins came tumbling back to me with a hitting-the-jackpot clatter that almost made me laugh despite the disappointment at hav/ing to postpone bliss . One wonders if this sudden discharge , this spasmodic refund , was not correlated somehow , in the mind of McFate , with my having invented that little expedition before ever learning of it as I did now . What next ? I proceeded to the business center of Parkington and devoted the whole afternoon ( the weather had cleared , the wet town was like silver-and-glass ) to buying beautiful things for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poignant predilection Humbert had in those days for check weaves , bright cottons , frills , puffed-out short sleeves , soft pleats , snug-fitting bodices and generously full skirts ! Oh Lolita , you are my girl , as Vee was Poe 's and Bea Dante 's , and what little girl would not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties ? Did I have something special in mind ? coaxing voices asked me . Swimming suits ? We have them in all shades . Dream pink , frosted aqua , glans mauve , tulip red , oolala black . What about playsuits ? Slips ? No slips . Lo and I loathed slips . One of my guides in these matters was an anthropometric entry made by her mother on Lo 's twelfth birthday ( the reader remembers that Know-Your-Child book ) . I had the feeling that Charlotte , moved by obscure motives of envy and dislike , had added an inch here , a pound there ; but since the nymphet had no doubt grown somewhat in the last seven months , I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girth , twenty-nine inches ; thigh girth ( just below the gluteal sulcus ) , seventeen ; calf girth and neck circumference , eleven ; chest circumference , twenty-seven ; upper arm girth , eight ; waist , twenty-three ; stature , fifty-seven inches ; weight , seventy-eight pounds ; figure , linear ; intelligence quotient , 121 ; vermiform appendixpresent , thank God . Apart from measurements , I could of course visualize Lolita with hallucinational lucidity ; and nursing as I did a tingle on my breastbone at the exact spot her silky top had come level once or twice with my heart ; and feeling as I did her warm weight in my lap ( so that , in a sense , I was always " with Lolita " as a woman is " with child " ) , I was not surprised to discover later that my computation had been more or less correct . Havingp110moreover studied a midsummer sale book , it was with a very knowing air that I examined various pretty articles , sport shoes , sneakers , pumps of crushed kid for crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these poignant needs of mine turned parental scholarship and precise description into commercialeuphemisms , such as " petite . " Another , much older woman , in a white dress , with a pancake make-up , seemed to be oddly impressed by my knowledge of junior fashions ; perhaps 1 had a midget for mistress ; so , when shown a skirt with two " cute " pockets in front , I intentionally put a naive male question and was rewarded by a smiling demonstration of the way the zipper worked in the back of the skirt . I had next great fun with all kinds of shorts and briefs  --  phantom little Lolitas dancing , falling , daisying all over the counter . We rounded up the deal with some prim cotton pajamas in popular butcher-boy style . Humbert , the popular butcher . There is a touch of the mythological and the enchanted in those large stores where according to ads a career girl can get a complete desk-to-date wardrobe , and where little sister can dream of the day when her wool jersey will make the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic figures of snubbed-nosed children with dun-colored , greenish , browndotted , faunish faces floated around me . I realized I was the only shopper in that rather eerie place where I moved about fishlike , in a glaucous aquarium . I sensed strange thoughts form in the minds of the languid ladies that escorted me from counter to counter , from rock ledge to seaweed , and the belts and the bracelets I chose seemed to fall from siren hands into transparent water . I bought an elegant valise , had my purchases put into it , and repaired to the nearest hotel , well pleased with my day . Somehow , in connection with that quiet poetical afternoon of fastidious shopping , I recalled the hotel or inn with the seductivename of The Enchanted Hunters which Charlotte had happened to mention shortly before my liberation . With the help of a guidebook I located it in the secluded town of Briceland , a four-hour drive from Lo 's camp . I could have telephoned but fearing my voice might go out of control and lapse into coyp111croaks of broken English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with twin beds for the next night . What a comic , clumsy , wavering Prince Charming I was ! How some of my readers will laugh at me when I tell them the trouble I had with the wording of my telegram ! What should I put : Humbert and daughter ? Humberg and small daughter ? Homberg and immature girl ? Homburg and child ? The droll mistake  --  the " g " at the end  --  which eventually came through may have been a telepathic echo of these hesitations of mine . And then , in the velvet of a summer night , my broodings over the philter I had with me ! Oh miserly Hamburg ! Was he not a very Enchanted Hunter as he deliberated with himself over his boxful of magic ammunition ? To rout the monster of insomnia should he try himself one of those amethyst capsules ? There were forty of them , all told  --  forty nights with a frail little sleeper at my throbbing side ; could I rob myself of one such night in order to sleep ? Certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscopic planetarium with its live stardust . Oh , let me be mawkish for the nonce ! I am so tired of being cynical . This daily headache in the opaque air of this tombal jail is disturbing , but I must persevere . Have written more than a hundred pages and not got anywhere yet . My calendar is getting confused . That must have been around August 15 , 1947 . Do n't think I can go on . Heart , head  --  everything . Lolita , Lolita , Lolita , Lolita , Lolita , Lolita , Lolita , Lolita , Lolita . Repeat till the page is full , printer . Still in Parkington . Finally , I did achieve an hour 's slumber -- from which I was aroused by gratuitous and horribly exhausting congress with a small hairy hermaphrodite , a total stranger.  |p112By  then it was six in the morning , and it suddenly occurred to me it might be a good thing to arrive at the camp earlier than I had said . From Parkington I had still a hundred miles to go , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brice land . If I had said I would come for Dolly in the afternoon , it was only because my fancy insisted on merciful night falling as soon as possible upon my impatience . But now I foresaw all kinds of misunderstandings and was all a-jitter lest delay might give her the opportunity of some idle telephone call to Ramsdale . However , when at 9.30 A.M. I attempted to start , I was confronted by a dead battery , and noon was nigh when at last I left Parkington . I reached my destination around half past two ; parked my cal in a pine grove where a green-shirted , redheaded impish lad stood throwing horseshoes in sullen solitude ; was laconically directed by him to an office in a stucco cottage ; in a dying state , had to endure for several minutes the inquisitive commiseration of the camp mistress , a sluttish worn out female with rusty hair . Dolly she said was all packed and ready to go . She knew her mother was sick but not critically . Would Mr. Haze , I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or look at the cabins where the girls live ? Each dedicated to a Disney creature ? Or visit the Lodge ? Or should Charlie be sent over to fetch her ? The girls were just finishing fixing the Dining Room for a dance . ( And perhaps afterwards she would say to somebodyor other : " The poor guy looked like his own ghost . " ) Let me retain for a moment that scene in all its trivial and fateful detail : hag Holmes writing out a receipt , scratching her head , pulling a drawer out of her desk , pouring change into my impatient palm , then neatly spreading a banknote over it with a bright " . . . and five ! " ; photographs of girl-children ; some gaudy moth or butterfly , still alive , safely pinned to the wall ( " nature study " ) ; the framed diploma of the camp 's dietitian ; my tremblinghands ; a card produced by efficient Holmes with a report of Dolly Haze 's behavior for July ( " fair to good ; keen on swimmingand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my poundingheart ... I was standing with my back to the open door , andp113then I felt the blood rush to my head as I heard her respiration and voice behind me . She arrived dragging and bumping her heavy suitcase . " Hi ! " she said , and stood still , looking at me with sly , glad eyes , her soft lips parted in a slightly foolish but wonderfully endearing smile . She was thinner and taller , and for a second it seemed to me her face was less pretty than the mental imprint I had cherished for more than a month : her cheeks looked hollowed and too much lentigo camouflaged her rosy rustic features ; and that first impression ( a very narrow human interval between two tiger heartbeats ) carried the clear implication that all widower Humberthad to do , wanted to do , or would do , was to give this wanlookingthough sun-colored little orphan aux yeux battus ( and even those plumbaceous umbrae under her eyes bore freckles ) a sound education , a healthy and happy girlhood , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if the fates deigned to repay me ) I might find , perhaps , a pretty little mdigdlein for Herr Doktor Humbert alone . But " in a wink , " as the Germans say , the angelic line of conduct was erased , and I overtook my prey ( time moves ahead of our fancies ! ) , and she was my Lolita again  --  in fact , more of my Lolita than ever . I let my hand rest on her warm auburn head and took up her bag . She was all rose and honey , dressed in her brightest gingham , with a pattern of little red apples , and her arms and legs were of a deep golden brown , with scratches like tiny dotted lines of coagulated rubies , and the ribbed cuffs of her white socks were turned down at the remembered level , and because of her childish gait , or because I had memorized her as always wearing heelless shoes , her saddle oxfords looked somehow too large and too high-heeled for her . Good-bye , Camp Q , merry Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the hot car she settled down beside me , slapped a prompt fly on her lovely knee ; then , her mouth working violently on a piece of chewing gum , she rapidly cranked down the window on her side and settled back again . We sped through the striped and speckled forest . " How 's Mother ? " she asked dutifully . I said the doctors did not quite know yet what the troublep114was . Anyway , something abdominal . Abominable ? No , abdominal . We would have to hang around for a while . The hospital was in the country , near the gay town of Lepingville , where a great poet had resided in the early nineteenth century and where we would take in all the shows . She thought it a peachy idea and wondered if we could make Lepingville before nine P.M. " We should be at Briceland by dinner time , " I said , " and tomorrow we 'll visit Lepingville . How was the hike ? Did you have a marvelous time at the camp ? " " Uh-huh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Talk , Lo  --  do n't grunt . Tell me something . " " What thing , Dad ?

When did you fall for my mummy ? " " Some day , Lo , you will understand many emotions and situations , such as for example the harmony , the beauty of spiritual relationship . " " Bah ! " said the cynical nymphet . Shallow lull in the dialogue , filled with some landscape . " Look , Lo , at all those cows on that hillside . " " I think I 'll vomit if I look at a cow again . " " You know , I missed you terribly , Lo . " " I did not . Fact I 've been revoltingly unfaithful to you , but itdoes not matter one bit , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much faster than my mummy , mister . " I slowed down from a blind seventy to a purblind fifty . " Why do you think I have ceased caring for you , Lo ? " " Well , you have n't kissed me yet , have you ? " Inly dying , inly moaning , I glimpsed a reasonably wide shoulderof road ahead , and bumped and wobbled into the weeds . Remember she is only a child , remember she is onlyHardly had the car come to a standstill than Lolita positivelyp115flowed into my arms . Not daring , not daring let myself go  --  not even daring let myself realize that this ( sweet wetness and tremblingfire ) was the beginning of the ineffable life which , ably assisted by fate , I had finally willed into being  --  not daring really kiss her , I touched her hot , opening lips with the utmost piety , tiny sips , nothing salacious ; but she , with an impatient wriggle , pressed her mouth to mine so hard that I felt her big front teeth and shared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , it was but an innocent game on her part , a bit of backfischfoolery in imitation of some simulacrum of fake romance , and since ( as the psychotherapist , as well as the rapist , will tell you ) the limits and rules of such girlish games are fluid , or at least too childishly subtle for the senior partner to grasp  --  I was dreadfully afraid I might go too far and cause her to start back in revulsion and terror . And , as above all I was agonizingly anxious to smuggle her into the hermetic seclusion of The EnchantedHunters , and we had still eighty miles to go , blessed intuition broke our embrace  --  a split second before a highway patrol car drew up alongside . Florid and beetlebrowed , its driver stared at me : " Happen to see a blue sedan , same make as yours , pass you before the junction ? " " Why , no . " " We did n't , " said Lo , eagerly leaning across me , her innocent hand on my legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " The cop ( what shadow of us was he after ? ) gave the little colleen his best smile and went into a U-turn .

" Juvenile delickwent , but frank and fetching . That light was red . I 've never seen such driving . "  |p116We  rolled silently through a silent townlet .

" " Well  --  I joined in all the activities that were offered . " " Ensuite ? " " Ansooit , I was taught to live happily and richly with others and to develop a wholesome personality . Be a cake , in fact . " " Yes . I saw something of the sort in the booklet .

Anything else ? " " The Girl Scout 's motto , " said Lo rhapsodically , " is also mine . I fill my life with worthwhile deeds such as  --  well , never mind what . My duty is  --  to be useful . I am a friend to male animals . I obey orders . I am cheerful . That was another police car . I am thrifty and I am absolutely filthy in thought , word and deed . " " Now I do hope that 's all , you witty child . " " Yep . That 's all . No  --  wait a sec . We baked in a reflector oven . Is n't that terrific ? " " Well , that 's better .

" " If we sit in the dark and you let me whisper , I will . Do you sleep in your old room or in a heap with Mother ? " " Old room . Your mother may have to undergo a very serious operation , Lo . " " Stop at that candy bar , will you , " said Lo . Sitting on a high stool , a band of sunlight crossing her bare brown forearm , Lolita was served an elaborate ice-cream concoctiontopped with synthetic syrup . It was erected and brought her by a pimply brute of a boy in a greasy bow-tie who eyed my fragile child in her thin cotton frock with carnal deliberation . My impatience to reach Briceland and The Enchanted Hunters was becoming more than I could endure . Fortunately she dispatchedthe stuff with her usual alacrity . " How much cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cent , " she said sadly , lifting her eyebrows , showing me the empty inside of her money purse . " This is a matter that will be mended in due time , " I rejoined archly . " Are you coming ? " " Say , I wonder if they have a washroom . " " You are not going there , " I said firmly . " It is sure to be a vile place . Do come on . " She was on the whole an obedient little girl and I kissed her in the neck when we got back into the car . " Do n't do that , " she said looking at me with unfeigned surprise . " Do n't drool on me . You dirty man . " She rubbed the spot against her raised shoulder . " Sorry , " I murmured . " I 'm rather fond of you , that 's all . " We drove under a gloomy sky , up a winding road , then down again . " Well , I 'm also sort of fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , with a sort of sigh , and sort of settled closer to me . ( Oh , my Lolita , we shall never get there ! ) Dusk was beginning to saturate pretty little Briceland , itsp118phony colonial architecture , curiosity shops and imported shade trees , when we drove through the weakly lighted streets in search of the Enchanted Hunters . The air , despite a steady drizzle beading it , was warm and green , and a queue of people , mainly children and old men , had already formed before the box office of a movie house , dripping with jewel-fires . " Oh , I want to see that picture . Let 's go right after dinner . Oh , let 's ! " " We might , " chanted Humbert  --  knowing perfectly well , the sly tumescent devil , that by nine , when his show began , she would be dead in his arms . " Easy ! " cried Lo , lurching forward , as an accursed truck in front of us , its backside carbuncles pulsating , stopped at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , immediately , miraculously , in the very next block , I felt I would lose all control over the Ilaze jalopy with its ineffectual wipers and whimsical brakes ; but the passers-by I applied to for directions were either strangers themselves or asked with a frown " Enchanted what ? " as if I were a madman ; or else they went into such complicated explanations , with geometrical gestures , geographical generalities and strictly local clues ( ... then bear south after you hit the courthouse ... ) that I could not help losing my way in the maze of their well-meaning gibberish . Lo , whose lovely prismatic entrails had already digested the sweetmeat , was looking forward to a big meal and had begun to fidget . As to me , although I had long become used to a kind of secondary fate ( McFate 's inept secretary , so to speak ) pettily interfering with the boss 's generous magnificent plan  --  to grind and grope through the avenues of Briceland was perhaps the most exasperating ordeal I had yet faced . In later months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyish way in which I had concentrated upon that particular inn with its fancy name ; for all along our route countless motor courts proclaimed their vacancy in neon lights , ready to accommodate salesmen , escaped convicts , impotent , , family groups , as well as the most corrupt and vigorous couples . Ah , gentle drivers gliding through summer 's blackP119nights , what frolics , what twists of lust , you might see from your impeccable highways if Kumfy Kabins were suddenly drained of their pigments and became as transparent as boxes of glass ! The miracle I hankered for did happen after all . A man and a girl , more or less conjoined in a dark car under dripping trees , told us we were in the heart of The Park , but had only to turn left at the next traffic light and there we would be . We did not see any next traffic light  --  in fact , The Park was as black as the sins it concealed  --  but soon after falling under the smooth spell of a nicely graded curve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist , then a gleam of lakewater appeared  --  and there it was , marvelously and inexorably , under spectral trees , at the top of a graveled drive  --  the pale palace of The EnchantedHunters . A row of parked cars , like pigs at a trough , seemed at first sight to forbid access ; but then , by magic , a formidable convertible , resplendent , rubous in the lighted rain , came into motion  --  wasenergetically backed out by a broad-shouldered driver  --  and we gratefully slipped into the gap it had left . I immediately regretted my haste for I noticed that my predecessor had now taken advantage of a garage-like shelter nearby where there was ample space for another car ; but I was too impatient to follow his example . " Wow ! Looks swank , " remarked my vulgar darling squinting at the stucco as she crept out into the audible drizzle and with a childish hand tweaked loose the frock-fold that had stuck in the peach-cleft  --  to quote Robert Browning . Under the arclights enlarged replicas of chestnut leaves plunged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hunchbacked and hoary Negro in a uniform of sorts took our bags and wheeled them slowly into the lobby . It was full of old ladies and clergymen . Lolita sank down on her haunches to caress a pale-faced , blue-freckled , black-eared cocker spaniel swooning on the floral carpet under her hand  --  as who would not , my heart  --  while I cleared my throat through the throng to the desk . There a bald porcine old man  --  everybody was old in that old hotel  --  examinedp120my features with a polite smile , then leisurely produced my ( garbled ) telegram , wrestled with some dark doubts , turned his head to look at the clock , and finally said he was very sorry , he had held the room with the twin beds till half past six , and now it was gone . A religious convention , he said , had clashed with a flower show in Briceland , and  --  " The name , " I said coldly , " is not Humberg and not Humbug , but Herbert , I mean Humbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cot for my little daughter . She is ten and very tired . " The pink old fellow peered good-naturedly at Lo  --  still squatting , listening in profile , lips parted , to what the dog 's mistress , an ancient lady swathed in violet veils , was telling her from the depths of a cretonne easy chair . Whatever doubts the obscene fellow had , they were dispelled by that blossom-like vision . He said , he might still have a room , had one , in fact  --  with a double bed . As to the cot " Mr. Potts , do we have any cots left ? " Potts , also pink and bald , with white hairs growing out of his ears and other holes , would see what could be done . He came and spoke while I unscrewedmy fountain pen . Impatient Humbert ! " Our double beds are really triple , " Potts cozily said tucking me and my kid in . " One crowded night we had three ladies and a child like yours sleep together . I believe one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  would there be a spare cot in 49 , Mr. Swine ? " " I think it went to the Swoons , " said Swine , the initial old clown . " We 'll manage somehow , " I said . " My wife may join us later  --  but even then , I suppose , we 'll manage . " The two pink pigs were now among my best friends . In the slow clear hand of crime I wrote : Dr. Edgar H. Humbert and daughter , 342 Lawn Street , Ramsdale . A key ( 342 ! ) was half shown to me ( magician showing object he is about to palm )  --  and handed over to Uncle Tom . Lo , leaving the dog as she would leave me some day , rose from her haunches ; a raindrop fell on Charlotte 's grave ; a handsome young Negress slipped open thep121elevator door , and the doomed child went in followed by her throat-clearing father and crayfish Tom with the bags . Parody of a hotel corridor . Parody of silence and death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful Lo . There was a double bed , a mirror , a double bed in the mirror , a closet door with mirror , a bathroom door ditto , a blue-dark window , a reflected bed there , the same in the closet mirror , two chairs , a glass-topped table , two bedtables , a double bed : a big panel bed , to be exact , with a Tuscan rose chenille spread , and two frilled , pink-shaded night lamps , left and right . I was tempted to place a five-dollar bill in that sepia palm , but thought the largesse might be misconstrued , so I placed a quarter . Added another . He withdrew . Click . En fin seals . " Are we to sleep in one room ? " said Lo , her features working in that dynamic way they did  --  not cross or disgusted ( though plain on the brink of it ) but just dynamic  --  when she wanted to load a question with violent significance . " I 've asked them to put in a cot . Which I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lo . " Why , my darling ? " " Because , my dahrling , when dahrling Mother finds out she 'll divorce you and strangle me . " Just dynamic . Not really taking the matter too seriously . " Now look here , " I said , sitting down , while she stood , a few feet from me , and stared at herself contentedly , not unpleasantly surprised at her own appearance , filling with her own rosy sunshinethe surprised and pleased closet-door mirror . " Look here , Lo . Let 's settle this once for all . For all practical purposes I am your father . I have a feeling of great tenderness for you . In your mother 's absence I am responsible for your welfare . We are not rich , and while we travel , we shall be obliged  --  we shall be thrown a good deal together . Two people sharing one room , inevitably enter into a kind  --  how shall I say  --  a kind  --  " " The word is incest , " said Lo  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young golden giggle , opened the adjoiningdoor , and after carefully peering inside with her strangep122smoky eyes lest she make another mistake , retired to the bathroom . I opened the window , tore off my sweat-drenched shirt , changed , checked the pill vial in my coat pocket , unlocked theShe drifted out . I tried to embrace her : casually , a bit of controlledtenderness before dinner . She said : " Look , let 's cut out the kissing game and get something to eat . " It was then that I sprang my surprise . Oh , what a dreamy pet ! She walked up to the open suitcase as if stalking it from afar , at a kind of slow-motion walk , peering at that distant treasure box on the luggage support . ( Was there something wrong , I wondered , with those great gray eyes of hers , or were we both plunged in the same enchanted mist ? ) She stepped up to it , lifting her rather high-heeled feet rather high , and bending her beautiful boy-knees while she walked through dilating space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flight dream . Then she raised by the armlets a copper-colored , charming and quite expensive vest , very slowly stretching it between her silent hands as if she were a bemused bird-hunter holding his breath over the incredible bird he spreads out by the tips of its flaming wings . Then ( while I stood waiting for her ) she pulled out the slow snake of a brilliant belt and tried it on . Then she crept into my waiting arms , radiant , relaxed , caressingme with her tender , mysterious , impure , indifferent , twilight eyes  --  for all the world , like the cheapest of cheap cuties . For that is what nymphets imitate  --  while we moan and die . " What 's the katter with misses ? " I muttered ( word-control gone ) into her hair . " If you must know , " she said , " you do it the wrong way . " " Show , wight ray . " " All in good time , " responded the spoonerette . Seva ascendes , pulsata , brulans , kitzelans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in corridoro . Hanc nisi mors mihi adimet nemo ! Juncea puellula , ; o pensavo fondissime , nobserva nihil quidquam ; but , of course , in another mo/ment I might have committed some dreadful blunder ; fortunately , she returned to the treasure box . From the bathroom , where it took me quite a time to shift back into normal gear for a humdrum purpose , I heard , standing , drumming , retaining my breath , my Lolita 's " oo 's " and " gee 's " of girlish delight . She had used the soap only because it was sample soap . " ' Well , come on , my dear , if you are as hungry as I am . " And so to the elevator , daughter swinging her old white purse , father walking in front ( notabene : never behind , she is not a lady ) . As we stood ( now side by side ) waiting to be taken down , she threw back her head , yawned without restraint and shook her curls . " When did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half-past  --  " she stifled another yawn  --  " six "  --  yawn in full with a shiver of all her frame . " Half-past , " she repeated , her throat filling up again . The dining room met us with a smell of fried fat and a faded smile . It was a spacious and pretentious place with maudlin murals depicting enchanted hunters in various postures and states of enchantment amid a medley of pallid animals , dryads and trees . A few scattered old ladies , two clergymen , and a man in a sports coat were finishing their meals in silence . The dining room closed at nine , and the green-clad , poker-faced serving girls were , happily , in a desperate hurry to get rid of us . " Does not he look exactly , but exactly , like guilty ? " said Lo in a soft voice , her sharp brown elbow not pointing , but visibly burning to point , at the lone diner in the loud checks , in the far corner of the room . " Like our fat Ramsdale dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just taken , and put down her dancing glass . " Course not , " she said with a splutter of mirth . " I meant the writer fellow in the Drorns ad . " Oh , Fame ! Oh , Femina ! When the dessert was plunked down  --  a huge wedge of cherry pie for the young lady and vanilla ice cream for her protector ,  |p124most  of which she expeditiously added to her pie  --  I produced a small vial containing Papa 's Purple Pills . As I look back at those seasick murals , at that strange and monstrous moment , I can only explain my behavior then by the mechanism of that dream vacuum wherein revolves a deranged mind ; but at the time , it all seemed quite simple and inevitable to me . I glanced around , satisfied myself that the last diner had left , removed the stopper , and with the utmost deliberation tipped the philter into my palm . I had carefully rehearsed before a mirror the gesture of clapping my empty hand to my open month and swallowing a ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the vial with its plump , beautifully colored capsules loaded with Beauty 's Sleep . " Blue ! " she exclaimed . " Violet blue . What are they made of ? " " Summer skies , " I said , " and plums and figs , and the grapebloodof emperors . " " No , seriously  --  please . " " Oh , just Purpills . Vitamin X. Makes one strong as an ox or an ax . Want to try one ? " Lolita stretched out her hand , nodding vigorously . I had hoped the drug would work fast . It certainly did . She had had a long long day , she had gone rowing in the morning with Barbara whose sister was Waterfront Director , as the adorableaccessible nymphet now started to tell me in between suppressedpalate-humping yawns , growing in volume  --  oh , how fast the magic potion worked !  --  and had been active in other ways too . The movie that had vaguely loomed in her mind was , of course , by the time we watertreaded out of the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she leaned against me , faintly smiling  --  would n't you like me to tell you ?  --  half closing her dark-lidded eyes . " Sleepy , huh ? " said Uncle Tom who was bringing up the quiet Franco-Irish gentleman and his daughter as well as two withered women , experts in roses . They looked with sympathy at my frail , tanned , tottering , dazed rosedarling . I had almost to carry her into our room . There , she sat down on the edge of the bed , swaying a little , speaking in dove-dull , long-drawn tones.  | " If I tell you  --  if I tell you , will you promise sleepy , so sleepy  --  head lolling , eyes going out , promise you wo n't make com-plaints ? " " Later , Lo . Now go to bed . I 'll leave you here , and you go to bed . Give you ten minutes . " " Oh , I 've been such a disgusting girl , " she went on , shaking her hair , removing with slow fingers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomorrow , Lo . Go to bed , go to bed  --  for goodness sake , to bed . " I pocketed the key and walked downstairs . Gentlewomen of the jury ! Bear with me ! Allow me to take just a tiny bit of your precious time ! So this was le grand moment . I had left my Lolita still sitting on the edge of the abysmal bed , drowsily raising her foot , fumbling at the shoelaces and showing as she did so the nether side of her thigh up to the crotch of her panties  --  she had always been singularly absentminded , or shameless , or both , in matters of legshow . This , then , was the hermetic vision of her which I had locked in  --  after satisfying myself that the door carried no inside bolt . The key , with its numbered dangler of carved wood , became forthwith the weighty sesame to a rapturous and formidable future . It was mine , it was part of my hot hairy fist . In a few minutes  --  say , twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustave used to say  --  I would let myself into that " 342 " and find my nymphet , my beauty and bride , emprisoned in her crystal sleep . Jurors ! If my happiness could have talked , it would have filled that genteel hotel with a deafening roar . And my only regret today is that I did not quietly deposit key " 342 " at the office , and leave the town , the country , the continent , the hemisphere ,  --  indeed , the globe  --  that very same night . Let me explain . I was not unduly disturbed by her self-ac/cusatory innuendoes . I was still firmly resolved to pursue my policy of sparing her purity by operating only in the stealth of night , only upon a completely anesthetized little nude . Restraint and reverence were still my motto  --  even if that " purity " ( incidentally , thoroughly debunked by modem science ) had been slightly damaged through some juvenile erotic experience , no doubt homosexual , at that accursed camp of hers . Of course , in my old-fashioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted , when I first met her , that she was as unravishedas the stereotypical notion of " normal child " had been since the lamented end of the Ancient World B.C. and its fascinatingpractices . We are not surrounded in our enlighted era by little slave flowers that can be casually plucked between business and bath as they used to be in the days of the Romans ; and we do not , as dignified Orientals did in still more luxurious times , use tiny entertainers fore and aft between the mutton and the rose sherbet . The whole point is that the old link between the adult world and the child world has been completely severed nowadays by new customs and new laws . Despite my having dabbled in psychiatry and social work , I really knew very little about children . After all , Lolita was only twelve , and no matter what concessions I made to time and place  --  even bearingin mind the crude behavior of American schoolchildren  --  I still was under the impression that whatever went on among those brash brats , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . Therefore ( to retrieve the thread of this explanation ) the moralist in me by-passed the issue by clinging to conventional notions of what twelve-year-old girls should be . The child therapistin me ( a fake , as most of them are  --  but no matter ) regurgitatedneo-Freudian hash and conjured up a dreaming and exaggerating Dolly in the " latency " period of girlhood . Finally , the sensualist in me ( a great and insane monster ) had no objection to some depravity in his prey . But somewhere behind the raging bliss , bewildered shadows conferred  --  and not to have heeded them , this is what I regret ! Human beings , attend ! I should have understood that Lolita had already proved to be something quite different from innocent Annabel , and that thep127nymphean evil breathing through every pore of the fey child that I had prepared for my secret delectation , would make the secrecy impossible , and the delectation lethal . I should have known ( by the signs made to me by something in Lolita  --  the real child Lolita or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horror would result from the expected rapture . Oh , winged gentlemen of the jury ! And she was mine , she was mine , the key was in my fist , my fist was in my pocket , she was mine . In the course of the evocationsand schemes to which I had dedicated so many insomnias , I had gradually eliminated all the superfluous blur , and by stackinglevel upon level of translucent vision , had evolved a final picture . Naked , except for one sock and her charm bracelet , spread-eagled on the bed where my philter had felled her  --  so I foreglimpsed her ; a velvet hair ribbon was still clutched in her hand ; her honey-brown body , with the white negative image of a rudimentary swimsuit patterned against her tan , presented to me its pale breastbuds ; in the rosy lamplight , a little pubic floss glistened on its plump hillock . The cold key with its warm wooden addendum was in my pocket . I wandered through various public rooms , glory below , gloom above : for the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure  --  even when the velvety victim is locked up in one 's dungeon  --  that some rival devil or influential god may still not abolish one 's prepared triumph . In common parlance , I needed a drink ; but there was no barroom in that venerable place full of perspiringphilistines and period objects . I drifted to the Men 's Room . There , a person in clerical black  --  a " hearty party " comme on dit  --  checking with the assistance of Vienna , if it was still there , inquired of me how I had liked Dr. Boyd 's talk , and looked puzzled when I ( King Sigmund the Second ) said Boyd was quite a boy . Upon which , I neatly chucked the tissue paper I had been wiping my sensitive finger tips with into the receptacle provided for it , and sallied lobbyward . Comfortably resting my elbows on the counter , I asked Mr. Potts was he quite sure my wife had not telephoned , and what about that cot ? He answered she had not ( she was dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we decided to stay on . From a big crowded place called The Hunters ' Hall came a sound of many voices discussing horticulture or eternity . Another room , called The Raspberry Room , all bathed in light , with bright little tables and a large one with " refreshments , " was still empty except for a hostess ( that type of worn woman with a glassy smile and Charlotte 's manner of speaking ) ; she floated up to me to ask if I was Mr. Braddock , because if so , Miss Beard had been looking for me . " What a name for a woman , " I said and strolled away . In and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood . I would give her till half-past-nine . Going back to the lobby , I found there a change : a number of people in floral dresses or black cloth had formed little groups here and there , and some elfish chance offered me the sight of a delightful child of Lolita 's age , in Lolita 's type of frock , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black hair . She was not pretty , but she was a nymphet , and her ivory pale legs and lily neck formed for one memorable moment a most pleasurable antiphony ( in terms of spinal music ) to my desire for Lolita , brown and pink , flushed and fouled . The pale child noticed my gaze ( which was really quite casual and debonair ) , and being ridiculously self-conscious , lost countenance completely , rolling her eyes and putting the back of her hand to her cheek , and pulling at the hem of her skirt , and finally turning her thin mobile shoulder blades to me in specious chat with her cow-like mother . I left the loud lobby and stood outside , on the white steps , looking at the hundreds of powdered bugs wheeling around the lamps in the soggy black night , full of ripple and stir . All I would do  --  all I would dare to do  --  would amount to such a trifle .. . Suddenly I was aware that in the darkness next to me there was somebody sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really see him but what gave him away was the rasp of a screwing off , then a discreet gurgle , then the final note of a placid screwingon . I was about to move away when his voice addressed me :  | " Where the devil did you get her ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " I said : the weather is getting better . " " Seems so . " " Who 's the lassie ? " " My daughter . " " You lie  --  she 's not . " " I beg your pardon ? " " I said : July was hot . Where 's her mother ? " " Dead . " " I see . Sorry . By the way , why do n't you two lunch with me tomorrow . That dreadful crowd will be gone by then . " " We 'll be gone too . Good night . " " Sorry . I 'm pretty drunk . Good night . That child of yours needs a lot of sleep . Sleep is a rose , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He struck a light , but because he was drunk , or because the wind was , the flame illumined not him but another person , a very old man , one of those permanent guests of old hotels  --  and his white rocker . Nobody said anything and the darkness returned to its initial place . Then I heard the old-timer cough and deliver himself of some sepulchral mucus . I left the porch . At least half an hour in all had elapsed . I ought to have asked for a sip . The strain was beginning to tell . If a violin string can ache , then I was that string . But it would have been unseemly to display any hurry . As I made my way through a constellation of fixed people in one corner of the lobby , there came a blinding flash  --  and beaming Dr. Braddock , two orchid-ornamentalized matrons , the small girl in white , and presumably the bared teeth of Humbert Humbert sidling between the bridelike lassie and the enchanted cleric , were im mortalized  --  insofar as the texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A twittering group had gathered near the elevator . I again chose the stairs . 342 was near the fire escape . One could still  --  but the key was already in the lock , and then I was in the room.  |p130The  door of the lighted bathroom stood ajar ; in addition to that , a skeleton glow came through the Venetian blind from the outside arclights ; these intercrossed rays penetrated the darkness of the bedroom and revealed the following situation . Clothed in one of her old nightgowns , my Lolita lay on her side with her back to me , in the middle of the bed . Her lightly veiled body and bare limbs formed a Z. She had put both pillows under her dark tousled head ; a band of pale light crossed her top vertebrae . I seemed to have shed my clothes and slipped into pajamas with the kind of fantastic instantaneousness which is implied when in a cinematographic scene the process of changing is cut ; and I had already placed my knee on the edge of the bed when Lolita turned her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was something the intruder had not expected . The whole pill-spiel ( a rather sordid affair , entre nous soit dit ) had had for object a fastness of sleep that a whole regiment would not have disturbed , and here she was staring at me , and thickly calling me " Barbara . " Barbara , wearing my pajamas which were much too tight for her , remained poised motionless over the little sleep-talker . Softly , with a hopeless sigh , Dolly turned away , resuming her initial position . For at least two minutes I waited and strained on the brink , like that tailor with his homemade parachute forty years ago when about to jump from the Eiffel Tower . Her faint breathing had the rhythm of sleep . Finally I heaved myself onto my narrow margin of bed , stealthily pulled at the odds and ends of sheets piled up to the south of my stonecoldheels  --  and Lolita lifted her head and gaped at me . As I learned later from a helpful pharmaceutist , the purple pill did not even belong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have induced sleep in a neurotic who believed it to be a potent drug , it was too mild a sedative to affect for any length of time a wary , albeit weary , nymphet . Whether the Ramsdale doctor was a charlatan or a shrewd oldp131rogue , does not , and did not , really matter . What mattered , was that I had been deceived . When Lolita opened her eyes again , I realized that whether or not the drug might work later in the night , the security I had relied upon was a sham , one . Slowly her head turned away and dropped onto her unfair amount of pillow . I lay quite still on my brink , peering at her rumpled hair , at the glimmer of nymphet flesh , where half a haunch and half a shoulder dimly showed , and trying to gauge the depth of her sleep by the rate of her respiration . Some time passed , nothing changed , and I decided I might risk getting a little closer to that lovely and maddening glimmer ; but hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspended , and I had the odious feeling that little Dolores was wide awake and would explode in screams if I touched her with any part of my wretchedness . Please , reader : no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted , morbidly sensitive , infinitely circumspect hero of my book , do not skip these essential pages ! Imagine me ; I shall not exist if you do not imagine me ; try to discern the doe in me , trembling in the forest of my own iniquity ; let 's even smile a little . After all , there is no harm in smiling . For instance ( I almost wrote " frinstance " ) , I had no place to rest my head , and a fit of heartburn ( they call those fries " French , " grand Dieu ! ) was added to my discomfort . She was again fast asleep , my nymphet , but still I did not dare to launch upon my enchanted voyage . La Petite Dormeuse ou l'Amant Ridicule . Tomorrow I would stuff her with those earlier pills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment  --  or in the Gladstone bag ? Should I wait a solid hour and then creep up again ? The science of nympholepsy is a precise science . Actual contact would do it in one second flat . An interspace of a millimeter would do it in ten . Let us wait . There is nothing louder than an American hotel ; and , mind you , this was supposed to be a quiet , cozy , old-fashioned , homey place  --  " gracious living " and all that stuff . The clatter of the elevator 's gate  --  some twenty yards northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside my left temple  --  alternatedp132with the banging and booming of the machine 's various evolutionsand lasted well beyond midnight . Every now and then , immediately east of my left ear ( always assuming I lay on my back , not daring to direct my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bed-mate ) , the corridor would brim with cheerful , resonant and inept exclamations ending in a volley of good-nights . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took over . It was a manly , energetic , deepthroatedtoilet , and it was used many times . Its gurgle and gush and long afterflow shook the wall behind me . Then someone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick , almost coughing out his life with his liquor , and his toilet descended like a veritable Niagara , immediately beyond our bathroom . And when finally all the waterfalls had stopped , and the enchanted hunterswere sound asleep , the avenue under the window of my insomnia , to the west of my wake  --  a staid , eminently residential . dignified alley of huge trees  --  degenerated into the despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night . And less than six inches from me and my burning life , was nebulous Lolita ! After a long stirless vigil , my tentacles moved towards her again , and this time the creak of the mattress did not awake her . I managed to bring my ravenous bulk so close to her that I felt the aura of her bare shoulder like a warm breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gasped , muttered with insane rapidity something about boats , tugged at the sheets and lapsed back into her rich , dark , young unconsciousness . As she tossed , within that abundant flow of sleep , recently auburn , at present lunar , her arm struck me across the face . For a second I held her . She freed herself from the shadow of my embrace  --  doing this not consciously , not violently , not with any personal distaste , but with the neutral plaintive murmur of a child demandingits natural rest . And again the situation remained the same : Lolita with her curved spine to Humbert , Humbert resting his head on his hand and burning with desire and dyspepsia . The latter necessitated a trip to the bathroom for a draft of water which is the best medicine I know in my case , except perhaps milk with radishes ; and when I re-entered the strangep133pale-striped fastness where Lolita 's old and new clothes reclined in various attitudes of enchantment on pieces of furniture that seemed vaguely afloat , my impossible daughter sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took the resilient and cold paper cup in her shadowy hand and gulped down its contentsgratefully , her long eyelashes pointing cupward , and then , with an infantile gesture that carried more charm than any carnal caress , little Lolita wiped her lips against my shoulder . She fell back on her pillow ( I had subtracted mine while she drank ) and was instantly asleep again . I had not dared offer her a second helping of the drug , and had not abandoned hope that the first might still consolidate her sleep . I started to move toward her , ready for any disappointment , knowing I had better wait but incapable of waiting . My pillow smelled of her hair . I moved toward my glimmering darling , stopping or retreating every time I thought she stirred or was about to stir . A breeze from wonderland had begun to affect my thoughts , and now they seemed couched in italics , as if the surface reflecting them were wrinkled by the phantasm of that breeze . Time and again my consciousness folded the wrong way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled out again , and once or twice I caught myself drifting into a melancholy snore . Mists of tenderness enfolded mountains of longing . Now and then it seemed to me that the enchantedprey was about to meet halfway the enchanted hunter , that her haunch was working its way toward me under the soft sand of a remote and fabulous beach ; and then her dimpled dimness would stir , and I would know she was farther away from me than ever . If I dwell at some length on the tremors and gropings of that distant night , it is because I insist upon proving that I am not , and never was , and never could have been , a brutal scoundrel . The gentle and dreamy regions through which I crept were the patrimonies of poets  --  not crime 's prowling ground . Had I reached my goal , my ecstasy would have been all softness , a case of internal combustion of which she would hardly have felt the heat , even if she were wide awake . But I still hoped shep134might gradually be engulfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste more than a glimmer of her . And so , in between tentative approximations , with a confusion of perceptionmetamorphosing her into eyespots of moonlight or a fluffy flowering bush , I would dream I regained consciousness , dream I lay in wait . In the first antemeridian hours there was a lull in the restless hotel night . Then around four the corridor toilet cascaded and its door banged . A little after five a reverberating monologue began to arrive , in several installments , from some courtyard or parking place . It was not really a monologue , since the speaker stopped every few seconds to listen ( presumably ) to another fellow , but that other voice did not reach me , and so no real meaning could be derived from the part heard . Its matter-of-fact intonations , however , helped to bring in the dawn , and the room was already suffused with lilac gray , when several industrioustoilets went to work , one after the other , and the clatteringand whining elevator began to rise and take down early risers and downers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mermaid in a greenish tank , and somewhere in the passage Dr. Boyd said " Good morning to you " in a fruity voice , and birds were busy in the trees , and then Lolita yawned . Frigid gentlewomen of the jury ! I had thought that months , perhaps years , would elapse before I dared to reveal myself to Dolores Haze ; but by six she was wide awake , and by six fifteen we were technically lovers . I am going to tell you something very strange : it was she who seduced me . Upon hearing her first morning yawn , I feigned handsome profiled sleep . I just did not know what to do . Would she be shocked at finding me by her side , and not in some spare bed ? Would she collect her clothes and lock herself up in the bathroom ? Would she demand to be taken at once to Ramsdal.etoher mother 's bedside  --  back to camp ? But my Lo was a sportive lassie . I felt her eyes on me , and when she uttered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes had been laughing . She rolled over to my side , and her warm brownp135hair came against my collarbone . I gave a mediocre imitation of waking up . We lay quietly . I gently caressed her hair , and we gently kissed . Her kiss , to my delirious embarrassment , had some rather comical refinements of flutter and probe which made me conclude she had been coached at an early age by a little Lesbian . No Charlie boy could have taught her that . As if to see whether I had my fill and learned the lesson , she drew away and surveyed me . Her cheekbones were flushed , her full underlip glistened , my dissolution was near . All at once , with a burst of rough glee ( the sign of the nymphet ! ) , she put her mouth to my ear  --  but for quite a while my mind could not separate into words the hot thunder of her whisper , and she laughed , and brushed the hair off her face , and tried again , and gradually the odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream world , where everything was permissible , came over me as I realized what she was suggesting . I answered I did not know what game she and Charlie had played . " You mean you have never  --  ? "  --  her features twisted into a stare of disgusted incredulity . " You have never  --  " she started again . I took time out by nuzzling her a little . " Lay off , will you , " she said with a twangy whine , hastily removing her brown shoulder from my lips . ( It was very curious the way she considered  --  and kept doing so for a long time  --  all caresses except kisses on the mouth or the stark act of love either " romantic slosh " or " abnormal " . ) " You mean , " she persisted , now kneeling above me , " you never did it when you were a kid ? " " Never , " I answered griite truthfully . " Okay , " said Lolita , " here is where we start . " However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of Lolita 's presumption . Suffice it to say that not a trace of modesty did I perceive in this beautiful hardly formed young girl whom modern co-education , juvenile mores , the campfire racket and so forth had utterly and hopelessly depraved . She saw the stark act merely as part of a youngster 's furtive world , unknown to adults . What adults did for purposes of procreation was no business of hers . My life was handled by little Lo in anp136energetic , matter-of-fact manner as if it were an insensate gadget unconnected with me . While eager to impress me with the world of tough kids , she was not quite prepared for certain discrepancies between a kid 's life and mine . Pride alone preventedher from giving up ; for , in my strange predicament , I feigned supreme stupidity and had her have her way  --  at : least while I could still bear it . But really these are irrelevant matters ; I am not concerned with so-called " sex " at all . Anybody can imagine those elements of animality . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the perilous magic of nymphets . I have to tread carefully . I have to speak in a whisper . Oh you , veteran crime reporter , you grave old usher , you once popular policeman , now in solitary confinement after gracing that school crossing for years , you wretched emeritus read to by a boy ! It would never do , would it , to have you fellows fall madly in love with my Lolita ! Had I been a painter , had the management of The Enchanted Hunters lost its mind one summer day and commissioned me to redecorate their dining room with murals of my own making , this is what I might have thought up , let me list some fragments : There would have been a lake . There would have been an arbor in flame-flower . There would have been nature studies  --  a tiger pursuing a bird of paradise , a choking snake sheathing whole the flayed trunk of a shoat . There would have been a sultan , his face expressing great agony ( belied , as it were , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb a column of onyx . There would have been those luminous globules of gonadal glow that travel up the opalescent sides of juke boxes . There would have been all kinds of camp activities on the part of the intermediate group , Canoeing , Coranting , Combing Curls in the lakeside sun . There would have been poplars , apples , a suburban Sunday . There would have been ap137fire opal dissolving within a ripple-ringed pool , a last throb , a last dab of color , stinging red , smarting pink , a sigh , a wincing child . I am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present boundless misery , but to sort out the portion of hell and the portion of heaven in that strange , awful , maddeningworld  --  nymphet love . The beastly and beautiful merged at one point , and it is that borderline I would like to fix , and I feel I fail to do so utterly . Why ? The stipulation of the Roman law , according to which a girl may marry at twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved , rather tacitly , in some of the United States . And fifteen is lawful everywhere . There is nothing wrong , say both hemispheres , when a brute of forty , blessed by the local priest and bloated with drink , sheds his sweat-drenched finery and thrusts himself up to the hilt into his youthful bride . " In such stimulating temperate climates says an old magazine in this prison library as St. Louis , Chicago and Cincinnati , girls mature about the end of their twelfth year . " Dolores Ilazc was born less than three hundred miles from stimulating Cincinnati . I have but followed nature . I am nature 's faithful hound . Why then this horror that I can not shake off ? Did I deprive her of her flower ? Sensitive gentlewomen of the jury , I was not even her first lover . She told me the way she had been debauched . We ate flavorlessmealy bananas , bruised peaches and very palatable potato chips , and die Kleine told me everything . Her voluble but disjointedaccount was accompanied by many a droll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I especially remember one wryp138face on an " ugh ! " basis : jelly-mouth distended sideways and eyes rolled up in a routine blend of comic disgust , resignation and tolerance for young frailty . Her astounding tale started with an introductory mention of her tent-mate of the previous summer , at another camp , a " very select " one as she put it . That tent-mate ( " quite a derelict character , " " half-crazy , " but a " swell kid " ) instructed her in various manipulations . At first , loyal Lo refused to tell me her name . " Was it Grace Angel ? " I asked . She shook her head . No , it was n't , it was the daughter of a big shot . He " Was it perhaps Rose Carmine ? " " No , of course , not . Her father  --  " " Was it , then , Agnes Sheridan perchance ? " She swallowed and shook her head  --  and then did a double take . " Say , how come you know all those kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They are pretty bad , some of that school bunch , but not that bad . If you have to know , her name was Elizabeth Talbot , she goes now to a swanky private school , her father is an executive . " I recalled with a funny pang the frequency with which poor Charlotte used to introduce into party chat such elegant tidbits as " when my daughter was out hiking last year with the Talbot girl . " I wanted to know if either mother learned of those sapphic diversions ? " Gosh no , " exhaled limp Lo mimicking dread and relief , pressing a falsely fluttering hand to her chest . I was more interested , however , in heterosexual experience . She had entered the sixth grade at eleven , soon after moving to Ramsdale from the Middle West . What did she mean by " pretty bad " ? Well , the Miranda twins had shared the same bed for years , and Donald Scott , who was the dumbest boy in the school , had done it with Hazel Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the brightest  --  used to exhibit himself wherever and whenever he had a chance , and " Let us switch to Camp Q , " I said . And presently I got the whole story . Barbara Burke , a sturdy blond , two years older than Lo and by far the camp 's best swimmer , had a very special canoe which she shared with Lo " because I was the only other girl who could make ' Willow Island " ( some swimming test , I imagine ) . Through July , every morning  --  mark , reader , every blessed morning  --  Barbaraand Lo would be helped to carry the boat to Onyx or Eryx ( two small lakes in the wood ) by Charlie Holmes , the camp mistress ' son , aged thirteen  --  and the only human male for a couple of miles around ( excepting an old meek stone-deaf handyman , and a farmer in an old Ford who sometimes sold the campers eggs as farmers will ) ; every morning , oh my reader , the three children would take a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblems of youth , dew , birdsongs , and at one point , among the luxuriant undergrowth , Lo would be left as sentinel , while Barbara and the boy copulated behind a bush . At first , Lo had refused " to try what it was like , " but curiosity and camaraderie prevailed , and soon she and Barbara were doing it by turns with the silent , coarse and surly but indefatigable Charlie , who had as much sex appeal as a raw carrot but sported a fascinating collection of contraceptives which he used to fish out of a third nearby lake , a considerably larger and more populous one , called Lake Climax , after the booming young factory town of that name . Although conceding it was " sort of fun " and " fine for the complexion , " Lolita , I am glad to say , held Charlie 's mind and manners in the greatest contempt . Nor had her temperament been roused by that filthy fiend . In fact , I think he had rather stunned it , despite the " fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the ebb of lust , an ashen sense of awfulness , abetted by the realistic drabness of a gray neuralgic day , crept over me and hummed within my temples . Brown , naked , frail Lo , her narrow white buttocks to me , her sulky face to a door mirror , stood , arms akimbo , feet ( in new slippers with pussy-fur tops ) wide apart , and through a forehanging lock tritely mugged at herself in the glass . From the corridor came the cooing voices of colored maids at work , and presently there was a mild attempt to open the door of our room . I had Lo go to the bathroom and take a much-needed soap shower . The bed was a frightful mess with overtones of potato chips . She tried on a two-piece navy wool , then a sleevelessblouse with a swirly clathrate skirt , but the first was too tight and the second too ample , and when I begged her to hurry up ( the situation was beginning to frighten me ) , Lo viciously sent those nice presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday 's dress . When she was ready at last , I gave her a lovely new purse of simulated calf ( in which I had slipped quite a few pennies and two mint-bright dimes ) and told her to buy herself a magazine in the lobby . " I 'll be down in a minute , " I said . " And if I were you , my dear , I would not talk to strangers . " Except for my poor little gifts , there was not much to pack ; but I was forced to devote a dangerous amount of time ( was she up to something downstairs ? ) to arranging the bed in such a way as to suggest the abandoned nest of a restless father and his tomboy daughter , instead of an ex-convict 's saturnalia with a couple of fat old whores . Then I finished dressing and had the hoary bellboy come up for the bags . Everything was fine . There , in the lobby , she sat , deep in an overstuffed blood-red armchair , deep in a lurid movie magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genre of the place had changed overnight to a spurious country-squire atmosphere ) was staring at my Lolita over his dead cigar and stale newspaper . She wore her professional white socks and saddle oxfords , and that bright print frock with the square throat ; a splash of jaded lamplight brought out the golden down on her warm brown limbs . There she sat , her legs carelessly highcrossed , and her pale eyes skimmingalong the lines with every now and then a blink . Bill 's wife had worshiped him from afar long before they ever met : in fact , she used to secretly admire the famous young actor as he ate sundaes in Schwob 's drugstore . Nothing could have beenp141more childish than her snubbed nose , freckled face for the purplishspot on her naked neck where a fairytale vampire had feasted , or the unconscious movement of her tongue exploring a touch of rosy rash around her swollen lips ; nothing could be more harmless than to read about Jill , an energetic starlet who made her own clothes and was a student of serious literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that glossy brown hair with that silky sheen on the temple ; nothing could be more naive  --  But what sickening envy the lecherous fellow whoever he was  --  come to think of it , he resembled a little my Swiss uncle Gustave , also a great admirer of le decouvert  --  would have experienced had he known that every nerve in me was still anointed and ringed with the feel of her body  --  the body of some immortal daemon disguised as a female child . Was pink pig Mr. Swoon absolutely sure my wife had not telephoned ? He was . If she did , would he tell her we had gone on to Aunt Clare 's place ? He would , indeedie . I settled the bill and roused Lo from her chair . She read to the car . Still reading , she was driven to a so-called coffee shop a few blocks south . Oh , she ate all right . She even laid aside her magazine to eat , but a queer dullness had replaced her usual cheerfulness . I knew little Lo could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited for a squall . I was unbathed , unshaven , and had had no bowel movement . My nerves were a-jangle . I did not like the way my little mistress shrugged her shoulders and distended her nostrils when I attempted casual small talk . Had Phyllis been in the know before she joined her parents in Maine ? I asked with a smile . " Look , " said Lo making a weeping grimace , " let us get off the subject . " I then tried  --  also unsuccessfully , no matter how I smacked my lips  --  to interest her in the road map . Our destination was , let me remind my patient reader whose meek temper Lo ought to have copied , the gay town of Lepingville , somewhere near a hypothetical hospital . That destinationwas in itself a perfectly arbitrary one ( as , alas , so many were to be ) , and I shook in my shoes as I wondered how to keep the whole arrangement plausible , and what other plausible objectives to invent after we had taken in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . It was something quite special , that feeling : an oppressive , hideous constraint as if I were sitting with the small ghost of somebody I had just killed . As she was in the act of getting back into the car , an expression of pain flitted across Lo 's face . It flitted again , more meaningfully , as she settled down beside me . No doubt , she reproduced it that second time for my benefit . Foolishly , I asked her what was the matter . " Nothing , you brute , " she replied . " You what ? " I asked . She was silent . Leaving Briceland . Loquacious Lo was silent . Cold spiders of panic crawled down my back . This was an orphan . This was a lone child , an absolute waif , with whom a heavy-limbed , foul-smelling adult had had strenuous intercoursethree times that very morning . Whether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had surpassed all expectation , it had , in a sense , overshot its mark  --  and plunged into a nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And let me be quite frank : somewhere at the bottom of that dark turmoil I felt the writhing of desire again , so monstrous was my appetite for that miserable ' nymphet . Mingled with the pangs of guilt was the agonizing thought that her mood might prevent me from making love to her again as soon as I found a nice country road where to park in peace . In other words , poor Humbert Humbert was dreadfully unhappy , and while steadily and inanely driving toward Lepingville , he kept racking his brains for some quip , under the bright wing of which he might dare turn to his seatmate . It was she , however , who broke the silence : " Oh , a squashed squirrel , " she said . " What a shame . " " Yes , is n't it ? " ( eager , hopeful Hum ) . " Let us stop at the next gas station , " Lo continued . " I want to go to the washroom . " " We shall stop wherever you want , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supercilious grove ( oaks , I thought ; American trees at that stage were beyond me ) started to echo greenly the rush of our car , a red and ferny road on our right turned its head before slanting into the woodland , and I suggested we might perhaps " Drive on , " my Lo cried shrilly . " Righto . Take it easy . " ( Down , poor beast , down . ) I glanced at her . Thank God , the child was smiling . " You chump , " she said , sweetly smiling at me . " You revoltingcreature . I was a daisy-fresh girl , and look what you 've done to me . I ought to call the police and tell them you raped me . Oh vGu , dirty , dirty old man . " Was she just joking ? An ominous hysterical note rang through her silly words . Presently , making a sizzling sound with her lips , she started complaining of pains , said she could not sit , said I had torn something inside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran over some little animal or other that was crossing the road with tail erect , and again my vile-tempered companion called me an ugly name . When we stopped at the filling station , she scrambled out without a word and was a long time away . Slowly , lovingly , an elderly friend with a broken nose , wiped my windshield  --  they do it differently at every place , from chamois cloth to soapy brush , this fellow used a pink sponge . She appeared at last . " Look , " she said in that neutral voice that hurt me so , " give me some dimes and nickels . I want to call mother in that hospital . What 's the number ? " " Get in , " I said . " You ca n't call that number . " " Why ? " " Get in and slam the door . " She got in and slammed the door . The old garage man beamed at her . I swung onto the highway . " Why ca n't I call my mother if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " your mother is dead . "  |p144In  the gay town of Lepingville I bought her four books of comics , a box of candy , a box of sanitary pads , two cokes , a manicure set , a travel clock with a luminous dial , a ring with ap145real topaz , a tennis racket , roller skates with white high shoes , field glasses , a portable radio set , chewing gum , a transparent raincoat , sunglasses , some more garments  --  swooners , shorts , all kinds of summer frocks . At the hotel we had separate rooms , but in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine , and we made it up very gently . You see , she had absolutely nowhere else to go.  |p146IT  WAS then that began our extensive travels all over the States . To any other type of tourist accommodation I soon grew to prefer the Functional Motel  --  clean , neat , safe nooks , ideal places for sleep , argument , reconciliation , insatiable illicit love . At first , in my dread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one double unit , each containing a double bed . I wondered what type of foursome this arrangement was ever intended for , since only a pharisaic parody of privacy could be attained by means of the incomplete partition dividingthe cabin or room into two communicating love nests . By and by , the very possibilities that such honest promiscuity suggested ( two young couples merrily swapping mates or a child shamming sleep to earwitness primal sonorities ) made me bolder , and every now and then I would take a bed-and-cot or twinbedcabin , a prison cell of paradise , with yellow window shades pulled down to create a morning illusion of Venice and sunshine when actually it was Pennsylvania and rain . We came to know  --  noes conni mes , to use a Flaubertian intonation  --  thestone cottages under enormous Chateaubriandesque trees , the brick unit , the adobe unit , the stucco court , on what the Tour Book of the Automobile Association describes as " shaded " or " spacious " or " landscaped " grounds . The log kind , finished in knotty pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried-chicken bones . We held in contempt the plain whitewashed clapboard Kabins , with their faint sewerish smell or some other gloomy self-conscious stench and nothing to boast of ( except " good beds " ) , and an unsmiling landlady always pre/pared to have her gift ( " ... well , I could give you . . . " ) turned down . Nous connurnes ( this is royal fun ) the would-be enticements of their repetitious names  --  all those Sunset Motels , U-Beam Cottages , Hillcrest Courts , Pine View Courts , Mountain View Courts , Skyline Courts , Park Plaza Courts , Green Acres , Mac 's Courts . There was sometimes a special line in the write-up , such as " Children welcome , pets allowed " ( You are welcome , you are allowed ) . The baths were mostly tiled showers , with an endless variety of spouting mechanisms , but with one definitely non-Laodicean characteristic in common , a propensity , while in use , to turn instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you , depending on whether your neighbor turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary complement in the shower you had so carefully blended . Some motels had instructions pasted above the toilet ( on whose tank the towels were un hygienically heaped ) asking guests not to throw into its bowl garbage , beer cans , cartons , stillborn babies ; others had special notices under glass , such as Things to Do ( Riding : You will often see riders coming down Main Street on their way backfrom a romantic moonlight ride . " Often at 3 A.M. , " sneered unromantic Lo ) . Nous conniimes the various types of motor court operators , the reformed criminal , the retired teacher and the business flop , among the males ; and the motherly , pseudo-ladylike and madamicvariants among the females . And sometimes trains would cry in the monstrously hot and humid night with heartrending and ominous plangency , mingling power and hysteria in one desperate scream . We avoided Tourist Homes , country cousins of Funeral ones , old-fashioned , genteel and showerless , with elaborate dressing tables in depressingly white-and-pink little bedrooms , and photographs of the landlady 's children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , to Lo 's predilection for " real " hotels . She would pick out in the book , while I petted her in the parked car in the silence of a dusk-mellowed , mysterious side-road , some highly recommended lake lodge which offered all sorts ofp148things magnified by the flashlight she moved over them , such as congenial company , between-meals snacks , outdoor barbecues  --  but which in my mind conjured up odious visions of stinking high school boys in sweatshirts and an ember-red cheek pressing against hers , while poor Dr. Humbert , embracing nothing but two masculine knees , would cold-humor his piles on the damp turf . Most tempting to her , too , were those " Colonial " Inns , which apart from " gracious atmosphere " and picture windows , promised " unlimited quantities of M-m-m food . " Treasured recollectionsof my father 's palatial hotel sometimes led me to seek for its like in the strange country we traveled through . I was soon discouraged ; but Lo kept following the scent of rich food ads , while I derived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOTEL , Children under 14 Free . On the other hand , I shudder when recalling that soi-disant " high-class " resort in a Midwestern state , which advertised " raidthe-icebox " midnight snacks and , intrigued by my accent , wanted to know my dead wife 's and dead mother 's maiden names . A two-days ' stay there cost me a hundred and twenty-four dollars ! And do you remember , Miranda , that other " ultrasmart " robbers ' den with complimentary morning coffee and circulating ice water , and no children under sixteen ( no Lolitas , of course ) ? Immediately upon arrival at one of the plainer motor courts which became our habitual haunts , she would set the electric fan a-whirr , or induce me to drop a quarter into the radio , or she would read all the signs and inquire with a whine why she could not go riding up some advertised trail or swimming in that local pool of warm mineral water . Most often , in the slouching , bored way she cultivated ; Lo would fall prostrate and abominably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a steamer chair of striped canvas with footrest and canopy , or a sling chair , or any other lawn chair under a garden umbrella on the patio , and it would take hours of blandishments , threats and promises to make her lend me for a few seconds her brown limbs in the seclusion of the five-dollar room before undertaking anything she might prefer to my poor joy . A combination of naivete and deception , of charm and vul/parity , of blue sulks and rosy mirth , Lolita , when she chose , could be a most exasperating brat . I was not really quite prepared for her fits of disorganized boredom , intense and vehement griping , her sprawling , droopy , dopey-eyed style , and what is called goofing off  --  a kind of diffused clowning which she thought was tough in a boyish hoodlum way . Mentally , I found her to be a disgustingly conventional little girl . Sweet hot jazz , square dancing , gooey fudge sundaes , musicals , movie magazines and so forth  --  these were the obvious items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many nickels I fed to the gorgeous music boxes that came with every meal we had ! I still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her , people with names like Sammy and Jo and Eddy and Tony and Peggy and Guy and Patty and Rex , and sentimental song hits , all of them as similar to my ear as her various candies were to my palate . She believed , with a kind of celestial trust , any advertisement or advice that appeared in Movie Love or Screen Land  --  Starasil Starves Pimples , or " You better watch out if you 're wearing your shirttails outside your jeans , gals , because Jill says you should n't . " If a roadside sign said : VISIT OUR GIFT SHoP  --  we had to visit it , had to buy its Indian curios , dolls , copper jewelry , cactus candy . The words " novelties and souvenirs " simp ' ; entranced her by their trochaic lilt . If some cafe sign proclaim d Icecold Drinks , she was automatically stirred , although all dhinks everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated : the ideal consumer , the subject and object of every foul poster . And she attempted  --  unsuccessfully  --  to patronize only those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads . In those days , neither she nor I had thought up yet the system of monetary bribes which was to work such havoc with my nerves and her morals somewhat later . I relied on three other methods to keep my pubescent concubine in submission and passable temper . A few years before , she h ' 1 spent a rainy summer under Miss Phalen 's bleary eye in dilapidated Appalachianfarmhouse that had belonged to some gnarled Haze or other in the dead past . It still stood among its rank acresp151of golden rod on the edge of a flowerless forest , at the end of a permanently muddy road , twenty miles from the nearest hamlet . Lo recalled that scarecrow of a house , the solitude , the soggy old pastures , the wind , the bloated wilderness , with an energy of disgust that distorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that I warned her she would dwell with me in exile for months and years if need be , studying under me French and Latin , unless her " present attitude " changed . Charlotte , I began to understand you ! A simple child , Lo would scream no ! and frantically clutch at my driving hand whenever I put a stop to her tornadoes of temper by turning in the middle of a highway with the implicationthat I was about to take her straight to that dark and dismal abode . The farther , however , we traveled away from it west , the less tangible that menace became , and I had to adopt other methods of persuasion . Among these , the reformatory threat is the one I recall with the deepest moan of shame . From the very beginning of our concourse , I was clever enough to realize that I must secure her complete co-operation in keeping our relations secret , that it should become a second nature with her , no matter what grudge she might bear me , no matter what other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man , " I would say , " and drop that moody nonsense . In former times , when I was still your dream male the reader will notice what pains I took to speak Lo 's tongue , you swooned to records of the number one throb-andsobidol of your coevals Lo : " Of my what ? Speak English " . That idol of your pals sounded , you thought , like friend Humbert . But now , I am just your old man , a dream dad protecting his dream daughter . " My there Dolores ! I want to protect you , dear , from all the horrors that happen to little girls in coal sheds and alley ways , and , alas , comme vous le savez trop Bien , ma gentille , in the blueberry woods during the bluest of summers . Through thick and thin I will still stay your guardian , and if you are good , I hope a court may legalize that guardianship before long . Letp152us , however , forget , Dolores Haze , so-called legal terminology , terminology that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I am not a criminal sexual psychopath taking indecent liberties with a child . The rapist was Charlie Holmes ; I am the therapist  --  a matter of nice spacing in the way of distinction . I am your daddum , Lo . Look , I 've a learned book here about young girls . Look , darling , what it says . I quote : the normal girl  --  normal , mark you  --  the normal girl is usually extremely anxious to please her father . She feels in him the forerunner of the desired elusive male ( ' elusive ' is good , by Polonius ! ) . The wise mother ( and your poor mother would have been wise , had she lived ) will encourage a companionship between father and daughter , realizing  --  excuse the corny style  --  that the girl forms her ideals of romance and of men from her association with her father . Now , what association does this cheery book mean  --  and recommend ? I quote again : Among Sicilians sexual relations between a father and his daughter are accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participates in such relationship is not looked upon with disapproval by the society of which she is part . I 'm a great admirer of Sicilians , fine athletes , fine musicians , fine upright people , Lo , and great lovers . But let 's not digress . Only the other day we read in the newspapers some bunkum about a middle-aged morals offender who pleaded guilty to the violation of the Mann act and to transporting a nine-year old girl across state lines for immoral purposes , whatever these are . Dolores darling ! You are not nine but almost thirteen , and I would not advise you to consider yourself my cross-country slave , and I deplore the Mann act as lending itself to a dreadful pun , the revenge that the Gods of Semantics take against tight-zippered Philistines . I am your father , and I am speaking English , and I love you . " Finally , let us see what happens if you , a minor , accused of having impaired the morals of an adult in a respectable inn , what happens if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let us suppose they believe you . A minor female , who allows a person over twenty-one to know her carnally , involves her victim into statutory rape , or second-degreep153sodomy , depending on the technique ; and the maximum penalty is ten years . So I go to jail . Okay . I go to jail . But what happens to you , my orphan ? Well , you are luckier . You become the ward of the Department of Public Welfare  --  which I am afraid sounds a little bleak . A nice grim matron of the Miss Phalen type , but more rigid and not a drinking woman , will take away your lipstickand fancy clothes . No more gadding about ! I do n't know if you have ever heard of the laws relating to dependent , neglected , incorrigible and delinquent children . While I stand gripping the bars , you , happy neglected child , will be given a choice of various dwelling places , all more or less the same , the correctional school , the reformatory , the juvenile detention home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit things , and sing hymns , and have rancid pancakes on Sundays . You will go there , Lolita  --  my Lolita , this Lolita will leave her Catullus and go there , as the wayward girl you are . In plainer words , if we two are found out , you will be analyzed and institutionalized , my pet , c'est tout . You will dwell , my Lolita will dwell ( come here , my brown flower ) with thirty-nine other dopes in a dirty dormitory ( no , allow me , please ) under the supervision of hideous matrons . This is the situation , this is the choice . Do n't you think that under the circumstances Dolores Haze had better stick to her old man ? " By rubbing all this in , I succeeded in terrorizing Lo , who despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her I.Q. might suggest . But if I managed to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt , I was much less successful in keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels I had to devise some expectation , some special point in space and time for her to look forward to , for her to survive till bedtime . Otherwise , deprived of a shaping and sustaining purpose , the skeleton of her day sagged and collapsed . The object in view might be anything  --  a lighthouse in Virginia , a natural cave in Arkansas converted to a cafe , a collection of guns and violins somewhere in Oklahoma , a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes in Louisiana , shabby photographs of the bonanza mining period in the localp154museum of a Rocky Mountains resort , anything whatsoever  --  but it had to be there , in front of us , like a fixed star , although as likely as not Lo would feign gagging as soon as we got to it . By putting the geography of the United States into motion , I did my best for hours on end to give her the impression of " going places , " of rolling on to some definite destination , to some unusual delight . I have never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , across the crazy quilt of forty-eight states . Voraciously we consumed those long highways , in rapt silence we glided over their glossy black dance floors . Not only had Lo no eye for scenery but she furiously resentedmy calling her attention to this or that enchanting detail of landscape ; which I myself learned to discern only after being exposed for quite a time to the delicate beauty ever present in the margin of our undeserving journey . By a paradox of pictorial thought , the average lowland North-American countryside had at first seemed to me something I accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted oilcloths which were imported from America in the old days to be hung above washstands in Central-European nurseries , and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views they depicted  --  opaque curly trees , a barn , cattle , a brook , the dull white of vague orchards in bloom , and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish gouache . But gradually the models of those elementaryrusticities became stranger and stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Beyond the tilled plain , beyond the toy roofs , there would be a slow suffusion of inutile loveliness , a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm , peeled-peach tinge pervading the upper edge of a two-dimensional , dove-gray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist . There might be a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon , and hot still noons above a wilderness of clover , and Claude Lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background . Or again , it might be a stern El Greco horizon , pregnant with inky rain , and a passing glimpse of some mummy-necked farmer , and all around alternating strips of quick-silverish water and harshp155green corn , the whole arrangement opening like a fan , some where in Kansas . Now and then , in the vastness of those plains , huge trees would advance toward us to cluster self-consciously by the roadsideand provide a bit of humanitarian shade above a picnic table , with sun flecks , flattened paper cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great user of roadside facilities , my unfastidious Lo would be charmed by toilet signs  --  Guys-Gals , John-Jane , Jack-Jill and even Buck'sDoe 's ; while lost in an artist 's dream , I would stare at the honest brightness of the gasoline paraphernalia against the splendid green of oaks , or at a distant hill scrambling out  --  scarred but still untamed  --  from the wilderness of agriculture that was trying to swallow it . At night , tall trucks studded with colored lights , like dreadful giant Christmas trees , loomed in the darkness and thundered by the belated little sedan . And again next day a thinly populated sky , losing its blue to the heat , would melt overhead , and La would clamor for a drink , and her cheeks would hollow vigorouslyover the straw , and the car inside would be a furnace when we got in again , and the road shimmered ahead , with a remote car changing its shape mirage-like in the surface glare , and seeming to hang for a moment , old-fashionedly square and high , in the hot haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage-man called " sage brush " appeared , and then the mysteriousoutlines of table-like hills , and then red bluffs ink-blotted with junipers , and then a mountain range , dun grading into blue , and blue into dream , and the desert would meet us with a steady gale , dust , gray thorn bushes , and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking pale flowers among the prickles of wind-tortured withered stalks all along the highway ; in the middle of which there sometimes stood simple cows , immobilized in a position ( tail left , white eyelashes right ) cutting across all human rules of traffic . My lawyer has suggested I give a clear , frank account of the itinerary we followed , and I suppose I have reached here a point where I can not avoid that chore . Roughly , during that mad year ( August 1947 to August 1948 ) , our route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in New England , then meandered south , up and down , east and west ; dipped deep into ce qu'on appelle Dixieland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts ( this is not too clear I am afraid , Clarence , but I did not keep any notes , and have at my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volumes , almost a symbol of my torn and tattered past , in which to check these recollections ) ; crossed and recrossedthe Rockies , straggled through southern deserts where we wintered ; reached the Pacific , turned north through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads ; almost reached the Canadian border ; and proceeded east , across good lands and bad lands , back to agriculture on a grand scale , avoiding , despite little Lo 's strident remonstrations , little Lo 's birthplace , in a corn , coal and hog producing area ; and finally returned to the fold of the East , petering out in the college town of Beardsley . Now , in perusing what follows , the reader should bear in mind not only the general circuit as adumbrated above , with its many sidetrips and tourist traps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that far from being an indolent pal-tie de plaisir , our tour was a hard , twisted , teleological growth , whose sole raison d'etre ( these French cliches are symptomatic ) was to keep my companion in passable humor from kiss to kiss . Thumbing through that battered tour book , I dimly evoke that Magnolia Garden in a southern state which cost me four bucks and which , according to the ad in the book , you must visit for three reasons : because John Galsworthy ( a stone-dead writer of sorts ) acclaimed it as the world 's fairest garden ; because in 1900 Baedeker 's Guide had marked it with a star ; and finally , because ... 0 , Reader , My Reader , guess ! .. because children ( and by Jingo was not my Lolita a child ! ) will " walkp157starry-eyed and reverently through this foretaste of Heaven , drinking in beauty that can influence a life . " " Not mine , " said grim Lo , and settled down on a bench with the fillings of two Sunday papers in her lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americanroadside restaurants , from the lowly Eat with its deer head ( dark trace of long tear at inner canthus ) , " humorous " picture post cards of the posterior " Kurort " type , impaled guest checks , life savers , sunglasses , adman visions of celestial sundaes , one half of a chocolate cake under glass , and several horribly experiencedflies zigzagging over the sticky sugar-pour on the ignoble counter ; and all the way to the expensive place with the subdued lights , preposterously poor table linen , inept waiters ( ex-convicts or college boys ) , the roan back of a screen actress , the sable eyebrows of her male of the moment , and an orchestra of zoot-suiters with trumpets . We inspected the world 's largest stalagmite in a cave where three southeastern states have a family reunion ; admission by age ; adults one dollar , pubescents sixty cents . A granite obelisk commemorating the Battle of Blue Licks , with old bones and Indian pottery in the museum nearby , Lo a dime , very reasonable . The present log cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A boulder , with a plaque , in memory of the author of " Trees " ( by now we are in Poplar Cove , N.C. , reached by what my kind , tolerant , usually so restrained tour book angrily calls " a very narrow road , poorly maintained , " to which , though no Kilmerite , I subscribe ) . From a hired motorboatoperated by an elderly , but still repulsively handsome White Russian , a baron they said ( Lo 's palms were damp , the little fool ) , who had known in California good old Maximovich and Valeria , we could distinguish the inaccessible " millionaires ' colony " on an island , somewhere off the Georgia coast . We inspected further : a collection of European hotel picture post cards in a museum devoted to hobbies at a Mississippi resort , where with a hot wave of pride I discovered a colored photo of my father 's Mirana , its striped awnings , its flag flying above the retouched palm trees . " So what ? " said Lo , squinting at thep158bronzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hobby House . Relics of the cotton era .

Collections of frontier lore . Ante-bellum homes with iron-trellis balconies and hand-worked stairs , the kind down which movie ladies with sun-kissed shouldersrun in rich Technicolor , holding up the fronts of their flounced skirts with both little hands in that special way , and the devoted Negress shaking her head on the upper landing .

A motel whose ventilator pipe passed under the city sewer . Lincoln 's home , largely spurious , with parlor books and period furniture that most visitors reverently accepted as personal belongings . We had rows , minor and major .

On N. Broadway , Burns , Oregon , corner of W. Washington , facing Safeway , a grocery . In some little town in the Sun Valley of Idaho , before a brick hotel , pale and flushed bricks nicely mixed , with , opposite , a poplar playing its liquid shadows all over the local Honor Roll . In a sage brush wilderness , between Pinedale and Farson . Somewhere in Nebraska , on Main Street ,  |p161near  the First National Bank , established 1889 , with a view of a railway crossing in the vista of the street , and beyond that the white organ pipes of a multiple silo . And on McEwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town bearing his first name . We came to know the curious roadside species , Hitchhiking Man , Homo pollex of science , with all its many sub-species and forms : the modest soldier , spit and span , quietly waiting , quietly conscious of khaki 's viatic appeal ; the schoolboy wishing to go two blocks ; the killer wishing to go two thousand miles ; the mysterious , nervous , elderly gent , with brand-new suitcase and clipped mustache ; a trio of optimistic Mexicans ; the college student displaying the grime of vacational outdoor work as proudly as the name of the famous college arching across the front of his sweatshirt ; the desperate lady whose battery has just died on her ; the clean-cut , glossy-haired , shifty-eyed , white-faced young beasts in loud shirts and coats , vigorously , almost priapicallythrusting out tense thumbs to tempt lone women or sadsacksalesmen with fancy cravings . " Let 's take him , " Lo would often plead , rubbing her knees together in a way she had , as some particularly disgusting pollex , some man of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an unemployed actor , walked backwards , practically in the path of our car . Oh , I had to keep a very sharp eye on Lo , little limp Lo ! Owing perhaps to constant amorous exercise , she radiated , despiteher very childish appearance , some special languorous glow which threw garage fellows , hotel pages , vacationists , goons in luxurious cars , maroon morons near blued pools , into fits of concupiscence which might have tickled my pride , had it not incensed my jealousy . For little Lo was aware of that glow of hers , and I would often catch her coulant un regard in the direction of some amiable male , some grease monkey , with a sinewy golden-brown forearm and watch-braceleted wrist , and hardly had I turned my back to go and buy this very Lo a lollipop , than I would hear her and the fair mechanic burst into a perfect love song of wisecracks . When , during our longer stops , I would relax after a particu/larly violent morning in bed , and out of the goodness of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the rose garden or children 's library across the street with a motor court neighbor'splain little Mary and Mary 's eight-year old brother , Lo would come back an hour late , with barefoot Mary trailing far behind , and the little boy metamorphosed into two gangling , golden-haired high school uglies , all muscles and gonorrhea . The reader may well imagine what I answered my pet when  --  rather uncertainly , I admit  --  she would ask me if she could go with Carl and Al here to the roller-skating rink . I remember the first time , a dusty windy afternoon , I did let her go to one such rink . Cruelly she said it would be no fun if I accompanied her , since that time of day was reserved for teenagers . We wrangled out a compromise : I remained in the car , among other ( empty ) cars with their noses to the canvas-topped open-air rink , where some fifty young people , many in pairs , were endlessly rolling round and round to mechanical music , and the wind silvered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as most of the other girls did . I kept counting the revolutionsof the rolling crowd  --  and suddenly she was missing . When she rolled past again , she was together with three hoodlums whom I had heard analyze a moment before the girl skaters from the outside  --  and jeer at a lovely leggy young thing who had arrived clad in red shorts instead of those jeans or slacks . At inspection stations on highways entering Arizona or California , a policeman 's cousin would peer with such intensity at us that my poor heart wobbled . " Any honey ? " he would inquire , and every time my sweet fool giggled . I still have , vibrating all along my optic nerve , visions of Lo on horseback , a link in the chain of a guided trip along a bridle trail : Lo bobbing at a walkingpace , with an old woman rider in front and a lecherous redneckeddude-rancher behind ; and I behind him , hating his fat flowery-shirted back even more fervently than a motorist does a slow truck on a mountain road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see her floating away from me , celestial and solitary , in an ethereal chairlift , up and up , to a glittering summit where laughingathletes stripped to the waist were waiting for her , for her.  |p163In  whatever town we stopped I would inquire , in my polite European way , anent the whereabouts of natatoriums , museums , local schools , the number of children in the nearest school and so forth ; and at school bus time , smiling and twitching a littleI discovered this tic nerveux because cruel Lo was the first to mimic it ) , I would park at a strategic point , with my vagrant schoolgirl beside me in the car , to watch the children leave school  --  always a pretty sight . This sort of thing soon began to bore my so easily bored Lolita , and , having a childish lack of sympathy for other people 's whims , she would insult me and my desire to have her caress me while blue-eyed little brunettes in blue shorts , copperheads in green boleros , and blurred boyish blondes in faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compromise , I freely advocated whenever and wherever possible the use of swimming pools with other girl children . She adored brilliant water and was a remarkably smart diver . Comfortably robed , I would settle clown in the rich postmeridianshade after my own demure dip , and there I would sit , with a dummy book or a bag of bonbons , or both , or nothing but my tingling glands , and watch her gambol , rubber-capped , bepearled , smoothly tanned , as glad as an ad , in her trim-fitted satin pants and shirred bra . Pubescent sweetheart ! how smugly would I marvel that she was mine , mine , mine , and revise the recent matitudinal swoon to the moan of the mourning doves , and devise the late afternoon one , and slitting my sun-speared eyes , compare Lolita to whatever other nymphets parsimonious chance collected around her for my anthological delectation and judgment ; and today , putting my hand on my ailing heart , I really do not think that any of them ever surpassed her in desirability , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most , in a certain light , with certain perfumes blended in the air  --  once in the hopeless case of a pale Spanish child , the daughter of a heavy-jawed nobleman , and another time  --  mais je divague . Naturally , I had to be always wary , fully realizing , in my lucid jealousy , the danger of those dazzling romps . I had only to turn away for a moment  --  to walk , say , a few steps in order to see if our cabin was at last ready after the morning change of linen  --  andp164Lo and Behold , upon returning , I would find the former , les yeux perdus , dipping and kicking her long-toed feet in the water on the stone edge of which she lolled , while , on either side of her , there crouched a brun adolescent whom her russet beauty and the quicksilver in the baby folds of her stomach were sure to cause to se tordre  --  oh Baudelaire !  --  in recurrent dreams for months to come . I tried to teach her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but although I had been a good player in my prime , I proved to be hopeless as a teacher ; and so , in California , I got her to take a number of very expensive lessons with a famous coach , a husky , wrinkled old-timer , with a harem of ball boys ; he looked an awful wreck off the court , but now and then , when , in the course of a lesson , to keep up the exchange , he would put out as it were an exquisite spring blossom of a stroke and twang the ball back to his pupil , that divine delicacy of absolute power made me recall that , thirty years before , I had seen him in Cannes demolish the great Gobert ! Until she began taking those lessons , I thought she would never learn the game . On this or that hotel court I would drill Lo , and try to relive the days when in a hot gale , a daze of dust , and queer lassitude , I fed ball after ball to gay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white skirt , black velvet hair band ) . With every word of persistent advice I would only augment Lo 's sullen fury . To our games , oddly enough , she preferred  --  atleast , before we reached California  --  formless pat ball approximations  --  more ball hunting than actual play  --  with a wispy , weak , wonderfully pretty in an ange gauche way coeval . A helpful spectator , I would go up to that other child , and inhale her faint musky fragrance as I touched her forearm and held her knobby wnst , and push this way or that her cool thigh to show her the back-hand stance . In the meantime , Lo , bending forward , would let her sunny-brown curls hang forward as she stuck her racket , like a cripple 's stick , into the ground and emitted a tremendous ugh of disgust at my intrusion . I would leave them to their game and look on , comparing their bodies in motion , a silk scarf round my throat ; this was in south Arizona , I think/and the days had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slash at the ball and miss it , and curse , and send a simulacrum of ; . a serve into the net , and show the wet glistening young down of her armpit as she brandished her racket in despair , and her even more insipid partner would dutifully rush out after every ball , and retrieve none ; but both were enjoying themselves beautifully , and in clear ringing tones kept the exact score of their ineptitudes all the time . One day , I remember , I offered to bring them cold drinks from the hotel , and went up the gravel path , and came back with two tall glasses of pineapple juice , soda and ice ; and then a sudden void within my chest made me stop as I saw that the tennis court was deserted . I stooped to set down the glasses on a bench and for some reason , with a kind of icy vividness , saw Charlotte 's face in death , and I glanced around , and noticed Lo in white shorts receding through the speckled shadow of a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tennis rackets . I sprang after them , but as I was crashing through the shrubbery , I saw , in an alternate vision , as if life 's course constantly branched , Lo , in slacks , and her companion , in shorts , trudging up and down a small weedy area , and beating bushes with their rackets in listless search for their last lost ball . I itemize these sunny nothings mainly to prove to my judges that I did everything in my power to give my Lolita a really good time . How charming it was to see her , a child herself , showing another child some of her few accomplishments , such as for example a special way of jumping rope . With her right hand holding her left arm behind her untanned back , the lesser nymphet , a diaphanous darling , would be all eyes , as the pavoninesun was all eyes on the gravel under the flowering trees , while in the midst of that oculate paradise , my freckled and raffish lass skipped , repeating the movements of so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damp-smelling sidewalksand ramparts of ancient Europe . Presently , she would hand the rope back to her little Spanish friend , and watch in her turn the repeated lesson , and brush away the hair from her brow , and fold her arms , and step on one toe with the other , or dropp166her hands loosely upon her still unflared hips , and I would satisfy myself that the damned staff had at last finished cleaning up our cottage ; whereupon , flashing a smile to the shy , darkhairedpage girl of my princess and thrusting my fatherly fingers deep into Lo 's hair from behind , and then gently but firmly clasping them around the nape of her neck , I would lead my reluctant pet to our small home for a quick connection before dinner . " Whose cat has scratched poor you ? " A full-blown fleshy handsome woman of the repulsive type to which I was particularlyattractive might ask me at the " lodge , " during a table d'hote dinner followed by dancing promised to Lo . This was one of the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , while Lo , on the other hand , would do her utmost to draw as many potential witnesses into her orbit as she could . She would be , figuratively speaking , wagging her tiny tail , her whole behind in fact as little bitches do  --  while some grinning stranger accosted us and began a bright conversation with a comparative study of license plates . " Long way from home ! " Inquisitive parents , in order to pump Lo about me , would suggesther going to a movie with their children . We had some close shaves . The waterfall nuisance pursued me of course in all our caravansaries . But I never realized how wafery their wall substance was until one evening , after I had loved too loudly , a neighbor 's masculine cough filled the pause as clearly as mine would have done ; and next morning as I was having breakfast at the milk bar ( Lo was a late sleeper , and I liked to bring her a pot of hot coffee in bed ) , my neighbor of the eve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose and a convention badge on his lapel , somehow managed to rig up a conversation with me , in the course of which he inquired , if my missus was like his missus a rather reluctant get-upper when not on the farm ; and had not the hideous danger I was skirting almost suffocatedme , I might have enjoyed the odd look of surprise on his thin-lipped weather-beaten face when I drily answered , as I slithered off my stool , that I was thank God a widower . How sweet it was to bring that coffee to her , and then deny itp167until she had done her morning duty . And I was such a thoughtfulfriend , such a passionate father , such a good pediatrician , attendingto all the wants of my little auburn brunette 's body ! My only grudge against nature was that I could not turn my Lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young matrix , her unknown heart , her nacreous liver , the sea-grapes of her lungs , her comely twin kidneys . On especially tropical afternoons , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of armchair leather against my massive nakedness as I held her in my lap . There she would be , a typical kid picking her nose while engrossed in the lighter sections of a newspaper , as indifferent to my ecstasy as if it were something she had sat upon , a shoe , a doll , the handle of a tennis racket , and was too indolent to remove . Her eyes would follow the adventures of her favorite strip characters : there was one well-drawn sloppy bobby-soxer , with high cheekbones and angular gestures , that I was not above enjoying myself ; she studied the photographic results of head-on collisions ; she never doubted the reality of place , time and circumstancealleged to match the publicity pictures of nakedthighedbeauties ; and she was curiously fascinated by the photographsof local brides , some in full wedding apparel , holding bouquets and wearing glasses . A fly would settle and walk in the vicinity of her navel or explore her tender pale areolas . She tried to catch it in her fist ( Charlotte 's method ) and then would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's explore your mind . Would sex crimes be reduced if children obeyed a few don'ts ?

She went on , her cheek ( recedent ) against mine ( pursuant ) and this was a good day , mark , 0 reader ! " If you do n't have a pencil , but are old enough to read  --  " " We , " I quip-quoted , " medieval mariners , have placed in this bottle  --  " " If , " she repeated , " you do n't have a pencil , but are oldp168enough to read and write  --  this is what the guy means , is n't it , you dope  --  scratch the number somehow on the roadside . " " With your little claws , Lolita . " She had entered my world , umber and black Humberland , with rash curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it seemed to me now that she was ready to turn away from it with something akin to plain repulsion . Never did she vibrate under my touch , and a strident " what d' you think you are doing ? " was all I got for my pains . To the wonderland I had to offer , my fool preferred the corniest movies , the most cloying fudge . To think that between a Hamburger and a Humburger , she would  --  invariably , with icy precision  --  plump for the former . There is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child . Did I mention the name of that milk bar I visited a moment ago ? It was , of all things , The Frigid Queen . Smiling a little sadly , I dubbed her My Frigid Princess . She did not see the wistful joke . Oh , do not scowl at me , reader , I do not intend to convey the impression that I did not manage to be happy . Reader must understand that in the possession and thralldom of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond happiness . For there is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet . It is hors contours , that bliss , it belongs to another class , another plane of sensitivity . Despite our tiffs , despite her nastiness , despite all the fuss and faces she made , and the vulgarity , and the danger , and the horrible hopelessness of it all , I still dwelled deep in my elected paradise  --  a paradise whose skies were the color of hell-flames  --  but still a paradise . The able psychiatrist who studies my case  --  and whom by now Dr. Humbert has plunged , I trust , into a state of leporine fascination  --  is no doubt anxious to have me take my Lolita to the seaside and have me find there , at last , the " gratification " ofp169a lifetime urge , and release from the " subconscious " obsession of an incomplete childhood romance with the initial little Miss Lee . Well , comrade , let me tell you that I did look for a beach , though I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirage of gray water , so many delights had already been granted me by my traveling companion that the search for a Kingdom by the Sea , a Sublimated Riviera , or whatnot , far from being the impulse of the subconscious , had become the rational pursuit of a purely theoretical thrill . The angels knew it , and arranged things accordingly . A visit to a plausible cove on the Atlantic side was completely messed up by foul weather . A thick damp sky , muddy waves , a sense of boundless but somehow matter-offactmist  --  what could be further removed from the crisp charm , the sapphire occasion and rosy contingency of my Riviera romance ? A couple of semitropical beaches on the Gulf , though bright enough , were starred and spattered by venomous beasties and swept by hurricane winds . Finally , on a Californian beach , facing the phantom of the Pacific , I hit upon some rather perverse privacy in a kind of cave whence you could hear the shrieks of a lot of girl scouts taking their first surf bath on a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fog was like a wet blanket , and the sand was gritty and clammy , and Lo was all gooseflesh and grit , and for the first time in my life I had as little desire for her as for a manatee . Perhaps , my learned readers may perk up if I tell them that even had we discovered a piece of sympathetic seaside somewhere , it would have come too late , since my real liberation had occurred much earlier : at the moment , in point of fact , when Annabel IIaze , alias Dolores Lee , alias Loleeta , had appeared to me , golden and brown , kneeling , looking up , on that shoddy veranda , in a kind of fictitious , dishonest , but eminently satisfactory seaside arrangement ( although there was nothing but a second-rate lake in the neighborhood ) . So much for those special sensations , influenced , if not actually brought about , by the tenets of modern psychiatry . Consequently , I turned away  --  I headed my Lolita away  --  from beaches which were either too bleak when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection , I suppose , of my hopeless hauntings of public parks in Europe , I was still keenly interested in outdoor activities and desirous of finding suitable playgrounds in the open where I had suffered such shameful privations . Here , too , I was to be thwarted . The disappointment I must now register ( as I gently grade my story into an expression of the continuous risk and dread that ran through my bliss ) should in no wise reflect on the lyrical , epic , tragic but never Arcadian American wilds . They are beautiful , heart-rendingly beautiful , those wilds , with a quality of wide-eyed , unsung , innocent surrenderthat my lacquered , toy-bright Swiss villages and exhaustivelylauded Alps no longer possess . Innumerable lovers have clipped and kissed on the trim turf of old-world mountainsides , on the innerspring moss , by a handy , hygienic rill , on rustic benches under the initialed oaks , and in so many cabanes in so many beech forests . But in the Wilds of America the open-air lover will not find it easy to indulge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants burn his sweetheart 's buttocks , nameless insects sting his ; sharp items of the forest floor prick his knees , insects hers ; and all around there abides a sustained rustle of potential snakes  --  que dis-je , of semi-extinct dragons !  --  while the crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling , in a hideous green crust , to gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike . I am exaggerating a little . One summer noon , just below timberline , where heavenly-hued blossoms that I would fain call larkspur crowded all along a purly mountain brook , we did find , Lolita and I , a secluded romantic spot , a hundred feet or so above the pass where we had left our car . The slope seemed untrodden . A last panting pine was taking a well-earned breather on the rock it had reached . A marmot whistled at us and withdrew . Beneath the lap-robe I had spread for Lo , dry flowers crepitated softly . Venus came and went . The jagged cliff crowningthe upper talus and a tangle of shrubs growing below us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alas , I had not reckoned with a faint side trail that curled up in cagey fashion among the shrubs and rocks a few feet from us.  |p171It  was then that we came closer to detection than ever before , and no wonder the experience curbed forever my yearning for rural amours . I remember the operation was over , all over , and she was weeping in my arms ;  --  a salutory storm of sobs after one of the fits of moodiness that had become so frequent with her in the course of that otherwise admirable year ! I had just retracted some silly promise she had forced me to make in a moment of blind impatient passion , and there she was sprawling and sobbing , and pinching my caressing hand , and I was laughing happily , and the atrocious , unbelievable , unbearable , and , I suspect , eternal horror that I know now was still but a dot of blacknessin the blue of my bliss ; and so we lay , when with one of those jolts that have ended by knocking my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unblinking dark eyes of two strange and beautiful children , faunlet and nymphet , whom their identical flat dark hair and bloodless cheeks proclaimed siblings if not twins . They stood crouching and gaping at us , both in blue playsuits , blending with the mountain blossoms . I plucked at the lap-robe for desperate concealment  --  and within the same instant , something that looked like a polka-dotted pushball among the undergrowth a few paces away , went into a turning motion which was transformed into the gradually rising figure of a stout lady with a raven-black bob , who automatically added a wild lily to her bouquet , while staring over her shoulder at us from behind her lovely carved bluestone children . Now that I have an altogether different mess on my conscience , I know that I am a courageous man , but in those days I was not aware of it , and I remember being surprised by my own coolness . With the quiet murmured order one gives a sweatstaineddistracted cringing trained animal even in the worst of plights ( what mad hope or hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars pierce the heart of the tamer ! ) , I made Lo get up , and we decorously walked , and then indecorously scuttled down to the car . Behind it a nifty station wagon was parked , and a handsome Assyrian with a little blue-black beard , un monsieur tres bien , in silk shirt and magenta slacks , ' pre/sumably the corpulent botanist 's husband , was gravely taking the picture of a signboard giving the altitude of the pass . It was well over io , 000 feet and I was quite out of breath ; and with a scrunch and a skid we drove off , Lo still struggling with her clothes and swearing at me in language that I never dreamed little girls could know , let alone use . There were other unpleasant incidents . There was the movie theatre once , for example . Lo at the time still had for the cinema a veritable passion ( it was to decline into tepid condescension during her second high school year ) . We took in , voluptuously and indiscriminately , oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred programs during that one year , and during some of the denser periods of movie-going we saw many of the newsreelsup to half-a-dozen times since the same weekly one went with different main pictures and pursued us from town to town . Her favorite kinds were , in this order : musicals , underworlders , westerners . In the first , real singers and dancers had unreal stage careers in an essentially grief-proof sphere of existence wherefromdeath and truth were banned , and where , at the end , whitehaired , dewy-eyed , technically deathless , the initially reluctant father of a show-crazy girl always finished by applauding her apotheosis on fabulous Broadway . The underworld was a world apart : there , heroic newspapermen were tortured , telephone bills ran to billions , and , in a robust atmosphere of incompetent marksmanship , villains were chased through sewers and storehousesby pathologically fearless cops ( I was to give them less exercise ) . Finally there was the mahogany landscape , the floridfaced , blue-eyed roughriders , the prim pretty schoolteacher arriving in Roaring Gulch , the rearing horse , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stupendous fist fight , the crashing mountain of dusty oldfashionedfurniture , the table used as a weapon , the timely somersault , the pinned hand still groping for the dropped bowie knife , the grunt , the sweet crash of fist against chin , the kick in the belly , the flying tackle ; and immediately after a plethora of pain that would have hospitalized a Hercules ( I should know by now ) , nothing to show but the rather becoming bruise on thep173bronzed cheek of the warmed-up hero embracing his gorgeous frontier bride . I remember one matinee in a small airless theatre crammed with children and reeking with the hot breath of popcorn . The moon was yellow above the neckerchiefed crooner , and his finger was on his strumstring , and his foot was on a pine log , and I had innocently encircled Lo 's shoulder and approached my jawbone to her temple , when two harpies behind us started muttering the queerest things  --  I do not know if I understood aright , but what I thought I did , made me withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show was fog to me . Another jolt I remember is connected with a little burg we were traversing at night , during our return journey . Some twenty miles earlier I had happened to tell her that the day school she would attend at Beardsley was a rather high-class , non-coeducationalone , with no modern nonsense , whereupon Lo treated me to one of those furious harangues of hers where entreaty and insult , self-assertion and double talk , vicious vulgarity and childish despair , were interwoven in an exasperating semblance of logic which prompted a semblance of explanation from me . Enmeshed in her wild words ( swell chance ... I 'd be a sap if I took your opinion seriously . . . Stinker . . . You ca n't boss me .. . I despise you . . . and so forth ) , I drove through the slumbering town at a fifty-mile-per-hour pace in continuance of my smooth highway swoosh , and a twosome of patrolmen put their spotlighton the car , and told me to pull over . I shushed Lo who was automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with malevolent curiosity . Suddenly all dimples , she beamed sweetly at them , as she never did at my orchideous masculinity ; for , in a sense , my Lo was even more scared of the law than I  --  and when the kind officers pardoned us and servilely we crawled on , her eyelids closed and fluttered as she mimicked limp prostration . At this point I have a curious confession to make . You will laugh  --  but really and truly I somehow never managed to find out quite exactly what the legal situation was . I do not know it yet . Oh , I have learned a few odds and ends . Alabama prohibits a guardian from changing the ward 's residence without an order of the court ; Minnesota . to whom I take off my hat , providesp174that when a relative assumes permanent care and custody of any child under fourteen , the authority of a court does not come into play . Query : is the stepfather of a gaspingly adorable pubescent pet , a stepfather of only one month 's standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , with the parapets of Europe , a divorce and a few madhouses behind him , is he to be considered a relative , and thus a natural guardian ? And if not , must I , and could I reasonably dare notify some Welfare Board and file a petition ( how do you file a petition ? ) , and have a court 's agent investigate meek , fishy me and dangerous Dolores Haze ? The many books on marriage , rape , adoption and so on , that I guiltily consulted at the public libraries of big and small towns , told me nothing beyond darkly insinuating that the state is the super-guardian of minor children . Pilvin and Zapel , if I remember their names right , in an impressivevolume on the legal side of marriage , completely ignored stepfathers with motherless girls on their hands and knees . My best friend , a social service monograph ( Chicago , 1936 ) , which was dug out for me at great pains from a dusty storage recess by an innocent old spinster , said " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court is passive and enters the fray only when the child 's situation becomes conspicuouslyperilous . " A guardian , I concluded , was appointed only when he expressed his solemn and formal desire ; but months might elapse before he was given notice to appear at a hearing and grow his pair of gray wings , and in the meantime the fair daemon child was legally left to her own devices which , after all , was the case of Dolores Haze . Then came the hearing . A few questions from the bench , a few reassuring answers from the attorney , a smile , a nod , a light drizzle outside , and the appointment was made . And still I dared not . Keep away , be a mouse , curl up in your hole . Courts became extravagantly active only when there was some monetary question involved : two greedy guardians , a robbed orphan , a third , still greedier , party . But here all was in perfect order , an inventory had been made , and her mother 's small property was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy seemed to be top175refrain from any application . Or would some busybody , some Humane Society , butt in if I kept too quiet ? Friend Farlow , who was a lawyer of sorts and ought to have been able to give me some solid advice , was too much occupied with Jean 's cancer to do anything more than what he had promised  --  namely , to look after Charlotte 's meager estate while I recovered very gradually from the shock of her death . I had conditioned him into believing Dolores was my natural child , and so could not expect him to bother his head about the situation . I am , as the reader must have gathered by now , a poor businessman ; but neither ignorance nor indolence should have prevented me from seeking professional advice elsewhere . What stopped me was the awful feeling that if I meddled with fate in any way and tried to rationalize her fantastic gift , that gift would be snatched away like that palace on the mountain top in the Oriental tale which vanished whenever a prospective owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly visible from afar between black rock and foundation . I decided that at Beardsley ( the site of Beardsley College for Women ) I would have access to works of reference that I had not yet been able to study , such as Woerner 's Treatise " On the American Law of Guardianship " and certain United States Children 's Bureau Publications . I also decided that anything was better for Lo than the demoralizing idleness in which she lived . I could persuade her to do so many things  --  their list might stupefy a professional educator ; but no matter how I pleaded or stormed , I could never make her read any other book than the so-called comic books or stories in magazines for American females . Any literature a peg higher smacked to her of school , and though theoretically willing to enjoy A Girl of the Limberlostor the Arabian Nights , or Little Women , she was quite sure she would not fritter away her " vacation " on such highbrow reading matter . I now think it was a great mistake to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Beardsley , instead of somehow scrambling across the Mexican border while the scrambling was good so as to lie low for a couple of years in subtropical blissp176until I could safely marry my little Creole . for I must confess that depending on the condition of my glands and ganglia , I could switch in the course of the same day from one pole of insanity to the other  --  from the thought that around 195o I would have to get rid somehow of a difficult adolescent whose magic nymphage had evaporated  --  to the thought that with patienceand luck I might have her produce eventually a nymphet with my blood in her exquisite veins , a Lolita the Second , who would be eight or nine around 1960 , when I would still be dans la force de l'dge ; indeed , the telescopy of my mind , or un-mind , was strong enough to distinguish in the remoteness of time a vieillard encore vert  --  or was it green rot ?  --  bizarre , tender , salivatingDr . Humbert , practicing on supremely lovely Lolita the Third the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wild journey of ours , I doubted not that as father to Lolita the First I was a ridiculous failure . I did my best ; I read and reread a book with the unintentionally biblical title Know Your Own Daughter , which I got at the same store where I bought Lo , for her thirteenth birthday , a de luxe volume with commercially " beautiful " illustrations , of Andersen 's The Little Mermaid . But even at our very best moments , when we sat reading on a rainy day ( Lo 's glance skipping from the window to her wrist watch and back again ) , or had a quiet hearty meal in a crowded diner , or played a childish game of cards , or went shopping , or silently stared , with other motorists and their children , at some smashed , blood-bespattered car with a young woman 's shoe in the ditch ( Lo , as we drove on : " That was the exact type of moccasin I was trying to describe to that jerk in the store " ) ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implausible a father as she seemed to be a daughter . Was , perhaps , guilty locomotion instrumental in vitiating our powers of impersonation ? Would improvement be orthc wing with a fixed domicile and a routine schoolgirl 's day ? In my choice of Beardsley I was guided not only by the fact of there being a comparatively sedate school for girls located there , but also by the presence of the women 's college . In my desire to get myself case , to attach myself somehow to somep177patterned surface which my stripes would blend with , I thought of a man I knew in the department of French at Beardsley College ; he was good enough to use my textbook in his classes and had attempted to get me over once to deliver a lecture . I had no intention of doing so , since , as I have once remarked in the course of these confessions , there are few physiques I loathe more than the heavy low-slung pelvis , thick calves and deplorablecomplexion of the average coed ( in whom I see , maybe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried alive ) ; but I did crave for a label , a background , and a simulacrum , and , as presently will become clear , there was a reason , a rather zany reason , why old Gaston Godin 's company would be particularly safe . Finally , there was the money question . My income was crackingunder the strain of our joy-ride . True , I clung to the cheaper motor courts ; but every now and then , there would be a loud hotel de luxe , or a pretentious dude ranch , to mutilate our budget ; staggering sums , moreover , were expended on sightseeingand Lo 's clothes , and the old Haze bus , although a still vigorous and very devoted machine , necessitated numerous minor and major repairs . In one of our strip maps that has happened to survive among the papers which the authorities have so kindly allowed me to use for the purpose of writing my statement , I find some jottings that help me compute the following . During that extravagant year 1947-1948 , August to August , lodgings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and repairs , 1,234 , and various extras almost as much ; so that during about 150 days of actual motion ( we covered about 27,000 miles ! ) plus some 200 days of interpolated standstills , this modest rentier spent around 8,000 dollars , or better say io , 000 because , unpractical as I am , I have surely forgotten a number of items , And so we rolled East , I more devastated than braced with the satisfaction of my passion , and she glowing with health , her bi-iliac garland still as brief as a lad 's , although she had added two inches to her stature and eight pounds to her weight . We had been everywhere . We had really seen nothing . And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiledp178with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely , trustful , dreamy , enormouscountry that by then , in retrospect , was no more to us than a collection of dog-eared maps , ruined tour books , old tires , and her sobs in the night  --  every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When , through decorations of light and shade , we drove up to 14 Thayer Street , a grave little lad met us with the keys and a note from Gaston who had rented the house for us . My Lo , without granting her new surroundings one glance , unseeingly turned on the radio to which instinct led her and lay down on the living room sofa with a batch of old magazines which in the same precise and blind manner she landed by dipping her hand into the nether anatomy of a lamp table . I really did not mind where to dwell provided I could lock my Lolita up somewhere ; but I had , I suppose , in the course of my correspondence with vague Gaston , vaguely visualized a house of ivied brick . Actually the place bore a dejected resem blance to the Haze home ( a mere 400 miles distant ) : it was the same sort of dull gray frame affair with a shingled roof and dull green drill awnings ; and the rooms , though smaller and furnished in a more consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My study turned out to be , however , a much larger room , lined from floor to ceiling with some two thousand books on chemistry which my landlord ( on sabbatical leave for the time being ) taught at Beardsley College . I had hoped Beardsley School for girls , an expensive day school , with lunch thrown in and a glamorous gymnasium , would , while cultivating all those young bodies , provide some formal education for their minds as well . Gaston Godin , who was seldom right in his judgment of American habitus , had warned me that the institution might turn out to be one ofp179those where girls are taught , as lie put it with a foreigner 's love for such things : " not to spell very well , but to smell very well . " I do n't think they achieved even that . At my first interview with headmistress Pratt , . she approved of my child 's " nice blue eyes " ( blue ! Lolita ! ) and of my own friendship with that " French genius " ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned Dolly over to a Miss Cormorant , she wrinkled her brow in a kind of recueillement and said : " We are not so much concerned , Mr. Ilumbird , with having our students become bookworms or he able to reel off all the capitals of Europe which nobody knows anyway , or learn by heart the dates of forgotten battles . What we are concerned with is the adjustment of the child to group life . This is why we stress the four D 's : Dramatics , Dance , Debating and Dating . We are confronted by certain facts . Your delightful Dolly will presently enter an age group where dates , dating , date dress , date book , date etiquette , mean as much to her as , say , business , business connections , business success , mean to you , or as much as smiling the happiness of my girls means to mc . Dorothy Humbird is already involved in a whole system of social life which consists , whether we like it or not , of hot-dog stands , corner drugstores , malts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches , and even hair-fixing parties ! Naturally at Beardsley School we disapprove of some of these activities ; and we rechannel others into more constructive directions . But we do try to turn our backs on the fog and squarely face the sunshine . To put it briefly , while adopting certain teaching techniques , we are more interested in communication than in composition . That is , with due respect to Shakespeare and others , we want our girls to communicate freely with the live world around them rather than plunge into musty old books . We are still groping perhaps , but we grope intelligently , like a gynecologistfeeling a tumor . We think , Dr. Ilumburg , in organismal and organizational terms . We have done away with the mass of irrelevant topics that have traditionally been presented to young girls , leaving no place , in former days , for the knowledges and the skills , and the attitudes they will need in managingp180their lives and  --  as the cynic might add  --  the lives of their husbands . Mr. Humberson , let us put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the most practical spot for an icebox in the kitchen may be even more important to the budding housewife . You say that all you expect a child to obtain from school is a sound education . But what do we mean by education ? In the old days it was in the main a verbal phenomenon ; I mean , you could have a child learn by heart a good encyclopediaand he or she would know as much as or more than a school could offer . Dr. Hummer , do you realize that for the modern pre-adolescent child , medieval dates are of less vital value than weekend ones twinkle ?  --  to repeat a pun that 1 heard the Beardsley college psychoanalyst permit herself the other day . We live not only in a world of thoughts , but also in a world of things . Words without experience are meaningless . What on earth can Dorothy Hummerson care for Greece and the Orient with their harems and slaves ? " This program rather appalled me , but I spoke to two intelligentladies who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls did quite a bit of sound reading and that the " communication " line was more or less ballyhoo aimed at giving old-fashioned Beardsley School a financially remunerativemodern touch , though actually it remained as prim as a prawn . Another reason attracting me to that particular school may seem funny to some readers , but it was very important to me , for that is the way I am made . Across our street , exactly in front of our house , there was , I noticed , a gap of weedy wasteland , with some colorful bushes and a pile of bricks and a few scatteredplanks , and the foam of shabby mauve and chrome autumn roadside flowers ; and through that gap you could see a shimmery section of School Rd. , running parallel to our Thayer St. , and immediately beyond that , the playground of the school . Apart from the psychological comfort this general arrangement should afford me by keeping Dolly 's day adjacent to mine , I immediatelyforesaw the pleasure I would have in distinguishing fromp181my study-bedroom , by means of powerful binoculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children playing around Dolly during recess ; unfortunately , on the very first day of school , workmen arrived and put up a fence some way down the gap , and in no time a construction of tawny wood maliciously arose beyond that fence utterly blocking my magic vista ; and as soon as they had erected a sufficient amount of material to spoil everything , those absurd builders suspended their work and never appeared again . In a street called Thayer Street , in the residential green , fawn , and golden of a mellow academic townlet , one was bound to have a few amiable fine-dayers yelping at you . I prided myself on the exact temperature of my relations with them : never rude , always aloof . My west-door neighbor , who might have been a businessman or a college teacher , or both , would speak to me once in a while as he barbered some late garden blooms or watered his car , or , at a later date , defrosted his driveway ( I do n't mind if these verbs are all wrong ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like conventional assents or **26;8793;TOOLONG , precluded any evolution toward chumminess . Of the two houses flanking the bit of scrubby waste opposite , one was closed , and the other contained two professors of English , tweedy and short-haired Miss Lester and fadedly feminine Miss Fabian , whose only subject of brief sidewalk conversation with me was ( God bless their tact ! ) the young loveliness of my daughter and the naive charm of Gaston Godin . My east-door neighbor was by far the most dangerous one , a sharp-nosed stock character whose late brother had been attached to the College as Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds . remember her waylaying Dolly , while I stood at the livingroomwindow , feverishly awaiting my darling 's return fromp182school . The odious spinster , trying to conceal her morbid in quisitiveness under a mask of dulcet goodwill , stood leaning on her slim umbrella ( the sleet had just stopped , a cold wet sun had sidled out ) , and Dolly , her brown coat open despite the raw weather , her structural heap of books pressed against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sheepish frightened little smile flitting over and off her snubnosedface , which  --  owing perhaps to the pale wintry light  --  looked almost plain , in a rustic , German , magdlein-like way , as she stood there and dealt with Miss East 's questions " And where is your mother , my dear ? And what is your poor father 's occupation ? And where did you live before ? " Another time the loathsome creature accosted me with a welcoming whine  --  but I evaded her ; and a few days later there came from her a note in a blue-margined envelope , a nice mixture of poison and treacle , suggesting Dolly come over on a Sunday and curl up in a chair to look through the " loads of beautiful books my dear mother gave me when I was a child , instead of having the radio on at full blast till all hours of the night . " I had also to be careful in regard to a Mrs. Holigan , a charwomanand cook of sorts whom I had inherited with the vacuum cleaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that this was no trouble , and I had become adept at providingher with a big breakfast and warming up the dinner that Mrs. Holigan prepared before leaving . That kindly and harmlesswoman had , thank God , a rather bleary eye that missed details , and I had become a great expert in bedmaking ; but still I was continuously obsessed by the feeling that some fatal stain had been left somewhere , or that , on the rare occasions where Holigan 's presence happened to coincide with Lo 's , simple Lo might succumb to buxom sympathy in the course of a cozy kitcheh chat . I often felt we lived in a lighted house of glass , and that any moment some thin-lipped parchment face would peer through a carelessly unshaded window to obtain a free glimpse of things that the most jaded voyeur would have paid a small fortune to watchp183A word about Gaston Godin . The main reason why I enjoyed  --  or at least tolerated with relief  --  his company was the spell of absolute security that his ample person cast on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no special reason to confide in him , and he was much too self-centered and abstract to notice or suspect anything that might lead to a frank question on his part and a frank answer on mine . He spoke well of me to Beardsleyans , he was my good herald . Had he discovered Ines gouts and Lolita 's status , it would have interested him only insofar as throwing some light on the simplicity of my attitude toward him , which attitude was as free of polite strain as it was of ribald allusions ; for despite his colorless mind and dim memory . he was perhaps aware that I knew more about him than the burghers of Beardsley did . He was a flabby , dough-faced , melancholybachelor tapering upward to a pair of narrow , not quite level shoulders and a conical pear-head which had sleek black hair on one side and only a few plastered wisps on the other . But the lower part of his body was enormous , and he ambulated with a curious elephantine stealth by means of phenomenally stout legs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seldom bathed ; his English was a burlesque . And , nonetheless , everybody considered him to be a supremely lovable , lovably freakish fellow ! Neighbors pampered him ; he knew by name all the small boys in our vicinity ( he lived a few blocks away from me ) and had some of them clean his sidewalk and burn leaves in his back yard , and bring wood from his shed , and even perform simple chores about the house , and he would feed them fancy chocolates , with real liqueurs inside  --  in the privacy of an orientally furnished den iii his basement , with amusing daggers and pistols arrayed on the moldy , rug-adorned walls among the camouflaged hot-water pipes . Upstairs he had a studio  --  he painted a little , the old fraud . He had decorated its sloping wall ( it was really not more than a garret ) with large photographs of pensive Andre Gide , T'chaikovsky , Norman Douglas , two other well-known English writers , Nijinsky ( allp184thighs and fig leaves ) , Harold D. Doublename ( a misty-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these poor people seemed about to fall on you from their inclined plane . He had also an album with snapshots of all the Jackies and Dickies of the neighborhood , and when I happened to thumb through it and make some casual remark , Gastonwould purse his fat lips and murmur with a wistful pout " Oui , ils sont gentils . " His brown eyes would roam around the various sentimental and artistic bric-a-brac present , and his own banal toiles ( the conventionally primitive eyes , sliced guitars , blue nipples and geometrical designs of the day ) , and with a vague gesture toward a painted wooden bowl or veined vase , he would say " Prenez donc une de ces poires . La bonne dame d'en f ace m'en o f f re plus que je n'en peux savourer . " Or : " Mississe Taille Lore vient de me donner ces dahlias , belles fleurs que j'execre . " ( Somber , sad , full of world-weariness . ) For obvious reasons , I preferred my house to his for the games of chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some old battered idol as he sat with his pudgy hands in his lap and stared at the board as if it were a corpse . Wheezing he would meditate for ten minutes  --  then make a losing move . Or the good man , after even more thought , might utter : Au roil with a slow old-dog woof that had a gargling sound at the back of it which made his jowls wabble ; and then he would lift his circumflexeyebrows with a deep sigh as I pointed out to him that he was in check himself . Sometimes , from where we sat in my cold study I could hear Lo 's bare feet practicing dance techniques in the living room downstairs ; but Gaston 's outgoing senses were comfortably dulled , and he remained unaware of those naked rhythmsand-one , and-two , and-one , and-two , weight transferred on a straight right leg , leg up and out to the side , and-one , and-two , and only when she started jumping , opening her legs at the height of the jump , and flexing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and landing on her toes  --  only then did my pale , pompous , morose opponent rub his head or cheek as if confusing those distant thuds with the awful stabs of my formidable Queenp185Sometimes Lola would slouch in while we pondered the board  --  and it was every time a treat to see Gaston , his elephant eye still fixed on his pieces , ceremoniously rise to shake hands with her , and forthwith release her limp fingers , and without looking once at her , descend again into his chair to topple into the trap I had laid for him . One day around Christmas , after I had not seen him for a fortnight or so , he askea me " Et toutes vos fillettes , elles vont Bien ? " from which it became evident to me that he had multiplied my unique Lolita by the number of sartorial categories his downcast moody eye had glimpsed during a whole series of her appearances : blue jeans , a skirt , shorts , a quilted robe .

I would have hardly alluded to him at all had not his Beardsley existence had such a queer bearing on my case . I need him for my defense . There he was devoid of any talent whatsoever , a mediocre teacher , a worthless scholar , a glum repulsive fat old invert , highly contemptuous of the American way of life , triumphantlyignorant of the English language  --  there he was in priggish New England , crooned over by the old and caressed by the young  --  oh , having a grand time and fooling everybody ; and here was I.I am now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definitedrop in Lolita 's morals . If her share in the ardors she kindled had never amounted to much , neither had pure lucre ever come to the fore . But I was weak , I was not wise , my schoolgirlnymphet had me in thrall . With the human element dwindling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only increased ; and of this she took advantage . Her weekly allowance , paid to her under condition she fulfill her basic obligations , was twenty one cents at the start of the  |p186Beardsley  era  --  and went up to one dollar five before its end . This was a more than generous arrangement seeing she constantlyreceived from me all kinds of small presents and had for the asking any sweetmeat or movie under the moon  --  although , of course , I might fondly demand an additional kiss , or even a whole collection of assorted caresses , when I knew she coveted very badly some item of juvenile amusement . She was , however , not easy to deal with . Only very listlessly did she earn her three pennies  --  or three nickels  --  per day ; and she proved to be a cruel negotiator whenever it was in her power to deny me certain lifewrecking , strange , slow paradisal philters without which I could not live more than a few days in a row , and which , because of the very nature of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing the magic and might of her own soft mouth , she managed  --  duringone schoolyear !  --  to raise the bonus price of a fancy embrace to three , and even four bucks , 0 Reader ! Laugh not , as you imagine me , on the very rack of joy noisily emitting dimes and quarters , and great big silver dollars like some sonorous , jingly and wholly demented machine vomiting riches ; and in the margin of that leaping epilepsy she would firmly clutch a handful of coins in her little fist , which , anyway , I used to pry open afterwards unless she gave me the slip , scrambling away to hide her loot . And just as every other day I would cruise all around the school area and on comatose feet visit drugstores , and peer into foggy lanes , and listen to receding girl laughter in between my heart throbs and the falling leaves , so every now and then I would burgle her room and scrutinize torn papers in the wastebasket with the painted roses , and look under the pillow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found eight one-dollar notes in one of her books ( fittingly  --  Treasure Island ) , and once a hole in the wall behind Whistler 's Mother yielded as much as twenty-four dollars and some change  --  say twenty-four sixty  --  which I quietly removed , upon which , next day , she accused , to my face , honest Mrs. Holigan of being a filthy thief . Eventually , she lived up to her I.Q. by finding a safer hoarding place which I never discovered ; but by that time I had brought prices down drastically by having her earn thep187hard and nauseous way permission to participate in the school 's theatrical program ; because what I feared most was not that she might ruin me , but that she might accumulate sufficient cash to run away . I believe the poor fierce-eyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dollars in her purse she might somehowreach Broadway or Hollywood  --  or the foul kitchen of a diner ( Help Wanted ) in a dismal ex-prairie state , with the wind blowing , and the stars blinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barmen , and everything soiled , torn , dead . I did my best , your Honor , to tackle the problem of boys . Oh , I used even to read in the Beardsley Star a so-called Column for Teens , to find out how to behave ! A word to fathers . Do n't frighten away daughter 's friend . Maybe it is a bit hard for you to realize that now the boys are finding her attractive . To you she is still a little girl . To the boys she 's charming and fun , lovely and gay . They like her . Today you clinch big deals in an executive 's office , but yesterday you were just highschool Jim carrying Jane 's school books . Remember ? Do n't you want your daughter , now that her turn has come , to be happy in the admiration and companyof boys she likes ? Do n't you want them to have wholesomefun together ? Wholesome fun ? Good Lord ! Why not treat the young fellows as guests in your house ? Why not make conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel at ease ? Welcome , fellow , to this bordello . If she breaks the rules do n't explode out loud in front of her partner in crime . Let her take the brunt of your displeasurein private . And stop making the laoys feel she 's the daughter of an old ogre.  |p188First  of all the old ogre drew up a list under " absolutely forbidden " and another under " reluctantly allowed . " Absolutely forbidden were dates , single or double or triple  --  the next step being of course mass orgy . She might visit a candy bar with her girl friends , and there giggle-chat with occasional young males , while I waited in the car at a discreet distance ; and I promised her that if her group were invited by a socially acceptablegroup in Butler 's Academy for Boys for their annual ball ( heavily chaperoned , of course ) , I might consider the questionwhether a girl of fourteen can don her first " formal " ( a kind of gown that makes thin-armed teen-agers look like flamingoes ) . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to which she would be allowed to invite her prettier girl friends and the nicer boys she would have met by that time at the Butler dance . But I was quite positive that as long as my regime lasted she would never , never be permitted to go with a youngster in rut to a movie , or neck in a car , or go to boy-girl parties at the houses of schoolmates , or indulge out of my earshot in boy-girl telephone conversations , even if " only discussing his relations with a friend of mine . " Lo was enraged by all this  --  called me a lousy crook and worse  --  and I would probably have lost my temper had I not soon discovered , to my sweetest relief , that what really angered her was my depriving her not of a specific satisfaction but of a general right . I was impinging , you see , on the conventional program , the stock pastimes , the " things that are done , " the routine of youth ; for there is nothing more conservative than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most auburn and russet , the most mythopoeic nymphet in October 's orchard-haze . Do not misunderstand me . I can not be absolutely certain that in the course of the winter she did not manage to have , in a casual way , improper contacts with unknown young fellows ; of course , no matter how closely I controlled her leisure , there would constantly occur unaccounted-for time leaks with **25;8821;TOOLONG to stop them up in retrospect ; of course , my jealousy would constantly catch its jagged claw in the fine fabrics of nymphet falsity ; but I did definitely feel  --  and can nowp189vouchsafe for the accuracy of my feeling  --  that there was no reason for serious alarm . I felt that way not because I never once discovered any palpable hard young throat to crush among the masculine mutes that flickered somewhere in the background ; but because it was to me " overwhelmingly obvious " ( a favorite expression with my aunt Sybil ) that all varieties of high school boys  --  from the perspiring nincompoop whom " holding hands " thrills , to the self-sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sophisticated young mistress . " All this noise about boys gags me , " she had scrawled on the inside of a schoolbook , and underneath , in Mona 's hand ( Mona is due any minute now ) , there was the sly quip : " What about Rigger ? " ( due too ) . Faceless , then , are the chappies I happened to see in her company . There was for instance Red Sweater who one day , the day we had the first snow  --  saw her home ; from the parlor window I observed them talking near our porch . She wore her first cloth coat with a fur collar ; there was a small brown cap on my favorite hairdo  --  the fringe in front and the swirl at the sides and the natural curls at the back  --  and her damp-dark moccasins and white socks were more sloppy than ever . She pressed as usual her books to her chest while speaking or listening , and her feet gestured all the time : she would stand on her left instep with her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock slightly , sketch a few steps , and then start the series all over again . There was Windbreaker who talked to her in front of a restaurant one Sunday afternoon while his mother and sister attempted to walk me away for a chat ; I dragged along and looked back at my only love . She had developed more than one conventional mannerism , such as the polite adolescent way of showing one is literally " doubled up " with laughter by inclining one 's head , and so ( as she sensed my call ) , still feigning helpless merriment , she walked backward a couple of steps , and then faced about , and walked toward me with a fading smile . On the other hand , I greatly liked  --  perhaps because it reminded me of her first unforgettableconfession  --  her trick of sighing " oh dear ! " in humorouswistful submission to fate , or emitting a long " no-o " in ap190deep almost growling undertone when the blow of fate had actually fallen . Above all  --  since we are speaking of movement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Thayer Street on her beautiful young bicycle : rising on the pedals to work on them lustily , then sinking back in a languid posture while the speed wore itself off ; and then she would stop at our mailbox and , still astride , would flip through a magazine she found there , and put it back , and press her tongue to one side of her upperlip and push off with her foot , and again sprint through pale shade and sun . On the whole she seemed to me better adapted to her surroundingsthan I had hoped she would be when considering my spoiled slave-child and the bangles of demeanor she naively affected the winter before in California . Although I could never get used to the constant state of anxiety in which the guilty , the great , the tenderhearted live , I felt I was doing my best in the way of mimicry . As I lay on my narrow studio bed after a session of adoration and despair in Lolita 's cold bedroom , I used to review the concluded day by checking my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind 's red eye . I watched dark-and-handsome , not un-Celtic , probably high-church , possiblyvery high-church , Dr. Humbert see his daughter off to school . I watched him greet with his slow smile and pleasantly arched thick black ad-eyebrows good Mrs. Holigan , who smelled of the plague ( and would head , I knew , for master 's gin at the first opportunity ) . With Mr. West , retired executioner or writer of religious tracts  --  who cared ?  --  I saw neighbor what 's his name , I think they are French or Swiss , meditate in his frank-windowed study over a typewriter , rather gaunt-profiled , an almost Hitlerian cowlick on his pale brow . Weekends , wearing a well-tailored overcoatand brown gloves , Professor H. might be seen with his daughter strolling to Walton Inn ( famous for its violet-ribboned china bunnies and chocolate boxes among which you sit and wait for a " table for two " still filthy with your predecessor 's crumbs ) . Seen on weekdays , around one p.M. , saluting with dignity ArguseyedEast while maneuvering the car out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down onto the slippery road . Raisingp191a cold eye from book to clock in the positively sultry Beardsley College library , among bulky young women caught and petrified in the overflow of human knowledge . Walking across the campus with the college clergyman , the Rev. Rigger ( who also taught Bible in Beardsley School ) . " Somebody told me her mother was a celebrated actress killed in an airplane accident . Oh ? My mistake , I presume . Is that so ? I see . How sad . " ( Sublimating her mother , eh ? ) Slowly pushing my little pram through the labyrinthof the supermarket , in the wake of Professor W. , also a slow-moving and gentle widower with the eyes of a goat . Shovelingthe snow in my shirt-sleeves , a voluminous black and white muffler around my neck . Following with no show of rapacious haste ( even taking time to wipe my feet on the mat ) my schoolgirldaughter into the house . Taking Dolly to the dentist  --  pretty nurse beaming at her  --  old magazines  --  ne inontrez pas vos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar II . Humbert was seen eating his steak in the continental knife-and-fork manner . Enjoying , in duplicate , a concert : two marble-faced , becalmedFrenchmen sitting side by side , with Monsieur H. H. 's musical little girl on her father 's right , and the musical little boy of Professor W. ( father spending a hygienic evening in Providence ) on Monsieur G. G. 's left . Opening the garage , a square of light that engulfs the car and is extinguished . Brightly pajamaed , jerking down the window shade in Dolly 's bedroom . Saturdaymorning , unseen , solemnly weighing the winter-bleached lassie in the bathroom . Seen and heard Sunday morning , no churchgoer after all , saying do n't be too late , to Dolly who is bound for the covered court . Letting in a queerly observant schoolmate of Dolly 's : " First time I 've seen a man wearing a smoking jacket , sir  --  except in movies , of course . " Her girl friends , whom I had looked forward to meet , proved on the whole disappointing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avis Chapman , and Eva Rosen , and Mona Dahl ( save one , all these names are approximations , of course ) . Opal was a bashful , formless , bespectacled , bepimpled creature who doted on Dolly who bullied her . With Linda Hall the school tennis champion , Dolly played singles at least twice a week : I suspect Linda was a true nymphet , but for some unknown reason she did not come  --  was perhaps not allowed to come  --  to our house ; so I recall her only as a flash of natural sunshine on an indoor court . Of the rest , none had any claims to nymphetry except Eva Rosen . Avis was a plump lateral child with hairy legs , while Mona , though handsome in a coarse sensual way and only a year older than my aging mistress , had obviously long ceased to be a nymphet , if she ever had been one . Eva Rosen , a displaced little person from France , was on the other hand a good example of a not strikingly beautiful child revealing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , such as a perfect pubescent figure and lingering eyes and high cheekbones . Her glossy copper hair had Lolita 's silkiness , and the features of her delicate milky-white face with pink lips and silverfish eyelashes were less foxy than those of her likes  --  the great clan of intra-racial redheads ; nor did she sport their green uniform but wore , as I remember her , a lot of black or cherry dark  --  a very smart black pullover , for instance , and high-heeled black shoes , and garnet-red fingernail polish . I spoke French to her ( much to Lo 's disgust ) . The child 's tonalities were still admirablypure , but for school words and play words she resorted to current American and then a slight Brooklyn accent would crop up in her speech , which was amusing in a little Parisian who went to a select New England school with phoney British aspirations . Unfortunately , despite " that French kid 's uncle " being " a millionaire , " Lo dropped Eva for some reason before I had had time to enjoy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reader knows what importance I attached to having a bevy of page girls , consolation prize nymphets , around my Lolita . For a while , I endeavored to interest my senses in Mona Dahl who was a good deal around , especially during the spring term when Lo and she got so enthusiastic about dramatics . I have often wondered what secrets outrageously treacherousp193Dolores Haze had imparted to Mona while blurting out to me by urgent and well-paid request various really incredible details concerning an affair that Mona had had with a marine at the sea , side . It was characteristic of Lo that she chose for her closest chum that elegant , cold , lascivious , experienced young female whom I once heard ( misheard , Lo swore ) cheerfully say in the hallway to Lo  --  who had remarked that her ( Lo 's ) sweater was of virgin wool : " The only thing about you that is , kiddo . . . " She had a curiously husky voice , artificially waved dull dark hair , earrings , amber-brown prominent eyes and luscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her loading herself with so much costume jewelry . Her hands trembled . She was burdened with a 15o I.Q. And I also knew she had a tremendous chocolatebrownmole on her womanish back which I inspected the night Lo and she had worn low-cut pastel-colored , vaporous dresses for a dance at the Butler Academy . I am anticipating a little , but I can not help running my memoryall over the keyboard of that school year . In meeting my attempts to find out what kind of boys Lo knew , Miss Dahl was elegantly evasive . Lo who had gone to play tennis at Linda 's country club had telephoned she might be a full half hour late , and so , would I entertain Mona who was coming to practice with her a scene from The Taming of the Shrew . Using all the modulations , all the allure of manner and voice she was capable of and staring at me with perhaps  --  could I be mistakcn ?  --  a faint gleam of crystalline irony , beautiful Mona replied : " Well , sir , the fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , we are rivals . She and I have a crush on the Reverend Rigger . " ( This was a joke  --  I have already mentioned that gloomy giant of a man , with the jaw of a horse : he was to bore me to near murder with his impressions of Switzerland at a tea party for parents that I am unable to place correctly in terms of time . ) How had the ball been ? Oh , it had been a riot . A what ? A panic . Terrific , in a word . Had Lo danced a lot ? Oh , not a frightfullot , just as much as she could stand . What did she , languorousMona , think of Lo ? Sir ? Did she think Lo was doing well at school ? Gosh , she certainly was quite a kid . But her general be-194havior was  --  ? Oh , she was a swell kid . But still ? " Oh , she 's a doll , " concluded Mona , and sighed abruptly , and picked up a book that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expression , falsely furrowing her brow , inquired : " Do tell me about Ball Zack , sir . Is he really that good ? " She moved up so close to my chair that I made out through lotions and creams her uninterestingskin scent . A sudden odd thought stabbed me : was my Lo playing the pimp ? If so , she had found the wrong substitute . Avoiding Mona 's cool gaze , I talked literature for a minute . Then Dolly arrived  --  and slit her pale eyes at us . I left the two friends to their own devices . One of the latticed squares in a small cobwebby casement window at the turn of the staircase was glazed with ruby , and that raw wound among the unstained rectangles and its asymmetrical position  --  a knight 's move from the top  --  always strangely disturbed me . Sometimes .. . Come on , how often exactly , Bert ? Can you recall four , five , more such occasions ? Or would no human heart have survived two or three ? Sometimes ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Lolita would be haphazardly preparingher homework , sucking a pencil , lolling sideways in an easy chair with both legs over its arm , I would shed all my pedagogic restraint , dismiss all our quarrels , forget all my masculinepride  --  and literally crawl on my knees to your chair , my Lolita ! You would give me one look  --  a gray furry question mark of a look : " Oh no , not again " ( incredulity , exasperation ) ; for you never deigned to believe that I could , without any specific designs , ever crave to bury my face in your plaid skirt , my darling ! The fragility of those bare arms of yours  --  how I longed to enfold them , all your four limpid lovely limbs , a folded colt , and take your head between my unworthy hands , and pull the templeskinback on both sides , and kiss your chinesed eyes , and  --  " Pulease , leave me alone , will you , " you would say , " for Christ'sp195sake leave me alone . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , your face deliberately twitching in imitation of my tic nerveux . But never mind , never mind , I am only a brute , never mind , let us go on with my miserable story . One Monday forenoon , in December I think , Pratt asked me to come over for a talk . Dolly 's last report had been poor , I knew . But instead of contenting myself with some such plausibleexplanation of this summons , I imagined all sorts of horrors , and i , had to fortify myself with a pint of my " pin " before I could face the interview . Slowly , all Adam 's apple and heart , I went up the steps of the scaffold . A huge woman , gray-haired , frowsy , with a broad flat nose and small eyes behind black-rimmed glasses  --  " Sit down , " she said , pointing to an informal and humiliating hassock , while she perched with ponderous spryness on the arm of an oak chair . For a moment or two , she peered at me with smiling curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recalled , but I could afford then to scowl back . Her eye left me . Site lapsed into thought  --  probably assumed . Making up her mind she rubbed , fold on fold , her dark gray flannel skirt at the knee , dispelling a trace of chalk or something . Then she said , still rubbing , not looking up : " Let me ask a blunt question , Mr. Haze . You are an oldfashionedContinental father , are n't you ? " " Why , no " I said , " conservative , perhaps , but not what you would call old-fashioned . " She sighed , frowned , then clapped her big plump hands together in a **26;8848;TOOLONG manner , and again fixed her beady eyes upon me . " Dolly Haze , " she said , " is a lovely child , but the onset of sexual maturing seems to give her trouble . " I bowed slightly . What else could I do ?  | " She is still shuttling , " said Miss Pratt , showing how with her liver-spotted hands , " between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lovely  --  " " I beg your pardon , " I said , " what zones ? " " That 's the old-fashioned European in you ! " cried Pratt deliveringa slight tap on my wrist watch and suddenly disclosing her dentures . " All I mean is that biologic and psychologic drives  --  do you smoke ?  --  are not fused in Dolly , do not fall so to speak into a  --  into a rounded pattern . " Her hands held for a moment an invisible melon . " She is attractive , bright though careless " ( breathing heavily , without leaving her perch , the woman took time out to look at the lovely child 's report sheet on the desk at her right ) . " Her marks are getting worse and worse . Now I wonder , Mr. Haze  --  " Again the false meditation . " Well , " she went on with zest , " as for me , I do smoke , and , as dear Dr. Pierce used to say : I 'm not proud of it but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke she exhaled from her nostrils was like a pair of tusks . " Let me give you a few details , it wo n't take a moment . Now let me see rummaging among her papers . She is defiant toward Miss Redcock and impossibly rude to Miss Cormorant . Now here is one of our special research reports : Enjoys singing with group in class though mind seems to wander . Crosses her knees and wags left leg to rhythm . Type of by-words : a two-hundredforty-twoword area of the commonest pubescent slang fenced in by a number of obviously European polysyllabics . Sighs a good deal in class . Let me see . Yes . Now comes the last week in November . Sighs a good deal in class . Chews gum vehemently . Does not bite her nails though if she did , this would conform better to her general pattern  --  scientifically speaking , of course . Menstruation , according to the subject , well established . Belongsat present to no church organization . By the way , Mr. Haze , her mother was  --  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody 's business is , I suppose , God 's business . Something else we wanted to know . She has no regular home duties , I understand . Making a princess of your Dolly , Mr. Haze , eh ? Well , what else have wep197got here ? Handles books gracefully . Voice pleasant . Giggles rather often . A little dreamy . Has private jokes of her own , transposingfor instance the first letters of some of her teachers names . Hair light and dark brown , lustrous  --  well laughing you are aware of that , I suppose . Nose unobstructed , feet high-arched , eyes  --  let me see , I had here somewhere a still more recent report . Aba , here we are . Miss Gold says Dolly 's tennis form is excellent to superb , even better than Linda Hall 's , but concentrationand point-accumulation are just " poor to fair . " Miss Cormorant can not decide whether Dolly has exceptional emotionalcontrol or none at all . Miss Horn reports she  --  I mean , Dolly  --  can not verbalize her emotions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfine . Miss Molar thinks Dolly is myopic and should see a good ophthalmologist , but Miss Redcock insists that the girl simulates eye-strain to get away with scholastic incompetence . And to conclude , Mr. Haze , our researchers are wondering about something really crucial . Now I want to ask you something . I want to know if your poor wife , or yourself , or anyone else in the family  --  I understand she has several aunts and a maternal grandfather in California ?  --  oh , had !  --  I 'm sorry  --  well , we all wonder if anybody in the family has instructed Dolly in the process of mammalian reproduction . The general impression is that fifteen-year-old Dolly remains morbidly uninterested in sexual matters , or to be exact , repressesher curiosity in order to save her ignorance and selfdignity . All right  --  fourteen . You see , Mr. Haze , Beardsley School does not believe in bees and blossoms , and storks and love birds , but it does believe very strongly in preparing its students for mutually satisfactory mating and successful child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only she would put her mind to her work . Miss Cormorant 's report is significant in that respect . Dolly is inclined to be , mildly speaking , impudent . But all feel that primo , you should have your family doctor tell her the facts of life and , secundo , that you allow her to enjoy the company of her schoolmates ' brothers at the Junior Club or in Dr. Rigger 's organization , or in the lovely homes of our parents . " " She may meet boys at her own lovely home , " I said.  | " I hope she will , " said Pratt buoyantly . " When we questioned her about her troubles , Dolly refused to discuss the home situation , but we have spoken to some of her friends and really  --  well , for example , we insist you un-veto her nonparticipation in the dramatic group . You just must allow her to take part in The Hunted Enchanters . She was such a perfect little nymph in the try-out , and sometime in spring the author will stay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal or two in our new auditorium . I mean it is all part of the fun of being young and alive and beautiful . You must understand  --  " " I always thought of myself , " I said , " as a very understanding father . " " Oh no doubt , no doubt , but Miss Cormorant thinks , and I am inclined to agree with her , that Dolly is obsessed by sexual thoughts for which she finds no outlet , and will tease and martyrizeother girls , or even our younger instructors because they do have innocent dates with boys . " Shrugged my shoulders . A shabby emigre . " Let us put our two heads together , Mr. Haze . What on earth is wrong with that child ? " " She seems quite normal and happy to me , " I said ( disaster coming at last ? was I found out ? had they got some hypnotist ? ) . " What worries me , " said Miss Pratt looking at her watch and starting to go over the whole subject again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonistic , dissatisfied , cagey  --  and everybody wonders why you are so firmly opposed to all the natural recreations of a normal child . " " Do you mean sex play ? " I asked jauntily , in despair , a corneredold rat . " Well , I certainly welcome this civilized terminology , " said Pratt with a grin . " But this is not quite the point . Under the auspices of Beardsley School , dramatics , dances and other natural activities are not technically sex play , though girls do meet boys , if that is what you object to . " " All right , " I said , my hassock exhaling a weary sign . " You win . She can take part in that play . Provided male parts are taken by female parts . "  | " I am always fascinated , " said Pratt , " by the admirable way foreigners  --  or at least naturalized Americans  --  use our rich language . I 'm sure Miss Gold , who conducts the play group , will be overjoyed . I notice she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I mean who seem to find Dolly manageable . This takes care of general topics , I guess ; now comes a special matter . We are in trouble again . " Pratt paused truculently , then rubbed her index finger under her nostrils with such vigor that her nose performed a kind of war dance . " I 'm a frank person , " she said , " but conventions are conventions , and I find it difficult ... Let me put it this way . . . The Walkers , who live in what we call around here the Duke 's Manor , you know the great gray house on the hill  --  they send their two girls to our school , and we have the niece of President Moore with us , a really gracious child , not to speak of a number of other prominent children . Well , under the circumstances , it is rather a jolt when Dolly , who looks like a little lady , uses words which you as a foreigner probably simply do not know or do not understand . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Dolly come up here right away to discuss things ? No ? You see  --  oh well , let 's have it out . Dolly has written a most obscene four-letter word which our Dr. Cutler tells me is lowMexicanfor urinal with her lipstick on some health pamphlets which Miss Redcock , who is getting married in June , distributed among the girls , and we thought she should stay after hoursanother half hour at least . But if you like  --  " " No , " I said , " I do n't want to interfere with rules . I shall talk to her later . I shall thrash it out . " " Do , " said the woman rising from her chair arm . " And perhapswe can get together again soon , and if things do not improvewe might have Dr. Cutler analyze her . " Should I marry Pratt and strangle her ? " ... And perhaps your family doctor might like to examine her physically  --  just a routine check-up . She is in Mushroom  --  the last classroom along that passage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous girlsp200school in England by having " traditional " nicknames for its various classrooms : Mushroom , Room-In 8 , B-room , Room-BA and so on . Mushroom was smelly , with a sepia print of Reynolds ' " Age of Innocence " above the chalkboard , and several rows of clumsy-looking pupil desks . At one of these , my Lolita was reading the chapter on " Dialogue " in Baker 's Dramatic Technique , and all was very quiet , and there was another girl with a very naked , porcelain-white neck and wonderful platinum hair , who sat in front reading too , absolutely lost to the world and inter . minably winding a soft curl around one finger , and I sat beside Dolly just behind that neck and that hair , and unbuttoned my overcoat and for sixty-five cents plus the permission to participate in the school play , had Dolly put her inky , chalky , red-knuckled hand under the desk . Oh , stupid and reckless of me , no doubt , but after the torture I had been subjected to , I simply had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never occur again . Around Christmas she caught a bad chill and was examined by a friend of Miss Lester , a Dr. Ilse Tristramson ( hi , use , you were a dear , uninquisitive soul , and you touched my dove very gently ) . She diagnosed bronchitis , patted Lo on the back ( all its bloom erect because of the fever ) and put her to bed for a week or longer . At first she " ran a temperature " in American parlance , and I could not resist the exquisite caloricity of unexpected delights  --  Venusfebriculosa  --  though it was a very languid Lolita that moaned and coughed and shivered in my embrace . And as soon as she was well again , I threw a Party with Boys . Perhaps I had drunk a little too much in preparation for the ordeal . Perhaps I made a fool of myself . The girls had decorated and plugged in a small fir tree  --  German custom , except that colored bulbs had superseded wax candles . Records were chosen and fed into my landlord 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted bodice and flared skirt . Humming , I retiredp201to my study upstairs  --  and then every ten or twenty minutes I would come down like an idiot just for a few seconds ; to pick up ostensibly my pipe from the mantelpiece or hunt for the newspaper ; and with every new visit these simple actions became harder to perform , and I was reminded of the dreadfully distant days when I used to brace myself to casually enter a room in the Ramsdale house where Little Carmen was on . The party was not a success . Of the three girls invited , one did not come at all , and one of the boys brought his cousin Roy , so there was a superfluity of two boys , and the cousins knew all the steps , and the other fellows could hardly ( lance at all , and most of the evening was spent in messing up the kitchen , and then endlessly jabbering about what card game to play , and sometime later , two girls and four boys sat on the floor of the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game which Opal could not be made to understand , while Mona and Roy , a lean handsome lad , drank ginger ale in the kitchen , sitting on the table and dangling their legs , and hotly discussing Predestinationand the Law of Averages . After they had all gone my Lo said ugh , closed her eyes , and dropped into a chair with all four limbs starfished to express the utmost disgust and exhaustionand swore it was the most revolting bunch of boys she had ever seen . I bought her a new tennis racket for that remark . January was humid and warm , and February fooled the forsythia : none of the townspeople had ever seen such weather . Other presents came tumbling in . For her birthday I bought her a bicycle , the doe-like and altogether charming machine already mentioned  --  and added to this a History of Modern American Painting : her bicycle manner , I mean her approach to it , the hip movement in mounting , the grace and so on , afforded me supremepleasure ; but my attempt to refine her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the guy noon-napping on Doris Lee 's hay was the father of the pseudo-voluptuous hoyden in the foreground , and could not understand why I said Grant Wood or Peter Hurd was good , and Reginald March or Frederick Waugh awful.  |p202By  the time spring had touched up Thayer Street with yellow and green and pink , Lolita was irrevocably stage-struck . Pratt , whom I chanced to notice one Sunday lunching with some people at Walton Inn , caught my eye from afar and went through the motion of sympathetically and discreetly clapping her hands while Lo was not looking . I detest the theatre as being a primitive and putrid form , historically speaking ; a form that smacks of stone-age rites and communal nonsense despite those individual injections of genius , such as , say , Elizabethan poetry which a closeted reader automatically pumps out of the stuff . Being much occupied at the time with my own literary labors , I did not bother to read the complete text of The Enchanted Hunters , the playlet in which Dolores Haze was assigned the part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witch , or Diana , or something , and who , having got hold f a book on hypnotism , plunges a number of lost hunters into various entertaining trances before falling in her turn under the spell of a vagabond poet ( Mona Dahl ) . That much I gleaned from bits of crumpled and poorly typed script that Lo sowed all over the house . The coincidence of the title with the name of an unforgettable inn was pleasant in a sad little way : I wearily thought I had better not bring it to my own enchantress 's notice , lest a brazen accusation of mawkishness hurt me even more than her failure to notice it for herself had done . I assumed the playlet was just another , practically anonymous , version of some banal legend . Nothing prevented one , of course , from supposing that in quest of an attractive name the founder of the hotel had been immediately and solely influenced by the chance fantasy of the second-rate muralist he had hired , and that subsequently the hotel 's name had suggested the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent mind I happened to twist it the other way round , and without giving the whole matter much thought really , supposed that mural , name and title had all been derived from a common source , from some local tradition , which I , an alien unversed in New England lore , would not be supposed to know ,  |p203In  consequence I was under the impression ( all this quite casually , you understand , quite outside any orbit of importance ) that the accursed playlet belonged to the type of whimsey for juvenile consumption , arranged and rearranged many times , such as Hansel and Gretel by Richard Roe , or The Sleeping Beauty by Dorothy Doe , or The Emperor 's New Clothes by Maurice Vermont and Marion Rumpelmeyer  --  all this to be found in any Plays for School Actors or Let 's Have a Play ! In other words , I did not know  --  and would not have cared , if I did  --  that actually The Enchanted Hunters was a quite recent and technically original composition which had been produced for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group in New York . To me  --  inasmuch as I could judge from my charmer 's part  --  it seemed to be a pretty dismal kind of fancy work , with echoes from Lenormand and Maeterlinck and various quiet British dreamers . The red-capped , uniformly attired hunters , of which one was a banker , another a plumber , a third a policeman , a fourth an undertaker , a fifth an underwriter , a sixth an escaped convict ( you see the possibilities ! ) , went through a complete change of mind in Dolly 's Dell , and remembered their real lives only as dreams or nightmares from which little Diana had aroused them ; but a seventh Hunter ( in a green cap , the fool ) was a Young Poet , and he insisted , much to Diana 's annoyance , that she and the entertainment provided ( dancing nymphs , and elves , and monsters ) were his , the Poet 's , invention . I understand that finally , in utter disgust at this cocksureness , barefooted Dolores was to lead check-trousered Mona to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the braggard she was not a poet 's fancy , but a rustic , down-to-brown-earth lass  --  and a lastminutekiss was to enforce the play 's profound message , namely , that mirage and reality merge in love . I considered it wiser not to criticize the thing in front of Lo : she was so healthily engrossed in " problems of expression , " and so charmingly did she put her narrow Florentine hands together , batting her eyelashes and pleading with me not to come to rehearsals as some ridiculousparents did because she wanted to dazzle me with a perfect First Night  --  and because I was , anyway , always butting in andp204saying the wrong thing , and cramping her style in the presence of other people . There was one very special rehearsal . . . my heart , my heart .. . there was one day in May marked by a lot of gay flurry  --  it all rolled past , beyond my ken , immune to my memory , and when I saw Lo next , in the late afternoon , balancing on her bike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young birch tree on the edge of our lawn , I was so struck by the radiant tenderness of her smile that for an instant I believed all our troubles gone . " Can you remember , " she said , " what was the name of that hotel , you know nose puckered , come on , you know  --  with those white columns and the marble swan in the lobby ? Oh , you know noisy exhalation of breath  --  the hotel where you raped me . Okay , skip it . I mean , was it almost in a whisper The EnchantedHunters ? Oh , it was ? musingly Was it ? "  --  and with a yelp of amorous vernal laughter she slapped the glossy bole and tore uphill , to the end of the street , and then rode back , feet at rest on stopped pedals , posture relaxed , one hand dreaming in her print-flowered lap.  |p205Because  it supposedly tied up with her interest in dance and dramatics , I had permitted Lo to take piano lessons with a Miss Emperor ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-shuttered little white house a mile or so beyond Beardsley Lo would spin off twice a week . One Friday night toward the end of May ( and a week or so after the very special rehearsal Lo had not had me attend ) the telephone in my study , where I was in the act of mopping up Gustave 's  --  I mean Gaston 's  --  king'sside , rang and Miss Emperor asked if Lo was comingnext Tuesday because she had missed last Tuesday 's and today 's lessons . I said she would by all means  --  and went on with the game . As the reader may well imagine , my faculties were now impaired , and a move or two later , with Gaston to play , I noticedthrough the film of my general distress that he could collect my queen ; he noticed it too , but thinking it might be a trap on the part of his tricky opponent , he demurred for quite a minute , and puffed and wheezed , and shook his jowls , and even shot furtive glances at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying to take that juicy queen and not daring  --  and all of a sudden he swooped down upon it ( who knows if it did not teach him certain later audacities ? ) , and I spent a dreary hour in achieving a draw . He finished his brandy and presently lumbered away , quite satisfied with this result ( mon pauvre ami , je ne vous ai jamais revu et quoiqu'il y ait bien peu de chance que vous voyiez mon livre , permettez-moi de vous dire que je vous serre la main bien cordialement , et que toutes mes fillettes vous saluent ) . I found Dolores Haze at the kitchen table , consuming a wedge of pie , with her eyes fixed on her script . They rose to meet mine with a kind of celestial vapidity . She remained singularly unruffled when confronted with my discovery , and said d'un petit air faussement contrit that she knew she was a very wicked kid , but simply had not been able to resist the enchantment , and had used up those music hours  --  O Reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic forest scene with Mona . I said " fine "  --  and stalked to the telephone . Mona 's mother answered : " Oh yes , she 's in " and retreatedwith a mother 's neutral laugh of polite pleasure to shout off stage " Roy calling ! " and the very next moment Mona rustled up , and forthwith , in a low monotonous not untender voice started berating Roy for something he had said or done and I interrupted her , and presently Mona was saying in her humblest , sexiest contralto , " yes , sir , " " surely , sir , " " I am alone to blame , sir , in this unfortunate business , " ( what elocution ! what poise ! ) " honest , I feel very bad about it "  --  and so on and so forth as those little harlots say . So downstairs I went clearing my throat and holding my heart . Lo was now in the living room , in her favorite overstuffed chair . As she sprawled there , biting at a hangnail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time rocking a stool upon which she had placed the heel of an outstretchedp206shoeless foot , I perceived all at once with a sickening qualm how much she had changed since I first met her two years ago . Or had this happened during those last two weeks ? Tendresse ? Surely that was an exploded myth . She sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger . The fog of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity . Oh , she had changed ! Her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an unwashedface and does not mind what soiled texture , what pustulateepidermis comes in contact with her skin . Its smooth tender bloom had been so lovely in former days , so bright with tears , when I used to roll , in play , her tousled head on my knee . A coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence . What was locally known as a " rabbit cold " had painted with flaming pink the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze , it mechanically slid along the underside of her tensely stretched bare thigh  --  how polished and muscular her legs had grown ! She kept her wide-set eyes , clouded-glass gray and slightly bloodshot , fixed upon me , and I saw the stealthy thought showing through them that perhaps after all Mona was right , and she , orphan Lo , could expose me without getting penalized herself . How wrong I was . How mad I was ! Everythingabout her was of the same exasperating impenetrable order  --  the strength of her shapely legs , the dirty sole of her white sock , the thick sweater she wore despite the closeness of the room , her wenchy smell , and especially the dead end of her face with its strange flush and freshly made-up lips . Some of the red had left stains on her front teeth , and I was struck by a ghastly recollection  --  the evoked image not of Monique , but of another young prostitute in a bell-house , ages ago , who had been snapped up by somebody else before I had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling disease , and who had just such flushed prominent pommettes and a dead maman , and big front teeth , and a bit of dingy red ribbon in her country-brown hair . " Well , speak , " said Lo . " Was the corroboration satisfactory ? "  | " Oh , yes , " I said . " Perfect . Yes . And I do not doubt you two made it up . As a matter of fact , I do not doubt you have told her everything about us . " " Oh , yah ? " I controlled my breath and said : " Dolores , this must stop right away . I am ready to yank you out of Beardsley and lock you up you know where , but this must stop . I am ready to take you away the time it takes to pack a suitcase . This must stop or else anythingmay happen . " " Anything may happen , huh ? " I snatched away the stool she was rocking with her heel and her foot fell with a thud on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it easy . " " First of all you go upstairs , " I cried in my turn ,  --  and simultaneouslygrabbed at her and pulled her up . From that moment , I stopped restraining my voice , and we continued yelling at each other , and she said unprintable things . She said she loathed me . She made monstrous faces at me , inflating her cheeks and producing a diabolical plopping sound . She said I had attempted to violate her several times when I was her mother 's roomer . She said she was sure I had murdered her mother . She said she would sleep with the very first fellow who asked her and I could do nothing about it . I said she was to go upstairs and show me all her hiding places . It was a strident and hateful scene . I held her by her knobby wrist and she kept turning and twisting it this way and that , surreptitiously trying to find a weak point so as to wrench herself free at a favorable moment , but I held her quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope my heart may rot , and once or twice she jerked her arm so violently that I feared her wrist might snap , and all the while she stared at me with those unforgettable eyes where cold anger and hot tears struggled , and our voices were drowning the telephone , and when I grew aware of its ringing she instantly escaped . With people in movies I seem to share the services of the machina telephonica and its sudden god . This time it was an irate neighbor . The east window happened to be agape in thep208living room , with the blind mercifully down , however ; and behindit the damp black night of a sour New England spring had been breathlessly listening to us . I had always thought that type of haddocky spinster with the obscene mind was the result of considerable literary inbreeding in modern fiction ; but now I am convinced that prude and prurient Miss East  --  or to explode her incognito , Miss Fenton Lebone  --  had been probably protruding three-quarter-way from her bedroom window as she strove to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . lacks all sense of . . . " quacked the receiver , " we do not live in a tenement here . I must emphatically ... " I apologized for my daughter 's friends being so loud . Youngpeople , you know  --  and cradled the next quack and a half . Downstairs the screen door banged . Lo ? Escaped ? Through the casement on the stairs I saw a small impetuous ghost slip through the shrubs ; a silvery dot in the dark  --  hub of bicycle wheel  --  moved , shivered , and she was gone . It so happened that the car was spending the night in a repair shop downtown . I had no other alternative than to pursue on foot the winged fugitive . Even now , after more than three years have heaved and elapsed , I can not visualize that spring-night street , that already so leafy street , without a gasp of panic . Before their lighted porch Miss Lester was promenading Miss Fabian 's dropsical dackel . Mr. Hyde almost knocked it over . Walk three steps and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnutleaves . At the next corner , pressing Lolita against an iron railing , a blurred youth held and kissed  --  no , not her , mistake . My talons still tingling , I flew on . Half a mile or so east of number fourteen , Thayer Street tangles with a private lane and a cross street ; the latter leads to the town proper ; in front of the first drugstore , I saw  --  with what melody of relief !  --  Lolita 's fair bicycle waiting for her . I pushed instead of pulling , pulled , pushed , pulled , and entered . Look out ! Some ten paces away Lolita , through the glass of a telephone booth ( membranous god still with us ) , cupping the tube , confidentially hunched over it , slit her eyes at me , turned awayp209with her treasure , hurriedly hung up , and walked out with a flourish . " Tried to reach you at home , " she said brightly . " A great decision has been made . But first buy me a drink , dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice , pour in the coke , add the cherry syrup  --  and my heart was bursting with love-ache . That childish wrist . My lovely child . You have a lovely child , Mr. Humbert . We always admire her as she passes by . Mr. Pim watched Pippa suck in the concoction . J'ai toujours admire l'ceuvre ormonde du sublime Dublinois . And in the meantime the rain had become a voluptuous shower . " Look , " she said as she rode the bike beside me , one foot scraping the darkly glistening sidewalk , " look , I 've decided something . I want to leave school . I hate that school . I hate the play , I really do ! Never go back . Find another . Leave at once . Go for a long trip again . But this time we 'll go wherever I want , wo n't we ? " I nodded . My Lolita . " I choose ? C'est entendu ? " she asked wobbling a little beside me . Used French only when she was a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lenore , or you 'll get soaked . " ( A storm of sobs was filling my chest . ) She bared her teeth and after her adorable school-girl fashion , leaned forward , and away she sped , my bird . Miss Lester 's finely groomed hand held a porch-door open for a waddling old dog qui prenait son temps . Lo was waiting for me near the ghostly birclitree . " I am drenched , " she declared at the top of her voice . " Are you glad ? To hell with the play ! See what I mean ? " An invisible hag 's claw slammed down an upper-floor window . In our hallway , ablaze with welcoming lights , my Lolita peeled off her sweater , shook her gemmed hair , stretched towards me two bare arms , raised one knee : " Carry me upstairs , please . I feel sort of romantic to-night . " It may interest physiologists to learn , at this point , that I have the ability  --  a most singular case , I presume  --  of shedding torrentsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waterpipes unclogged , the valves ground , and a number of other repairs and improvements were paid for by not very mechanically-minded but prudent papa Humbert , so that the late Mrs. Humbert 's car was in respectable shape when ready to undertake a new journey . We had promised Beardsley School , good old Beardsley School , that we would be back as soon as my Hollywood engagementcame to an end ( inventive Humbert was to be , I hinted , chief consultant in the production of a film dealing with " existentialism , " still a hot thing at the time ) . Actually I was toying with the idea of gently trickling across the Mexican border  --  I was braver now than last year  --  and there deciding what to do with my Iittle concubine who was now sixty inches tall and weighed ninety pounds . We had dug out our tour books and maps . She had traced our route with immense zest . Was it thanks to those theatricals that she had now outgrown her juvenile jaded airs and was so adorably keen to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pale but warm Sunday morning when we abandoned Professor Chem 's puzzled house and sped along Main Street toward the four-lane highway . My Love 's striped , black-and-white , cotton frock , jaunty blue cap , white socks and brown moccasins were not quite in keeping with the large beautifully cut aquamarine on a silver chainlet , which gemmed her throat : a spring rain gift from me . We passed the New Hotel , and she laughed . " A penny for your thoughts , " I said and she stretched out her palm at once , but at that moment I had to apply the brakes rather abruptly at a red light . As we pulled up , another car came to a gliding stop alongside , and a very striking looking , athletically lean young woman ( where had I seen her ? ) with a high complexion and shoulderlengthbrilliant bronze hair , greeted Lo with a ringing " Hi ! "  --  and then , addressing me , effusively , edusively ( placed ! ) , stressing certain words , said : " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you should have heard the author raving about her after that rehearsal  --  " " Green light , you dope , " said Lop211under her breath , and simultaneously , waving in bright adieu a bangled arm , Joan of Arc ( in a performance we saw at the local theatre ) violently outdistanced us to swerve into Campus Avenue . " Who was it exactly ? Vermont or Rumpelmeyer ? " " No  --  Edusa Gold  --  the gal who coaches us . " " I was not referring to her . Who exactly concocted that play ? " " Oh ! Yes , of course . Some old woman , Clare Something , I guess . There was quite a crowd of them there . " " So she complimented you ? " " Complimented my eye  --  she kissed me on my pure brow "  --  and my darling emitted that new yelp of merriment which  --  perhaps in connection with her theatrical mannerisms  --  she had lately begun to affect . " You are a funny creature , Lolita , " I said  --  or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up that absurd stage business . But what is curious is that you dropped the whole thing only a week before its natural climax . Oh , Lolita , you should be careful of those surrenders of yours . I remember you gave up Ramsdale for camp , and camp for a joyride , and I could list other abrupt changes in your disposition . You must be careful . There are things that should never be given up . You must persevere . You should try to be a little nicer to mc , Lolita . You should also watch your diet . The tour of your thigh , you know , should not exceed seventeen and a half inches . More might be fatal ( I was kidding , of course ) . We are now setting out on a long happy journey . I remember  --  " I remember as a child in Europe gloating over a map of North America that had " Appalachian Mountains " boldly running from Alabama up to New Brunswick , so that the whole region they spanned  --  Tennessee , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire and Maine , appeared to myp212imagination as a gigantic Switzerland or even Tibet , all mountain , glorious diamond peak upon peak , giant conifers , le montagnard emigre in his bear skin glory , and Felis tigris goldsmithi , and Red Indians under the catalpas . That it all boiled down to a measly suburban lawn and a smoking garbage incinerator , was appalling . Farewell , Appalachia ! Leaving it , we crossed Ohio , the three states beginning with " I , " and Nebraska  --  ah , that first whiff of the West ! We travelled very leisurely , having more than a week to reach Wace , Continental Divide , where she passionately desired to see the Ceremonial Dances marking the seasonal opening of Magic Cave , and at least three weeks to reach Elphinstone , gem of a western State where she yearned to climb Red Rock from which a mature screen star had recently jumped to her death after a drunken row with her gigolo . Again we were welcomed to wary motels by means of inscriptionsthat read : " We wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully checked upon your arrival . Your license number is on record here . Use hot water sparingly . We reserve the right to eject without notice any objectionable person . Do not throw waste material of any kind in the toilet bowl . Thank you . Call again . The Management . P.S. We consider our guests the Finest People of the World . " In these frightening places we paid ten for twins , flies queued outside at the screenless door and successfully scrambled in , the ashes of our predecessors still lingered in the ashtrays , a woman 's hair lay on the pillow , one heard one 's neighbor hanging his coat in his closet , the hangers were ingeniously fixed to their bars by coils of wire so as to thwart theft , and , in crowning insult , the pictures above the twin beds were identical twins . I also noticed that commercial fashion was changing . There was a tendency for cabins to fuse and gradually form the caravansary , and , lo ( she was not interested but the reader may be ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew in , and cars were removed to a communalgarage , and the motel reverted to the good old hotel . I now warn the reader not to mock me and my mental daze . It is easy for him and me to decipher now a past destiny ; but ap213destiny in the making is , believe me , not one of those honest mystery stories where all you have to do is keep an eye on the clues . In my youth I once read a French detective tale where the clues were actually in italics ; but that is not McFate 's way  --  even if one does learn to recognize certain obscure indications . For instance : I would not swear that there was not at least one occasion , prior to , or at the very beginning of , the Midwest lap of our journey , when she managed to convey sonic information to , or otherwise get into contact with , a person or persons unknown . ' We had stopped at a gas station , tinder the sign of Pegasus , and she had slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premises while the raised hood , under which I had bent to watch the mechanic 's manipulations , hid her for a moment from my sight . Being inclined to be lenient , I only shook my benign head though strictly speaking such visits were taboo , since I felt instinctively that toilets  --  as also telephones  --  happened to be for reasons unfathomable , the points where my destiny was liable to catch . We all have such fateful objects  --  it may be a recurrent landscape in one case , a number in another  --  carefully chosen by the gods to attract events of special significance for us : here shall John always stumble ; there shall Jane 's heart always break . Well  --  my car had been attended to , and I had moved it away from the pumps to let a pickup truck be serviced  --  when the growing volume of her absence began to weigh upon me in the windy grayness . Not for the first time , and not for the last , had I stared in such dull discomfort of mind at those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to find themselves in the stranded traveller 's field of vision : that green garbage can , those very black , very whitcwallcd tires for sale , those bright cans of motor oil , that red icebox with assorted drinks , the four , five , seven discarded bottles within the incompletedcrossword puzzle of their wooden cells , that bug patiently walking up the inside of the window of the office . Radio music was coming from its open door , and because the rhythm was not synchronized with the heave and flutter and other gestures of wind-animated vegetation , one had the impression of an oldp214scenic film living its own life while piano or fiddle followed a line of music quite outside the shivering flower , the swaying branch . The sound of Charlotte 's last sob incongruously vibrated through me as , with her dress fluttering athwart the rhythm , Lolita veered from a totally unexpected direction . She had found the toilet occupied and had crossed over to the sign of the Conche in the next block . They said there they were proud of their home-clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been provided for your comments . No postcards . No soap . Nothing . No comments . That day or the next , after a tedious drive through a land of food crops , we reached a pleasant little burg and put up at Chestnut Court  --  nice cabins , damp green grounds , apple trees , an old swing  --  and a tremendous sunset which the tired child ignored . She had wanted to go through Kasbeam because it was only thirty miles north from her home town but on the following morning I found her quite listless , with no desire to see again the sidewalk where she had played hopscotch some five years before . For obvious reasons I had rather dreaded that side trip , even though we had agreed not to make ourselves conspicuous in any way  --  to remain in the car and not look up old friends . My relief at her abandoning the project was spoiled by the thought that had she felt I were totally against the nostalgic possibilities of Pisky , as I had been last year , she would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sigh , she sighed too and complained of being out of sorts . She wanted to remain in bed till teatime at least , with lots of magazines , and then if she felt better she suggested we just continue westward . I must say she was very sweet and languid , and craved for fresh fruits , and I decided to go and fetch her a toothsome picnic lunch in Kasbeam . Our cabin stood on the timbered crest of a hill , and from our window you could see the road winding down , and then running as straight as a hair parting between two rows of chestnuttrees , towards the pretty town , which looked singularly distinct and toylike in the pure morning distance . One could make out an elf-like girl on an insect-like bicycle , and a dog , a bit too large proportionately , all as clear as those pilgrims andp215mules winding up wax-pale roads in old paintings with blue hills and red little people . I have the European urge to use my feet when a drive can be dispensed with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a plain plump girl with pigtails , followed by a huge St. Bernard dog with orbits like pansies . In Kasbeam a very old barber gave me a very mediocre haircut : he babbled of a baseball-playing son of his , and , at every explodent , spat into my neck , and every now and then wiped his glasses on my sheet-wrap , or interrupted his tremulous scissor work to producefaded newspaper clippings , and so inattentive was I that it came as a shock to realize as he pointed to an easeled photographamong the ancient gray lotions , that the mustached young ball player had been dead for the last thirty years . I had a cup of hot flavorless coffee , bought a bunch of bananas for my monkey , and spent another ten minutes or so in a delicatessenstore . At least an hour and a half must have elapsed when this homeward-bound little pilgrim appeared on the winding road leading to Chestnut Castle . The girl I had seen on my way to town was now loaded with linen and engaged in helping a misshapen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Bcrtoldo " character in low Italian comedy . They were cleaning the cabins of which there was a dozen or so on Chestnut Crest , all pleasantly spaced amid the copious verdure . It was noon , and most of them , with a final bang of their screen doors , had already got rid of their occupants . A very elderly , almost mummy-like couple in a very new model were in the act of creeping out of one of the contiguousgarages ; from another a red hood protruded in somewhatcod-piece fashion ; and nearer to our cabin , a strong and handsome young man with a shock of black hair and blue eyes was putting a portable refrigerator into a station wagon . For some reason he gave me a sheepish grin as I passed . On the grass expanse opposite , in the many-limbed shade of luxuriant trees , the familiar St. Bernard dog was guarding his mistress ' bicycle , and nearby a young woman , far gone in the family way , had seated a rapt baby on a swing and was rocking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making a nuisance of himself byp216trying to push or pull the swing board ; he finally succeeded in getting himself knocked down by it , and bawled loudly as he lay supine on the grass while his mother continued to smile gently at neither of her present children . I recall so clearly these minutiae probably because I was to check my impressions so thoroughly only a few minutes later ; and besides , something in me had been on guard ever since that awful night in Beardsley . I now refused to be diverted by the feeling of well-being that my walk had engendered  --  by the young summer breeze that envelopedthe nape of my neck , the giving crunch of the damp gravel , the juicy tidbit I had sucked out at last from a hollow tooth , and even the comfortable weight of my provisions which the general condition of my heart should not have allowed me to carry ; but even that miserable pump of mine seemed to be working sweetly , and I felt adolori d'amoureuse langueur , to quote dear old Ronsard , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To my surprise I found her dressed . She was sitting on the edge of the bed in slacks and T-shirt , and was looking it me as if she could not quite place me . The frank soft shape of her small breasts was brought out rather than blurred by the limpness of her thin shirt , and this frankness irritated me . She had not washed ; yet her mouth was freshly though smudgily painted , and her broad teeth glistened like wine-tinged ivory , or pinkish poker chips . And there she sat , hands clasped in her lap , and dreamily brimmed with a diabolical glow that had no relation to me whatever . I plumped down my heavy paper bag and stood staring at the bare ankles of her sandaled feet , then at her silly face , then again at her sinful feet . " You 've been out , " I said ( the sandals were filthy with gravel ) . " I just got up , " she replied , and added upon intercepting my downward glance : " Went out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " She became aware of the bananas and uncoiled herself tableward . What special suspicion could I have ? None indeed  --  but those muddy , moony eyes of hers , that singular warmth emanating  |p217from  her ! I said nothing . I looked at the road meandering so distinctly within the frame of the window ... Anybody wishing to betray my trust would have found it a splendid lookout . With rising appetite , Lo applied herself to the fruit . All at once I remembered the ingratiating grin of the Johnny nextdoor . I stepped out quickly . All cars had disappeared except his station wagon ; his pregnant young wife was now getting into it with her baby and the other , more or less cancelled , child . " What 's the matter , where are you going ? " cried Lo from the porch . I said nothing . I pushed her softness back into the room and went in after her . I ripped her shirt off . I unzipped the rest of her . I tore off her sandals . Wildly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent I travelled upon was so slight as to be practically undistinguishable from a madman 's fancy . Gros Gaston , in his prissy way , had liked to make presents  --  presents just a prissy wee bit out of the ordinary , or so he prissily thought . Noticing one night that my box of chessmen was broken , he sent me next morning , with a little lad of his , a copper case : it had an elaborate Oriental design over the lid and could be securely locked . One glance sufficed to assure me that it was one of those cheap money boxes called for some reason " luizettas " that you buy in Algiers and elsewhere , and wonder what to do with afterwards . It turned out to be much too flat for holding my bulky chessmen , but I kept it  --  using it for a totally different purpose . In order to break some pattern of fate in which I obscurely felt myself being enmeshed , I had decided  --  despite La 's visible annoyance  --  to spend another night at Chestnut Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ascertained that Lo was still sound asleep ( mouth open , in a kind of dull amazement at the curiously inane life we all had rigged up for her ) and satisfied my/self that the precious contents of the " luizetta " were safe . There , snugly wrapped in a white woollen scarf , lay a pocket automatic : caliber .32 , capacity of magazine 8 cartridges , length a little under one ninth of Lolita 's length , stock checked walnut , finish full blued . I had inherited it from the late Harold Haze , with a 1938 catalog which cheerily said in part : " Particularly well adapted for use in the home and car as well as on the person . " There it lay , ready for instant service on the person or persons , loaded and fully cocked with the slide lock in safety position , thus precluding any accidental discharge . We must remember that a pistol is the Freudian symbol of the Ur-father 's central forelimb . I was now glad I had it with me  --  and even more glad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pine forest around my and Charlotte 's glass lake . Farlow , with whom I had roamed those remote woods , was an admirable marksman , and with his .38 actually managed to hit a humming bird , though I must say not much of it could be retrieved for proof  --  only a little iridescentfluff . A burley ex-policeman called Krestovski , who in the twenties had shot and killed two escaped convicts , joined us and bagged a tiny woodpecker  --  completely out of season , incidentally . Between those two sportsmen I of course was a novice and kept missing everything , though I did wound a squirrel on a later occasion when I went out alone . " You lie here , " I whispered to my light-weight compact little chum , and then toasted it with a dram of gin . The reader must now forget Chestnuts and Colts , and accompanyus further west . The following days were marked by a number of great thunderstorms  --  or perhaps , there was but one single storm which progressed across country in ponderous frogleapsand which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off detective Trapp : for it was during those days that the problemp219of the Aztec Red Convertible presented itself to me , and quite overshadowed the theme of Lo 's lovers . Queer ! I who was jealous of every male we met  --  queer , how I misinterpreted the designations of doom . Perhaps I had been lulled by Lo 's modest behavior in winter , and anyway it would have been too foolish even for a lunatic to suppose another Humbert was avidly following Humbert and I Iumbcrt 's nymphet with Jovian fireworks , over the great and ugly plains . I surmised , done , that the Red Yak keeping behind us at a discreet distance mile after mile was operated by a detective whom some busybodyhad hired to see what exactly Humbert I Iinnbcrt was doing with that minor stepdaughter of his . As happens with me at periods of electrical disturbance and crepitating lightnings , I had hallucinations . Maybe they were more than hallucinations . I do not know what she or he , or both had put into my liquor but one night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , and I flung it open , and noticed two things -- that I was stark naked and that , white-glistening in the rain-dripping darknessthere stood a man holding before his face the mask of JuttingChin , a grotesque sleuth in the funnies . Ile emitted a muffled guffaw and scurried away , and I reeled back into the room , and fell asleep again , and am not sure even to this day that the visit was not a drug-provoked dream : I have thoroughly studied Trapp 's type of humor , and this might have been a plausible sample . Oh , crude and absolutely ruthless ! Somebody , I imagined , was making money on those masks of popular monsters and morons . Did I see next morning two urchins rummaging in a garbage can and trying on Jutting Chin ? I wonder . It may all have been a coincidence  --  due to atmospheric conditions , I suppose . Being a murderer with a sensational but incomplete and unorthodoxmemory , I can not tell you , ladies and gentlemen , the exact day when I first knew with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do remember , however , the first time I saw its driver quite clearly . I was proceeding slowly one afternoon through torrents of rain and kept seeing that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror , when presentlyp220the deluge dwindled to a patter , and then was suspended altogether . With a swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway , and needing a pair of new sunglasses , I pulled up at a filling station . What was happening was a sickness , a cancer , that could not be helped , so I simply ignored the fact that our quiet pursuer , in his converted state , stopped a little behind us at a cafe or bar bearing the idiotic sign : The Bustle : A Deceitful Seatful . Having seen to the needs of my car , I walked into the office to get those glasses and pay for the gas . As I was in the act of signing a travellers ' check and wondered about my exact whereabouts , I happened to glance through a side window , and saw a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oatmeal coat and dark-brown trousers , was listening to Lo who was leaning out of the car and talking to him very rapidly , her hand with outspread fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic . What struck me with sickening force was  --  how should I put it ?  --  the voluble familiarity of her way , as if they had known each other  --  oh , for weeks and weeks . I saw him scratch his cheek and nod , and turn , and walk back to his convertible , a broad and thickish man of my age , somewhat resembling Gustave Trapp , a cousin of my father 's in Switzerland  --  same smoothly tanned face , fuller than mine , with a small dark mustacheand a rosebud degenerate mouth . Lolita was studying a road map when I got back into the car . " What did that man ask you , Lo ? " " Man ? Oh , that man . Oh yes . Oh , I do n't know . He wondered if I had a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove on , and I said : " Now listen , Lo . I do not know whether you are lying or not , and I do not know whether you are insane or not , and I do not care for the moment ; but that person has been following us all day , and his car was at the motel yesterday , and I think he is a cop . You know perfectly well what will happen and where you will go if the police find out about things . Now I want to know exactly what he said to you and what you told him . " She laughed . " If he 's really a cop , " she said shrilly but not illogically , " the  |p221worst  thing we could do , would be to show him we are scared . Ignore him , Dad . " " Did he ask where we were going ? " " Oh , he knows that " ( mocking me ) . " Anyway , " I said , giving up , " I have seen his face now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relative of mine called Trapp . " " Perhaps he is Trapp . If I were you  --  Oh , look , all the nines are changing into the next thousand . When I was a little kid , " she continued unexpectedly , " I used to think they 'd stop and go back to nines , if only my mother agreed to put the car in reverse . " It was the first time , I think , she spoke spontaneously of her pre-Humbertian childhood ; perhaps , the theatre had taught her that trick ; and silently we travelled on , unpursued . But next day , like pain in a fatal disease that cones back as the drug and hope wear off , there it was again behind us , that glossy red beast . The traffic on the highway was light that day ; nobody passed anybody ; and nobody attempted to get in between our humble blue car and its imperious red shadow  --  as if there were some spell cast on that interspace , a zone of evil mirth and magic , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was almost artistic . The driver behind me , with his stuffed shoulders and Trappish mustache , looked like a display dummy , and his convertible seemed to move only because an invisible rope of silent silk connected it with our shabby vehicle . We were many times weaker than his splendid , lacquered machine , so that I did not even attempt to outspeed him . 0 lente currite noctis equi ! 0 softly run , nightmares ! We climbed long grades and rolled downhill again , and heeded speed limits , and spared slow children , and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yellow shields , and no matter how and where we drove , the enchanted interspace slid on intact , mathematical , mirage-like , the viatic counterpart of a magic carpet . And all the time I was aware of a private blaze on my right : her joyful eye , her flaming cheek . A traffic policeman , deep in the nightmare of crisscross streets  --  at half-past-four P.M. in a factory town  --  was the hand of chance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thenp222with the same hand cut off my shadow . A score of cars were launched in between us , and I sped on , and deftly turned into a narrow lane . A sparrow alighted with a jumbo bread crumb , was tackled by another , and lost the crumb . When after a few grim stoppages and a bit of deliberate meandering , I returned to the highway , our shadow had disappeared . Lola snorted and said : " If he is what you think he is , how silly to give him the slip . " " I have other notions by now , " I said . " You should  --  ah  --  check them by  --  ah  --  keeping in touch with him , fahther deah , " said Lo , writhing in the coils of her own sarcasm . " Gee , you are mean , " she added in her ordinary voice . We spent a grim night in a very foul cabin , under a sonorous amplitude of rain , and with a kind of prehistorically loud thunder incessantly rolling above us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning , " said Lo , whose dread of electric storms gave me some pathetic solace . We had breakfast in the township of Soda , pop . iooi . " Judging by the terminal figure , " I remarked , " Fatface is alreadyhere . " " Your humor , " said Lo , " is sidesplitting , deah fahther . " We were in sage-brush country by that time , and there was a day or two of lovely release ( I had been a fool , all was well , that discomfort was merely a trapped flatus ) , and presently the mesas gave way to real mountains , and , on time , we drove into Wace . Oh , disaster . Some confusion had occurred , she had misread a date in the Tour Book , and the Magic Cave ceremonies were over ! She took it bravely , I must admit  --  and , when we discoveredthere was in kurortish Wace a summer theatre in full swing , we naturally drifted toward it one fair mid-June evening . I really could not tell you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , with self-conscious light effects and a mediocre leading lady . The only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces , more or less immobile , prettily painted , barelimbed  --  sevenbemused pubescent girls in colored gauze that had been recruited locally ( judging by the partisan flurry here andp223there among the audience ) and were supposed to represent a living rainbow , which lingered throughout the last act , and rather teasingly faded behind a series of multiplied veils . I rememberthinking that this idea of children-colors had been lifted by authors Clare Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom from a passage in James Joyce , and that two of the colors were quite exasperatinglylovely  --  Orange who kept fidgeting all the time , and Emerald who , when her eyes got used to the pitch-black pit where we all heavily sat , suddenly smiled at her mother or her protector . As soon as the thing was over , and manual applause  --  a sound my nerves can not stand  --  began to crash all around me , I started to pull and push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience to get her back to our neon-blue cottage in the stunned , starry night : I always say nature is stunned by the sights she sees . Dolly-Lo , however , lagged behind , in a rosy daze , her pleased eyes narrowed , her sense of vision swamping the rest of her senses to such an extent that her limp hands hardly came together at all in the mechanical action of clapping they still went through . I had seen that kind of thing in children before but , by God , this was a special child , myopically beaming at the already remote stage where I glimpsed something of the joint authors  --  a man 's tuxedo and the bare shoulders of a hawklike , black-haired , strikingly tall woman . " You 've again hurt my wrist , you brute , " said Lolita in a small voice as she slipped into her car seat . " I am dreadfully sorry , my darling , my own ultraviolet darling , " I said , unsuccessfully trying to catch her elbow , and I added , to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh God , oh God : " Vivian is quite a woman . I am sure we saw her yesterday in that restaurant , in Soda pop . " " Sometimes , " said Lo , " you are quite revoltingly dumb . First , Vivian is the male author , the gal author is Clare ; and second , she is forty , married and has Negro blood . " " I thought , " I said kidding her , " Quilty was an ancient flameof yours , in the days when you loved me , in sweet old Ramsdale . " " What ? " countered Lo , her features working . " That fat den/tist ? You must be confusing me with some other fast little article . " And I thought to myself how those fast little articles forget everything , everything , while we , old lovers , treasure every inch of their nymphancy . With Lo 's knowledge and assent , the two post offices given to the Beardsley postmaster as forwarding addresses were P.O. Wace and P.O. Elphinstone . Next morning we visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queue . Serene Lo studied the rogues ' gallery . Handsome Bryan Bryanski , alias Anthony Bryan , alias Tony Brown , eyes hazel , complexion fair , was wanted for kidnaping . A sad-eyed old gentleman 's faux-pas was mail fraud , and , as if that were not enough , he was cursed with deformed arches . Sullen Sullivan came with a caution : Is believed armed , and should be considered extremely dangerous . Jr you want to make a movie out of my book , have one of these faces gently melt into my own , while I look . And moreover there was a smudgy snapshot of a Missing Girl , age fourteen , wearing brown shoes when last seen , rhymes . Please notify Sheriff Buller . I forget my letters ; as to Dolly 's , there was her report and a very special-looking envelope . This I deliberately opened and perused its contents . I concluded I was doing the foreseen since she did not seem to mind and drifted toward the newsstand neat the exit . " Dolly-Lo : Well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet having been slightly drugged by Cutler , I suspect , and Linda knew all your lines . She was fine , she had alertness and control , but lacked somehow the responsiveness , the relaxed vitality , the charm of my  --  and the author 's  --  Diana but there was no author to applaud us as last time , and the ter rific electric storm outside interfered with our own modest off stage thunder . Oh dear , life does fly . Now that everything is over ,  |p225school  , play , the Roy mess , mother 's confinement ( our baby , alas , did not live ! ) , it all seems such a long time ago , though practically I still bear traces of the paint . " We are going to New York after to-morrow , and I guess I ca n't manage to wriggle out of accompanying my parents to Europe . I have even worse news for you . Dolly-Lo ! I may not be back at Beardsley if and when you return . With one thing and another , one being you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you know , Dad wants me to go to school in Paris for one year while he and Fullbright are around . As expected , poor Poet stumbled in Scene III when arriving at the bit of French nonsense . Remember ? Ne numque pas de dire a ton arrant , Chianene , comme le lac est beau car it faut qu'il t'y mene . Lucky beau ! Qu'il t'y  --  What a tongue-twister ! Well , be good , Lollikins . Best love from your Poet , and best regards to the Governor . Your Mona . P. S. Because of ( Inc thing and another , my correspondence happens to be rigidly controlled . So better wait till I write you from  --  rope . " ( She never did as far as I know . The letter contained an clement of mysteriousnastiness that I am too tired to-day to analyze . I found it later preserved in one of the Tour Books , and give it here a titre documentaire . I read it twice . ) I looked up from the letter and was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engrossed in Mona 's witchery , Lo had shrugged her shoulders and vanished . " Did you happen to see  --  " I asked of a hunchback sweeping the floor near the entrance . He had , the old lecherer . He guessed she had seen a friend and had hurried out . I hurried out too . I stopped  --  she had not . I hurried on . I stopped again . It had happened at last . She had gone for ever . In later years I have often wondered why she did not go for ever that day . Was it the retentive quality of her new summeu clothes in my locked car ? Was it some unripe particle in some general plan ? Was it simply because , all things considered , I might as well be used to convey her to Elphinstone  --  the secret terminus , anyway ? I only know I was quite certain she had left me for ever . The noncommittal mauve mountains half encirclingp226the town seemed to me to swarm with panting , scrambling , laughing , panting Lolitas who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white stones on a steep talus in the far vista of a cross street seemed the very initial of woe . The new and beautiful post office I had just emerged from stood between a dormant movie house and a conspiracy of poplars . The time was 9 A.M. mountain time . The street was Main Street . I paced its blue side peering at the opposite one : charming it into beauty , was one of those fragile young summer mornings with flashes of glass here and there and a general air of faltering and almost fainting at the prospect of an intolerably torrid noon . Crossing over , I loafed and leafed , as it were , through one long block : Drugs , Real Estate , Fashions , Auto Parts , Cafe , Sporting Goods , Real Estate , Furniture , Appliances , Western Union , Cleaners , Grocery . Officer , officer , my daughter has run away . In collusion with a detective ; in love with a blackmailer . Took advantage of my utter helplessness . I peered into all the stores . I deliberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot-passengers . I did not . I sat for a while in the parked car . I inspected the public garden on the east side . I went back to Fashions and Auto Parts . I told myself with a burst of furious sarcasm  --  un ricanement  --  that I was crazy to suspect her , that she would turn up in a minute . She did . I wheeled around and shook off the hand she had placed on my sleeve with a timid and imbecile smile . " Get into the car , " I said . She obeyed , and I went on pacing up and down , struggling with nameless thoughts , trying to plan some way of tackling her duplicity . Presently she left the car and was at my side again . My sense of hearing gradually got tuned in to station Lo again , and I became aware she was telling me that she had met a former girl friend . " Yes ? Whom ? " " A Beardsley girl . " " Good . I know every name in your group . Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my group . " " Good . I have a complete student list with me . Her name please . " " She was not in my school . She is just a town girl in Beardsley . " " Good . I have the Beardsley directory with me too . We 'll look up all the Browns . " " I only know her first name . " " Mary or Jane ? " " No  --  Dolly , like me . " " So that 's the dead end " ( the mirror you break your nose against ) . " Good . Let us try another angle . You have been absent twenty-eight minutes . ' What did the two Dollys do ? " " We went to a drugstore . " " And you had there  --  ? " " Oh , just a couple of cokes . " " Careful , Dolly . We can check that , you know . " " At least , she had . I had a glass of water . " " Good . Was it that place there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll grill the soda jerk . " " Wait a sec . Come to think it might have been further down  --  just around the corner . " " Come on all the same . Go in please . Well , let 's sec . " ( Openinga chained telephone book . ) " Dignified Funeral Service . No , not yet . Here we are : Druggists-Retail . I ! i l l Drug Store . Larkin 's Pharmacy . And two more . That 's all Wacc seems to have in the way of soda fountains  --  at least in the business section . Well , we will check them all . " " Go to hell , " she said . " Lo , rudeness will get you nowhere . " " Okay , " she said . " But you 're not going to trap me . Okay , so we did not have a pop . We just talked and looked at dresses in show windows . " " Which ? That window there for example ? " " Yes , that one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's look closer at it . "  | ' It was indeed a pretty sight . A dapper young fellow was vacuum-cleaning a carpet of sorts upon which stood two figures that looked as if some blast had just worked havoc with them . One figure was stark naked , wigless and armless . Its comparativelysmall stature and smirking pose suggested that when clothed it had represented , and would represent when clothed again , a girl child of Lolita 's size . But in its present state it was sexless . Next to it , stood a much taller veiled bride , quite perfect and intacta except for the lack of one arm . On the floor , at the feet of these damsels , where the man crawled about laboriously with his cleaner , there lay a cluster of three slender arms , and a blond wig . Two of the arms happened to be twisted and seemed to suggest a clasping gesture of horror and supplication . " Look , Lo , " I said quietly . " Look well . Is not that a rather good symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as we got back into the car  --  " I have taken certain precautions . Here ( delicately opening the glove compartment ) , on this pad , I have our boy friend 's car number . " As the ass I was I had not memorized it . What remained of it in my mind were the initial letter and the closing figure as if the whole amphitheatre of six signs receded concavely behind a tinted glass too opaque to allow the central series to be deciphered , but just translucent enough to make out its extreme edges  --  a capital P and a 6 . I have to go into those details ( which in themselves can interest only a professional psychologue ) becauseotherwise the reader ( ah , if I could visualize him as a blond-bearded scholar with rosy lips sucking la pomme de sa canne as he quaffs my manuscript ! ) might not understand the quality of the shock I experienced upon noticing that the P had acquired the bustle of a B and that the 6 had been deleted altogether . The rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rubber end , and with parts of numbers obliterated or reconstructed in a child 's hand , presented a tangle of barbed wire to any logical interpretation . All I knew was the state  --  one adjacent to the state Beardsley was in . I said nothing . I put the pad back , closed the compartment , and drove out of Wace . Lo had grabbed some comics from thep229back seat and , mobile-white-bloused , one brown elbow out of the window , was deep in the current adventure of some clout or clown . Three or four miles out of Wace , I turned into the shadow of a picnic ground where the morning had dumped its litter of light on an empty table ; Lo looked up with a semi-smile of surprise and without a word I delivered a tremendous backhandcut that caught her smack on her hot hard little cheekbone . And then the remorse , the poignant sweetness of sobbing atonement , groveling love , the hopelessness of sensual reconciliation . In the velvet night , at Mirana Motel ( Mirana ! ) I kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself .. . But it was all of no avail . Both doomed were we . And soon I was to enter a new cycle of persecution . In a street of Wace , on its outskirts . . . Oh , I am quite sure it was not a delusion . In a street of Wace , I had glimpsed the Aztec Red Convertible , or its identical twin . Instead of Trapp , it contained four or five loud young people of several sexes  --  but I said nothing . After Wace a totally new situation arose . For a day or two , I enjoyed the mental emphasis with which I told myself that we were not , and never had been followed ; and then I became sickeningly conscious that Trapp had changed his tactics and was still with us , in this or that rented car . A veritable Proteus of the highway , with bewildering ease he switched from one vehicle to another . This technique implied the existence of garages specializing in " stage-automobile " operations , but I never could discover the remises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevrolet genus , beginning with a Campus Cream convertible , then going on to a small Horizon Blue sedan , and thenceforth fading into Surf Gray and DriftwoodGray . Then he turned to other makes and passed through a pale dull rainbow of paint shades , and one day I found myself attempting to cope with the subtle distinction between Our own Dream Blue Melmoth and the Crest Blue Oldsmobile he had rented ; grays , however , remained his favorite cryptochromism , and , in agonizing nightmares , I tried in vain to sort out properlyp230such ghosts as Chrysler 's Shell Gray , Chevrolet 's Thistle Gray , Dodge 's French Gray .. . The necessity of being constantly on the lookout for his little moustache and open shirt  --  or for his baldish pate and broad shoulders  --  led me to a profound study of all cars on the road  --  behind , before , alongside , coming , going , every vehicle under the dancing sun : the quiet vacationist 's automobile with the box of Tender-Touch tissues in the back window ; the recklessly speedingjalopy full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a crumpled mudguard ; the bachelor 's tudor sedan crowded with suits on hangers ; the huge fat house trailer weavingin front , immune to the Indian file of fury boiling behind it ; the car with the young female passenger politely perched in the middle of the front seat to be closer to the young male driver ; the car carrying on its roof a red boat bottom up . . . The gray car slowing up before us , the gray car catching up with us . We were in mountain country , somewhere between Snow and Champion , and rolling down an almost imperceptible grade , when I had my next distinct view of Detective Paramour Trapp . The gray mist behind us had deepened and concentrated into the compactness of a Dominion Blue sedan . All of a sudden , as if the car I drove responded to my poor heart 's pangs , we were slithering from side to side , with something making a helpless plap-plap-plap under us . " You got a flat , mister , " said cheerful Lo . I pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put her foot on the dashboard . I got out and examined the right rear wheel . The base of its tire was sheepishly and hideously square . Trapp had stopped some fifty yards behind us . His distant face formed a grease spot of mirth . This was my chance . I started to walk towards him  --  with the brilliant idea of asking him for a jack though I had one . He backed a little . I stubbed my toe against a stone  --  and there was a sense of general laughter . Then a tremendous truck loomed from behind Trapp and thundered by me  --  and immediately after , I heard it utter a convulsive honk . Instinctively I looked back  --  and saw my own car gently creeping away . I could make out Lo ludicrously at the wheel ,  |p231and  the engine was certainly running  --  though I remembered I had cut it but had not applied the emergency brake ; and during the brief space of throb-time that it took me to reach the croakingmachine which came to a standstill at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Lo had had ample time to pick up the rudiments of driving . As I wrenched the door open , I was goddam sure she had started the car to prevent me from walking up to Trapp . Her trick proved useless , however , for even while I was pursuing her he had made an energetic U-turn and was gone . I rested for a while . Lo asked was n't I going to thank her  --  the car had started to move by itself and  --  Getting no answer , she immersed herself in a study of the map . I got out again and commenced the " ordeal of the orb , " as Charlotte used to say . Perhaps , I was losing my mind . We continued our grotesque journey . After a forlorn and useless dip , we went up and up . On a steep grade I found myself behind the gigantic truck that had overtaken us . It was now groaning up a winding road and was impossible to pass . Out of its front part a small oblong of smooth silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into our windshield . It occurred to me that if I were really losing my mind , I might end by murdering somebody . In fact  --  said high-and-dry Humbert to floundering Humbert  --  it might he quite clever to prepare things  --  to transfer the weapon from box to pocket  --  so as to be ready to take advantage of the spell of insanity when it does come . By permitting Lolita to study acting I had , fond fool , suffered her to cultivate deceit . It now appeared that it had not been merely a matter of learning the answers to such questions as what is the basic conflict in " Hedda Gabler , " or where are the climaxes in " Love Under the Lindens , " or analyze the prevailing mood of " Cherry Orchard " ; it was really a matter of learning to betray me . How I deplored now the exercises in sensual simula/tion that I had so often seen her go through in our Beardsley parlor when I would observe her from some strategic point while she , like a hypnotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated versions of infantile make-believe by going through the mimetic actions of hearing a moan in the dark , seeing for the first time a brand new young stepmother , tasting something she hated , such as buttermilk , smelling crushed grass in a lush orchard , or touching mirages of objects with her sly , slender , girl-child hands . Among my papers I still have a mimeographed sheet suggesting : " Tactile drill . Imagine yourself picking up and holding : a pingpong ball , an apple , a sticky date , a new flannel-fluffed tennis ball , a hot potato , an ice cube , a kitten , a puppy , a horseshoe , a feather , a torchlight . Knead with your fingers the following imaginary things : a piece of bread , india rubber , a friend 's aching temple , a sample of velvet , a rose petal . You are a blind girl . Palpate the face of : a Greek youth , Cyrano , Santa Claus , a baby , a laughing faun , a sleeping stranger , your father . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate spells , in the dreamy performance of her enchantments and duties ! On certain adventurous evenings , in Beardsley , I also had her dance for me with the promise of some treat or gift , and although these routine leg-parted leaps of hers were more like those of a football cheerleader than like the languorous and jerky motions of a Parisian petit rat , the rhythms of her not quite nubile limbs had given me pleasure . But all that was nothing , absolutely nothing , to the indescribable itch of rapture that her tennis game produced in me  --  the teasing delirious feeling of teetering on the very brink of unearthly order and splendor . Despite her advanced age , she was more of a nymphet than ever , with her apricot-colored limbs , in her sub-teen tennis togs ! Winged gentlemen ! No hereafter is acceptable if it does not produce her as she was then , in that Colorado resort between Snow and Elphinstone , with everything right : the white widep233little-boy shorts , the slender waist , the apricot midriff , the white breast-kerchief whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dangling knot leaving bare her gaspingly young and adorable apricot shoulder blades with that pubescence and those lovely gentle bones , and the smooth , downward-tapering back . Her cap had a white peak . Her racket had cost me a small fortune . Idiot , triple idiot ! I could have filmed her ! I would have had her now with me , before my eyes , in the projection room of my pain and despair ! She would wait and relax for a bar or two of white-lined time before going into the act of serving , and often bounced the ball once or twice , or pawed the ground a little , always at ease , alwaysrather vague about the score , always cheerful as she so seldom was in the dark life she led at home . Tier tennis was the highest point to which I can imagine a young creature bringingthe art of make-believe , although I daresay , for her it was the very geometry of basic reality . The exquisite clarity of all her movements had its auditory counterpart in the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it entered her aura of control became somehow whiter , its resilience somehow richer , and the instrument of precision she used upon it seemed inordinately prehensile and deliberate at the moment of clinging contact . Her form was , indeed , an absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely top-notch tennis  --  without any utilitarian results . As Edusa 's sister , Electra Gold , a marvelous young coach , said to me once while I sat on a pulsatinghard bench watching Dolores Haze toying with Linda Hall ( and being beaten by her ) : " Dolly has a magnet in the center of her racket guts , but why the heck is she so polite ? " Ali , Electra , what did it matter , with such grace ! I remember at the very first game I watched being drenched with an almost painful convulsionof beauty assimilation . My Lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of thep234powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip . It had , that serve of hers , beauty , directness , youth , a classical purity of trajectory , and was , despite its spanking pace , fairly easy to return , having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop . That I could have had all her strokes , all her enchantments , immortalized in segments of celluloid , makes me moan to-day with frustration . They would have been so much more than the snapshots I burned ! Her overhead volley was related to her service as the envoy is to the ballade ; for she had been trained , my pet , to patter up at once to the net on her nimble , vivid , white-shod feet . There was nothing to choose between her forehandand backhand drives : they were mirror images of one another  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp echoes and Electra 's cries . One of the pearls of Dolly 's game was a short half-volley that Ned Litam had taught her in California . She preferred acting to swimming , and swimming to tennis ; yet I insist that had not something within her been broken by me  --  not that I realized it then !  --  she would have had on the top of her perfect form the will to win , and would have become a real girl champion . Dolores , with two rackets under her arm , in Wimbledon . Dolores endorsing a Dromedary . Dolores turning professional . Dolores acting a girl champion in a movie . Dolores and her gray , humble , hushed husband-coach , old Humbert . There was nothing wrong or deceitful in the spirit of her game  --  unless one considered her cheerful indifference toward its outcomeas the feint of a nymphet . She who was so cruel and crafty in everyday life , revealed an innocence , a frankness , a kindness of ball-placing , that permitted a second-rate but determined player , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to victory . Despite her small stature , she covered the one thousandand fifty three square feet of her half of the court with wonderful ease , once she had entered into the rhythm of a rally and as long as she could direct that rhythm ; but any abruptp235attack , or sudden change of tactics on her adversary 's part , left her helpless . At match point , her second serve , which  --  rather typically  --  was even stronger and more stylish than her first ( for she had none of the inhibitions that cautious winners have ) , would strike vibrantly the harp-cord of the net  --  and ricochet out of court . The polished gem of her dropshot was snapped up and put away by an opponent who seemed four-legged and wielded a crooked paddle . Her dramatic drives and lovely volleys would candidly fall at his feet . Over and over again she would land an easy one into the net  --  and merrily mimic dismay by drooping in a ballet attitude , with her forelocks hanging . So sterile were her grace and whipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old-fashioned lifting drive . I suppose I am especially susceptible to the magic of games . In my chess sessions with Gaston I saw the board as a square pool of limpid water with rare shells and stratagems rosily visible upon the smooth tessellated bottom , which to my confused adversary was all ooze and squid-cloud . Similarly , the initial tennis coaching I had inflicted on Lolita  --  prior to the revelationsthat came to her through the great Californian 's lessons  --  remained in my mind as oppressive and distressful memories  --  not only because she had been so hopelessly and irritatingly irritated by every suggestion of mine  --  but because the precioussymmetry of the court instead of reflecting the harmonieslatent in her was utterly jumbled by the clumsiness and lassitude of the resentful child I mistaught . Now things were different , and on that particular day , in the pure air of Champion , Colorado , on that admirable court at the foot of steep stone stairs leading up to Champion Hotel where we had spent the night , I felt I could rest from the nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soul , of her essential grace . She was hitting hard and flat , with her usual effortless sweep , feeding me deep skimming balls  --  all so rhythmically coordinated and overt as to reduce my footwork to , practically , a swinging stroll  --  crack players will understand what I mean . My rather heavily cut serve that I had been taught by my father who hadp236learned it from Decugis or Borman , old friends of his and great champions , would have seriously troubled my Lo , had I really tried to trouble her . But who would upset such a lucid dear ? Did I ever mention that her bare arm bore the 8 of vaccination ? That I loved her hopelessly ? That she was only fourteen ? An inquisitive butterfly passed , dipping , between us . Two people in tennis shorts , a red-haired fellow only about eight years my junior , with sunburnt bright pink shins , and an indolent dark girl with a moody mouth and hard eyes , about two years Lolita 's senior , appeared from nowhere . As is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed , and they carried them not as if they were the natural and comfortableextensions of certain specialized muscles , but hammers or blunderbusses or wimbles , or my own dreadful cumbersome sins . Rather unceremoniously seating themselves near my preciouscoat , on a bench adjacent to the court , they fell to admiringvery vocally a rally of some fifty exchanges that Lo innocently helped me to foster and uphold  --  until there occurred a syncope in the series causing her to gasp as her overhead smash went out of court , whereupon she melted into winsome merriment , my golden pet . I felt thirsty by then , and walked to the drinking fountain ; there Red approached me and in all humility suggested a mixed double . " I am Bill Mead , " he said . " And that 's Fay Page , actress . Maffy On Say "  --  he added ( pointing with his ridiculously hooded racket at polished Fay who was already talking to Dolly ) . I was about to reply " Sorry , but  --  " ( for I hate to have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , when a remarkably melodious cry diverted my attention : a bellboy was tripping down the steps from the hotel to our court and making me signs . I was wanted , if you please , on an urgent long distance call  --  so urgent in fact that the line was being held for me . Certainly . I got into my coat ( inside pocket heavy with pistol ) and told Lo I would be back in a minute . She was picking up a ball  --  in the continental foot-racket way which was one of the few nice things I had taught her ,  --  and smiled  --  she smiled at me ! An awful calm kept my heart afloat as I followed the boy
