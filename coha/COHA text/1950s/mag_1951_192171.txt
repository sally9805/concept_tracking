Breard to sell combination subscriptions to several magazines ( Saturday Evening Post , Newsweek and Ladies Home Journal ) . But Breard was really trying to get arrested , to test a city ordinance forbidding door-to-door visits without prior permission of householders . Obligingly , Alexandria 's police arrested Salesman Breard , and he was ordered to pay a $25 fine or go to jail for 30 days . <P> Three associations , representing door-to-door sellers of everything from Fuller Brushes to encyclopedias , joined with Breard to appeal his case , since the law dealt a heavy blow to the house-to-house selling of $1.4 billion in consumer goods each year , including some 10,000,000 magazine subscriptions . They wanted to test the constitutionality of the " Green River " ordinance which over 400 U.S. communities have adopted since Green River , Wyo. passed the first one in 1931 to slam the door on solicitors . Breard 's lawyers charged that his arrest violated both freedom of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Supreme Court ruled otherwise , affirmed the right of any community to restrict door-to-door selling .
