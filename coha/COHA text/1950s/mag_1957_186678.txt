MANNERS &; MORALS <P> Californians had a good case of Orwellian creeps . While no Big Brother was watching them , they had flatly been warned that almost everyone else was-or could be-listening . The state senate Judiciary Committee , hoping to draft 20th century laws to cope with ingenious invasions of privacy , set many a Californian on his ear with a report on a lengthy study of electronic eavesdropping and wiretapping , found that for all the benefits of electronic enterprise there have also been some disturbing developments . Among them : <P> Small , high-quality microphones that will pick up conversations anywhere in a normal-sized room and carry them-either through undetectable , hairlike wires or radio transmission-to receivers or recorders that may be located in the next room or a car a block or two away . <P> Pocket microphone and recorder units so tiny and effective that they may be operated undetected in an ordinary briefcase ; e.g. , a private eye could plant the briefcase in a conference room , pick it up at the end of the day and listen to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wireless microphones packed into transmitters no bigger than a pack of cigarettes and so sensitive that they can pick up whispers in an average room , transmit them by radio to receiving and recording equipment hundreds of feet away .

Best protection against the shotgun : talk behind closed windows . <P> Much of the testimony came from private investigators and equipment manufacturers , who were reluctant to be too specific about their clientele .

In Los Angeles some used-car dealers bug rooms where prospective car purchasers are left with their wives ; thus the salesman can pick up tips for a new pitch by listening to the family discussion of who likes what and how much the family budget will stand . <P> One expert related just how serious electronic warfare can get . An attorney who had learned that his opponent planned to introduce into court the tape recording of a secret meeting carried a powerful , battery-operated electromagnet into court in his briefcase . He placed his briefcase near the opposition lawyer 's tape . The magnet erased the recording , left the rival attorney with a blank tape and blank expression when he got up to play the evidence .
