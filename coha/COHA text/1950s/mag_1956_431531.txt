Before I Hire your Husband , I want to meet You 52 Tomorrow your husband gets his big break . He 's going to be interviewed for a key position that will be the turning point in his career ? if he gets the job . To be sure , the decision will be based primarily on your husband 's personality and qualifications . But more and more these days the decision also hinges on what the bossto-be thinks of you , the man 's wife . We employers realize how often the wrong wife can break the right man . This does n't mean that the wife is necessarily wrong for the man but that she is wrong for the job . On the other hand , more often than is realized the wife is the chief factor in the husband 's success in his career . In the first  | place , she has a very definite effect on a man 's spirit . Everyone knows that a happy employe is a good employe . Many companies spend millions of dollars just to make their employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they sponsor recreational activities afterhours , they fix up attractive rooms where employes may relax during lunch hour or relief period . But there is one thing that no company can control , and that 's an employe 's home life . If a man has a peevish , nagging wife , if she is jealous and possessive , if she is lazy or overambitious or extravagant , that man is going to be unhappy . And his unhappiness will interfere with his concentration on his job . In the case of an important executive , this lack of @# concentration can affect the outcome of a business conference . It may even kill a profitable deal . Sometimes , of course , a man can separate his home life and his business life so that one does not interfere with the other . Even so , his wife can affect his career , for at times she must represent his company almost as much as he . It 's no secret that a good portion of today 's business is transacted at dinners and cocktail parties . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married before I place him in a key job . All of this may sound a bit cold-blooded . But you 've been hearing a lot about this subject , and have even seen movies about it from the employes ' point of view . I 'd like to present the employer 's point of view . Most of our promotions come from within the organization , so the man w is singled out for a top position is no stranger to me . A check through our files will give me all I want to know about : : the man himself ? his working habits art : his ability to get along with others . If h , does happen to be a stranger , I will chec his references and arrange a persons interview before we get to the wifemeeting stage . Then , frequently , Mrs. Milner and take the couple out to dinner . Usually we go to the Country Club . It 's a friendly , informal meeting , and I take advantage of the opportunity to loop : long and hard at the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Milner observes too , so that she can give me her opinion later . I think it 's  | important to have a woman 's opinion , particularly about another woman , and I trust Mrs. Milner 's judgment of people . What do we look for in a wife ? Here are six qualities that impress us most . And how a wife rates on these goes a long way in determining whether her husband gets that job or that next promotion . 1 . A good wife is friendly . She smiles easily and she is pleasant to be with . She has many friends , whom she entertains within her means , but she is careful to prevent social activities from interfering with her husband 's rest , health , and efficiency . 2 . A good wife is a good citizen . She wants to bring up nice children in a pleasant community . Her aims are simple and well defined . She has her job to do , and she keeps busy making her home comfortable , educating her children , and keeping herself attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable . She does n't ask her husband to do her job ; she leaves him free to do his own . She talks to him about her home , her activities , their children , but she does n't meet him at the door every night with a long list of grievances and complaints . She can discipline the children herself , she can do her own shopping , and she can budget her time and money without help . 4 . A good wife is part of her community . She is interested in town planning , local government , school conditions , church activities . In her community , she is a good-will ambassador for her husband . 5 . A good wife is adaptable . A transfer is a challenge , not a crisis , and she does n't have to be pulled up by the roots for a move to another town . Because she makes friends easily she can settle anywhere with ease . 6 . A good wife 's primary interest is her husband , her home , and her children . There may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , artists , musicians , writers , and the like , but I believe that being the wife of an executive is a full-time job in itself . A good wife is there when her husband needs her . She must be his sounding board . She must be able to listen patiently without giving advice , she must have the knack of commenting without interfering . Sometimes it may be necessary for her to make sacrifices for the sake of her husband and his business career ; she can not be free to do this if she is dedicated to a career of her own . Of course it is n't possible to discover whether or not a woman has all these plus qualities in just one meeting . If we must make an immediate decision , we do the best we can . Our safeguard is that even more important than what a good wife is , is what she is not . And here it is surprisingly easy to form a judgment on short notice . Real troublemakers are fairly easy to spot . Here are the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bad , the child was cranky tonight , the waiter is sloppy , the food is cold : I know immediately that she is a nag . Sometimes she does n't actually complain much , but she does n't smile much either , and her sour expression gives her away . A nagging wife is a millstone around the neck of any man . She 's a nuisance at home , and she consumes time on the telephone every day , nagging her husband while he is at work . The complaining woman can toss a cloud over the brightest of days ? and the brightest of men . 2 . The dominating woman . She knows it all ? from what a man should eat to how he should run his business . Her unwanted advice is offered free of charge for everything and anything . She shows up at her husband 's office regularly , ready to revise staff and procedure . She can ruin her husband 's career in just one evening . When I hire a man , I want to know that he will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment I rely on , not hers . The dominating woman is easiest to spot and hardest to control . She 's anathema to me. 3 . The possessive woman . She owns her husband , body and soul . She hangs on his arms , fiddles with his tie , watches him like a hawk . He must sit next to her , even at large parties . Woe to him if he should want to dance with another woman ! For the sake of money , she grudgingly lends her husband to his employer for eight hours a day , five days a week , but she insists on retaining visiting privileges . She shows up at his office two or three times a week , taking up everyone 's time . At five o'clock every evening you can find her outside her husband 's office , impatiently tapping her foot . This I can not tolerate . If I ask my general manager to meet me at the station to take the 8:10 to Chicago , I do n't want to wait for his wife to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife-in-a-rut . This pathetic little creature is just out of her element She is self-conscious , nervous , and awkward . Her taste in clothes is usually pretty bad ; her conversation centers on babies and how to wash the kitchen floor . Ten or 15 years ago she may have been the pretty little girl on Maple Street . Her husband has become a man of the world , but she is still on Maple Street . She may be a good wife , but she 's just not up to the job of being married to a top executive . I 'm sorry for the man whose wife has not grown with him , and I 'm usually tempted to give him a chance in spite of her . Once in a while it works out ; mostly it doesn't. 5 . The bored woman . Strange as it may seem , I have come across women who just do n't care about their husbands ' jobs at all . This type of wife usually arrives late , begins to yawn early . Any discussion of business is Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a glassy-eyed stare , frankly uninterested . She may be a wonderful woman , a firstrate cook , and a perfect housewife , but she 's not the girl for a man in a key job . Top men are not mere employes to me , and they can not think of the company as merely a job . An executive is an integral part of an organization , and as such he has responsibilities . An unforeseen development may mean a trip out of town on a few hours ' notice . Unexpected business may call for overtime . his wife has to understand , and she has to be able to smile about it . PERHAPS I 'm asking a lot of the women who are married to my executives . But no business can be better than the men who run it , and no man can be better than his wife permits him to be . Few men work for themselves ; rather their ambition is to build a good home , make a better life for their children , and keep their wives happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man work hard is his home , his wife must make his home worth working for . This , I believe , is what most women try to do . Smart men pick smart wives . It 's unrealistic to think that office and home can be kept completely separate . It 's much better to acknowledge that a wife is part of her husband 's career and do something constructive about it , rather than thinking that home vs. office problems will quietly disappear if you pretend they do n't exist . That 's why I believe in inviting wives to company parties . If a woman can meet the people her husband works with and talks about , if she can see the surroundings in which he operates and breathe some of the atmosphere he breathes , his job will take on more meaning to her . Understanding the role he plays , she will then be able to fit into the role that she must play if she is to be a good executive 's wife . And if she does n't ? It hurts to discover that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still deserves a chance . I might be more cautious about the position I give him , watch him more closely , advance him more slowly , give him more help than he needs , but if he can keep his wife successfully under control , he can keep his job . We all make errors in judgment sometimes . It 's too bad if a man 's worst mistake turns out to be his wife . THE END
