When Mills College ( for women ) in Oakland , Calif , began hunting for a new president in 1942 , the trustees hoped to find a sedate , older woman for the job . What they finally got was a brash and breezy young man . Lynn White Jr . was a San Francisco minister 's son who had studied at Union Theological Seminary and had taken his Ph.D . under Harvard 's famed Medievalist Charles Homer Haskins . He was an expert on wine and cooking ( " anything with garlic in it " ) , on 13th Century clocks and chivalry ( " the culture of the horsy crowd " ) . And somewhere along the line , he had also become an unabashed expert on women 's colleges . <P> Last week , as Mills alumnae launched a $2,000,000 fund-raising campaign to celebrate Mills ' 100th birthday , the college which started out as a young ladies ' seminary back in the gold-rush days could count itself a senior dowager among U.S. women 's colleges. * But under President Lynn White , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fantastic Notion . " " The trouble with Smith , Vassar , and the others , " White once declared , " is that they do n't go ahead . They merely confirm each other 's prejudices . " And the worst prejudice , White decided , was that women 's colleges should remain a feminine imitation of men 's , accepting the " biologically fantastic notion that to be different from men is to be inferior to men . . . " When a woman marries , she feels ashamed to find herself " just a housewife . " And when her children are old enough to leave her , she finds she has nothing to do . Educated women in the U.S. , insisted Lynn White , are not only a lost sex , but a wasted one-and their colleges have made them so . <P> Lynn White started right out to change all that . To make Mills students successful housewives , he set up a major in " Family Studies , " which concerned itself not only with keeping house and raising children , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it offers to those who devote themselves to it . " He also set up a course in family law so that Mills graduates would be able to cope with the normal business and legal problems that many women face-taxes , insurance , adoption proceedings , annuities and investments . <P> To give them an idea of what to do in middle age , he organized a course in community services ( " Women need to know how to work for symphonies , art centers and museums " ) . He also set up B.S. degrees in merchandising , personnel , business and interior design . <P> " Between the Lines . " Mills students still spend most of their time in a solid liberal arts program , and White made his own contribution to this , too . Today every freshman is required to take the new course in the main moral and intellectual currents of U.S. thought , reading such odd combinations as a novel of Horatio Alger and Henry George 's Progress and Poverty in the same week . Says White : " We 're trying to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen between words . " <P> To help them read and listen , Mills has such top teachers as Sociologist George Hedley , Novelist Jessamyn West , and Composer Darius Milhaud . And this year more students than ever before are reading and listening-548 girls , 15% more than in 1950 . <P>
