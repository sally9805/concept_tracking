BOMB IN GRAND CENTRAL <P> BOMB-FOUND IN SEAT&lt;BR&gt; OF B'WAY MOVIE HOUSE ! <P> Mad Bomber 's New Attempt&lt;BR&gt; Spurs Hunt by 20,000 Cops <P> 15 MORE BOMB SCARES <P> CRACKPOTS ON " BOMB " SPREE <P> As any goggle-eyed New Yorker could guess from reading the biggest and blackest headlines , the " Mad Bomber " had struck . His calling card : a crude but workable bomb made of gunpowder , set to be detonated by a cheap watch movement wired to a flashlight battery-all contained in a short ( 2-5 in. ) length of ordinary pipe capped at both ends . And , to provide the final touch , the pipe was stuffed into a man 's red sock . <P> He had been striking , on and off-so police said-for the last 16 years , but only now had the harassed New York City cops decided to let the city newspapers play the story up big , in the hope that wide publicity would flush him out . Besides , the Mad Bomber 's latest activities were such that the cops could hardly keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last month in a Brooklyn movie house , a pipe-bomb exploded , injured seven people . On Christmas Eve a page found a sock-wrapped bomb in a telephone booth of the New York Public Library .

Off the presses came a rash of interviews with psychologists , psychiatrists , jewelers , bomb experts , handwriting experts , cops , scientists . Columnists discoursed learnedly on the psychopathic makeup of the man who so desperately wanted recognition , speculated on everything from his childhood to his sex drives ( either weak or strong , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do-it-yourself spread on how to make a pipe-bomb ; Scripps-Howard 's World-Telegram and Sun gave an artist 's rendering of the Bomber 's face ( details for which were somehow set forth by a handwriting expert ) . <P> Goose Chases . Suddenly police switchboards jammed with calls telling of planted bombs . Detectives by the squad were kept on the run ( 107 times last week alone ) to such public landmarks as Madison Square Garden , Grand Central Terminal , Yankee Stadium , the new Coliseum and the Empire State Building , sometimes came up with a firecracker or an empty piece of pipe , and only once ( at the Paramount ) with the real goods . Said one weary cop : " This city has plenty of wacks with a screwball sense of humor . " <P> At week 's end the papers , thirsty and cunning in a news-dry holiday period , were still going strong . Everybody but the cops was enjoying the thrill . But there was not a man in his right mind who dared to buy a cheap watch , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
