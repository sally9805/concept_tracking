One of the laws of cold war , as of Newton 's physics , is that action and reaction are equal and opposite . When Soviet pressure relaxes , so does Western vigilance ; when Soviet threats increase , so does Western resistance . Last week Soviet pressure increased portentously in the most sensitive spot of cold war : Berlin . The West 's reaction was instantaneous : 15 NATO nations , meeting in Paris , moved off the dead center made by the spirit of Geneva and 1 ) warned the Russians to keep their hands off West Berlin , 2 ) resolved unanimously to stop the summer 's rot in the Atlantic alliance . <P> What the Communists are up to in Berlin was made plain at midweek by Soviet Ambassador to East Germany Georgy M. Pushkin . In identical notes to the U.S. , Britain and France , Pushkin rejected their joint protest over the four-hour detention by East Berlin police of two U.S. Congressmen ( TIME , Dec. 12 ) and added ominously : " East Germany now . . . regulates . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin . " In effect , Pushkin was telling the West : if you want barge permits and free road traffic , apply to the East German Communists ; it 's no longer any business of ours . His implication was obvious : unless the West agrees to deal with the East Germans ( thereby recognizing their so-called sovereignty ) , Berlin would be made to suffer . <P> Closing Ranks . Faced with the threat of a new Berlin blockade , the 15 Atlantic allies , meeting in Paris for their sixth annual review of NATO policies , reacted by closing ranks . West Germany , NATO 's newest member , wanted NATO support for its refusal to deal with East Germany and won a unanimous affirmation : " The council . . . considers the Federal Republic as the only German government freely and legitimately constituted and therefore entitled to speak for Germany . " <P> Weakest Link . Examining their defense posture in the light of the new Russian challenge , the ministers reached a dismaying conclusion : a summer of relaxation has robbed NATO of much strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's 175 ) . Actually , it can presently rely on only ten of them , of which five are U.S. , four British . France has depleted its four divisions on the Rhine to crush the spreading revolt in North Africa . Britain is reducing its army by 100,000 men ; Belgium is disbanding one of its three active divisions ; four of the five Dutch divisions are mere skeletons . Denmark 's contribution in soldiers is practically negligible , since its 14-month conscription period is too short to train a soldier properly . <P> The U.S. too came under the ministers ' scrutiny and was found wanting . Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson admitted that only 50% of the U.S. 's promised military aid had reached Europe so far this year , but pointed out that many regiments in the U.S. do not have as up-to-date equipment as NATO units . Altogether , the 15 nations are spending $53 billion a year on defense . Western Europe 's contribution : about $8 billion . <P> Last summer , with the spirit of Geneva soaring , many an allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that peace was just around the corner . But last week no one tried . Instead , in their brief two-day meeting , they addressed themselves to NATO 's weakest link , air defense .
