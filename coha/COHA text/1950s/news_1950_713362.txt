Status Criteria of United States in According Recognition Cited The ? writer of the following letter , former Socialist party leader , is counsel for national and local labor : anions . TO THE EDITOR OP ' Tim NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of Nov. 6 , " Qualifying for the U. N. , " in which you praise the statement made by Ernest A. Gross , representing the United States , before the United Nations subcommittee on the qualifications'to be required of applicants seeking admission to the United Nations , deserves commendation from thoughtful citizens . The more discussion there is on this question the better for our own people and for the democratic world . However , your statement that Mr. Gross ' outline of American policy " may mark a significant broadening of our national outlook and viewpoint " might lead one to believe that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The contrary is the fact . Even before the United Nations our Government has had to deal with the problem of recognizing foreign regimes . The test historically has always been our own sense of public morality , good government and international order . From the beginning of our nation it has  --  been American policy to inject the moral Issue into international relations , rather than attempting to withdraw it . Jefferson 's View Evidence of this policy appears early in our history . In his communication to Gouverneur Morris on Nov. 7 , 1792 , Thomas Jefferson declared that one of the cardinal American principles of recognition is " to acknowledge any Government to be rightful which is formed by the will of the nation substantially declared . " This principle is particularly important today when " the will of the nation " seeking recognition should be of paramount concern to us . The will of the nation , according to Jefferson , must be " substantially declared . " This does not mean that a country need choose any particular form of government , but the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no declaration of the will of the nation when the people are cowed ' and intimidated by tanks , planes and bayonets , frequently supplied by a foreign Power . The will of the nation can not be substantially declared when by the techniques of totalitarian rule all parties opposing the Communist rulers are dissolved , all organs of criticism destroyed , and all organized life in the nation , other than that of the Communist party , is denied an opportunity to help formulate the will of the nation , much less , ' express it . Acceptance of Regime In the middle of the nineteenth century Secretary Seward and , his successors declared as the policy of the United States that a revolutionary Government in a republican state , which has come into being in defiance of an existing Constitution and which has gained control by sheer force of arms , ought not to be recognized by the United States until our country has been assured that the change was adopted by the people rather than imposed upon them against their will . In his instructions to Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1868 , Mr. Seward wrote : " The policy of the United States is settled upon the principle that revolutions in republican states ought not to be accepted until the people have adopted them by organic law , with the solemnities which would seem sufficient to ' guarantee their stability and permanency . This is the result of reflection upon national trials of our own . " The will of the nation of which Jefferson spoke was amplified to mean the will of the people in the language of Secretary Seward . The same policy was reiterated later by President Wilson . In the course of time between Jefferson 's original declaration and the present , two other conditions have been demanded by our country before it would extend recognition . The first condition is the ability and willingness of a new Government presenting itself for recognition to respect and fulfill the foreign obligations and responsibilities of a sovereign state . The second is the freedom of such a Government from the control and domination of any other state in the management of its domestic or foreign affairs . Implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new state comes into being usually has an effect upon the time when recognition is accorded . When a demand for recognition comes from a state or a Government whose very existence is due to civil war or revolution , foreign Powers act slowly . This is so not only because premature recognition may be regarded as an act of intervention and a cause of war by the Government which the revolutionary regime is seeking to replace but also because the circumstances surrounding the revolution or the civil war are of direct concern to the state extending recognition . Thus if the so-called revolution or civil war is in fact inspired , organized and even conducted by a foreign Power bent on aggression and conquest , then the new regime seeking recognition may not be entitled to it at all . A. revolution inspired and conducted in the interest of the foreign policy of a foreign Power does not render the new Government an independent one . The technique of inspiring revolution and setting up a puppet regime has been followed many ' times within our own lifetime , first by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that the United States will probably have to recognize ultimately a Government which , though obnoxious to its own people , compels obedience and maintains itself ? Indefinitely by enforcing submission . But such recognition should not come hastily , if at ' all . A Government - of this type , controlling vast areas and populations , must be viewed as an international menace , Such a Government , not being subject to the will and control of the people , constitutes a constant threat to the maintenance of world peace . It lacks the moral qualifications which experience has shown to 134 necessary for a nation to perform its obligations to the outside world and to live up to treaties and conventions . These standards and policies which our own nation has followed for a century and a half should not be accepted by the United Nations as the criterion for admission into that body . Only in that way can the United Nations become a truly powerful fnrop for wrirld peace . LOUIS WALDMAN , New York , Nov. 7. 1950 . Negro Education Needs Pattern Considered Unchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive director of the United Negro College Fund . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK ' TIMES The facts reported by THE NEW YORK TIMES ' survey of education in the seventeen Southern States where segregation is practiced do indeed constitute a " refreshing and encouraging bit of news , " as you stated in your editorial , " Negroes . at College , " in the issue of Nov , 8 . Particularly so as they represent the first real step toward the eradication of such racial barriers in education in the private colleges and universities as well as in state-supported institutions . However , despite the admission of a thousand Negro students on the graduate level to universities originally open only to white students , the situation , while most encouraging , is far from resolved . By and large , on the undergraduate level there have been no significant changes in the pattern . Approximately eight million Negroes still reside in that part of the nation where segregation laws are in force in varying degrees . If the majority of these people are to receive any elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of separate institution , since it would be impossible , for financial reasons , for the families concerned to send many of the qualified students to institutions in other parts of the nation . These institutions , private and public , exist as " Negro colleges " because there is need to provide higher educational opportunities for Negroes : they exist as such , not in support of segregation but because of segregation . At present there are approximately 70,000 students enrolled in these institutions . An important part of our program at the United Negro College Fund has always been to acquaint a larger public with the pressing need for greater educational ' opportunities ' for Negro youth . Our annual educational symposiums are part of that public information effort . The Fund 's annual appeals in support of private Negro colleges and universities are directed toward strengthening these institutions , for two basic reasons : In order that the young Negro people who attend them can have as fine an educational opportunity as is possible under the circumstances ; So that in the future , when segregation laws no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent , welladministered colleges open to serve all qualified students who wish to enroll , without reference to race or creed . W. J. TRENT Jr . New York , Nov. 9 , 1950 . Uprising Not Bloodless To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Allow me to thank , you for your splendid editorial entitled " Thirtythree Red Years . " However , when you write that Oct. 25 , 1917 , by the old calendar ( Nov. 7 by the new one ) , in regard to the Bolshevik Revolution , was " a mighty popular uprising * * * " and " no blood was shed on that day * * * , " historically this is not correct . I was a witness to this event in Petrograd , now Leningrad , and I can assure you that the uprising was neither " popular " nor " bloodless . " It is sufficient to glance at Leon Trotsky 's memoirs to see how much blood was shed on that day . ALEXANDRE TARSAIDZE . New York , Nov. 8 , 1950 . Puerto Rico 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The writer of the following letter is a teacher of Spanish in New York . To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : . Recent developments in Puerto Rico have touched off a series of . commentaries and statements about the situation in that island , Inasmuch as the Puerto Rican people are about to enter the process of drafting a Constitution that must be approved by Congress and the President , it is necessary to cast light on the matter to dispel possible misinformation or misunderstanding . One such misunderstanding which has gained wide credence among English-speaking people is that the Puerto Rican people are by nature incapable of settling their political differences by democratic procedure and that it is in their nature to resort to , violence to settle such issues . That version is absolutely unfounded . There are four main political parties in Puerto Rico : Popular-Democratic , Independence party , Statehood party , Socialist . The Independence and Statehood parties advocate what their re , spective names imply . The PopularDemocratic holds that the political status must be settled at a special future plebiscite ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puerto Rican people is to be concentrated on building up the economy of the island by means of full-scale industrialization . The Socialist party has no fixed political ideal . It aims at the improvement of the conditions of the working class . All four political parties have a corn , mon fundamental principle : that such ideals must be brought about by due democratic process . Vote Analyzed In the last elections , there was a total registration of 873,985 , of which 619,321 actually voted . The breakdown is as follows : Populars , 391,282 ; Statehood party , .87,128 ; Socialists , 63 , - 876 ; Independence party , 64,811 . We thus see that from the political point of view those 619,321 citizens form the mass of the Puerto Rican people . In the supreme ideal of a democratic way of life the Puerto Ricans are solid . ly united as a single unit . Those people embody the sentiments and traditions of 457 years of Puerto Rican history , In those 457 years not a single shot has been fired for political reasons by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misstatement been uttered ? Because a handful of Nationalists have set loose a more or less extended wave of violence ? Who are those Nationalists ? In the last elections in which the Na ? tionalists participated they polled 5,00C votes , or .007 per cent of the population . Is it not ludicrous to judge a people as a whole by the irresponsible acts of an insignificant minority ? Ic it not more sensible to consider those acts as the expression of the mihority of malcontents , normal in all countries , who do not care about the consequences of their actions because they want to give vent to their frustration ? Their frustration is caused by the conclusive repudiation which the Puerto Rican people , a politically mature country , has given them in such an unmistakably clear way . Precisely because of that repudiation they have resorted to this madness in order to discredit their own countrymen before the Americans and thus block the adoption of the Puerto Rican Constitution which they do not want . All they need to do ' is to make the American Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pable of self-government . We ardently want ? to impress upon the American people that by believing so they will be falling for the Nationalists ' game and actually helping them in thwarting the democratically expressed will of the Puerto Ricans . Record of Non-Violence , No country in the world is free from the depredations of irresponsible minority groups who leap suddenly upon innocent majorities who , used to the ways of peace , do not expect such outrages . Not even the United States and England , which are the most democratic countries ' in the world , have been able to avoid such instances of , violence ; and in both countries ti : : has been plenty of unprovoked bloodshed and destruction . All that the democratic countries can hope to do to minimize those attacks upon their liberties . That is being , done in Puerto Rico as it in being done in all the democratic countries . In Puerto Rico 's history there have been only two such instances , which is a record unsurpassed in any other country in the world , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people to dismiss that occurrence as one more instance of the criminal conspiracy going on in the world by the forces of darkness against the common masses of mankind , who only want to live in peace and goodwill . No sane Puerto Rican has ever believed , even remotely , in the possibility of an armed revolt . Since such an event has never been expected , no preparations had been made and thus . the Nationalist blow came as a stunning surprise . But the very surprise is the best evidence of the peacefulness of the Puerto Rican people . We hope that the Americans will remember that at the very moment when two innocent American public servants were being struck down at Blair House , in defense of the President , many Puerto Rican boys were also being struck down on the Korean battlefront in defense of the nation , and many more ( the Puerto Rican Sixty-fifth Infantry ) were on their way to replace their fallen comrades .
