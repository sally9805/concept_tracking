To Paris ' pro-Communist daily Liberation ( circ. 125,000 ) last week came a startling mimeographed letter from the Suez Canal Company . The letter noted gratefully that the press had been printing the company 's side of the story in the Suez crisis . Enclosed was a check for 100,000 francs ( $286 ) - " a contribution to your expenses for the month of August . It is understood that our participation could be renewed in the future . " <P> <P> What startled Liberation was that , having faithfully followed the Moscow line on the Suez crisis , it had done nothing to earn the money-the kind of bonus for which French journalism has long been notorious . Overcoming their surprise , Liberation editors plastered their front page with photostats of the letter and check , plus an editorial : " We are forced to think other newspapers received similar checks , no doubt more sumptuous . We expect our colleagues to give their opinions of this singular procedure . " <P> Next day , with a tardy show of indignation , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were returning the money . " Do n't think this is corruption . You ca n't bribe anyone with such a small sum , " bumbled an embarrassed official of the Suez Canal Company . But he wearily confessed : " It was all a mistake on our part . We picked the wrong newspaper . We sent out one check too many . " Editorialized Le Monde : " It is good that the press is indignant . But it should examine itself . If moneyed interests hold nothing but disdain for the press , is it not because the press does not perhaps disdain money enough ? "
