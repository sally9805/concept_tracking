Holly Jane Hyde , daughter of a Rhode Island chicken and apple farmer , had been a lively youngster and , with her brilliant coppery hair , was as bright as a new penny . But when , at seven , Holly went into second grade , she had trouble with reading . Then Holly 's mother noticed that sometimes she seemed not to understand what was said to her ; she gazed vacantly into space and occasionally picked up her luncheon sandwich and tossed it across the room for no evident reason . <P> At first the doctors could not be sure of the reason , either . It might be the petitmal form of epilepsy , or a brain tumor . At Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , Neurosurgeon William H. Sweet tried the electroencephalogram ( " brainwave machine " ) and got indications of a local disorder , but nothing definite enough to justify major brain surgery . Another standard test ( in itself fairly drastic ) , involving the injection of air into the brain cavities , showed nothing . Not long ago Holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsen , imperiling her understanding of language and perhaps endangering her life , before the doctors could have felt certain of what to do . <P> But Dr. Sweet had worked with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Physicist Gordon Brownell to develop a scanning machine that shows , with a high degree of accuracy , not only whether a brain tumor is present but , if so , precisely where it is . Dr. Sweet gave Holly an injection of radioactive arsenic , which has an affinity for tumors . An hour later she lay on a cot with her head between two scintillation counters to which scanning mechanisms were attached . Soon , as the counters picked up the gamma rays , the robot pens showed that the arsenic had concentrated in one part of the lower forebrain . This showed that Holly did indeed have a tumor . Another scan showed that it was left of center , and ( within a third of an inch ) how far . The machine , which Dr. Brownell had helped to work out under an AEC grant , told Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor . That was a year ago . <P> Last week Third-Grader Holly Hyde bounced into the hospital board room so that American Cancer Society officials could see for themselves that she now seems fully recovered . Her reading has improved , she has no more spells and feels , as she chirped , " fine . " <P> Drs . Sweet and Brownell have run their tally of scanned subjects ( including normal volunteers for comparison ) to well over 200 . The machine , they hope , will save many a patient from dangerous surgery inside the skull for the sole purpose of getting information and will make the operation far surer in cases where a lurking tumor is disclosed .
