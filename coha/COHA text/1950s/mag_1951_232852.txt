Strike It Rich ( weekdays 11:30 a.m. , CBS-TV ) , a veteran radio giveaway , makes its TV bow with a noisy M.C. ( Warren Hull ) , an even noisier studio audience , and a batch of contestants who can win as much as $500 ( sample question : " What great U.S. President married Martha Custis ? " ) . Before , during and after the questions , Sponsor Colgate-Palmolive-Peet hawks its products with giant display cards , man-sized toothpaste tubes , animated cartoons , singing commercials , and free samples dumped in each contestant 's lap . <P> Altar Bound ( weekdays 4:15 P-M ) - , ABC ) , transcribed at Los Angeles ' Marriage License Bureau , turns loose an exclamatory interviewer named Bob Moon ( " You say you 're a handbag manufacturer ! " ) on a succession of soon-to-be-wed couples . The ensuing chitchat , enlivened by gushing superlatives , arch evasions and coy giggles , makes no major contribution to the art of man-on-the-street interviewing . <P> Family Circle ( weekdays 3 p.m. , ABC ) is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propelled through the wasteland of daytime radio by a glib and determinedly jolly M.C. named Walter Kiernan . Typical guest : Actress Sarah Churchill , who was allowed to tell the plot of her current Broadway show , Gramercy Ghost . In exchange , Kiernan asked how her father , Winston Churchill , felt about her becoming an actress ( " he thought it was a whim " ) . <P> Pentagon-Washington ( Sun . 8:30p.m. , Du Mont ) is a joint effort of the network and the U.S. Department of Defense , devoted mainly to a briefing on the Korean war , with long and necessarily dated reports filed by spokesmen for the Army , Navy &; Air Force . The filmed show ends with newsmen asking obviously prepared questions of Secretary of the Air Force Thomas K. Finletter and getting obviously prepared answers .
