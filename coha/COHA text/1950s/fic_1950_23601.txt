Portrait of the Artist as a Young Grocery Clerk A Story by Bentz Plagemann Drawings by Bernarda Bryson " You gave Pat Walsh a dollar more than you gave me. " until I was graduated from high school , on Wednesday and Friday afternoons , and all clay Saturday . I graduated during the depression when there were no jobs for anyone , particularly for young men so brilliant that not even their families , much less the world , could understand them , and so there I was , condemned with a cynical smile to weigh butter and potatoes and wait on customers . When I had begun to work for Mr. Gogarty I was confident that someone would come in some day , sonic patron of the arts , idly tapping a riding crop against his breeches , and exclaim , after stopping with amazement , " What is this young Voltaire ( or Goethe or Shakespeare ) doing here ? " and forthwith whisk me away to Weimar-on-the-Ohio , or some small principality near Cleveland , where I would begin to pen the great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-beer . The passing years had disillusioned me about the perspicacity of patrons , and there I was , finished with my schooling , out in theworld , still standing behind the grocery counter and smiling with a knowing eye at the people who asked for pink salmon for the cat , or oleomargarine for frying , aware of the sham of the world , its petty hypocrisy . " Where youth grows pale , and specter thin , and dies , " I used to mutter from Keats , dipping morosely into the peanut-butter barrel . But if Mr. Gogarty was no patron of the arts , at least I was forced to admit he was no tyrant . He was a rotund man , with apoplectic coloring , and the manner of a professional Irishman , which indeed he was . And while it was incomprehensible to me in my philosophical detachment , he also took pride in being a good grocer , and he wanted me to be a good grocer too . He had tried , with some pain and embarrassment , to teach rue his sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-market , and he was concerned with something called the plus-sale . The good grocer always sold the customer something more than she had come in for . Mr. Gogarty 's approach was peaty and romantic . " Any cheese , teas , or peas ? " he would shout cheerfully when the customer came to the end of her list . " Any leeks , beets , or sweets ? " I was a considerable disappointment to him because I could never master this rollicking technique which always threw the ladies into panic spasms of laughter , although I was a constant advertisement for the goods of the store , my mouth always stuffed with a dill pickle , a marshmallow , a maraschino cherry , or a bit of Roquefort cheese . Mr. Gogarty tolerated me , I suppose , becatise I was quick on my feet , tirelessly young , and docile to the point of idiocy . ( The great man bows before destiny . ) On Saturday morning , for example , I got up at six o'clock , walked half a mile to the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to carry in the crates of bread and milk and vegetables before the store opened at eight ; fetched groceries for customers , with a break for lunch and supper , until the store closed at ten that night , and then worked until midnight cleaning up and stocking the shelves for Monday morning . I did not do all of this by myself , of course . I was , depending on the busyness of the season , one of a staff of six or eight pimple-faced contemporaries . It was a large store , with a counter running the length of one wall and across the back , and each of us had a certain portion for ourselves where our regular clients presented themselves . They were pleasant people of a suburban area and many of their own sons had served or were serving behind the counter . I rejected all of them , naturally , families and sons , as being hopelessly bourgeois ( a word I was very fond of but could n't pronounce ) , and one of my particular pleasures was dealing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groceries to the car . The disdain with which I rejected this insult , my pained hauteur caused many of them to turn their heads away to hide what I presume was their shame . Although I am at a loss to understand why , I was not an unpopular member of the staff . I had nothing but contempt for my business associates who , hopelessly inane and immature to a man , were interested in nothing but football , practical jokes , and girls , in that order . I was interested in these things too , but I also had my lofty side . Many of my fellow clerks have unaccountably gone on to greater things ; I can count a doctor , a lawyer , a public health officer , and a banker among the boys / worked with there , but only the present public health officer seemed to me then to possess so much as a glimmering of sensibility . He and I were members together of the Cercle Francaise , a social group which met on occasional Wednesday nights to discuss the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ostentatious reading of Plato or Shaw 's Prefaces while I ate my lunch in the basement of the store . It was his sister who packed the sandwiches for me when I ran away from home on the Greyhound bus . I T ALL began with Pat Walsh , one of the clerks who did not , as far as I know , go on to greater things . Pat was Mr. Go-garty 's Achilles ' heel , a handsome son of the old sod , lazy as sin , the map of County Cork on his face , and the blue of Irish skies in his eyes . The lyrics are Mr. Gogarty 's ; for his money Pat could do no wrong . Most of us loafed when Mr. Gogarty was not looking ; Pat even loafed when he was . And got a smile of indulgence in return . All this did not help him in our esteem , a fact which troubled Pat not at all . He knew which side his bread was buttered on , and I do n't suppose it surprised any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand as godfather for his new , and first , son . Certainly it was no business of mine whom Mr. Gogarty asked to be godfather to his son , but it was on Saturday afternoon of that week that I learned ( in some devious way I now forget ) that Pat had a dollar more in his pay envelope than I did , and for the same number of hours . I was a man slow to anger ( timid would be a better word , I suppose ) but all the rest of that day my soul seethed with righteous wrath . It had been a bad day from the start . At noon I had telephoned my mother to discover that five of my short-story manuscripts , from my early or Poe period , had been returned without a word by callous , indifferent magazine editors who , I was certain , had n't even read them , probably because I had no " influence " in their crass world . All day I moved about among the butter tubs , a cheated and misunderstood genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " under my breath . I suppose it might all have stopped right there , bogged down in poetic Weltschmerz , had it not been for the incident of the spinach can . After the store had closed that night and I was replenishing a lower shelf on my knees , a number-four , or large-size , spinach can fell from a higher shelf on my head . Friends rushed to my aid and I was helped to the back room where I lay stunned , rather like General Wolfe at the battle of Quebec , on a pile of burlap bags . There the iron entered into my soul . I waited until all had gone home but Mr. Gogarty . Then I emerged , an apocalyptic figure , to face Mr. Gogarty over the counter . " You gave Pat Walsh a dollar more than you gave me , " I said . Mr. Gogarty had been working on his perpetual inventory ; the large sheets of paper spread out before him . We faced each other in our aprons . " So I did , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that he flushed , if it was possible to observe such a phenomenon under Mr. Gogarty 's natural coloring , and I began to flush and tremble with my own temerity . " It is n't fair , " I said . " I decide that , " Mr. Gogarty said . " I decide what 's fair . " 1 wanted to play that rale myself and not share it with anyone . Then I played my trump card . I delivered the line I had rehearsed on the burlap bags . " It says in the Bible , Mr. Gogarty , " I said , capitalizing as I went , " that one of the Sins that Cry to Heaven for Vengeance is Defrauding the Laborer of his Wages . " There was a moment of absolute , stunned silence . Then , without a word , Mr. Gogarty flung himself across the counter . He seized me by the neck and shoulders and shook me , as I described it afterward , like a wet rat . It is difficult to say who was sorrier afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , dabbing at his own eyes with the end of his apron . But I did n't stand there long . I went into the back room for my sweater and then I ran out of the door , never to see Mr. Gogarty again . That night I made my plans . My friend , the future public health officer , met me in the dead of night . I would say that I was going to Mass with him , but instead I wouldtake the bus for New York . With my weekly pay , and some money he would lend me , I would have enough for a ticket , and some left over to get me started on my new life . I wrote a note for my parents before I left in the morning , impaling it , in the traditional way , on my mother 's pincushion . They would not find it until it was far too late to follow , since they planned to go on to a cousin 's for dinner after Mass . " Like Oscar Wilde , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must be allowed to make my own mistakes . " I think it is fortunate that neither my parents nor I kncw at that time the exact nature of the mistakes made by Mr. Wilde , so there could have been no sinister suggestions to follow upon the initial shock of the note . In spite of that , I still think of that note as a unique example of its kind . My friend was waiting for me at the bus station . He had confided in his sister and she had prepared the lunch which he was holding awkwardly in a brown paper bag . " You can throw it away if you want to , " lie said . " She made me take it . " But I was touched . My friend , his sister , and I all knew that I was moving inevitably toward the kind of messy destiny which awaits all great , misunderstood men of genius , men like Keats and D. H. Lawrence . It might be the last home meal I ever had . I took the brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfactorily high key . Dry-eyed , we clasped hands . On the steps of the bus I turned back and raised my hand , Lord Byron Leaving England Forever . T HE bus trip to New York , in itself , was one of those tedious episodes best omitted , for dramatic reasons , from any biographical account . Even M. Gide with his special talent for investing the commonplace with excitement would have been hard-pressed , I think , to write any significance into that twenty-four hour trip . For a while , I admit , I was interested in a young woman sitting opposite me who seemed to carry with her the tawdry glamor of an Iris March , but as the trip progressed her glamor faded and the tawdriness increased . She spent the night with her bead shouldered on the convenient clavicle of a traveling salesman , a man who possessed neither my subtle charm , nor my in --  77%. : 1777t " ' " ' ability to speak to strange women . There was also a largish man with indigestion , and a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune in New York . I avoided him after he confided this to me over a cup of coffee during one of our night stops , because I wanted to play that role myself and not share it with anyone . We arrived in New York about ten in the morning , a critical time to see New York City for the first time , particularly the Greyhound bus station on Thirty-Fourth Street . But the Sloane House YMCA was nearby , and I headed for it like a homing pigeon , filled with panic , and awe at my own courage . I would just stay there until I got settled , I told myself . And , anyway , it was only fifty cents a night . I SPENT my days roaming the streets of Greenwich Village , which I found by asking my way to the Provincetown theater . I had to ask a good many people , because there was n't any Provincetown theater , but I stood in front of the building where it had been , when I found it , cursing the destiny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fifteen dollars , over and above the cost of my round-trip ticket . ( Well , everybody knows it 's cheaper to buy a round-trip ticket , and you can always turn in the otherhalf if you do n't use it . ) At the end of the first week I began to spend most of my time hanging around the general delivery window of the post office , the address I had thoughtfully written in my farewell note , under the line from the wit and wisdom of Oscar Wilde . On Saturday there was a letter from my father . There was no money in it . He just told me to come home . I took the bus the next morning . A large , comfortable woman who looked like one of my aunts took the seat beside me , and she bought me hamburgers when the bus stopped , to keep her company , " she said . I told her I was n't hungry , and I was n't . I had lived on hamburgers and hot dogs all that week , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of green in color . My mother put me to bed when I got home and called our doctor . I had complete intestinal stasis , he said . Nothing functioned at all except my luminous mind . I lay there thinking it all over and , as is so often the case with great men , that illness was a turning point in my career . In a flash of revelation I knew what I must do , I realized where I might best take my peculiar talents . When I was well enough to get out of bed I went into town and got a job as clerk in a bookstore . Lord Byron Leaving England Forever .
