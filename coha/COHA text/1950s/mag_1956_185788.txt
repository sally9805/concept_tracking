Two plainclothesmen strode last week into Cairo 's Metropolitan Hotel , rapped on Correspondent William ( Steve ) Stevenson 's door and gave the Toronto Star 's 33-year-old roving newsman 24 hours to get out of Egypt . Also expelled for spreading " falsehoods and fabrications to mislead public opinion " : the London Evening Standard 's pretty Anne Sharpley , 26 , and the London Daily Mail 's fortyish Eileen Travis , a U.S. citizen . That made a total of five correspondents sent packing since Egypt seized the Suez Canal. * <P> While Cairo 's foreign press corps worriedly met to plan some defense against expulsion , Correspondent Stevenson flew to Rome and , in the black-and-white Japanese kimono that he wears while writing , pounded out the reply to his office 's urgent cable to FILE STORY SOONEST MOSTEST BESTEST . Star readers soon learned in glittering detail that Stevenson first offended the Egyptians by trying twice in the same day-and getting arrested both times-to get an interview with Ex-Premier Mohammed Naguib , under house arrest 15 miles out of Cairo .

Stevenson 's latest adventure was made to order for his self-cast role as the romantically dashing foreign correspondent who lets nothing-sometimes not even the facts-get in the way of a good story . A World War II Royal Navy flyer and jet test pilot , Stevenson has been forced out of Yugoslavia , denounced by the Peking radio for his stories after a trip through Red China , and scolded by the Canadian government for breaking a story on Canada 's highly secret " flying saucer " -a saucer-shaped aircraft expected to fly 1,500 m.p.h .
