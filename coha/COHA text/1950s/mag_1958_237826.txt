In a nameless northern country , in a mansion like a padded hearse , a " lady of great beauty " sat winter after snowy winter waiting for the man she loved . The great gates were barred , the chandeliers were dimmed , and all through the drafty house the mirrors were draped against the reflected evidence of her advancing age . <P> This faded Victorian dreamscape is the setting of Vanessa , first opera by Symphonist ( Adagio for Strings Samuel Barber and the first new American work produced by the Metropolitan Opera in a decade. * <P> With last week 's opening-night audience , at least , it was a direct hit . Composer Barber 's Vanessa failed to be intensely moving or to spring any musical or dramatic surprises , but it could still lay claim to being the best U.S. opera yet staged at the Metropolitan . <P> Living Death .

Menotti 's yarn is like a pulse-bumping 19th century melodrama that lacks the courage of its afflictions . The lover , when he finally arrives , is not the man Vanessa was waiting for , but his son Anatol , a fatally charming young man who promptly seduces Vanessa 's niece Erika .

Yet death and destruction are sidetracked . Though Erika has a miscarriage , she survives her night in the snow ; Anatol and the unsuspecting Vanessa depart for a new life in Paris . In a familiar living-death type of ending ( recalling Eugene O'Neill 's Mourning Becomes Electra and Henry James 's Washington Square ) , the big house is shut again , the mirrors are covered once more , and Erika sits brooding before the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> In addition to providing fine flashes of humor and plenty of surefire scenes . Librettist Menotti seems intent on making the point that as soon as a dream is realized it is destroyed ; waiting and hoping are the whole of life . Composer Barber , 47 , had to do a good deal of waiting himself . Menotti wrote the libretto in intermittent stretches over an 18-month period ( " At one point , " says Barber , " he left Anatol standing in a drafty doorway in deep winter for months " ) . Barber himself named the leading character after scanning a What-to-call-your-baby book entitled Name This Child .
