THESE THOUSAND HILLS ( 346 pp. ) -A . B. Gufhrie Jr. - Houghton Mifflin ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> The events and characters of most historical novels about the U.S. West are interchangeable parts that have worn smooth with use . But in 1947 Montana 's Alfred Bertram ( " Bud " ) Guthrie Jr . took the opening of the West away from the clich specialists with The Big Sky , a knowing , realistic book about the early traders , trappers and scouts that was as unashamedly rich in poetic evocation as it was in gritty plain talk . In 1949 came The Way West , a sober but richly authentic account of the great migration by wagon to the Pacific coast . Guthrie 's new book , These Thousand Hills , again justifies the literary claim he has staked out in that vast country , but it also shows that when a novelist sets a Western hero on a horse , he is apt. sooner or later , to follow a trail that leads to horse opera . <P> Hero Lat Evans is 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people pioneered , more than a little tired of his God-fearing father , who hugs his Methodism as closely as his near poverty hugs him . Lat heads for the wider spaces of Montana , breaks broncs , hunts wolves , wins a pot on a horse race and finally satisfies his ambition-a ranch of his own . But all the time he progresses in the field of livestock , he is tethered to that stock character of all cowtowns , a prostitute with a heart of gold . Gallic is slim and blonde and high-breasted , and it was love for both from the first time he paid cash on the barrelhead . When Lat becomes a big man , it is plain that Gallic will not do . But the educated niece of a prosperous storekeeper will and does , at the cost of Callie 's broken heart . <P> Author Guthrie is still the sensitive , loving researcher more than he is the true novelist . With all its virtues , his story is so commonplace and predictable that the reader can not help projecting it onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Lat Evans . But throughout These Thousand Hills there are fine evocations of what the country was like , the authentic sense of place that is Guthrie 's trademark . Even the standard brushes with Indians and rustlers have a quality of this-is-how-it-was , and the speech rings as true as the slap of a silver dollar on a saloon bar .
