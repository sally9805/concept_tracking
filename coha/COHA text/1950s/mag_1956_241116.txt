Militarily and economically , agreed the few Western newsmen in Budapest last week , the Hungarian revolution was at an end . After eight weeks of valiant resistance , the nation 's patriots , intellectuals , youths and workers were finding the Communist police system too much for them . Guerrillas were leaving the frost-whipped hills and woods . Factory workers , stood over by Russian " production police , " were reluctantly facing their machines . <P> Western observers , however , were careful to qualify judgment of the incredible Hungarians with such statements as " morally and psychologically , the revolution is as strong as ever . " Something like that was acknowledged by Premier Kadar in an interview with Communist East German correspondents . Said Kadar : " The military defeat has been completed . It will be the ideological struggle that will be the most important . " <P> By ideological struggle , Kadar obviously meant his failure to persuade the people that his regime was good for them . In several areas the workers ' councils refused to accept his decree outlawing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county , northeast of Budapest , was virtually a rebel stronghold whose villagers " just jeer at the order and carry on their activities ... " But Kadar 's biggest headache was the coal miners . Less than half of Hungary 's 100,000 miners were at work , and coal production was down an estimated 70% . Last week those coal miners who had not either fled or fallen in the fighting sent Kadar a spunky , three-point ultimatum demanding 1 ) his immediate resignation , 2 ) withdrawal of Soviet forces to their barracks , 3 ) free elections . <P> This was the miners ' answer to a Presidential Council decree re-establishing the old Stalinist internment system , by which the police may arrest and hold without trial " persons whose activity or behavior endangers public order . " The decree was accompanied by a burst of government publicity defending the new police force and denying that it was identified with the old AVH or would use " former criminal methods . " <P> But the new AVH acted exactly like Rakosi 's old bullyboys . In one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arrested were condemned to death and one executed , said Radio Budapest , hinting at mass trials to come . Western sources gave a grimmer estimate of AVH efficiency : over a period of " several days , " Western diplomats reported , 241 persons had been executed by summary courts-martial , 170 of them in Budapest . <P> The new AVH shared headquarters with the joint Soviet-Hungarian Police Committee ( probable chairman : Soviet Police Boss Ivan Serov ) . To Hungarians this was proof that while it might suit the Russians to appear to be withdrawing , leaving Premier Janos Kadar to work out his own solution , they were , in fact , still in control .
