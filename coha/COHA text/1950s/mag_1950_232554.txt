" Hatches were opened , sailors in blue shirts and dungarees oiled up the winches , coiled ropes , listened to the roar of the engines as Higgins boats were tested , unlashed , swung out from their davits . . . <P> Marines checked their packs , made camouflage nets for their helmets , sharpened knives and bayonets . It was hushed , tense activity which did not slacken until daylight was fading . And as night fell and the wind whistled through the rigging , ' Darken Ship ' rang out . . . " <P> Just eight years ago , an officer aboard a U.S. transport standing off the Solomon Islands wrote these words in his diary . It was the evening before the newly created 1st Division of the U.S. Marine Corps landed on Guadalcanal . After many a stinging U.S. defeat at the hands of the Japanese , the bloody Guadalcanal campaign was the first U.S. land offensive of the Pacific War . <P> Last week advance elements of the 1st Marine Division-a " reinforced regimental combat team " numbering about 5,000 men- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carried , along with their shiny new equipment , a large ration of glory in their packs , arrived at the critical moment in the Korean fighting-which was also a critical moment in U.S. history. * Korea would not turn out to be much less tough than Guadalcanal ; it might turn out to be tougher . The commander of the Marines in Korea , Brigadier General Edward Craig , has recently expressed an opinion on how his men would handle themselves in this situation . Said he : " They are ready for anything that can be thrown at them . " <P> On the Eve of Battle . From the combat-loaded holds of their ships , the marines brought forth great shiny bulldozers , wreckers and heavy road equipment the like of which Korea had never seen before . The marines had their own flamethrowers , amphibious tractors , Pershing tanks whose 90-mm. guns were a match for the Reds ' Russian-built T-34s . The 1st Division 's advance team also had its own air wing-a force of about 200 Corsairs ( see The Air War ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the officers and three-fourths of the noncoms were combat veterans of the Pacific war . The youngsters who formed the main bulk of the team might be green to combat , but they were superbly conditioned and trained . Even headquarters clerks , cooks and orderlies were crack riflemen and machinegunners . As they landed , some of them exchanged the usual cocky banter with watching Doggies ( as they call the Army men ) . Sample : " You can go home now , Junior . Us men have taken over . " But for the most part the leathernecks had a humility not usually found in marines . In Korea , unlike Guadalcanal and many another battle , it was the Army that had been poured into the breach first , the marines who came later . If for the past six weeks the Army had not put up a magnificent fight , there would not have been a place for the marines to land .
