txt Every few days in the senate a quiet little man with an almost inaudible voice rises from his seat and reads a carefully prepared statement . Ills colleagues have to draw close to hear what Sea . Williams he is saying . In the huge governmentbuildings , burocrats turn pale as word reaches them : " Williams has uncovered ' another one . " They know that another scandal , big or small , is about to endanger the jobs of some of them . Never Seeks Publicity For 10 years , Sen. John J. Williams , Republican f r o m Delaware , representing one of the smallest constituencies in the nation , has been a nemesis to crooks in government . He is a one man investigator who personally unearthed tax scandals in - the Truman ad4nistration which rocked thijustice department and the internal revenue bureau and touched off a seri4 of grand jury investigations , trials , and convictions . Scores of officials lost their jobs . He has remained on the warpath during the Eisenhower administration and , while his revelations now disclose burocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remains an object of fear to government officials . Recently , word was passed out to field agents of a big depart . ment that if they received queries from Williams the y were to relay all such questions to Washington headquarters . This mild , unassuming man of 52 never seeks publicity . He never " leaks " news on his investigations to favorite reporters . He is a true " lone wolf " who never tires in his pursuit of facts until he has every detail checked and documented . Then , he appears on the senate floor with a report , replete with statistics , tables , official letters , and documents . He waits patiently until there is a lull in the proceedings , then reads his ! speech in a near - whisper . Until that moment , the subject of his latest investigation is unknown . Often , front page headlines result . Goes After Tax Officials Williams was born on a farm near Bayard , Del. , one of 11 children . He finished high school and then went , to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are now among the state 's big chicken f arm ers , owning ' about 25 farms , producing one million baby chicks a year . Politics had no part tin his career until 1946 . Then , the internal revenue bureau listed him as a tax delinquent . Angered , because he had can celled checks to prove his payment , he began an investigation which took months and discovered that an internal revenue bureau employe had embezzled his money and that of other taxpayers . Altho this embezzlement was known to his employers , he was still on the payroll . Thus started Williams ' interest in the internal revenue bureau which eventually was to result in a wholesale house cleaning . He decided to enter politics , ran for the senate against Sen. Tunnell , a veteran Democratic New Dealer , and beat him handily . Gets His Facts Straight When Williams came to the senate in 1947 , he promptly began digging for more information on the tax bureau . Tipsters , in government and out , began feeding him information and have been doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just investigate like any newspaper reporter would cover a story , " he says . " I get my facts straight , then I report them . " He trained his guns on James P. Finnegan , internal revenue collector at St. Louis , in a series of speeches . Finnegan subsequently was indicted and convicted . He broke the story that St. Louis promoters had leased properties of Camp Crowder from the government , then rerented them to the Commodity Credit corporation at a big profit . He exposed the fact that the justice department had allowed tax claims totaling 1 million dollars against William Lias , Wheeling , W. Va. , race official , to lapse . Later , liens totaling two mil ? lions were slapped on Lias ' properties . It 's Just the Beginning This was just the beginning . Williams focused his attention on tax collectors in Delaware , Massachusetts , New York City , and San Francisco . He told of how 40 million dollars in income tax claims had been settled for 25 cents on the dollar . Williams revealed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25,000 in income taxes from Frank Costello , New York gambler ; that Philip F. Kastel , a Costello associate , had been forgiven $463,199 of taxes and penalties in 1942 and 1943 ; that the late Al Capone and members of the Chicago gang satisfied a delinquent tax bill for $119,367 in 1942 by paying $30,000 . Another Williams t a rge t was Jake Guzik , Capon e 's treasurer , who settled $892 , - 000 in income tax claims for $100,000 . Ralph Capone , brother of the gang leader , was permitted to negotiate for 25 years , rather than to pay $92 , - I914 levied against him in delinquent tax claims and penalties , Williams revealed . The senator 's exposes continued . He disclosed that the internal revenue bureau failed to collect a dime of nearly 2 million dollars in tax deficiencies and penalties from four clients of the law firm of I Joseph Nunan , former revenue collector . He told the senate in detail how a 175 page report , involving more than 20 gangsters , public officials and politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials " discovered " this missing report . Williams estimated that 25 , - 000 government employes had " beat " - payment of their proper income taxes . Heads rolled in the internal revenue bureau and elsewhere as a result of these disclosures . Approximately 3 8 8 government officials and employes were fired , resigned , or retired in a three year period and 60 of them were tried and convicted . The removals included 17 of the 64 district collectors of internal revenue bureau and 155 deputy collectors . More recently , Williams has turned his attention to absurdities in burocratic procedure . He revealed that citizens , wishing to file cornplaits with a government department , were told that such complaints would be ignored unless they filed 63 copies . Yesterday , he outlined his futile fight with the treasury to get them to accept an unexpended $1,508 from his office stationery allowance .
