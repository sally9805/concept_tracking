Into John Foster Dulles ' fifth-floor office in the State Department , and onto the Dulles carpet , walked Presidential Disarmament Adviser Harold Stassen . Preceding Stassen was a sheaf of crackling cables from U.S. embassies in Western Europe . Stassen , the complaint ran , had pulled a diplomatic blooper , and the European allies were miffed . The blooper : Stassen , after promising Western partners that he would consult with them before making any specific disarmament proposals to the Russians , had launched into private talks with Russia 's disarmament representative , Valerian Zorin ( architect of the Russian takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948 ) . <P> In the course of discussing technical questions , Stassen had handed Zorin an informal working paper which detailed a highly tentative U.S. proposal for setting up zones of aerial inspection , one of which included Western Europe . When British and French diplomats-to say nothing of the apprehensive West Germans-heard of this , they were quick to file complaints . <P> Something Special . Both the President and Dulles were wroth , because in trying to guard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him specific written instructions on how to proceed . Summoned home , he got no table-pounding from Dulles , but was sharply admonished to obey orders . Moreover he was told pointedly that Veteran State Department Careerman Julius Holmes , onetime second man in the London embassy , would soon join him as an adviser . <P> Next day John Foster Dulles publicly avowed in his press conference that the U.S. was not playing solo . The disarmament discussions , he said , are not " just between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . And we are not going to throw into the discard the views of our allies merely in the interest of making progress on a bilateral basis with the Soviet Union . " <P> At the same time , the size and shape of the Stassen problem symbolized something special about the U.N.-sponsored disarmament talks now going on in London . Disarmament , as a subject of debate , appears now a little down out of the clouds and more in the realm of political give and take . And in this atmosphere it will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have . If Western European governments were edgy about Stassen 's private meetings with Zorin , they stood firm and tough in the face of Russian-inspired propaganda on the horrors of the H-bomb . The President of the U.S. was hopeful enough about the disarmament talks to make them a major effort of his Administration , and he felt tough enough about them to fight for the biggest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history .
