The complete education of a daughter is something no American has ever been willing to leave entirely to the schoolteachers . Culling over their own back issues for wisdom on this and other subjects , the editors of the Reader 's Digest last week republished Lines to a Daughter - Any Daughter ( in an anthology entitled Fun Fare ; Simon &; Schuster , $2.50 ) , written four years ago by Manhattanite Agnes Rogers : <P> One of the things that you really should know Is when to say " yes " and when to say " no . " <P> There are n't any textbooks , there are n't many rules , The subject 's neglected in orthodox schools . You ca n't be consistent ; there 's often a reason For changing your mind with a change in the season . You may be quite right in accepting at seven Suggestions you 'd better refuse at eleven . <P> Perhaps you 'll consider these tentative hints : <P> " No " to a dirndl of highly glazed chintz , " Yes " to the bashful young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who 's been living in France , <P> " Yes " to a walk in the park in the rain , " Yes " if he asks for a chance to explain , " No " to all slacks unless you 're too thin , <P> " No " to that impulse to telephone him , " Yes " to a baby , and " no " to a bore , " No " if you 're asked if you-ve heard it before , <P> " Yes " to a Saturday " no " to a Monday , " Yes " to a salad and " no " to a sundae , " Yes " to a stranger ( but use some discretion ! ) , " No " to three cocktails in rapid succession , <P> " No " if he 's misunderstood by his wife , " Yes " if you want it the rest of your life . <P> Remember , my darling , careers and caresses <P> Depend on our choices of " noes " and of " yesses.
