The belief is widespread that while boxers and big-league ballplayers are old at 40 , that is just the age when giants in the arts and sciences begin to hit their stride . Not so , says Ohio University 's Professor Harvey C. Lehman in Age and Achievement ( Princeton University ; $7.50 ) . In nearly every field of creative activity , claims Psychologist Lehman , the greatest men register their greatest achievements* by the time they are 40 . <P> Science . In chemistry , Dr. Lehman finds , the most creative thinkers did their best work in the age range from 26 to 30 ; in mathematics , physics , electronics , botany and practical inventions , from 30 to 34 . What about Thomas Alva Edison , who was still making highly practical inventions in his 80s ? No exception , says Dr. Lehman . A breakdown of the number of patents Edison took out year by year shows a Himalayan peak of activity in his 30s and only molehills later . <P> The greatest achievements of Kepler and Darwin , Ohm and Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Galileo was a partial exception : he seems to have done as well at 17 and 73 as in his 30s . <P> The Arts . Composers , according to Dr. Lehman , write their best symphonies and songs between 30 and 34 ( this would cover few of Schubert 's songs , since he died at 31 ; it includes Beethoven 's Eroica , but not his Ninth ) . Chamber music and grand opera written between 35 and 39 have achieved the greatest fame . Wagner wrote Tannhuser and Lohengrin in his 30s , and by 40 was working on The Ring . Verdi was a clear exception . He churned out 25 operas by the time he was 58 , then went into semiretirement . Meanwhile , Wagner 's fame soared . At 74 Verdi began again , and in six years wrote Falstaff and Otello , considered by many his masterpieces . <P> Poetry clearly needs the inspiration of youth . The best odes , by Dr. Lehman 's reckoning , are written between 24 and 28 , pastoral and narrative poems and elegies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two later . Notwithstanding Bernard Shaw , who started to write plays around 40 , most dramatists do their best in their 30s : comedies from 32 to 36 ( e.g. , Shakespeare 's As You Like It ) , tragedies from 34 to 38 ( Hamlet and Racine 's Iphignie ) . Novelists are most likely to hit the jackpot between 40 and 44 . <P> Painters of the past did their masterpieces in oil from 32 to 36 . Raphael did the Sistine Madonna at 35 and died at 37 . Yet Da Vinci worked on The Last Supper in his 40s . And the durable Michelangelo , who lived to be 89 , is best remembered for his The Last Judgment , done at 59-66 . <P> Philosophy &; Statecraft . The traditional picture of the philosopher as a bearded oldster is all wrong , too , says Dr. Lehman . The most notable contributions to ethics , logic , economics , political science and esthetics have been made by men in their 30s ( metaphysicians run five years older ) . Spinoza began his major work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schopenhauer published his masterpiece ( The World as Will and Idea ) at 31 . But a few of the best-known philosophers were laggards : Kant spent the years from 46 to 57 on The Critique of Pure Reason .
