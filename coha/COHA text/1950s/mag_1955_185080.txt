PRESIDENT Eisenhower 's attack , and his good recovery to date , have given national urgency to questions that have always troubled heart patients and their families : How good a recovery can a patient make after a coronary thrombosis , and what are his chances of resuming an ordinary , active life ? While each case is different , the answer that most heart specialists are now trying to put across to the country is : the chances are far better than generally realized . <P> The medical profession itself did not fully understand this even 20 years ago . The general feeling used to be : the less activity the better . Recently , searching tests have been conducted to find out just how much or how little an injured but healed heart can stand . Manhattan 's Bellevue Hospital and Dr. Arthur M. Master have pioneered in finding out how much work heart sufferers can safely do . Many victims have been found to suffer from nothing but a wrong diagnosis . Others , after recovering from an attack , have been handicapped more by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else . About three-fourths can soon go back to work , most at their old jobs , though some must settle for lighter tasks . <P> Promoted by the American Heart Association , this principle is now being applied nationally through 48 state-federal programs . Classification units grade the patient 's capacity for work and such items as his emotional status and especially anxiety about his heart . They also grade the demands of the jobs available , try to fit workers to jobs . Labor unions and industry groups are backing the effort . Some employers shy away because of compensation problems , but the problems have no medical basis : heart cases are more safety-conscious than other workers , likely to be steadier and more reliable . Properly job-graded , they produce as much as their healthier fellows-sometimes more . <P> Doctors are able to give patients improved care now that they take more and better electrocardiograms ( using twelve leads instead of the former three ) , regulate the diet after an attack , and prescribe permissible exercise . This may range from walking two blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits to heart sufferers come not so much from new discoveries or drugs as from spreading a realization , first among doctors and then among laymen , of what the facts are : <P> At least 80% of coronary victims survive their first attack ; among private patients ( likely to have better diagnosis and more individual care than ward patients ) the rate goes up to 95% . <P> Among large numbers of patients studied up to 30 years after an attack , 40% have made full recoveries in activity ( though some showed electrocardiographic or other signs of hidden damage ) . Another 40% have made good recoveries with only mild symptoms . <P> The outlook for those patients who go back to their work is at least as good as it is for those who retire .
