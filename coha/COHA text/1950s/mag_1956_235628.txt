It was the morning after opening night in Miami , with three weeks to go before Streetcar careened into Manhattan 's City Center . Recalled Williams : " She asked me meekly if she had played Blanche better than anyone else had played her . I hope you will forgive me for having answered , ' No , your performance was the worst I have seen . ' . . . I never stated publicly , to my sober recollection , that she had ruined my play . What I said was phrased in barroom lingo . I was talking to myself , not to all who would listen , though certainly into my cups .

The big clue behind Eliza 's bequest : her maiden name was Campbell . Glowed the duke , a well-heeled man : " I can only assume that the bequest was made to me as head of the Clan Campbell . . .
