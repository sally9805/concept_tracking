txt The U S. has decided to attempt  --  probably within two or three years ? to orbit a man around the earth and bring him back alive . The Pentagon officially reported that the program was formally approved lust a few days ago . Roy Johnson , director of the Pentagon 's Advanced Research Projects Agency , briefly mentioned the plan ina speech earlier in the week . The decision is expected to speed U S. progress toward true space flight ; it 's the most advanced project yet involving manned vehicles . The experimental Xz15 plane , to be flown either late next year or early in 1960 , will reach only the neighborhood of outer space about 100 miles up . A man in orbit will go much higher , ' although no one would estimate just how much . And the go-ahead for man-in-space , it 's understood , could well bring several contracts to some of the private concerns that have been offering to handle similar projects for the Government . The formal Pentagon statement merely said a program to put man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hock this apace feat is likely to be performed , according to space experts , suggest a plan similar to one proposed by Convair division of General Dynamics and Avco Manufacturing Corp. , both of New York . No final decisions on contracts have been made . Estimated cost of the space program : Over $100 million , plus the cost of already available military hardware . In fact , Mr. Johnson spent longer on the problem of paying for the project than on details of how it will be carried out . He insisted this fiscal year 's approximately $40 million in spending authority " is insufficient to go as far as we are capable . " The space boss is looking for $25 million more this fiscal year for the project , and still more in the 1960 fiscal period . Details of the man-in-space project , according to space experts here , suggest the Government 's thinking is now in the direction of an orbiting , wingless cone . Avco scientists have pushed such a scheine . Scientists in the Pentagon and the new civilian space agency  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many details of the project . But , according to present thinking , here 's how the U.S. plans to put  --  a man in orbit : The space passenger will ride in a coneshaped vehicle about seven feet in diameter . Inside this craft , he 'll first make a brief trip of-one orbit around the earth . Later he 'll stay aloft for 24 hours , making many orbits . The man would ride reclining on a specially Wilt couch at the base of the pressure-tight cone . According to one specialist , " This couch would be carefully fitted to his body , and in this position the man could stand much more acceleration than he could in another position . " Government officials say the vehicle will be designed to keep a comfortable temperature for the passenger and provide for disposal of waste . This cone , which will be built of heat resistant material , will probably be launched into space by a special version of a military missile . " The Atlas , for example , has enough performance to put this in orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a scientist with the civilian space agency . ( The Defense Department expects Atlas will be fairly reliable within the next year or so , as more firings are held . But officially it wo n't confirm that Atlas will launch the man-in-space capsule . ) In order to return the man to earth safely from altitudes of several hundred miles it is expected that the manned space capsule will have a series of retro-rockets , designed to slow the vehicle down from its 18,000 mile-per-hour speed . The vehicle also probably will be covered at the top with a material that can absorb lots of heat , such as beryllium , as it leads the flight through space . " It might be made of some ablating material , such as nylon , that in effect vaporizes and forms a shield of gas that prevents so much heat from being carried into the space capsule 's body , " figures a Government space expert . The portion of the space craft that houses the passenger is likely to be constructed of stainless steel , covered over with other materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final space capsule can be expected to weigh over 2,000 pound* , scientists estimateIt would be equipped with radio conirnunications with the ground and a. limited amount of food , they add . As a further precaution , the craft would probably be equipped with special parachutes to slow the vehicle in its descent to earth , Many of the details  --  at least on a theoretical basis  --  have been discussed by space experts , including the Army 's Dr. Wernher von Braun , before Congresitional committees . But , as might be expected , the experts often disagreed . For example , Dr. Von Braun backs a project to shoot a man in a capsule up ' in a Redstone missile and return him to earth . But many scientists within the civilian apace agency are cool to shooting a man into the air . The plan just approved to orbit a manned vehicle has considerably more scientific backing than the plan for just shooting a man up in a missile and letting him come back down . The space capiule is primarily a scientific venture , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle for military use . The Air Force 's Dyna-Soar , a manned satellite and space glider , is expected to be launched in the early 1960 's . Militarily , it could be used for reconnaissance work , dropping bombs and even " policing outer space , " the Air Force says . Two competitive teams of contracts are doing initial work on Dyna-Soar , one headed by Boeing Airplane Co. , Seattle , and another led by Martin Co. , Baltimore .
