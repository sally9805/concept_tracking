txt The most shocking scandal in amateur sport broke today when Gene Squeaky Melchiorre , a Bradley university All - American basketball player last season , and.four Bradley teammates , gave Peoria County State 's Atty . Michael Shore evidence that they had accepted $5,500 in bribes from New York gamblers who made one payoff on a downtown Peoria street and another in Chicago 's Morrison hotel . A former Bradley athlete may have been implicated as a go-between . Four gamblers , one already under indictment on a similar charge arising from bribing college basketball players in New York , are involved . It is expected that the same evidence that unveiled the Bradley scandal will point to at least one other University . Admit Taking Bribes Signing sworn statements admitting the acceptance of bribes were Melchiorre , a 23 year old former resident of Highland Park , Ill. ; William Mann , 24 , who once attended Chicago 's Austin High school ; Aaron Preece , 24 , formerly of Canton , Ill. ; Charles Bud Grover , 22 , a graduate of Dundee , Iii. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All except Kelly , who did not sign a statement until this evening , were graduated from Bradley this spring after starring on the school 's quintet .

He was released when Shore said he was convinced Chianakas was not a participant , the he may innocently have introduced some of the Bradley players to Nick The Greek Englisis , who allegedly made the payoffs and who is one of the gamblers named in the statements . Invade New Territory The bribes center around two games , both played in Robertson fieldhouse on the Bradley campus , marking the first time basketball 's scandalous bettors , already under fire for activities in New York 's Madison Square Garden , have dared to invade another territory .

Investigation of New York 's recent basketball - bribery cases brought the evidence involving the Bradley athletes . Vincent A. G. O'Connor , New York assistant district attorney , presented the evidence to Shore in Peoria today . Shore immediately called Melchiorre , Mann , Grover , and Preece for questioning by himself and // Five Basketball Players at Bradley Admit Fixing Games // O'Connor 's staff .

Melchlorre Does Collecting Shore said Melchiorre , the 5 foot 8% inch Bradley floor general , admitted collecting both payoffs from Nick Englisis . Shore added that Melchiorre also revealed that he had been offered $5,000 to see that Bradley lost when it met City College of New York in the 1950 National Collegiate Athletic association playoff finals in Madison Square Garden . Melchiorre said that he turned this offer down . In fact , the fiery little fellow almost won the game , for Bradley .

Y. players recovered the ball from Melchiorre and scored another goal to win , 71 to 68 .

Shore said he will submit results of his investigation to the Peoria county grand jury in September , or , if he finishes soon enough , he may ask that the May grand jury be recalled . Shore said that he primarily is interested in prosecuting the gamblers , but that the five athletes will not be let off . He said he may go to New York to question Tony Englisis and Klukofsky . Shore said ' that the basketball players could face one to five year prison sentences and/or $1,000 to $5,000 lines if they are tried and found guilty of accepting bribes . The gamblers would face a possible five year sentence and fines of $1,000 to $5,000 if found guilty .

Failure to report and acceptances of , bribes ban for life any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley players emphasized that they did not enter any agreement to lose a game , but only agreed to keep Bradley 's winning margin down to enable gamblers to collect on the point spread . Lt. Oakey disclosed that any ? gambler , regardless of his name , was addressed as " Ed Turner " when contacted in New York on the telephone by a player . Oakey said that the name Turner might have been chosen because the gambler had a financial interest in " the turn of the game . " Given $100 as Bonus Melchiorre , Mann , and Grover , who did not play due town injured ankle , got $500 each from the payoffs in 1949 . Preece and Kelly also shared in the 1950 bribe . Melchiorre 's share then was $2,000 , $1,000 for Preece , $500 divided between Mann and Grovel:fiend $5001 for Kelly , who ' with Chiaiiikas was not questioned until today . Shore said that Nick the Greek also allegedly gave $100 each to Melchiorre and two other Bradley athletes in January , 1950 , in Philadelphia , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was merely listed as a " bonus " after the game , as Bradley players had not been approached beforehand . Melchiorre said he first was approached when Bradley was playing in the National Invitational tournament in 1949 . Bradley lost in the semi-finals , but Melchlorre was approached by Nick the Greek before a consolation game with Bowling Green and told that he could be paid off if Bowling Green won by a greater margin than the betting cards gave it . Margin Not Big Enough Melchiorre said that he and the Bradley athletes gave the gambler no answer . Bowling Green won , but by less than the margin indicated on the cards and neither Melchiorre nor any of the other player was approached after that game . The next contact was made in Peoria in the fall of 1949 . Then before the Washington game in December , the Bradley athletes were asked to make the game closer than the margin gamblers were granting Bradley . Melchiorre , Mann , and Grover were involved in this and Melchiorre received the money from Nick the Greek on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition to hold Bradley 's margin against Oregon State was made . Melchiorre collected from Nick on that one , on Dec. 9 , 1950 , two days after the game . To Continue Investigation Shore indicated that the investigation would continue , perhaps with questioning of at least one other player on the 1949-50 team . Shore said he believes that this player , whom he would not name , may have received some of the bribe money without knowing its source . The five players involved told Shore that the money they received had been spent in various ways . The incident rocked the Bradley campus just when the university was sponsoring a movement to return basketball to college campuses . This movement resulted from New York basketball gambling scandal and Bradley 's first step was made when it was host to seven other colleges in an invitational tournament last season .
