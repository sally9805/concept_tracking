Does God ever sit on the judge 's bench ? He does if the judge really seeks Him , thinks Federal Judge Harold R. Medina , who presided over the trial of the eleven top-ranking U.S. Communists . Last week the Living Church quoted from a speech by Episcopalian Medina on the subject , " The Judge and His God " : <P> " There is much in the Bible about judges , but I do not know of any judge who has discussed the impact of religion upon his profession . . . Fortunately for me , I was taught to pray from so early a time that I can not remember going to bed at night without saying my prayers ... I do not see why a judge should be ashamed that he prays for divine guidance and for strength to do his duty . . . <P> " There came a time . . . when I did the most sincere and the most fervent praying that I have ever done in my life . I suddenly found myself in the midst of the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize what they were trying to do to me . But as I got weaker and weaker , and found the burden difficult to bear , I sought strength from the one source that never fails . <P> " Let me be specific . There came a time when one of the defendants on the stand refused to answer a question , pleading a supposed constitutional privilege which obviously had no application . I gave him time to consult with his counsel . I held the matter in abeyance overnight , and on the next day ... I sentenced the man to prison for 30 days , unless he should sooner purge himself of contempt by answering the question . Pandemonium broke loose . The other ten defendants and their lawyers , and many of the spectators , rose to their feet ; there was a great shouting and hullabaloo , and several of the defendants started toward the bench . <P> " In all that excitement , I felt just as calm as I do now ... I did not raise my voice ... I singled out several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it on the record , and sentenced each of them to imprisonment for the balance of the trial . <P> " I tell you . . . that I never had the will and the self-control to do these things . If ever a man felt the presence of someone beside him , strengthening his will and giving him aid and comfort , I certainly did on that day . . . <P> " After all is said and done , it is not we who pull the strings ; we are not the masters , but the servants of our Master 's will ; and it is well that we should know it to be so . "
