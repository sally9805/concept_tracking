In Santa Fe one fine autumn day , the wind tore away the canvas covering a 2-by-4-ft. bas-relief on the wall of an annex to New Mexico 's Capitol . The bas-relief looked sullen , weary and very nude and it shocked a passing citizen . At once he told his Baptist minister , who in turn marched off to protest to 65-year-old Governor Thomas J. Mabry that the sculptured figure 's reclining position was " extremely suggestive . " <P> The governor could not quite see what the fuss was about . He was " no longer intrigued by the sight of an undressed woman , " he said somewhat irrelevantly , and furthermore a magazine called Finlandia Pictorial , then &; there on his desk , showed all sorts of public nude statues in Finland . " We all know , " said he , " that the Finns are a moral people . " But Tom Mabry , a Democrat , was up for reelection , and arranged to hear both sides : the artists , and three churchmen , led by the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sculptor , William Longley , bearded and 27 , insisted that his bas-relief-which the newspapers nicknamed " Miss Fertility " - was wholly without sex appeal . His supporters cited the nudes in Rome 's Sistine Chapel . " Evil be to him , " said one , " who evil thinketh . " " I can show you things in the Bible , " said famed Artist John Sloan to the protesting churchmen , " that would make this look like lemonade . " No artist , he said , would find the sculpture pornographic . <P> " There are other people in the state besides artists , " countered a churchman . Then , said Sloan , " it 's up to us to educate these people . " " It 's up to me , " replied the churchman coldly " to educate you . " <P> " It would be cowardly . " said the governor , " to take this statue down simply to appease certain people . If we start censorship , who will do the censoring ? " Then , still thinking of November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had the nude taken down . <P> At week 's end , a Committee for the Preservation of Cultural Freedom was trying to get it put back up . Their grounds : the architect had n't the authority to take the nude down , since it was a public work ; since the taxpayers paid for it , they had a say in its disposal . <P> The issue no longer was whether the nude was artistically good , or morally bad ( a good many citizens seemed to think it was neither ) . The issue now , trumpeted the committee , was censorship . One J. Robert Jones , a letter-to-the-editor writer , summed it up : " I am a citizen of New Mexico , a taxpayer and property owner , " wrote Mr. Jones , " and I think that the work in question looks like hell . But principles are principles . "
