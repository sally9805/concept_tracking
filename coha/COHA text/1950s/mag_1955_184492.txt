It was raining buckets in Paris ' Boulevard Poissonniere one night last week as six taxi drivers shouted and gesticulated at the door of the Hotel Violet . " What kind of a circus is this ? " cried one . " We 'll get wet as pigs , " complained another . " This calls for an extra tip . " Eventually , the taxicabs got under way , carrying 16 American girls dressed in flowing silver-grey silk and toting violins , violas , cellos and a string bass ; their conductor , Boris Sirpo , and a few assistants . In sum total they were the Little Chamber Orchestra from Portland , Ore. , and their destination was the National French Television studio in Rue Cognacq-Jay . <P> The orchestra 's dampened debut before France 's TV watchers was a cloud-high point of a seven-week European tour that had already won raves in Finland , Sweden , Norway , Denmark and England . As the French cameras blinked on , Conductor Sirpo led the girls through a solemn , contemplative Corelli air , a Vivaldi piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , some modern variations by Alexander Tansman and an allegro by Stamitz . They played with fire and discipline that astonished their listeners-and played everything without a sheet of music . When they had done , the TV crew crowded around , and the studio audience burst into applause . <P> Part Payment . The triumphal tour was the kind of stuff that winsome movies are made of . The girls themselves range in age from 15 to 28 , have been rehearsing for their tour for the last two summers . Conductor Sirpo , 60 , is a harddriving ; expatriate Finn who wants the old countries to understand the deep-down values he has found in the U.S. " I felt the need to repay America for giving me so much , " he explains , " and for a music teacher , music is the only way to repay something . I wanted to show Europeans what young Americans can do in music , to let them see something of the culture and spiritual power our country can produce . " <P> Conductor Sirpo abandoned his own conservatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the U.S. Since 1945 , he has been teaching at Portland 's Presbyterian Lewis and Clark College , where as many as 70 students brave his celebrated sternness to play in his student orchestra . One reason : beneath the rigorous vigor lies a puckish streak that relieves the direst stress . For example , Sirpo was once felled on the podium by a minor stroke , and somebody shrieked that he had been shot . As the cops arrived , he regained his speech and muttered solemnly : " My wife did it . " On another occasion , the Sirpos had just moved into a house that was supposed to be haunted . Sure enough , ghostly sounds wakened the couple , and Mrs. Sirpo suggested that he investigate . " No , my love , " said he . " You go ; your English is better . " Money Back . The girls take their tour with all the seriousness that a dedicated Finn and a Presbyterian education can instill . " It 's like a mission , " said one .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
