It is 48 years since a U.S. gymnastic team won an Olympic championship . Even that victory at the world 's fair in St. Louis in 1904 may have been hollow : some experts still say that the Americans won because there was no real European competition , and furthermore predict that the U.S. will never turn out a topflight team . Why ca n't the U.S. produce champion gymnasts ? One man who thinks he knows is German-born Coach Bernard Unser of the famed Bronx branch of the American Turners ( until 1948 , the Turnverein ' ) . Says Unser : " In this country gymnastics is not considered a sport as it is in Europe . The average person here says , ' What do I care about people on monkey bars ! ' " <P> No matter what the public says , 92 steel-armed men and 38 agile women risked making monkeys of themselves last week at Pennsylvania State College . They were thrashing about for the National Amateur Athletic Union gymnastic titles . For some , the stakes were bigger : eight berths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams . The men 's Olympic events demand all-round agility on 1 ) a single horizontal bar , 2 ) two parallel bars , 3 ) a side horse , 4 ) a long horse , 5 ) a pair of suspended rings . The sixth event : free calisthenics , i.e. , without hand apparatus . <P> Olympic gymnasts must excel in all six events ; the points they make in each specialty are totaled , first for individuals , then for their team . The high team total wins the Olympic title . Thus , the few specialists developed by the U.S. have actually dragged down the team 's total in past Olympics and proved more hindrance than help to their more versatile fellows . <P> At the Penn State meet , a Philadelphia schoolteacher , 26-year-old Bob Stout , upset the Bronx Turners ' favored Edward Scrobe , to take the all-round title and win the No. 1 Olympic berth on the men 's team . A fellow member of Stout 's Philadelphia club , wiry Housewife Clara Schroth Lomady , 31 , won the all-round honors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic spot for the second time . <P> In the 1948 Olympics , U.S. women beat some relatively easy competition to place third , outshining the U.S. men , who wound up seven notches below the Finnish champions . U.S. Olympic Coach Gene Wettstone , who calls U.S. gymnastics an " orphan sport , " remains glum . Eying American prospects for Helsinki this summer , he thinks " foreign countries will probably top us again . "
