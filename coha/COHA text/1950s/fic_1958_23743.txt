I T ' S a funny thing about studying medicine . Sometimes you get to know a patient , and sometimes you do n't . I mean really know him . Of course , if you do a decent job on your history and your physical , you can usually get a pretty good idea of where the trouble lies . But you can go over a patient all day , in fact you can go over him every day for weeks , and never get to know him , even when you 've asked him every question in the whole history-taking manual . Even if he can tell you a story about every sore throat he 's ever had , you might not get to know him . That 's the way it was with Bluhm and me . Bluhm was my first patient in medical school ? and nearly my last . I was just starting , you understand . I had just finished two years of medical school and I was beginning in the clinics . To tell the truth , I almost did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second year , and they were all set to boot me out right then and there . But I told them how much I wanted to be a doctor , and finally they decided to see what I could do with patients . I was on the spot , though , let me tell you . One mistake and bingo  --  into my father 's business . So what happened ? They threw me in with this wise apple Bluhm . My first morning in the hospital they assigned him to me . It was quite a shock . I had n't even gotten to my locker yet when I heard my name over the telepage . That 's the way they do it in our hospital . As soon asyou get assigned a patient , they start paging you . It really threw use when I heard that thing . If you 've never heard your name over telepage before , and all of a sudden at eight in the morning , on an empty stomach , someone starts paging you , it can throw you . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ready and started up there . There was a mirror on the wall just outside Bluhm 's room and before I went in I checked my appearance . The one thing I remembered from the sophomore lectures was that no matter what , you had to look like a doctor . ' What it really came down to was you had to do a good job of fooling the patients . Of course no one said that , but you got the idea all right . If you looked enough like a doctor people might not catch on that you were a junior medical student . Seeing myself in the mirror I hoped I might pass for a real doctor . I had on my white coat with a stethoscope slipped into one side pocket and fixed so that just enough of the tubing stuck out . That 's a point of style I ca n't go into now , but take it from me , it makes a difference among doctors how much tubing sticks out . In the other pocket I had a note book , a reflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the successful clinicians in the hospital had a lot of things sticking out of their breast pockets , so I 'd put a couple of pens in there along with a mechanical pencil , a ruler , and a few tongue depressors . It looked impressive all right . The only trouble was I had to walk slowly so that everything would n't jangle . When I walked into Bluhm 's room and saw him , at first I thought he was dead . I mean dead about a thousand years . He looked like one of these guys in an explorer picture that gets lost in a desert without any canteen , and his friends show up in Bermuda shorts later and find him just bones , with vultures flying around and all . Even his pajamas looked sort of pecked at . He was lying there giving me the eye , sort of squinty-like . Not too friendly , I 'll tell you . I did n't know what to do . I had come to give this man medical attention , and he was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt like getting out of there and going to law school or some place . Finally , though , I asked him how he was feeling . I 'd been standing there a couple of minutes without saying anything , and I was getting worried he might think I was a psychiatrist , so I put on this kind of professional cheery voice  --  you know , the nauseating kind , and I said : " How are you feeling today , Mr. Bluhm ? " Real cheery . " To tell you the truth , I 'm sick in bed today , " said Bluhm . That 's the way he was . You could n't give him an inch . Naturally I introduced myself as doctor , but I do n't think it went over too well . In fact I know it did n't because right away Bluhm asked me what year I was in . " What year you in ? " he said , as though trying to show me he knew something . That burned me . Suppose I was really a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluhm could be a real smart alec when he wanted to . I did n't want to give myself away , though , so I said : " I 'm an extern , sir . " " Oh , - said Bluhm , " that 's different . Why did n't you say so ? You should have said so when you first came in . For a minute I was thinking you was a regular doctor . " A real wise guy . The trouble was , Bluhm had been around university hospitals a lot . He knew all the medical school gimmicks . " What 's wrong with you , Mr , Bluhm ? " I said . I said this sort of firmly . Not too firmly , understand , but eirough ro let him know that I was n't holding any auditions for " Can You Top This ? " or anything . " What am I , an M.D. ? Overnight they gave me a license ? How do I know what 's wrong with me ? I 'll tell you a secret . I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with me . " " Well , what symptoms have you got ? " " What symptoms ? " " Yeah . You got headaches , pains in the stomach ? Are you nervous , or what ? " " That 's it . " " What 's it ? " " I 'm nervous . All the time I 'm getting nervous . " " Nervous , eh ? What are you nervous about ? " " Twenty-two dollars a day and he 's asking me what I 'm nervous about . " " Have you noticed any unusual sensations in your arms or legs , Mr. Bluhm ? " " Yeah , now you 're mentioning it , since FE. here , my arms is feeling Iike pin cushions . " This guy 's sense of humor could really devastate you . " You 've had quite a bit of blood drawn today , I imagine , " I said , I was trying to be cordial , for God 's sake . " Why not ? They see I 'm an old man . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack like that up his sleeve , Bluhm . Always with the kind word . " It 's not a matter of practice , Mr. Bluhm . That blood is taken for important tests . You 'll be glad you had them . " Bluhm looked at me with that squinty eye of his . " What arc you , the chief ? miller around here or something ? Maybe you 're Dr. Salk from the vaccine , you know so much ? " I FELT like giving him a wise answer when he said that . You know , something real sarcastic to shut him up . Still , I did n't want to antagonize him . After all , he was my first patient and you know how you always imagine that you are going to have a wonderful relationship with your first patient . You do n't like to give up that idea . Besides , to tell the truth , I was plenty worried about what was liable to happen in this situation . If the attending doctors found out that I was not getting along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that . The way things were , it would probably mean the old heave-ho . So I tried to be nice to Bluhm . I laughed at his idiotic jokes , but I still could n't get a history out of him . All he would tell was this fantastic stuff . With most of the patients on the gastro-intestinal service you get too much history . A lot of people with digestion trouble and constipation and things like to tell vou all about it , especially the details . It can get you pretty sore . But not Bluhm . All he would tell me were these wild stories . " Have you had any major illnesses ? " I asked him . " You do n't know the half of it , " said Bluhm . " I was born with a defective heart . Had an operation for it in the ' eighties . " That was about sixty years before anyone ever heard of that kind of surgery . Whatever disease I asked about , he 'd had it . High blood pressure , diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had them all . If you started breathing in diseases like a chain smoker you could n't have that many . It would be odds-on you 'd never get past kindergarten , no less live to a mean old age , having half these things . But that did n't bother Bluhm . He 'd just start telling stories of this or that disease and how it nearly wiped out the whole old country and how he survived by a miracle , and a lot of other lunatic stuff until I was really up to my neck . " Have you ever had tularemia ? " I finally asked him . That 's some crazy disease no one ever gets . You have to live with a bunch of rab ? bits or something to get it . " No , " said Bluhm , " all my friends had it , but I never came down with it . " Well , finally I gave up trying to get the history . I just was n't doing any business on that score at all . I figured maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like that very much , " Bluhm said when I told him I would like to examine him . " It would be a pleasure . Only I ca n't do it . " " What do you mean , you ca n't do it ? " " My doctor would n't like it . He 's the jealous type . " " Look , Mr. Bluhm , " I said , " I 've been sent here by the medicine department to go over you . " " I tell ya what . Go back to the medicine department and tell them I ca n't afford it . Blue Cross do n't cover no treatment by undergradu-ates . " " Mr. Bluhm , " I said , " in a hospital like this everyone is a student . " I heard someone say that once about a British university . " Would I deny it ? Certainly everyone 's a student . Only thing , I got a funny quirk . I like better the students around sixty years old . I feel sorry for them they been studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , though . He did me a big favor and let me poke around , but to tell the truth I did n't get too much information . He had quite a few lumps , but I did n't know whether they were supposed to be there or not . It 's hard to tell on old patients , especially if you got a " C " in anatomy to begin with . Besides , all the time he kept saying things to throw me off the track . " Feel the goiter on my neck ? " he asked . " Notice the liver is a little swollen ? " Things like that just to mix me up . At first I believed him and I started poking around like mad  --  it 's hell to pay if you miss a thyroid or a liver  --  but pretty soon I saw this stupid , apple-eating grin come on his face . So I cut it out . I could have kicked myself halfway around the ward and back for being such an idiot . A FTER I finished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured the best thing I could do for our relationship at that point was to get out of there and stay out . I felt depressed as hell . I had no history and I knew I 'd clone a pretty stinko physical , even by my flexible standards . It did n't help , either , to think of the bright remarks old Bluhm was liable to make to the doctors about me . They take very seriously any comment a patient makes about a student , even if the patient is a lunatic , After that I tried to avoid Bluhm , but it seemed as though every time I passed his room to go to the lab or something he 'd catch me . I 'd be walking past there , and he 'd spot me from his bed and call out . Naturally all he wanted was to aggravate me a little . " I 've got cutting pains across the middle , " he 'd call to me as I passed by , or , " Feels like that disc of mine has slipped again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me in there and give me the business for a little while . He collected newspaper clippings , and whenever I came , he 'd show me ones that he 'd saved especially for me . Things like help-wanted ads For veterinarians or stories about people that got jailed for impersonating officers . He said he thought I 'd appreciate them . Actually I had almost gotten used to Bluhm 's sterling personality . In fact I had to admit that sometimes he could be pretty clever  --  in an asinine way , of course , But I was getting a little tired of it all , too . At one o'clock one morning , I was paged and told that I was wanted in Bluhm 's room . I was just about to go home for a little sack time after doing lab work all night and I felt like saying the hell with it and leaving , but like a dope , I did n't . I went up to his room . Do you know what he wanted ? You 'll never believe this in a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . At one o'clock in the morning . I told him I was a Buddhist and I was late for a prayer meeting . " No kiddin ' , " he says , " you been Bar Mitzvah ? " I told him I was n't Bar Mitzvah and good ight . " Why not ? " he wanted to know . " What 's the matter , you 're not Jewish ? " " I 'm terribly sorry , Mr. Bluhm , " I said , " but I 'm a Christian . " " What are you so sorry ? You ca n't help it . Do n't worry . Some Christians are very nice . " " Thanks , " I said . I was n't in the mood for that kind of thing . It was late and 1 was beat and I wanted to go home . But old Bluhm just kept talking to me . I do n't know why . I suppose he just felt like talking to someone that night . You got the idea A Clarification from Rosebud T H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just that the rest of the world is n't made to fit it . ? " The Pond Creek Philosopher . " Rosebud News ( Texas ) , July 25 , 1958. he was a kind of lonely character anyway , Bluhm . Ile told me he had no family and he lived alone in a hotel room and I doubt if he had any real friends . With his personality I do n't think anyone could have taken him for very long . Anyway , he just went on like that , talking to me for a couple of hours , until I could hardly keep my eyes open . He talked about all kinds of things . The Jewish religion , politics , television , chess , the movies , history  --  everything . He was n't really educated , but it seemed he had ideas on a thousand different things . I listened as best I could , but I could n't help dozing a little , I was so pooped . When I finally got out of there , it was after three , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was idiotic . I should have walked out and let him try to trap some other screwball . But 1 do n't know , I just could n't do it . He looked so damn skinny and pecked at and everything , and I knew that he 'd just gotten me up there to have someone to listen to him . So I stayed . I 'm a prize ass when it comes to situations like that . I DID N'T see Bluhm for a while after that , but about a week later I came into his Mom with a group of doctors . It was during what they call grand rounds , when the chief of the service takes his residents and a few medical students to see a slew of patients . It 's usually quite a time , with the chief showing off to beat the band and everyone else giving him the old " yes sit " until its enough to stir up a little reverse peristalsis . ? There were eight of us that mourning and we marched into the patients ' rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident second , the second-year resident third , and so on until you got down to the medical students , bringing up the rear . When we got near Bluhm 's room , this Dr. Ackman , who 's head of the G.I. service and a real brain on bowel problems , suddenly asked me to tell the group what I knew about the case . I was caught by surprise . Usually Ackman did n't do things like that . Most of the time he was too busy to bother with the students ' reports . But all of a sudden he wanted me to give him a summary of the case . Well , I told him what I knew , which Look about three minutes , and then for twenty minutes Ackman got me against the wall and started pumping me with questions , and every time I could n't answer one , he got a little nastier . I really think he got a kick out of making me squirm . When that friend of humanity finally got through with me , he led the parade into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just tell the residents thought T was a low-grade moron . As soon as we got in there Ackman took hold of Bluhm 's hand and started playing the old family doctor in a voice that sounded as though he was announcing " The Firestone Hour . " I really felt like leaving the room , it got so bad . All Ackman really said in the end was that Bluhm would have to have an exploratory operation  --  in other words that he was in the same situation , diagnostically speaking , as I was  --  but he threw in ten minutes ' worth of polysyllables to make it sound good . Everyone crowded around him as though he was from the Nobel Prize committee , but I stood way in the back . I was n't very keen on Ackman at that point , and besides I did n't want Bluhm to see me . Under the circumstances I did n't think it would be to my advantage for Bluhm to make one of his bright remarks about me . He saw me , though . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression on his face , as if he could n't figure out who was Jewish and who was n't . When he spotted me , though , he smiled a little . Rut I did n't smile back . I did n't want to start anything . Through most of Ackman 's talk Bluhm was quiet , but near the end , when he got to the part about the operation , Bluhm spoke tip . " Pardon me , " he said . " I do n't think I got that so well . You said an operation I need ? " " I 'm afraid it 's the only way to establish the diagnosis , Mr. Bluhm , " said Ackman . " I see . You could n't maybe  --  maybe do without a diagnosis ? " " Not very well , I 'm afraid . After all we can not treat intelligently if we do not know what entity we are dealing with . " " Sure . Sure , I could see that . But , well , to tell the truth , I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is the best way , believe me. - " You could n't maybe take a few more pictures ? " " It would n't do any good . " " Okay . Well , listen . I do n't know . There 's something I would Like to do first . I 'd like to ask my own doctor , get his opinion . That 's okay with you ? " " You have a physician on the outside you would like to consult ? " asked Ackman , sounding slightly hurt . " What on the outside ? On the inside . There 's my doctor over there . " And with that apple-eating grin on his face Bluhm pointed at me . " Sure that 's my doctor right there . Took care of me all the time . " " Is that right ? " asked Ackman , grinning . " Sure . Sure , " said Bluhm . " All the time I 'm here . Very fine doctor . He has a real heart , that doctor . " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ackman , turning to me . " Wo n't you , Doctor ? " All I could do was nod . I nodded four times , I wanted to say something ; to protest , to explain about Bluhm , but it was as though I 'd had a stroke and had lost the ability to speak . I could n't make a sound . I looked around . The residents were fighting laughter behind coughs and cupped hands . Even Ackman seemed to be smiling . I did not know what to do , or even what to think . All I knew for certain was that Bluhm was an out-and-out lunatic . But you know , when I glanced over there he looked pretty normal . I swear he did . It was amazing . He did n't even look pecked at .
