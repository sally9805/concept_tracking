like other writers of comparable stature , are performing an ancient function : ritualizing , dramatizing , selecting the deeper motifs of a culture . Eberhart more than others has proposed for himself the theme of the fact of death , a theme doubtless as old as poetic expression itself . In his work , however , we find no incantations to ward death off , or ingenious proofs of its irrelevance , or outcries against cruel nature . His best-known poem , " The Groundhog , " introduces the shock of fact immediately : The speaker tells how he stood and stared and poked the animal 's maggoty body with a stick " and kept my reverence for knowledge . " There is no escape into more abstract considerations , despite his loathing and the sickness of the " strange love " welling up in him . Later in the year he returns to the scene again and sees the " bony sodden hulk " of the groundhog ; the next summer he finds the skeleton " beautiful as architecture " in the sunlight ; three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved from that first strong emotional involvement through less " concerned " attitudes to a sudden final vision of the futility of , yet necessity for , heroism , wisdom and mystic vision ? human buffers and constructs against time . 0 This is a way of " meeting " death characteristic of modern poets , though the reader may find ? strong parallels in Donne and others of the seventeenth century . Side by side are ranged a recognition of a tragic reality , a scientific and esthetic " objectivity " and a desire to counteract knowledge with imaginative assertions that transcend reality . Sometimes an Eberhart poem is pitched in so high an emotional key that the vision of traniformation and the catastrophic knowledge are fused together , seen as equally valid perceptions of the whole truth . " In a Hard Intellectual Light , " for instance , is a Blakean attempt to merge the moral , humanistic purposes motivating the search for truth with " the hard intellectual light , " which , as he says : At other times the deaths of famous men ? Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or humor . Death is no more serious for such , after all , than it is for the rest of us . Again , the rich complexities of wit and imagination evoked in the life of the free intelligence may force grimmer recognitions temporarily underground , as in Eberhart 's " Ode to the Chinese Paper Snake . " This poem , and his " Retrospective Forelook , " views our culture and its history in ironic perspective ; perhaps they imply , a relationship between the individual 's obsession with the harshness and bleakness of the truth about death and a society 's consciousness , as a whole , of the needs for self-deception underlying cultural forms . All this taken together composes into a vision not too unlike that of Herbert Read , who must certainly sympathize with Eberhart 's attempt to use all the resources of will , humor , logic and fantasy to create a human counter-reality to bleakness ? what Eberhart calls But Read 's " metaphysical " arguments are knottier and doser to the genuine religious questionings of Donne than to Eberhart 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despondency ? curiously , because the statements are so precise and bold . Read 's Collected Poems doses on a very dark note , the poem " 1945 , " which views unmoved the hopes of the victors in the last war , presented in the image of children " running over the perilous sands " believing they have found riches by the shore : We have seen this note in Eberhart 's writing , too , and would not be surprised to find in Read a parallel counter-effort toward " positive " synthesis . The latter 's work , however , is more bitterly depressed , rarely containing a full assertion of mystical realization as the high point of a poem . The difference is partly one of emphasis . Thus , Read 's " The Lament of St. Denis " begins with images of burnt-out faith and macabre gayety : Slowly it rises to its moment of exaltation and epiphany , but then lets down sharply into a personal outcry that dashes cold water over the painfully . built up Platonic illusion : . But in the long poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly explicit and partly symbolic , of the individualist creed that shows where the poet 's heart , if not quite his faith , lies . Read 's better-known poems are those dealing with war . These are " anti-war poems ; " yet often imbued with a social mysticism which almost means acceptance of war as a precondition of grace . " The Execution of Cornelius Vane " and a few others , though , concern themselves more simply with the pity of war , Wilfred Owen 's theme . ( Owen 's influence is dear in " Bombing Casualties in Spain . " ) The story of poor Cornelius ' panic and desertion is told directly and vividly , and there are few moments of poetic narrative as poignant as the dosing lines that tell of the execution : He saw a party of his own regiment , With rifles , looking very sad . The morning was bright , and as they tied The cloth over his eyes , he said to the assembly : " What wrong have I done that I should leave these : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The concentrated sadness of " The Heart Conscripted " and of these poems of pity can not ' destroy the image and hope for " a crystal city in the age of peace " ; but Read 's knowledge , again like Eberhart 's , is in large part the self-knowledge of a culture fully aware of the deep stain of its evil compulsions . In both poets the naive delight in nature , in love and the spontaneous discovery of beauty and melody , is largely subordinated to this knowledge and thus made pathetic . Now that Horace Gregory 's Selected Poems makes it easy to review his whole development , we can see how thoroughly and consciously elegaic a poet he has always been . There was ever a pure , lucid , nostalgic dassical strain in his verse ; the early studies in and translations of Latin poets remain a permanent influence , blending with and sometimes outlasting. the later stamp of such strong literary personalities as Lawrence , Pound and Jeffers . The influence comes through not only in the clarity and elegance of phrasing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as of a loss of relationship between the traditional poetic sensibility and the world it now finds itself in . Gregory 's " social " poems of the thirties were less poems of protest or propaganda than efforts to find a home for that sensibility . In " 0 Metaphysical Head , " a key to his writing of that period , we see him exploring conventional romantic conceptions of the ideal self ? the " good guy , " the hero , the great lover , the successful man ? and emerging with an image of a headless beggar as the most realistic suggestion of what has happened to personality in the wasteland of the modern spirit . " Hagen " is pure elegy in a naturalistic setting , though " social " in its pointing up of the waste , once more , of human possibilities . " Longface Mahoney Discusses Heaven " reduces the pipedream of happiness in an ordered world to its most elementary form ? a bum 's imagined escape from poverty and cops to . . . someplace unreal where everybody goes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a room in a hotel . A brass bed , military hairbrushes , a couple of coats , trousers , maybe a dress on a chair or draped on the floor . Gregory 's good taste and integrity as a craftsman have saved him from bumptiousness and overstatement . Thus , his " Interior : the Suburbs " is both a nonconformist 's criticism of the narrowness of bourgeois perspectives and an assertion of " desperate valor , " the endurance that can wring value out of absurdity . Chorus for Survival , the culminating poem-sequence of Gregory 's " dissident " period , subordinates revolutionary themes and Laurentian prayers for rebirth of the personality to a classical structure modeled on Catullus ' epithalamial poetry ; thus once again it asserts , indirectly , certain values of endurance , despite the fact that several poems of the sequence are intensely bitter thrusts at the economic order and the American neglect of our best . heritage and most promising potentialities . Of his later work , the " Two Monologues from the Passion of M'Phail " are remarkable poems , traps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their sense of loss , their grasping after some remnant of personal meaning in the soul of M'Phail , the Great Salesman . Gregory has of late , as the twenty-two new poems show , been plunging further and further into the world of nostalgia , personal and cultural memory , lost meanings ? a vast inheritance of need , guilt and neglected love . He has been spinning a thin , tough web of courage out of this recognition of all that haunts the modern mind just below the surface of ordinary consciousness . Gregory 's experimentation with this area of poetic meaning has gone on for some time now ; in poems like " Elizabeth at the Piano , " " Haunted Odysseus , " " The Cage of Voices " and " Statue in the Square " he moves almost as far away from his early themes of rebirth and into an obsession with old , unhappy , far-off voices as it seems possible for even so richly resourceful an elegist to go .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
