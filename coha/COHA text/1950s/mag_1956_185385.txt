Robert E. Lee had just won a great victory at Fredericksburg when Cornelius McGillicuddy was born at East Brookfield , Mass , on Dec. 23 , 1862 . Soon after President Garfield was assassinated on July 2 , 1881 , Cornelius was beginning to be called Connie Mack , a name that fit handily into a baseball box score . Young Connie was a catcher-one of the young game 's best . He was in Pittsburgh as manager of the Pirates when Coxey 's Army marched on Washington in 1894 ; he was manager of Milwaukee in the Western League when Dewey took Manila in 1898 . And when MacArthur landed at Inchon in 1950 , Mr. Mack was still at the ballpark . He was 87 , and he had been manager of the Philadelphia Athletics for half a century . <P> It was an accomplishment simply to have lasted through the roughneck growth of baseball into its age of respectability and glory . But Connie Mack did more than survive : he changed the game . <P> Behind the Plate . As a string-straight teen-ager refugee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day when pitchers lobbed the ball underhand and catchers grabbed it on the first bounce some 15 ft. back of the plate . It was all too soft for Connie . His only equipment a fingerless kid glove , Connie walked out to the mound one day and told his pitcher to fire the ball overhand . The unexpected stunt almost started a riot among the fans , but the style stuck . <P> Then Connie moved up right behind the batter . That close , he could not resist the temptation to tip bats and trip batters . A good catcher but not a great one , he was tricky and tough enough to move up through the bush leagues into the big time . In that era of fierce competition and low salaries ( he got $200 a month in 1886 ) , Connie jumped from the solidly entrenched National League to the short-lived Brotherhood , then to the Pittsburgh Nationals , where he played until 1893 , when a broken ankle sent him on to an unparalleled career as manager . <P> At the turn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a crack at the majors , Connie gladly took on the job of organizing a competitor for the Philadelphia Nationals . Ruthlessly raiding the opposition , Connie signed up such great stars as Nap Lajoie and Lave Cross . By 1902 he had an American League pennant contender in the Philadelphia Athletics . Then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court barred all the league jumpers from playing for him . Connie was probably the only man who did not believe the A 's were through . He remembered a hard-drinking , eccentric southpaw pitcher named Rube Waddell , then dividing his time between baseball and bottle-belting in California . With Rube 's help , Connie whipped the league . <P> That was the first of nine pennants . By 1914 Connie 's A 's had won three World Series ; his " $100,000 infield " ( Stuffy Mclnnis at first , Eddie Collins at second , Jack Barry at short and Home-Run Baker at third ) was the pride of baseball . Then the A 's were humiliated in a 4-0 series with the Boston Braves . Furious , Connie broke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia finished with one foot in the cellar for seven consecutive seasons .
