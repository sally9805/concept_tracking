Wrapping the . tattered cloak of experience about them , the British stepped forward in the role of the honest broker and wise counselor . Question was : Can a man be an honest broker to a bad bargain ? The broker 's solution for the rot infecting Indo-China was partition of the country . That solution the British hoped to get at Geneva . Until they got it , or it proved impossible to get , they refused to discuss the future . " Our immediate task is to do everything we can to reach an agreed settlement at Geneva for the restoration of peace in Indo-China , " Winston Churchill told Parliament . " Until the outcome of the conference is known , no final decision can be taken on a collective defense pact in Southeast Asia . . . Her Majesty 's government has not embarked on any negotiations involving commitments , " and would not until after Geneva . <P> Churchill 's statement , and Eden 's busy activity at Geneva , made clear that the British have very different aims from the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France urgently asked the U.S. under what conditions it might be willing to intervene to help the French if 1 ) the military situation deteriorated rapidly ; 2 ) if the Chinese intervened openly ; 3 ) if no settlement was reached at Geneva . Anthony Eden was both agitated by the question and angered at being left out . He rushed off to see U.S. Under Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith . If the U.S. intervenes militarily in Indo-China and the result is world war , said Eden , Britain would have to be on the U.S. side . But he warned that if the U.S. intervenes and the fighting remains localized , Britain would remain aloof-even if the Chinese retaliated by openly joining the fighting . <P> Britain , Eden emphasized , is not interested in intervening in Indo-China under any circumstances . The British are willing to talk about a Southeast Asian pact after Geneva , but only a pact designed to guarantee what may be left of a partitioned Indo-China as a kind of buffer state-not to help the French fight on . Partition must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until something happens at Geneva , the British ignored or refused to recognize the possibility that the Communists might drag out the talks indefinitely , as they did at Panmunjom-and more profitably . Last week the Communists seemed to be quite content to bleed France a little whiter , in the hope that such bleeding would make the French more pliable . <P> By delay , the Communists could also take military advantage of the free man 's own virtues-his reluctance to squander life unnecessarily if there is a chance of peace , his sense of honest dealing which keeps him from waging war while talking peace . No such inhibitions bother the iron men of Communism .
