The University of Pittsburgh 's football team was feeling fine . The night before the opening game with West Virginia , they all stowed away a steak dinner and took in a movie , Somebody Up There Likes Me . Next afternoon , it turned out that somebody up there really did like them . Outplayed for most of the game , the Panthers just managed to go home on the long end of a 14-13 score . <P> Professional Gloom . Pitt was obviously unready for the hefty , hopped-up Mountaineers . West Virginia , on the other hand , had been pointing for Pitt since spring . Coach Art ( " Pappy " ) Lewis had taken a raw squad of untried recruits , drilled them ruthlessly , taught them that they must not play Pitt 's brand of power football . Instead , he told them , they must move faster , confuse and frustrate the Panthers ' possession type of game . <P> Pitt Coach John Michelosen had not been loafing either . With professional gloominess he tried to convince his squad of musclemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback , he insisted , was still wide open . Pitt was weak at the ends ; the Panther squad had lost a total of twelve lettermen . <P> For all Michelosen 's efforts , it was the Mountaineers in their mustard-colored uniforms who finally knocked the Panthers loose from their false pride . All through the first half , West Virginia , led by Quarterback Tricky Mickey Trimarki , dominated the game . After a Pitt fumble they went into the lead , 6-0 . <P> Small Satisfaction . Pitt 's potential heroes faded like shooting stars . Hobbled by a bad leg , Left End Joe Walton did next to nothing . Tough Tackle Bob Pollock managed a jarring shot at Mountaineer Fullback Krutko , forced him to fumble and set up the first Pitt score . For the rest of the game he was far from a terror . Pitt 's quarterbacks , Darrell Lewis and Corny Salvaterra , made Michelosen 's pre-game moaning seem prophetic . But late in the third quarter , Pitt recovered another fumble and scored once more . Again they converted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also scored again , could not make up the 1-point deficit . <P> Afterward , Coach Michelosen and his assistants could find some small satisfaction in their narrow escape . Now the Panthers would surely get down to work : their opening game had been less a victory than a bucket of ice water in the face . <P> Other favorites also got a rude awakening : <P> Faked out of their shoes by the ball-handling of Southern Methodist 's Quarterback Charlie Arnold , the Irish of Notre Dame lost their first opening game since 1934 . Score : 19-13 . <P> Thoroughly unimpressed by Maryland 's record of 15 straight victories in regular-season games , Syracuse ran rings around the sluggish Terrapins , 26-12 . <P> North Carolina 's Jim Tatum made his homecoming debut as head coach , and fell flat on his face as North Carolina State ran all over the Tarheels for the first time in 14 years . Score : 26-6.
