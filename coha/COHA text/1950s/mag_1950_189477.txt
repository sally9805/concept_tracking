Several football seasons ago a young man from out of town got one of our research librarians on the phone . The caller was embarrassed and troubled . It was Saturday morning . He had two tickets for the Army-Notre Dame game that afternoon , and a date with a beautiful girl . But he could not for the life of him remember her name . He did know , though , that TIME had once run a photograph of the young lady 's aunt thumbing her nose at the camera . If the photograph could be found , he would have his date 's last name . The TIME librarian located the picture , passed on the information-and as far as we know , the young man and his girl enjoyed the game . <P> This odd request illustrates the versatility expected of our research librarians . There are 18 of them ( 14 women , four men ) in TIME Inc. ' s Morgue ( i.e. , library of essential information ) . All are college graduates and graduate librarians . Their operation has been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By then our morgue had become so large and complex that the editorial researchers needed help in selecting from it the background material , facts and information they used for swift and accurate checking . <P> TIME 'S morgue has been 27 years abuilding and today includes some 33,000 reference books , 500,000 folders of biographical , historical , business and otherwise usefully classified information , and 50,000 periodicals . Finding your way around quickly among this mass of material demands patience , imagination and a real knowledge of the resources of the morgue . To help matters , each research librarian is a specialist in a specific field . He or she works closely with the editorial staff in these fields and attends story conferences to help out on two basic jobs : 1 ) selecting morgue material requested when stories are in the making ; 2 ) helping the editorial researchers find the sources for checking their facts after stories are written . <P> Each month the research librarians answer about 5,000 requests for facts and background material . Some of them are one-of-a-kinds : How much does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was Julius Caesar a good swimmer ? Did Shakespeare wear a nightgown ? How much money was bet at U.S. race tracks on Memorial Day , 1948 ? <P> But the bulk of the research librarian 's work is done on stories like TIME 'S cover on New York City 's Mayor O'Dwyer . After receiving the 30 folders on O'Dwyer , the researcher called for everything on New York City . Told that that would mean some 800 folders , 50 books , and innumerable magazine articles , she revised her request somewhat . The research librarian selected a group of books he thought would be most valuable , sent along a batch of folders on finance , government , industries , etc. , added some selected material from the periodicals file . As the story progressed , checking points inevitably arose on which the researcher needed specific information : the number of banks , art galleries , insurance companies , etc . Some of the figures were hard to nail down . But the end result was in paragraphs like the following : <P> " It is the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing city and the world 's greatest marketplace . . . both bees and locomotives are on sale within a stone 's throw of City Hall . "
