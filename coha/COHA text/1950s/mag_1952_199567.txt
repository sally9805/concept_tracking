Warily a patrol of Philippine army soldiers sidled through the jungle in search of Huk guerrillas . In a clearing they saw something moving . It proved to be a scrawny eight-month-old baby crawling along the ground . Another patrol stumbled on a pair of year-old infants wandering through a coconut grove . A farmer out fishing heard a baby 's wail , searched the bushes and came across two more babies . <P> Soon villagers arrived at the army billets with six more , ranging from eight months to 3 years old . They , too , had been found abandoned , ill and hungry , in the countryside . <P> Philippine army intelligence pieced together the story . A month before , the army had launched separate heavy attacks against the Communistic Huks who had been spreading terror through the provinces of Bataan and Laguna . Taken by surprise , the local Huk commanders ordered the guerrillas to retreat along narrow jungle paths into the mountains . All excess baggage had to be discarded On the way ; that included children . <P> By last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officers guessed that another 25 lay dead somewhere in the jungle brush . To care for the survivors , the army converted a quonset hut at Camp Murphy into a hospital . Doctors and nurses went to work to treat festering skin sores and cure malnutrition-but the marks that did not show were harder to administer to . The blare of bugles blowing reveille scared the Huklings so that they clutched at nurses in fear . The first sight of soldiers in uniform made them duck ; they were so disciplined to silence that the slightest shush from a nurse stopped their crying . The girls shrank from dolls , the boys were frightened by toy cars . <P> Scores of Filipino families wanted to adopt the abandoned babies , but the army would not let them , hoping instead to restore the children to their real parents ; in fact , the army hoped that concern for the Huklings might lure parents out of the jungle . Last week the army at last gave the children names instead of numbers , at a mass christening ceremony . One god parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a two-year-old girl her own name of Luz ( which means Light ) . <P> " They are now learning to play , and one or two are beginning to smile , " reported one army welfare worker . " But I have yet to hear one of them laugh . "
