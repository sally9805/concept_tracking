Time was when all the U.S. politician had to do to look like a statesman was pop over to London for a chat with Winston Churchill . But no more . With the junketeering season about to reopen , the rush is on for a place long closed to capitalistic pols : Moscow . <P> Nevada 's Republican Senator George Malone has been granted a visa to Russia . Among those who have applied for visas are Louisiana 's Democratic Senator Allen Ellender , Alabama 's Democratic Senator John Sparkman , and Connecticut 's Republican Senator William Purtell ( " I hope to get the feel of the country " ) . Seriously considering trips to Russia are Republican Senators Milton Young of North Dakota and Henry Dworshak of Idaho and Democratic Senator J. Allen Frear of Delaware . Also mulling over the idea : Kentucky 's grand old pro , Democrat Alben W. Barkley . <P> It was inevitable , however , that one man would already have his bags virtually packed : Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Estes Kefauver , toting his presidential ambitions around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Helsinki , Finland , then make the Moscow trek . He already has his visa in hand .
