In a bold experiment designed to sell more books , the publishing house of Putnam last week brought out a novel entitled The Sable Lion ( $3.50 ) with this message attached to its jacket : " This book is sold with the publisher 's unqualified guarantee of reader satisfaction . . . If you do not thoroughly enjoy it ... we will replace it with any book of your choice of similar price on the current bestseller list . " <P> Two publishing houses , Putnam and Coward-McCann , have decided to test in their own business a merchandising plan that has long been effective in other fields . As a starter , they are guaranteeing a total of twelve books on their spring lists . <P> Putnam 's lead-off book has well-tested reader satisfactions swashbuckled in . The Sable Lion is a 17th century historical novel featuring a daredevil Flemish corsair . Born to command on the bridge or in the boudoir , Marinus De Boer ( " Rinus " for short ) is a hero who turns scuppers red with blood and rivals green with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sable Lion , as well as three nonfiction books and four contemporary novels . All will stick to standard themes , e.g. , one of the contemporary novels will be The Healing Oath , a new story of French medical life by Andr Soubiran , author of the bestselling The Doctors . The publishers expect few exchanges . Says a Putnam official : " A lot of good books get lost in the shuffle because the reviewers are looking for literature . But much of the time the public just wants a good yarn . With the guaranteed-book plan , that 's what they 're going to get . "
