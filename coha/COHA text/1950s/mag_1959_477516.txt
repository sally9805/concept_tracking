WITH publication of The Mansion ( Random House , $4.75 ) William Faulkner has completed his trilogy devoted to the House of Snopes . In a rather testy note prefatory to this final volume Faulkner points out that he is fully aware of discrepancies and contradictions that have crept into the chronicle in the course of the thirty-four years since he started working on it , but most readers will be less distressed by inconsistencies in the details than by the diminution in imaginative power , comic invention , and intensity of feeling in the narrative as a whole . The first volume of the Snopes epic , The Hamlet ( published in 1940 and a year or two ago very freely translated to the screen under the title Long Hot Summer ) , is surely one of the best books Faulkner ever wrote . In one brilliant chapter after another ( the chapters are more or less independent short stories ) , with wonderful , often ribald humor , he tells of various members of the Snopes clan , the poorest and trashiest of poor white trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their exhausted tenant farms to make their way in a Mississippi hamlet called Frenchman 's Bend . The central figure in The Hamlet is Flem Snopes , a wiry little impotent money-hungry rascal with a certain low cunning and no morality whatever . He gets his hoof in the trough partly by making himself indispensable to Will . Varner , the richest man in Frenchman 's Bend , and partly by marrying Varner 's daughter Eula when she finds herself needing a husband in a hurry . In the second volume of the trilogy , The Town ( published in 1957 ) , Flem and Eula move to Jefferson , the county seat of Yoknapatawpha County , and Hem becomes rich , important , and ? he hopes ? respectable . The final volume , now published , The Mansion , takes its name from the fine house , once the possession of a leading family in the region , where Emil finally moves after he replaces his dead wife 's lover as president of the bank . But in fact Flem hardly appears in the book , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the Snopeses are crowded fromthe stage in the final scenes of their story by characters whn are a good deal more admirable , morally and socially , but vastly less interesting to read about . Most of the action ( what there is of it ) is seen through the eyes of the Jefferson lawyer Gavin Stevens , his nephew Charles Mallison , and their old friend the sewing-machine salesman V. K. Ratliff . On his first appearance Ratliff was a fine character , but for him as for many of us the passage of the years has brought a relaxation of intellectual tension and an increase in pointless gars ulity . Gavin Stevens and Charles Mallison have become more and more important in Faulkner 's later work ; in fact they are probably the biggest blight that has hit Yoknapatawpha County since the boll weevil . They are talkers , not doers , endlessly licking their chops over events of the past and speculating with ponderous coyness un the present and future . Their conversation is like wallpaper ; it can he unrolled in almost any length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Mansion both Flem and Eula are dead of boredom , and the reader has an uneasy suspicion that kie may be next . But fortunately one Snopes is left , and whenever he appears in The Mansion it comes to life with all the old power . This saving remnant is Mink Snopes , possibly the poorest of all the Snopeses , who long ago ( in The Hamlet ) murdered his unbearably rich and arrogant neighbor Jack Houston . When he was brought to trial he assumed that his well-connected cousin Fleva would come to his aid in some way , but Flem did not come , and Mink never forgave him . Patiently he serves out his thirty-eight years at the state penitentiary , waiting for the day when he can revenge himself on Flem . In the complication of his attitude toward Mink and in the richness with which he imagines Mink 's plight , Faulkner shows why , in spite of everything that can be said in criticism of his book , he is a great novelist . Mink is almost illiterate , abysmally ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varmint whose name he bears . Yet he is a man ; he has a profound if inarticulate sense that either the universe contains some kind of justice or that it is not worth living in . There is an absurd yet wonderful heroism in his total dedication to the task of making his sense of justice ( his revenge on Fiera ) prevail , whatever the odds . The passages that describe Mink 's solitary return to a half-remembered Memphis and to the Yoknapatawpha County of his youth after his thirty-eight years ' imprisonment are extremely fine . The terror that strikes Mink when he sees how the prices of even the most everyday things have risen , the disorientation he feels when the numbers along the side of the road do not decrease ( milestones have been replaced by routemarkers ) ? such details are imagined so beautifully that they should perhaps silence criticism of the tedium that marks much of the book . VINTAGE NABOKOV T H E immense success of Lolita was almost certain to increase interest in the other works of Vladimir Nabokov , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Real Life of Sebastian Knight , Nabokov 's first novel in English , originally published in 1941 ( New Directions , $3.50 ) , and the first translation of a book by Nabokov from the Russian , Invitation to a Beheading , originally written a quarter-century ago and now rendered into English by the author 's son and revised by the author himself ( Putnam , $3.75 ) . It is unlikely that either book will win anything like the audience that has responded to Lolita , chiefly because neither has the sexual interest it has , though one of them , the Invitation , has an engaging nymphet in a minor role . But in fact neither book has the richness of invention or the wonderful comedy of Lolita . But the books have a fascination beyond the fact that they illustrate earlier phases of an important writer 's work , at least for anyone who takes the art of fiction seriously , for they show Nabokov almost as much a theorizer of fiction as a practitioner . In the Invitation the young man who is to be beheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interminable novel called Quercus , which is written from the point of view of an oak tree : it tells of all the conversations that take place under the tree through the centuries , and when nothing else is happening pads out the interstices with accounts of various sciences dealing with trees . Presumably Quercus is exactly the kind of novel that Nabokov finds unbearable ; certainly it is the very opposite of the kind of novel he likes to write . With its emphasis on external detail , its slow , meticulous , and mechanical account of the passage of time , its preference for literal-minded reporting to the imagination 's bolder flights , its tendency to take itself seriously , Quercus obviously stands for the stolid , well-madehook , and Nabokov 's impatience with it recalls Virginia Woolf 's impatience with the novels of Arnold Bennett . Not that Nabokov and Virginia Woolf have much in common ( I can not imagine that they would even care to read each other 's books ) , but they share the opinion that the writing of fiction requires more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best described as a surrealistic novel . It pays no attention to any probability except the psychological ; the most unlikely events occur ? the setting changes itself , when a man starts undressing he does not stop with his clothes but takes off his shoulder-blades and ribs and other parts as well , another man sometimes goes out leaving his beard and hair behind , etc. , etc . Some of this is delightful , some of it seems simply willful , and a little of it goes a long way . One difficulty with the book is that a reader does not always know where the Russian setting leaves off and the surrealism begins ; in older Russian fiction there are often details that seem to the Western reader surrealistic but probably are not ? the character in one of Turgenev 's stories who wears two neckties , for instance , or the dish of radishes stewed in honey that is served somewhere in Gogol . The " story " in Invitation to a Beheading concerns a young man who is sentenced to die for an obscure crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know when the execution is to take place . After he has been in prison alone for a time , another prisoner , M'sieur Pierre , arrives and attempts to win him over as a friend . But M'sieur Pierre is really the executioner in disguise ; he is also in a sense death . Finally the execution takes place and the young man is at last free . The Real Life of Sebastian Knight is much more like a conventional novel , though it too is a book much concerned with the art of fiction . The Sebastian Knight of the title was a novelist when he was alive , and in the course of the book his various novels are described . They are wonderful books , quite impossible to write , but wildly inventive , turning the novel form upside down and inside out in all sorts of unlikely ways . The narrator of The Real Life of Sebastian Knight is Knight 's half-brother . He is a Russian , though Knight himself was half-English and wrote in the language and under the surname of his English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover the true character of his late half-brother , whom he had admired immensely but had scarcely seen since boyhood . He attempts to get at the identity of his brother through his books , his possessions , his old friends and former mistresses . He has one wonderful interview with his late brother 's secretary ? one Mr. Goodman ? who himself has written an account of the " real " Sebastian THE NEW BOOKS Knight . The quotations from Mr. Goodman 's book are a masterly takeoff on the affectations of vapid literary biography . The Real Life of Sebastian Knight has wit and style ; the theme of the ambiguity of identity ? by this time not the most original of themes in modern fiction ? is extremely well handled . A REPORTER 'S NOVEL AS a novelist John Hersey is almost exactly the antithesis of Nabokov ; he could probably write a novel like the hypothetical Quercus with the greatest of ease , and get everything right too , from the sound a halberd makes when it strikes against the bark of an oak to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conscientiousness ; he is limited by a circumscribed imagination . Consequently Hersey 's new book , The War Lover ( Knopf , $5 ) , a story about the Air Force in the second world war , must be looked at in two ways . As an account of the crew of a Flying Fortress based on England and bombing various Continental targets , it must he the result of many hours of dedicated research . Every detail of equipment , training , housing , weather , etc. , is as lovingly reconstructed as Colonial Williamsburg , and perhaps more convincing . Even the slang and pin-up girls of fifteen years ago are carefully disinterred . Though I can not say so with any authority , suspect a historian of the future who wants to know what the life of a Flier was like in the second world war can turn to I lersey 's book with confidence . All this is a very considerable feat , and for many readers ? especially readers who think that the first and perhaps the whole duty of a novelist is to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The War Lover is a great novel . But the narrative thread that strings together all this aeronautical archaeology is both slender and obvious . Here it is : the narrator , Lieutenant Boman , is copilot of a Flying Fortress called The Body . His closest friend and greatest hero is the pilot , Buzz Marrow . Gradually he realizes that Marrow is not the wholesome American boy he had seemed to be , that he is fundamentally perverse , and that all his superb gifts as a flier , his wonderful courage , are directed toward destruction and annihilation . There is hardly enough material in this situation for a novel , though it has been used effectively in short stories ( Sherwood Anderson 's " I Want to Know Why " is an example ) . The character of Marrow is not subtle or complex , and the reader either knows or , with the help of Hersey 's broad and repeated hints , can guess virtually about all there is to know about Marrow early in the book . The hook that is supposed to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily iterated , that some shocking revelation of Marrow 's sexual perversity will be made in time . When it comes ( about page 370 ) , this revelation is hardly a surprise ( Marrow thinks it is more fun to fly planes than sleep with girls ) , but it is made with such painstaking elaboration of detail , such embarrassing and tautological completeness , that the reader lured onward by a promise of something naughty to come has no legitimate cause for complaint . Judgment of Hersey 's accomplishment in The War Lover depends on what one is looking for in a novel . The careful research that lies behind it and the lucid reporting of Air Force life are not insignificant accomplishments , but the more specifically fictional aspect of the book is less satisfactory . ( A Book-of-theMonth-Club selection . ) TWO NOVELS BY WOMEN Mavis Gallant 's Green Water , Green Sky ( Houghton Mifflin , $3 ) is a first novel and a much slighter book than those previously discussed , or at least it has fewer pages ( only 154 of them ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of fiction , and I find myself a little troubled to say just what it is all about ; yet it is obviously the work of a highly gifted , intelligent , witty , perceptive writer . Miss Gallant can catch more of a character in a phrase than many writers can in a chapter . Here , for instance , is a description of the education of one of her minor characters ( it is not quite Miss Gallant at her best , because it is a little too self-consciously witty , a little too much a set piece , but these qualities make it inure quotable than some better passages ) : " Doris was proud ofher education ? a bundle of notions she trundled before her like a pram containing twins . She could not have told you that the shortest distance between two points was a straight line , but she did know that ' hostility ' was the key word in human relations , and that a man with an abscessed tooth was only punishing himself . " The main character in Green Water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family but limited resources , financial and otherwise . In New York , before the story opens , she has been caught by her husband in a meaningless love affair and divorced ; she feels that the disgrace is so unbearable that she must always live in Europe , and with her daughter Florence she moves from one resort to another , using Florence to fill the emptiness of her life and at the same time looking for a son-in-law who will be both socially acceptable and solvent enough to support them . Florence finally marries , to get her mother off her back , but the strain of her marriage and of her mother 's continued demands is too much for her ; rootless , isolated , she withdraws more and more into herself and finally loses her mind . The narrative is framed by visits from an American cousin of Florence 's ? George , an almost aggressively decent representative of the proper branch of the family back in New York , the Fairlies , whom scandal has never driven into exile . Miss Gallant 's view of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her characters makes perfect sense to himself , but they are selfish , carapaced , exploitative , foolish , and damned ; they can not or will not help one another . Yet they are not consciously wicked ; they hardly have the stamina for sin on any impressive scale ; their lives are empty because they are empty people : character is fate . Probably no reader will want to believe that the portraits she has drawn exhaust the possibilities of human nature , nor does she pretend that they do , but they have an authenticity all too hard to deny . The Haunting of Hill House , Shirley Jackson 's new novel ( Viking , $3.95 ) , is an undertaking of a rather uncommon sort these days ; it is a full-length ghost story . A scientist interested in psychic phenomena , a Dr. Montague , rents a large and isolated house that has long enjoyed the reputation for being haunted , and invites a couple of young women who have been previously mixed up in apparently genuine parapsychological experiences to stay in the house with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the owner of the house , and served by a hard-bitten farm woman who ostentatiously goes home at night . Once this motley group has been assembled the haunting proceeds to take place . It would not be fair to describe just what happens , even if it were possible , or to reveal the highly dramatic ending , but the action is brilliantly devised . Miss Jackson% writing is occasionally mannered . She is overfond of describing " little " things , especially tiny old women with cats . The complete absence of physical description of the main characters leads to misapprehensions about them , and the character of Mrs. Montague , who arrives at the end of the book , is so crudely conceived as to be a blemish . Yet for the most part the writing is extremely good , alive with wit and intelligence , and Miss Jackson has the power to make the strange events at Hill House exciting . I am puzzled by Miss Jackson 's attitude toward her story . At times she offers a rational explanation for what happens ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of swinging shut when nobody is looking , but that is because they are hung off-balance . Sometimes , too , apparently mysterious events are really the projections of minds made unsteady by a strange and perverse environment . But there remain certain goings-on that can be accepted only if one is willing to believe that haunted houses are really haunted . I find this a difficult task , even under the influence of Miss Jackson 's persuasive writing , but readers who do not suffer from such a handicap are almost certain to be entertained . NO HIDING PLACE I N Half Moon Haven ( Rinehart , S3 ) Martin Russ describes a domicile even Less inviting than Hill House , for the " haven " of the title is a home for the mentally retarded . Russ is the young man who a few years ago wrote a remarkable and much-admired book about his experiences in the Korean War , The Last Parallel . His new book is in almost every way a less ambitious undertaking , and in most ways a less successful one , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a young man trying to keep his balance in an unpredictable and often ugly world . The young man is called Delaney in Half Moon Haven , and the book itself is called a novel , but Delaney bears a striking resemblance to the young man who was Martin Russ in The Last Parallel. , and the book has much the same quality of autobiography . Delaney is only moderately employable , and after several jobs have turned sour on him , or the reverse , he undertakes to make a living as an attendant in a cottage for feebleminded boys at Half Moon Haven . The other attendants enforce discipline by knocking the boys around , and the boys expect it , but Delaney hopes and tries to do the job without physical violence . Half Moon Haven is not an expos ? or a reformer 's pamphlet . Conditions at the home are far from pleasant , but it is not easy to sec how they could he greatly improved , given such facts of life as the tendency of the human race to produce a certain number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large in the world and the generally undesirable nature of the work of taking care of them . What puzzles Delaney is how to reconcile such harsh facts with his own impulses to he decent . The result could be some dreary moralizing , but Delaney is too sardonic , too distrustful of the nobility of his own motives , too much aware of his own desire to get by with as little trouble as possible to get solemn about it all . His moral sense is too lively to permit him to moralize . The dust jacket carries a picture of Russ that is an interesting commentary on the book , almost an illustration . The face that looks out at you is handsome and trying for an expression a little tougher than belongs on it ; the mouth is sullenly pulled down to prevent a smile . It looks like the face of a basketball player a few years out of college who would be beat if he were n't afraid he would burst out laughing . Hag Moon Hauen has little to recommend it except the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOST AND FOUND Hidden America by Roland Wells Robbins and Evan Jones ( Knopf , $5 ) has a title that promises too much , but the book itself is a thoroughly pleasant and unpretentious introduction to practical archaeology in America . Robbins , whose experience forms the basis of the book ( Jones is a professional journalist who presumably did most of the actual writing ) , started out as a house painter and handyman . With only a very sketchy formal education , he first became interested in the past when he discovered that there were unanswered questions about Daniel Chester French 's statue of the Minute Man in Concord , near his home in Massachusetts , and his first piece of digging was undertaken in an attempt , ultimately successful , to find the exact location of Thoreau 's house on Walden Pond . From these beginnings Robbins has gone on to work at many sites ? the Saugus Iron Works , now handsomely reconstructed ; the Philipse Manor , home of a rich Dutch settler in early New York ; Jefferson 's birthplace , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians and of alleged forerunners of Columbus from Europe . ( He can not take very seriously any of the latter that he has examined . ) Robbins ' enthusiasm for his work is contagious , and he makes it clear that the opportunities for archaeological research in America are far richer than I had supposed . A chapter devoted to telling the amateur how to go about digging for himself should prevent a good deal of innocent vandalism that sometimes passes for archaeology . Oddly enough , according to Robbins , America has some claim to having produced the first scientific archaeologist in the person of Thomas Jefferson . That remarkable man in- yestigated an Indian mound on his estate entirely for love of knowledge ( earlier diggers there had been . but they were looking for loot ) , and his technique of removing the soil and examining remains still apparently commands respect . Hidden America is amply illustrated . Though it is not a boy 's book , many a boy would find it exciting reacting . The Lost Cities of Africa by Basil Davidson ( Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of archaeological research , as well as travelers ' tales and many other sources of knowledge , to sketch the history of Africa south of the Sahara in ancient and medieval times . Probably for most Americans , reading The Lost Cities of Africa will be a little like reading a history of ancient and medieval Europe without being quite sure who Charlemagne was , whether Rome was north or south of the Alps or whether Pope was a family name , a given name , a title , or an office . But Davidson is a clear writer on the whole ; he tackles his subject by regions ? the ancient kingdom of Kush , south ? of Egypt ; the city-states of West Africa ( one of them , Ghana , is now beginning its modern history ) ; the medieval trading centers of the east coast , etc . Certain large themes emerge ? the effect of the desiccation of the Sahara in limiting intercourse in some directions ; the generally widespread cultural diffusion ; the penetration of Islam ; the relative gentleness of African societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries of slavery not only on the Africans who were taken away from Africa but also on those who stayed behind . In general Davidson 's theme is that Africa has a long and distinguished past , which , if it did not produce a high civilization by European standards , did produce a group of cultures that were far from primitive and that were distinctly African . He particularly derides those who find some outside influence , often vaguely specified , to account for any African accomplishment . Davidson does not pretend to be more than a conscientious popularizer , but he has obviously read and traveled and corresponded widely . There are inevitably many gaps in his story . Some will never he filled , but others only require more digging at the sites . African archaeology south of the Sahara has not attracted the financial support that it has in Egypt , because there is not the same promise of treasure to sell to museums , but archaeological knowledge is nonetheless expanding . I N The New Shape of American Religion ( Harper , $3.50 ) Martin E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well aware , the first ? of the recent religious revival in America , which he believes readied its peak iu 1957 . By comparing it with earlier revivals and examining the utterances of some of its spokesmen , he comes to the conclusion that it was a revival of " religion-in-general , " of religious sentiment or vague piety , stiffened by very little doctrinal or theological backbone , and therefore a further erosion of American Protestantism . But Marty goes beyond criticism of the religious revival ; his book is a chapter in the great debate between unity and particularity in American society . Obviously social institutions will work only if there is enough agreement among their members toenable them to get along together , hut , just as obviously , agreement for the sake of agreement can destroy the very purposes for which the institutions exist . The problem is especially acute for churches , since they are both social institutions , fighting for survival and growth like any other , and at the same time the carriers of a message that reaches beyond society . Marty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that the Protestant churches are now sacrificing too much to make themselves socially acceptable , that they need a stiffening of doctrine , and he makes some suggestions for the reforms of parish life to improve the situation . Probably there has never been a time when the Christian churches were not accused by their critics of being too much like the secular society around them , and probably there has never been a time when the critics were wrong . Yet to say that Marty 's argument is neither altogether new nor always happily phrased is not to deny its cogency.
