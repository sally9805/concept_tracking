txt Agriculture Secretary Benson proclaimed a 1919 wheat allotment of 55 million acres , the legal minimum , and scheduled a referendum on marketing quotas for June 20 . If two thirds of eligible farmers in commercial wheat states vote for marketing quotas they will get price supports at a level to be established later this year . Those who exceed their acreage allotments would lose price supports and have to pay penalties on wheat grown on excess acreage . If farmers reject quotas they would have a choice between complying with allotments or ignoring them . Those who complied would get supports at 50% of parity , those who overplanted would get no supports , but not have to pay any fine . Parity is a formula that relates prices of things farmers buy to those at which they sell their crops Allotments haile been set at 55 million acres and quotas have been in effect for the past four marketing seasons Mr Benson will announce the- 1959 price support for wheat before the June 20 referendum . The support level , which can range between 75% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been set at 75% of parity , or an average of $1.78 a bushel , for the 1938 crop . The proposed 55 million acre allotment would not be affected by legislation passed by Congress last week and sent on to the President . The measure , which Mr. Eisenbower is expected to veto , would freeze acre ? age allotments in 1959 at the present level . While such a freeze might prevent a sharp drop to cotton and rice acreage , it would not affect wheat in view of the Secretary 's proclamation . The legislation also would freeze price supports in 1958 at last year 's level . This , of course , would have no effect on whatever 1959 wheat crop the Secretary proclaims , but it would push the 1958 support back to last year 's level-79.7 of parity , or $2 a bushel.
