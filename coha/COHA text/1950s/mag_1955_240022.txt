NECTAR IN A SIEVE ( 248 pp. ) - Kamala Markandaya-John Day ( $3.50 ) . <P> When Rukmani was twelve and ready for marriage , she was obviously no bargain . She was not much to look at , and her father had gone broke providing dowries for her older sisters . The best the old man could find for her was a tenant farmer named Nathan who came from a poor village a day 's travel away by bullock cart . When the child bride reached her new home , she saw a thatched mud hut . Holding back her tears , she lied bravely : " No , I am not frightened . It suits me quite well to live here . " Often , in the years to come , it was to be not so much living as a living death . <P> Rukmani is the heroine of Nectar in a Sieve , a first novel by a young Indian woman who lives and writes in London under the pseudonym Kamala Markandaya . Hers is a simple , unaffected story of human suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and economics to explain the people of India . <P> Taken at its simplest , Nectar is about hunger . Nathan was a good man , but all his hard work meant nothing if his small rice crop failed . When it did , his growing family starved . They sold their clothes , looked for scraps in the streets , ate grass like cattle when there was nothing else . For a time , to save her parents and brothers from death by starvation . Rukmani 's gentle daughter became a prostitute , with the result that soon there was another mouth to feed . The family survived the famine , but a local tannery bought their land , and the now middle-aged couple went to a distant city to look for a son who might support them . They never found him . wound up sleeping on a temple floor , begging for handouts , working in a stoneyard for a few pennies . Nathan dies , but Rukmani makes it back to her village , her spirit still so strong that she dares to adopt a crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her own children . <P> In other hands , Nectar could easily have become an embittered , even sordid book . It is , instead , free from bitterness and its ignorant villagers are at least as dignified as they are pathetic . Author Markandaya proves the old truth that in fiction sympathy is more effective than anger . Few readers will be able to forget that most of India is still a land of Rukmanis , Nathans and their children .
