The Telephone Pole That Became a Memorial The cottage on Lincoln Street in Portland , Oregon , is shaded by graceful trees and covered with ivy . Many years ago , A. H. Feldman and his wife remodeled the house to fit their dreams anti set out slips of ivy around it . And when their son , Danny , came along , he , too , liked to watch things grow . One day , when he was only nine , he took a handful of ivy slips and planted them at the base of the telephone pole in front of the house . Time passed ... and the ivy grew , climbing to the top of the pole . Like the ivy , Danny grew too . He finished high school , went to college . The war came along before he finished  --  and Danny went overseas . And there he gave his life for his country . Not very long ago the overhead telephone lines were being removed from the poles on Lincoln Street . The ivy-covered telephone pole in front of the Feldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done . But , when the telephone crew arrived , Mrs. Feldman came out to meet them . " Could n't it he left standing ? " she asked . And then she told them about her son . So the pole , although no longer needed , was n't touched at all . At the request of the telephone company , the Portland City Council passed a special ordinance permitting the company to-leave it standing . And there it is today , mantled in ivy , a living memorial to Sergeant Danny Feldman . DELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM if you think I could act it . . . " He shook his head . " No Ledas for me , no Daphnes , no Europas . In those days , remember , I was still the unmitigated product of a deplorable upbringing . A Lutheran minister 's son and , after the age of twelve , a widowed mother 's only consolation . And of course the only consolation had no choice but to become the model son , the star pupil , the indefatigable scholarship winner , sweating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything so extracurricular as girls . " " But did the girls allow you to ignore them ? " Rivers was silent , then answered with another question . " Did your mother ever tell you that the most wonderful wedding present a man could bring his bride was his virginity ? " " Fortunately not . " " Well , mine did . And she did it , what 's more , on her knees , in the course of an extemporary prayer . At twenty-eight , believe it or not , I still had that wedding present for my hypothetical bride . " There was a silence . " My poor John , " I said at last . He shook his head . " Actually it was my poor mother . She had it all worked out so perfectly . An instructorship in my old university , then an assistant professorship , then a professorship . There would never be any need for me to leave home . And when I was around forty , she 'd arrange a marriage for me with some wonderful Lutheran girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the grace of God , there went John Rivers  --  down the drain . But the grace of God was forthcoming  --  with a vengeance , as it turned out . One fine morning , a few weeks after I had my PhD , I had a letter from Henry Maartens . He was at St. Louis then , working on atoms . Needed another research assistant , had heard good reports of me from my professor , could n't offer more than a scandalously small salary  --  but would I he interested ? For a budding physicist it was the opportunity of a lifetime . For my poor mother it was the end of everything . Earnestly , agonizingly , she prayed over it . To her eternal credit , God told her to let me go . T EN DAYS later a taxi deposited me on the Maartenses ' doorstep . I remember standing there in a cold sweat , trying to screw up my courage to ring the bell . Like a delinquent schoolboy who has an appointment with the Headmaster . The first elation over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few days at home , and during all the endless hours of the journey , I had been thinking only of my own inadequacy . How longwould it take a man like Henry Maartens to see through a man like me ? A week ? A day ? More likely an hour ! He 'd despise me ; I 'd be the laughingstock of the laboratory . And things would be just as bad outside the laboratory . Indeed , they might even be worse . The Maartenses had asked me to be their guest until I could find a place of my own . How extraordinarily kind ! But also how fiendishly cruel ! In the austerely cultured atmosphere of their home I should reveal myself for what I was  --  shy , stupid , hopelessly provincial . But meanwhile , the Headmaster was waiting . " I gritted my teeth and pushed the button . The door was opened by one of those ancient colored retainers in an old-fashioned play . You know , the kind that was born before Abolition and has been with Miss Belinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was a sympathetic part and , though she dearly loved to ham it up , Beulah was not merely a treasure ; she was , as I soon discovered , well along the road to sainthood I explained who I was and , as I talked , she looked inc over . I must have seemed satisfactory ; for there and then she adopted rue as a long lost member of the family , a kind of Prodigal Son just back from the husks . " ' I 'll go make you a sandwich and a nice cup of coffee , ' she insisted , and adding , ' They 're all in here , ' she opened a door and pushed me through it . I braced myself for the Headmaster and a barrage of culture . But what I actually walked into was something which , if I had seen it fifteen years later , I might have mistaken for a parody , in the minor key , of the Marx Brothers . I was in a large , extremely untidy living room . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently dying  --  for his face was livid , his breath came and went with a kind of wheezing rattle . Close beside him in a rocking chair  --  her left hand on his forehead and a copy of William James 's Pluralistic Universe in her right  --  the most beautiful woman I had ever seen was quietly reading . On the floor were two children  --  a small red-headed boy playing with a clockwork train and a girl of fourteen with long black legs , lying on her stomach and writing poetry ( I could see the shape of the stanzas ) with a red pencil . All were so deeply absorbed in what they were engaged upon  --  playing or composing , reading or dying  --  that for at least half a minute my presence in the room remained completely unnoticed . I coughed , got no reaction , coughed again . The small boy raised his head , smiled at me politely but without interest , and returned to his train . " I waited another ten seconds ; then , in desperation , advanced into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped over her . ' Pardon me , ' I murmured . She paid no attention ; but the reader of William James heard and looked up . Over the top of the Pluralistic Universe her eyes were brilliantly blue . ' Are you the man about the gas furnace ? ' she asked , Her face was so radiantly lovely that for a moment I could n't say a word . I could only shake my head . ' Silly ! ' said the small boy . ' The gas man has a mustache . ' ' I 'm Rivers ' I finally managed to mumble . ' Rivers ? ' she repeated blankly . ' Rivers ? Oh , Rivers ' Them was a sudden dawn of recognition . ' I 'm so glad . . ' But before she could finish the sentence , the man with the death rattle opened a pair of ghastly eyes , made a noise like an indrawn war whoop , and , jumping up , rushed toward the open window . ' Look out ! ' the small boy shouted . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Christ ! ' he added in a tone of contained despair . A whole Grand Central Station lay in ruins , reduced to its component blocks . ' Christ ! ' the child repeated ; and when the poetess told him he must n't say Christ , say something really bad , ' he menaced . ' I 'll say . . . " His lips Moved in silent blasphemy . " From the window , meanwhile , came the dreadful sound of a man being slowly hanged . " ' Excuse me , ' said the beautiful woman . She rose , put down her book , and hurried to the rescue . There was a metallic clatter . The hem of her skirt overturned a signal . The small boy uttered a shriek of rage . ' You fool , ' he yelled . ' You ... you elephant . ' " ' Elephants , ' said the poetess didactically , ' always look where they 're going . ' Then she screwed her head round and , for the first time , acknowledged my existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to me in a tone of wearily contemptuous superiority . ' That 's how things are around here . ' " Over by the window the gradual hanging was still in progress . Doubled up , as though someone had hit him below the belt , the white-haired man was fighting for air  --  fighting what looked and sounded like a losing battle . Beside him stood the goddess , patting his back and murmuring words of encouragement . I was appalled . This was the most terrible thing I had ever seen . A hand plucked at the cuff of my trousers . turned and found the poetess looking up at me . She had a narrow , intense little face with gray eyes , set wide apart and a size too large . ' Gloom , ' she said . ' I need three words to rhyme with gloom . I 've got room  --  that Ls all right . And I 've got womb  --  which is simply gorgeous . But what about a catacomb ... ? ' " She shook her head ; then , frowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something gloom Of my soul 's deep and dreary catacomb . I do n't like it , do you ? ' I had to admit that I did n't . ' And yet it 's exactly what I want to say , ' she went on . I had a brain wave . ' What about tomb ? ' Her face it up with pleasure and excitement . But of course , of course ! What a fool she had been ! The red pencil started to scribble at a furious rate . ' The something gloom . ' she declaimed triumphantly , ' Of my soul 's irremediable tomb . ' I must have looked dubious , for she hastily asked inc if I thought irrevocable tomb would be better . Before I could answer there was another , louder sound of strangling . I. glanced toward the window , then back at the poetess . ' Is n't there anything we can do ? ' I whispered . The girl shook her head . ' I looked it up in the Encyclopaedia Britannica , ' she answered . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' And then , seeing that I was still disturbed , she shrugged her bony little shoulders and said , ' You kind of get used to it . ' " Rivers laughed to himself as he savored the memory . " ' You kind of get used to it , ' " he repeated . Then got up and started to mend the fire . ELL , THAT was my first introduc- tion to the Maartens family , " he said as he laid another oak log on the pile of glowing embers . " I kind of got used to everything pretty quickly . Even to the asthma . It 's remarkable how easy it is to get used to other people 's asthma . After two or three experiences I was taking Henry 's attacks as calmly as the rest of them . One moment he 'd be strangling ; the next he was as good as new and talking nineteen to the dozen about quantum mechanics . And he continued to repeat the performance till he was eighty-seven . Whereas 1 shall be lucky , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if I go to sixty-seven . I was an athlete , you see . One of those strong-as-a-horse boys . And never a day 's illness  --  until , bang , comes a coronary , or whoosh , go the kidneys ! Meanwhile the broken reeds , like poor old Henry , go on complaining of ill health until they 're a hundred . And not merely complaining  --  actually suffering . Asthma , dermatitis , every variety of bellyache , inconceivable fatigues , indescribable depressions . " Well , as I say , " be resumed in another tone . " I kind of got used to Henry 's asthma , I kind of got used to all of them , to everything . So much GENIUS AND so , indeed , that when , after a month of house hunting , I finally located a cheap and not too nasty apartment , they would n't let me go . ' Here you are , ' said Katy , ' and here you stay . ' OM Beulah hacked her up . So did Timmy and , though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from everything anyone else approved of , so  --  rather grudgingly  --  did Ruth . Even the great man emerged for a moment from Cloud Cuckoo Land to cast a vote in favor of my staying on . That clinched it . I became a fixture ; I became an honorary Maartens . It made me so happy , " Rivers went on after a pause , " that I kept thinking uneasily that there must surely be something wrong . And pretty soon I saw what it was . Happiness with the Maartenses entailed disloyalty to home . It was an admission that , all the time I lived with my mother , I had never experienced anything but constraint and a chronic sense of guilt . And now , as a member of this family of pagan strangers , I felt not merely happy , but also good , also , in an entirely unprecedented way , religious . For the first time I knew what all those words in the Epistles really meant . Grace , for example  --  I was chock full of grace . The newness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whereas most of what I had known with my mother was the deadening oldness of the letter . And what about First Corinthians , thirteen ? What about faith , hope , and charity ? Well , do n't want to boast , but I had them . Faith first of all . A redeeming faith in the universe and in my fellow man . As for the other brand of faith ? that simple , Lutheran variety which my poor mother was so proud of having preserved intact , Iike a virginity , through all the temptationA of my scientific education .. . " He shrugged his shoulders . " Nothing can be simpler than zero ; and that , 1 suddenly discovered , was the simple faith I had been living by for the past ten years . At St. Louis I had the genuine article  --  real faith in a real good , and at the same time a hope amounting to the positive conviction that everything would always be wonderful . And along with faith and hope went an overflowing charity . How could you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hardly knew who you were and so self-centered that he did n't even want to know ? You could n't he fond of him  --  and yet I was , I was . I liked him not merely for the obvious reasons  --  because he was a great man , because working with him was like having your own intelligence and insight raised to a higher power . I even liked him outside the laboratory , for the very qualities that made it all but impossible to regard him as anything but a kind of high-class monster . " I had so much charity in those days that I could have loved a crocodile ; I could have loved an . octopus . One reads all these fictions of the sociologists , all this learned foolery by the political scientists . " With a gesture of contemptuous exasperation Rivers slapped the backs of a row of corpulent volumes on the seventh shelf . " But actually there 's only one solution , and that 's expressible in a four-letter word , so shocking that even the Marquis de Sade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " L-o-v-e . Or if you prefer the decent obscurity of the learned languages , Agape , Caritas , Mahakaruna . In those days I really knew what it meant . For the first time  --  yes , for the first time . That was the only disquieting feature in an otherwise blissful situation . For if this was the first time I knew what loving was , what about all the other times when I had thought I knew , what about those sixteen years of being my mother 's only consolation ? " I N THE ensuing pause I summoned up the memory of the Mrs. Rivers who had sometimes wine , with her little Johnny , to spend a Sunday afternoon with us on the farm , nearly fifty years ago , It was a memory of black alpaca , of a pale profile like the face on Aunt Esther 's cameo brooch , of a smile whose deliberate sweetness did n't seem to match the cool appraising eyes . The picture was associated with a chilling sense of apprehension . " Give Mrs. Rivers a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluct-ance ! " Is there such a word as ' debellishment ' ? " Rivers suddenly asked . I shook my head . " Well , there ought to be , " he insisted . " For that 's what I resorted to in my letters home . I recorded the facts ; but I systematically debellished them . I turned a revelation into something drab and ordinary and moralistic . Why was I staying on at the Maartenses ? Out of a sense of duty . Because Dr. M. could n't drive a car and I was able to help with the fetching and carrying . Because the children had had the misfortune to strike a pair of inadequate teachers and needed all the coaching I could give them . Because Mrs. M. had been so very kind that I felt I simply had to stay and relieve her of a few of her burdens . Naturally I should have preferred my privacy ; but would it have been right to put my personal inclinations before their needs ? And since the question was addressed to my mother , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What hypocrisy , what a pack of lies ! But the truth would have been much too painful for her to hear or for me to put into words . For the truth was that I had never been happy , never loved , never felt capable of spontaneous unselfishness until the day I left home and came to live with these Amalekites . " Rivers sighed and shook his head . " My poor mother , " he said . " Whenever I could forget her  --  which was every day except Sundays , when I wrote her my weekly letter  --  I was supremely happy . Yes , supremely happy ! For me , in those clays , life was an eclogue interspersed with lyrics . Everything was poetry . Driving Henry to the laboratory in my second-hand Maxwell ; mowing the lawn ; carrying Katy 's groceries home in the rain  --  pure poetry . So was taking Timmy to the station to look at engines . So was taking Ruth for walks in springtime to look for caterpillars . She took a professional interest in caterpillars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was part of the Gloom-Tomb syndrome . Caterpillars were the nearest approach , in real life , to Edgar Allan Poe . " " To Edgar Allan Poe ? " " ' For the play is the tragedy , Man , ' " he declaimed , " ' and its hero , the Conqueror Worm . ' In May and June the landscape was fairly crawling with Conqueror Worms . " Rivers drank some whisky and water , put down the glass and for a little while sucked at his pipe in silence . T HERE was one particularly educative weekend , " he said at last , smiling to himself at the memory . " It was during my first spring with the Maartenses . We were staying at their little farmhouse in the country , ten miles west of St. Louis . After supper , on the Saturday night , Ruth and .1 went out to look at the stars . There was a little hill behind the house . You climbed it , and there was the whole sky from horizon to horizon . A hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good place for just sitting and saying nothing . But in Chose clays I still felt I had a duty to improve people 's minds . " So instead of leaving her in peace to look at Jupiter and the Milky Way , I trotted out the stale old facts and figures  --  the distance in kilometers to the nearest fixed star , the diameter of the galaxy , the latest word from Mount Wilson on the spiral nebulae . " Ruth listened , but her mind was n't improved . Instead , she went into a kind of metaphysical panic . Such spaces , such durations , so many worlds beyond improbable worlds ! And here we were , in the face of infinity and eternity , bothering our heads about science and housekeeping and being on time , about the color of hair ribbons and the weekly grades in algebra and Latin grammar ! Then , in the little wood beyond the hill , an owl began calling , and at once the metaphysical panic turned into something physical  --  physical but at the same time occult ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the superstition that owls are wizard birds , bringers of bad luck , harbingers of death . She knew , of course , that it was all nonsense ; but how transporting it was to think and act as though it were true ! " We started to walk down the hill in the direction of the wood . ' It would absolutely kill me if I was alone , ' she said . And then , a moment later , ' Did you ever read The Fail of the House of Usher ? ' It was evident that she wanted to tell me the story ; so I said , No , I had n't read it . She began . ' It 's about a brother and sister called Usher , and they lived in a kind of castle with a black and livid tarn in front of it , and there are funguses on the walls , and the brother is called Roderick and he has such a fervid imagination that he can make up poetry without stopping to think , and he 's dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , just like his twin sister , who's. called Lady Madeline , and they 're both very ill with a mysterious nervous complaint and she 's liable to go into cataleptic fits . . . ' And so the narrative proceeded  --  as we walked down the grassy slope under the stars . And now we were on the road and moving toward the dark wall of woodland . Meanwhile poor Lady Madeline had died and young Mr. Usher was roaming about among the fungi in a. state of incipient lunacy . And no wonder ! Tot said I not that my senses were acute ? ' Ruth declaimed in a thrilling whisper . ' I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin . I heard them many , many clays ago . ' Around us the darkness had deepened and suddenly the trees closed over us and we were engulfed in the double night of the wood . Overhead , in the roof of foliage , there was an occasional jagged gleam of a paler , bluer darkness and on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dim gray crape and blackened silver . And what a moldy smell of decay ! What a damp chill against the cheek ! It was as though Poe 's fancy had turned into sepulchral fact . We had stepped , so it seemed , into the Ushers ' family vault . ' And then suddenly , ' Ruth was saying , ' there it was at the door  --  the lofty and enshrouded figure of the Lady Madeline of Usher . And she gave the most frightened shriek and fell on top of him , and he shrieked too and . . - " But at this moment there was a loud corn-motion in the invisible undergrowth . Black in the blackness , something enormous emerged on to the road just in front of us . Ruth 's scream was as loud as Madeline 's and Roderick 's combined . She clutched my arm , she hid her face against the sleeve . The apparition snorted . Ruth screamed again . There was another snort , then the clatter of retreating hoofs . ' It 's only a stray horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and , if I had n't ' Caught her and lowered her gently to the ground , she would have fallen . There was a long silence . ' When you 've had enough of sitting in the dust , ' I said ironically , ' maybe we can go on . ' " It was after her bedtime when we got home and Ruth went straight to her room , I was afraid she 'd have nightmares . Not at all . She slept like a top and came down to breakfast next morning as gay as a lark . But a lark that had read her Poe , a lark that was still interested in worms . After breakfast we went out caterpillar hunting and found something really stupendous -- -a big hawk-moth larva , with green and white markings and a horn on its rear end . Ruth poked it with a straw and the poor thing curled itself first one way , then the other , in a paroxysm of impotent rage and fear . ' it writhes , it writhes , ' she chanted exultantly ; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angels sob at vermin fangs with human blood imbued . ' ' Vermin fangs , ' she repeated , and gave the green worm another poke , ' Vermin fangs . . . ' And in an overflow of high spirits she began to sing ' If you were the only girl in thc world ' at the top of her voice . ' If you were the only girl in the world , and I were the vermin fangs . ' Then she broke off , made a dive for Grampus , the cocker spaniel , who eluded her and rushed off , full tilt across the pasture , with Ruth in hot pursuit . " ' Bliss was in it that dawn to be alive . ' And the bliss was perfectly compatible with tombs and glooms and Conqueror Worms . What the child wrote was doggerel ; but what she felt and did was often a lyric . But then , so far as I was concerned , everything in those days was lyrical . Life was pure poetry then  --  every moment of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those were some of the best moments , " he answered me . " Moments of paper work , moments of fiddling around with experimental gadgets , moments of discussion and argument . The whole thing was pure idyllic poetry , like something out of Theocritus or Vergil . Four young PhDs in the role of goatherd 's apprentices , with Henry as the patriarch , teaching the youngsters the tricks of his trade , dropping pearls of wisdom , spinning interminable yarns about the new pantheon of theoretical physics . It was idyllic . Those were the days , remember , when you could be a physicist without feeling guilty ; the days when it was still possible to believe that you were working for the greater glory of God . Now they wo n't even allow you the comfort of self-deception . You 're paid by the Navy and trailed by the FBI . Not for one moment do they permit you to forget what you 're up to . Ad majorem Del gloriam ? Do n't he an idiot ! Ad majorem horn inis degradationem  --  that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines were safely in the future . " In 1921 we were just a bunch of Theocritean innocents , enjoying the nicest kind of clean scientific fun . And when the fun in the laboratory was over , I 'd drive Henry home in the Maxwell and there 'd be fun of another kind . Sometimes it was young Timmy , having difficulties with the Rule of Three . Sometimes it was Ruth who simply could n't see why the square on the hypotenuse must always be equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides . In this case , yes ; she was ready to admit it . But why every time ? They would appeal to their father . But Henry had lived so long in the world of Higher Mathematics that he had forgotten how to do sums ; and he was interested in Euclid only because Euclid 's was the classical example of reasoning based upon a vicious circle . After a few minutes of utterly confounding talk , the great man would get bored and quietly fade away , leaving me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than vector analysis , to set Ruth 's doubts at rest by arguments a little less subversive of all faith in rationality than Hilbert 's or Poineares . " And then at supper there would he the noisy fun of the children telling their mother about the day 's events at school ; the sacrilegious fun of Katy suddenly breaking into a soliloquy on general relativity theory with an accusing question about those flannel pants which Henry was supposed to have picked up at the cleaners ; the Old Plantation fun of Beulah 's comments on the conversation , or the epic fun of one of her sustained , blow-by-blow accounts of how they used to butcher hogs back on the farm . And later , when the children had gone to bed and Henry had shut himself up in his study , there was the fun of funs  --  there were my evenings with Katy . " Rivers leaned hack in his chair and closed his eyes . I AM NOT much good at visualizing , " he said after a little silence . " But the wallpaper , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the lampshade was certainly red . It must have been red , because there was always that rich flush on her face , as she sat there darning our socks or sewing on the children 's buttons . A flush on thc face , but never on the hands . The hands moved in the brightness of the unscreened light . What strong hands ! " he added , smiling to himself . " What efficient hands ! None of your spiritual , Blessed-Damozelish appendages ! And the rest of . her matched the hands . Her body  --  it was the body of a strong young matron . A matron with the face of a healthy peasant girl . No , that 's not quite right . It was the face of a goddess disguised as a healthy peasant girl . Demeter , perhaps . No . Demeter was too sad . And it was n't Aphrodite either ; there was nothing fatal or obsessive about Katy 's femininity , nothing self-consciously sexy . If there was a goddess involved , it must have been Hera . Hera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mind , a milkmaid who had gone to college . " Rivers opened his eyes and replaced the pipe between his teeth . He was still smiling . " I remember some of the things she said about the books I used to read aloud in the evenings . H. G. Wells , for example . He reminded her of the rice paddies in her native California . Acres and acres of shiny water , but never more than two inches deep . And those ladies and gentlemen in . Henry James 's novels  --  could they ever bring themselves , she wondered , to go to the bathroom ? And D. H. Lawrence . How she loved those early books of his ! All scientists ought to be compelled to take a post-graduate course in Lawrence . She said that to the Chancellor when he came to dinner . He was a most distinguished chemist ; and whether it was post hoc or pro pter hoc , I do n't know ; but his wife looked as if all her secretions were pure acetic acid . Katy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled . " And sometimes , " he went on , " we did n't read ; we just talked . Katy told me about her childhood in San Francisco . About the balls and parties after she came out . About the three young men who were in love with her  --  each one richer and , if possible , stupider than the last . At nineteen she got engaged to the richest and the dumbest . The trousseau was bought , the wedding presents had begun to arrive . " And then Henry Maartens came out to Berkeley as a visiting professor . She heard him lecture on the philosophy of science , and after the lecture she went to an evening party given in his honor . They were introduced . He had a nose like an eagle 's , he had pale eyes like a Siamese cat 's , he looked like the portraits of Pascal , and when he laughed , the noise was like a ton of coke going down a chute . As for what he saw  --  it must have passed description . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At nineteen she must have been Hebe and the three Graces and all the nymphs of Diana rolled into one . And Henry , remember , had just been divorced by his first wife . Poor woman ! She simply was n't strong enough to play the parts assigned to her  --  mistress to an indefatigable lover , business manager to an absentee half-wit , secretary to a man of genius , and womb , placenta , and circulatory system to the psychological equivalent of a fetus , After two miscarriages and a nervous breakdown , she had packed up and gone home to her mother . Henry was on the loose , all four of him  --  fetus , genius , half-wit , and hungry lover  --  in search of some woman capable of meeting the demands of a symbiotic relationship , in which all the giving would be on her side , all the ravenous and infantile taking on his , The search had been going on for the best part of a year . Henry was growing desperate . And now , suddenly , providentially , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took her into a corner and , ignoring everyone else in the room , started to talk to her . Needless to say , it never occurred to him that she might have her own interests and problems ; it never entered his head that it might perhaps be a good thing to draw the girl out . He just let fly at her with what happened , for the moment , to be on his mind . On this occasion , it was recent developments in logic . Katy , of course , did n't understand a word of it ; but he was so manifestly a genius , it was all so unspeakably wonderful , that there and then , before the evening was over , she made her mother ask him to dinner . He came , he finished oil what he had to say and , while Mrs. Hanbury and her other guests played bridge , he plunged with Katy into semiotics . Three days later there was some sort of a picnic organized by the Audubon Society , and the two of them managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arroyo . And finally there was the evening when they went to hear La Traviata . Rum-turn-turntwa-te-tum . " Rivers hummed the theme of the prelude to the third act . " It was irresistible  --  it always is . On the way home in the cab he kissed her  --  kissed her with an intensity of passion and at the same time a tact , an adeptness , for which the semiotics and the absent-mindedness had left her entirely unprepared . After that it became only too evident that her engagement to poor dear Randolph had been a mistake . " But what a hue and cry when she announced her intention of becoming Mrs. Henry Maartens ! A half-mad professor , with nothing but his salary , divorced by his first wife and old enough , into the bargain , to be her father ! But all they could say was entirely irrelevant . The only thing that mattered was the fact that Henry belonged to another species ; and that , not Randolph 's  --  Homo sapiens and not Homo tnoronicus  --  was the species she now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got married . Had she ever regretted her millionaire ? Regretted Randolph ? To this inconceivably ridiculous question the answer was a peal of laughter . But his horses , she added as she wiped the tears from her eyes , his horses were another matter . His horses were Arabians , and the cattle on his ranch were pure-bred Herefords , and he had a big pond near the ranch house , with all kinds of the most heavenly ducks and geese . The worst of being a poor professor 's wife in a big town was that you never had a chance of getting away from people . Sure , there were plenty of good people , intelligent people . But the soul can not live by people alone ; it needs horses , it needs pigs and waterfowl . Randolph could have provided her with all the animals her heart could desire  --  but at a price : himself . She had sacrificed the animals and chosen genius  --  genius with all its drawbacks . A ND FRAN EL Y ( she admitted it with a laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were drawbacks . In his own way , albeit for entirely different reasons , Henry could be almost as dumb as Randolph himself . An idiot where human relations were concerned , a prize ass in all the practical affairs of life . But what an unboring ass , what a luminous idiot ! Henry could be utterly insupportable ; but he was always worth it . Always ! And maybe , she paid me the compliment of adding , maybe when I got married , my wife would feel the saute way about me . Insupportable , but worth it . " " I thought you said she was n't consciously sexy , " I commented . " And it 's true , " he said . " You think she was baiting her hook with flattery . She was n't . She was just stating a fact . I had my points ; but I was also unbeatable . Twenty years of formal education and a lifetime of my poor mother had produced a real monster . " On the outspread fingers of his left hand he itemized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumpkin ; I was an athlete who could n't say Bo to a girl ; I was a Pharisee with a sense of inferiority ; I was a prig who secretly envied the people he disapproved of . And yet , in spite of everything , it was worth while to put up with me . I was enormously well meaning . " " And in this case , I imagine , you did more than mean well . Were you in love with her ? There was a little pause ; then Rivers slowly nodded . " Overwhelmingly , " he said . " But you could n't say Bo to a girl , " I said . " This was n't a girl , " he answered . " This was Henry 's wife . Bo was unthinkable . Besides , I was an honorary Maartens , and that made her my honorary mother . And it was n't just a question of morality . I never wanted to say Bo . I loved her metaphysically , almost theologically ? the way Dante loved Beatrice , the way Petrarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my case it happened to be sincere . I actually lived my idealism . No little illegitimate Petrarchs on the side . No Mrs. Alighieri , and none of those whores that Dante found it necessary to resort to . It was passion , but it was also chastity ; and both at white heat . Passion and chastity , " he repeated , and shook his head . " At sixty one forgets what the words stand for . To-clay I only know the meaning of the word that has replaced them  --  indifference . to . son Beatrice , " he declaimed . " And all is dross that is not Helena . So what ? Old age has something else to think about . " Rivers was silent ; and suddenly , as though to elucidate what he had been saying , there was only the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece , and the whispers of flames among the logs . " How can anyone seriously believe in his own identity ? " he went on . " In logic , A equals A. Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me-then is another . I look at the John Rivers who felt that way about Katy . It 's like a puppet play ; it 's like Romeo and Juliet through the wrong end of the opera glasses . No , it 's not even that ; it 's like looking through the wrong end of the opera glasses at the ghosts of Romeo and Juliet . And Romeo once called himself John Rivers , and was in love , and had at least ten times more life and energy than at ordinary times . And the world he was living in  --  how totally transfigured ! " I remember how he looked at landscapes ; and the colors were incomparably brighter , the patterns that things made in space unbelievably beautiful . I remember how he glanced around him in the streets , and St. Louis , believe it or not , was the most splendid city ever built . People , houses , trees , T-model Fords , dogs at lamp posts  --  everything was more significant . Significant , you may ask , of what ? And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols . Goethe was absolutely wrong . Alles vergiingliche is not a Gleichnis . At every instant every transience is eternally that transience . What it signifies is its own being , and that being ( as one sees so clearly when one 's in love ) is the same as Being with the biggest possible B. Why do you love the woman you 're in love with ? Because she is . And that , after all , is God 's own definition of Himself : I am that I am . The girl is who she is . Some of her isness spills over and impregnates the entire universe . Objects and events cease to the mere representatives of classes and become their own uniqueness ; cease to be illustrations of verbal abstractions and become fully concrete . Then you stop being in love , and the universe collapses , with an almost audible squeak of derision , into its normal insignificance . Could it ever stay transfigured ? Maybe it could . Maybe it 's just a question of being in love with Cod . But that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or rather it 's the only thing that 's either here , there , or anywhere ; but if we said so , we 'd he cut by all our respectable friends and might even end up in the asylum . So let 's get hack as quickly as possible to something a little less dangerous . Back to Katy , back to the late lamented . . " He broke off . " Did you hear something ? " T HIS TIME I distinctly did . It was the sound , muffled by distance and a heroic self-restraint , of a child 's sobbing . Rivers got up and , thrusting his pipe into his pocket , walked to the door and opened it . " Bimbo ? " he called questioningly . For all answer there was a louder sob . He moved out into the hall and a moment later there was the sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs . " Bimbo , " I heard him saying , " good old Bimbo ! Come to see if you could catch Santa Claus red-handed  --  was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got up and followed my host upstairs . Rivers was sitting on the top step , his arms , gigantic in their rough tweed , around a tiny figure in blue pajamas . " It 's Grandpa , " he kept repeating . " Funny old Grandpa . Bimbo 's all right with Grandpa . " The sobbing gradually died down . " What made Bimbo wake up ? " Rivers asked . " What made hint climb out of his crib ? " " Dog , " said the child , and at the memory of his dream he began to cry again . " Big dog . " " Dogs are funny , " Rivers assured him . " Dogs are so dumb they ca n't say anything but how-wow . Think of all the things Bimbo can say . Mummy . Weewee . Daddy . Pussycat . Dogs are n't smart . They ca n't say any of those things . just bowwow-wow . " He put on an imitation of a bloodhound . " Or else how-wow-wow . " This time it was a toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lugubriously and grotesquely . Uncertainly , between sobs , the child began to laugh . " That 's right , " said Rivers . " Bimbo just laughs at those dumb dogs . Every time he sees one , every time he hears that silly harking , he laughs and laughs and laughs . " This time the child laughed whole-heartedly . " And now , " said Rivers , " Grandpa and Bimbo are going to take a walk . " Still holding the child in his arms , he got up and made bis way along the corridor . " This is Grandpa 's room , " he said , opening the first door , " Nothing of great interest here , I 'm afraid . " The next door stood ajar ; he walked ha . " And this is Mummy 's and Daddy 's room . And here 's the closet with all Mummy 's clothes . Do n't they smell good ? " He sniffed loudly . The child followed suit . " Le Shocking de Scltiaparelli , " Rivers went on . " Or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for it 's sex , sex , sex that makes the world go round  --  as , I 'm sorry to say , you 'll find out , my poor Bimbo , in a very few years from now . " Tenderly he brushed his check against the pale Boss of the child 's hair , then walked over to the full-length mirror set in the door of the bathroom . " Look at us , " he called to me. " just look at us ! " I came and stood beside him . There we were in the glass  --  a pair of bent and sagging elders and , in the arms of one of them , a small , exquisite Christ child . " And to think , " said Rivers , " to think that once we were all like that . You start as a lump of protoplasm , a machine for eating and excreting . You grow into this sort of thing . Something almost supernaturally pure and beautiful . " He laid his cheek once more against the child 's head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After which you have a year or two , in your twenties , of being Praxiteles . But Praxiteles soon puts on weight and starts to lose his hair , and for the next forty years you degenerate into one or other of the varieties of the human gorilla . The spindly gorilla  --  that 's you . Or the leather-faced variety  --  that 's me . Or else it 's the successful businessman type of gorilla  --  you know , the kind that looks like a baby 's bottom with false teeth . " The child in his arms yawned at our reflections , then turned , pillowed his head on the man 's shoulder , and closed his eyes . " I think we can take him back to his crib , " Rivers whispered and started toward the door . " One feels , " he said slowly , as we stood looking down , a few minutes later , at that small face , which sleep had transfigured into the image of an unearthly serenity , " one feels so desperately sorry for them . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ambushes and betrayals , of booby traps and deceptions . " " And of fun , " I put in . " Fun to the pitch , sometimes , of ecstasy . " " Of course , " Rivers agreed , as he turned away from the crib . " That 's what baits the booby traps . " He switched off the light , softly closed the door , and followed me down the stairs . " Fun ? every kind of fun . Sex fun , eating fun , power fun , comfort fun , possession fun , cruelty fun , But there 's either a hook in the bait , or else GENIUS AND when you grab it , it pulls a trigger and down come the bricks or the bucket of bird lime or whatever it is that the cosmic joker has prepared for you . " We resumed our seats on either side of the fire in the library . " What sort of traps are waiting for that poor little , shining creature up there in the crib ? One can hardly bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ignorance before the event and , after it , forgetting , or at the very least indifference . Every balcony scene turns into an affair of midgets in another universe ! And in the end , of course , there 's always death . And while there is death , there is hope . " He refilled our glasses and relit his pipe . " Where was I ? " " In heaven , " I answered , " with Mrs. Ma artens . " N HEAVE N , " Rivers repeated . And then , I after a little pause , " It lasted . " he went on , " about fifteen.mdnths . From December to the second spring , with a break of ten weeks in the summer while the family was away in Maine . Ten weeks of what was supposed to be my vacation at home , but was actually , in spite of the familiar house , in spite of my poor mother , the most desolate kind of exile . What bliss it was , in September , to regain my paradise ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky still blue , the tight turning from gold to silver . Then Eden in winter , Eden with the lamps lighted and rain outside the windows , and the bare trees like hieroglyphs against the sunset . " And then , at the beginning of that second spring , there was a telegram from Chicago . Katy 's mother was ill . Nephritis  --  and those were the days before the sulfas , before penicillin . Katy packed her bags and was at the station in time to catch the next train . The two children  --  the three children , if you counted Henry  --  were left in charge of Beulah and myself . Timmy gave us no trouble at all . But the others , I assure you , the others more than made up for Timmy 's reasonableness . The poetess refused to eat her prunes at breakfast , could n't be bothered to brush her hair , neglected her homework . The Nobel Prize winner would n't get up in the morning , cut his lectures , was late for every appointment . And there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squandered a year 's accumulated savings on a make-up kit and a bottle of cheap perfume . The day after Katy left , she looked and smelt like the Whore of Babylon . " " For the benefit of the Conqueror Worm ? " " Worms were out , " he answered . " Poe was as old-fashioned as Over There ' or ' Alexander 's Ragtime Band . ' She 'd been reading Swinburne ; she 'd just made the discovery of the poems of Oscar Wilde . The universe was quite different now and she herself was somebody else  --  another poetess with a brand-new vocabulary . . .. Sweet sin ; desire ; jasper claws ; the ache of purple pulses : the raptures and roses of vice ; and lips , of course , lips intertwisted and bitten till the foam has a savor of blood  --  all that adolescent bad taste of Late Victorian rebellion . And in Ruth 's case , the new words had been accompanied by new facts . She was no longer a little boy in a skirt and with pigtails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she carried about delicately and gingerly as though they were a pair of extremely valuable but rather dangerous and embarrassing zoological specimens . They were a source , one could sense , of mingled pride and shame , of intense pleasure and , therefore , of a haunting sense of guilt . All of which made it absolutely necessary for the poor child to smear her mouth with lipstick and drench her combinations with synthetic violet . And worse was to follow . " " Synthetic ambergris ? " " Much worse  --  synthetic love . She persuaded herself that she was passionately , Swinburneishly in love  --  and , of all people , with me ! " " Could n't she have chosen someone a little nearer her own size ? " I asked . - She 'd tried , " Rivers answered , " but it had n't worked . I had the story from Beulah , to whom she had confided it . A , tragic little story of , a fifteen-year-old girl adoring a heroic young footballer and scholarship winner of seventeen . She had chosen someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period of life , two years are an almost impassable gulf . The young hero was interested only in girls of a maturity comparable to his own  --  eighteen-year-olds , seventeen-year-olds , at a pinch well-developed sixteenyear-olds . A skinny little fifteen-year-old like Ruth was out of the question . She found herself in the position of a low-born Victorian maiden hopelessly adoring a duke . For a long time the young hero did n't even notice het ; and when at last she forced herself on his attention , he began by being amused and ended by being rude . That was when she started to persuade herself that she was in love with me . " I T S TARTE D actually several weeks be-fore Katy left for Chicago . I had noticed a number of premonitory symptoms  --  blushings , silences , abrupt inexplicable exits in the middle of conversations , fits of jealous sulking if ever I seemed to prefer the mother 's company to the child 's . And then , of course , there were those love poems which she insisted , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Blisses and kisses ; lips and whips ; yearning and burning ; best , blest , pressed , breast . She 'd look at me intently while I read the things , and it was n't the merely anxious look of a literary novice awaiting the critic 's judgment ; it was the damp , large , lustrous regard of an adoring spaniel , of a Counter-Reformation Magdalen , of the willing murderee at the feet of her predestined Bluebeard . " It made me feel exceedingly uncomfortable , and I wondered sometimes if it would n't be a good thing , for everybody 's sake , to mention the matter to Katy . But then , I argued , if my suspicions were unfounded , I should look pretty fatuous ; and if I were right , I should be making trouble for poor little Ruth . Better say nothing and wait for the foolishness to blow over . Better to go on pretending that the poems were simply literary exercises which had nothing to do with real life or their author 's feelings . And so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the fifth column , until the day of her mother 's departure . Driving home from the station I wondered apprehensively what would happen now that Katy 's restraining presence had been removed . Next morning brought the answer  --  painted cheeks , a mouth like an overripe strawberry , and that perfume , that whore-house smell of her ! " " With behavior , I suppose , to match ? " " That was what I expected , of course . But oddly enough it did n't immediately materialize . Ruth did n't seem to feel the need of acting her new part ; it was enough merely to look it . Besides , I had committed the unpardonable offense of not taking her latest impersonation with proper seriousness . It was on the very first day of the new dispensation . I came downstairs to find Ruth and Beulah in the hall , hotly disputing . ' A nice young girl like you , ' the old woman was saying . ' You ought to be ashamed of yourself . ' The nice young girl tried to enlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother will mind my using make-up , do you ? ' Beulah left me no time to answer . TR tell you what your mother will do , ' she said emphatically and with remorseless realism . ' She 'll give you one look , then she will sit down on the davenport , turn you over her knee , pull down your drawers , and give you the biggest spanking you ever had in all your life . ' " Ruth gave her a look of cold and haughty contempt and said , ' I was n't talking to you . ' Then she turned back in my direction . ' What do you say , John ? ' The strawberry lips wreathed themselves into what was intended to be a richly voluptuous smile ; the eyes gave me a holder version of their adoring look . ' What do you say ? ' " In mere self-defense I told her the truth . ' I 'm afraid Beulah 's right , ' I said . ' An enormous spanking . ' The smile faded , the eyes darkened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks . ' I think you 're absolutely disgusting , ' she said . ' Disgusting ! ' Beulahechoed . ' Who 's disgusting , I 'd like to know ? ' Ruth scowled and bit her lip , but managed to ignore her . ' How old was Juliet ? ' she asked with a note of anticipated triumph in her voice . ' A year younger than you are , ' I answered . The triumph broke through in a mocking smile . ' But Juliet , ' I went on , ' did n't go to school . No classes , no homework . Nothing to think about except Romeo and painting her face  --  if she did paint it , which I rather doubt . Whereas you 've got algebra , you 've got Latin and the French irregular verbs . You 've been given the inestimable opportunity of some day becoming a reasonably civilized young woman . ' There was a long silence . Then she said , ' I hate you . ' " It was the cry of an outraged Salome , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school kid . Tears began to flow . Charged with the black silt of mascara , they cut their way through the alluvial plains of rouge and powder . ' Damn you , ' she sobbed , ' damn you ! ' She wiped her eyes ; then , catching sight of the horrible mess on her handkerchief , she uttered a cry of dismay and rushed upstairs . Five minutes later , serene and completely repainted , she was on her way to school . And that , " Rivers concluded , " was one of the reasons why our grande amoureuse paid so little attention to the object of her devouring passion , why the femme fatale preferred , during the first two weeks of her existence , to concentrate on herself rather than on the person to whom the author of the scenario had assigned the part of victim . She had tried me out and found me sadly unworthy of the role ! It seemed better , for the time being . to play the piece as a monologue . In that quarter at least I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting into trouble . 0 N THE fourth day of his emancipation , Henry sneaked off to a cocktail party given by a female musicologist with Bohemian tastes . Broken reeds can never hold their liquor like gentlemen . Henry could get gloriously tipsy on tea and conversation . Martinis turned him into a maniac , who suddenly became a depressive and ended up , invariably , by vomiting . He knew it , of course ; but the child in him had to assert its independence . Katy had confined him to an occasional sherry . Well , he 'd show her , he 'd prove that he could affront Prohibition as manfully as anyone else . Henry accepted the musicologist 's invitation , and what was bound to happen duly happened . By the time he was halfway through his second drink he was making an exhibition of himself . By the end of the third he was holding the musicologist 's hand and telling her that he was the unhappiest man in the world . And a quarter way through the fourth he had to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; on the way home  --  he insisted on walking  --  he managed somehow to lose his brief case . In it were the first three chapters of his new book . From Boole to WiItgenstein . Even now , a generation later , it 's still the best introduction to modern logic . A little masterpiece ! And maybe it would he still better if he had n't got drunk and bast the original version of the first three chapters . I deplored the loss , but welcomed its sobering effect on poor old Henry . For the next few days he was as good as gold , as reasonable , very nearly , as little Timmy . I thought my troubles were over , all the more so as the news from Chicago seemed to indicate that Katy would soon be home again . Her mother , so it seemed , was sinking . Sinking SO fast that , one morning on our way to the laboratory , Henry made me stop at a haberdasher 's ; he wanted to buy himself a black satin tie for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news of a miracle . At the last moment , refusing to give up hope , Katy had called in another doctor  --  a young man just out of Johns Hopkins , brilliant , indefatigable , up to al the latest tricks . He had started a new treatment ; he had wrestled with death through the whole of a night and a day and another night . And now the battle was won ; the patient had been brought hack from the very brink of the grave and would live . Katy , in her letter , was exultant and I , of course , exulted in sympathy . Old Beulah went about her work loudly praising the Lord , and even the children took time off from their themes and problems , their fantasies of sex and railway trains , to rejoice . " Everyone was happy except Henry . True , he kept saying that he was happy ; but his unsmiling face ( he could never conceal what he really felt ) belied his words . He had been counting on Mrs. Hanbury 's death to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  unexpectedly , improperly ( there was no other word for it ) ? this interfering young squirt from Johns Hopkins had come along with his damned miracle . Someone who ought to have quietly shuffled off was now ( against all the rules ) out of danger . Out of danger ; but still , of course , much too sick to be left alone . Katy would have to stay on in Chicago until the patient could fend for herself . Heaven only knew when the one being on whom poor old Henry depended for everything  --  his health , his sanity , his very life  --  would return to him . " Hope deferred brought on several attacks of asthma . But then , providentially , came the announcement that he had been elected a Corresponding Member of the French Institute . Veryflattering , indeed ! It cured him instantly  --  but , alas , not permanently . A week passed , and as day succeeded day , Henry 's sense of deprivation became a positive agony , like the withdrawal pains of a drug addict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That fiendish old hag ! ( actually , Katy 's mother was two months his junior ) . That malignant malingerer ! For , of course , she was n't really ill nobody could be really ill that long without dying . She was just shamming . And the motive was a mixture of selfishness and spite . She wanted to keep her daughter to herself and she wanted ( for the old bitch had always hated him ) to prevent Katy from being where she ought to be  --  with her husband . I gave him a little talk on nephritis and made him reread Katy 's letters . " It worked for a day or two , and after that the news was more encouraging . The patient was making such good progress that in a few days , maybe , she could safely be left in charge of a nurse and the Swedish maid . In his joy , Henry became , for the first time since I had known him , almost a normal father . Instead of retiring to his study after dinner , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own subjects , he tried to amuse them by making bad puns and asking riddles . ' Why is a chicken with its head hanging down like next week ? ' Obviously , because its neck 's weak . Timmy was in ecstasies and even Ruth condescended to smile . Three more days passed and it was Sunday . In the evening we played bezique and then a game of Heads , Bodies , and Tails . The clock struck nine . One last round ; then the children went upstairs . Ten minutes later they were in bed and calling us to come and say good night . We looked in first on Timmy . Do you know this one ? ' Henry asked . What flower would come up if you planted bags of anger ? ' The answer , of course , was sacks of rage ; but as Timmy had never beard of saxifrage , it left him rather cold . " We turned out the light and moved on to the next room . Ruth was in bed with the Teddy Bear , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her She was wearing pale blue pajamas and full make-up . Her teacher had raised objections to rouge and perfume in class and , when persuasion proved unavailing , the principal had categorically forbidden them . The poetess had been reduced to painting and scenting herself at bedtime . The whole room reeked of imitation violets , and the pillow , on either side of her small face , was streaked with lipstick and mascara . " These were details , however , which Henry was not the man to notice . ' What flower , ' he asked as he approached the bed , or , to be more precise , what flowering tree would come up if you were to plant a packet of old love letters ? ' ' Love letters ? ' the child repeated . She glanced at me , then blushed and looked away ; forcing a laugh , she answered , in a bored superior tone , that she could n't guess . ' Laburnum , ' her father brought out triumphantly ; and when she did n't understand , ' La , burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get the point ? They 're love letters  --  old love letters , and you 've found a new admirer . So what do you do ? You burn them- ' But why La ? ' Ruth asked . Henry gave her a brief , instructive lecture on the art of innocuous blasphemy . Gee for God , jeeze for Jesus , heck for hell , La for Lord . ' But nobody ever says La , ' Ruth objected . ' They did in the eighteenth century , ' Henry retorted rather testily. thing , she once more squeezed my hand and said , ' Liking people , ' and gave me another of those looks of hers . There was an embarrassing pause . ' Well , I guess I 'd better be going , ' I said at Last , and remembering the rhyme which Timmy always found so exquisitely humorous , ' Good night , ' I added as I disengaged my hand , ' sleep tight , mind the fleas do n't bite . ' " The joke fell like a ton of pig iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yearning that I would have found comic if it had n't scared me out of my wits , she went on gazing up at me . ' Are n't you going to say good night to me properly ? ' she asked . I bent down to administer the ritual peck on the forehead , and suddenly her arms were around my neck and it was no longer I who was kissing the child , but the child who was kissing me  --  o ? the right cheekbone first of all and then , with somewhat better aim , near the corner of the mouth . ' Ruth ! ' I protested ; but before I could say more , she had kissed me again , with a clumsy kind of violence , full on the lips . I jerked myself free . What did you do that for ? ' I asked in an angry panic . Her face flushed , her eyes shining and enormous , she looked at me , whispered , ' I love you , ' then turned away and buried her face in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , ' I said severely . ' This is the last time I come and say good night to you , ' and 1 turned to go . " The bed creaked , bare feet thudded on the floor , and as I touched the doorknob she was beside me , tugging at my arm . ' I 'm sorry , John , ' she was saying incoherently . ' I 'm sorry . I 'll do anything you say . Anything ? . . ' The eyes were all spaniel now , without a trace of the temptress . I ordered her back to bed and told her that , if she was a very good girl , I might relent . Otherwise . . . And with that unspoken threat I left her . First I went to my room , to wash the lipstick off my face , then walked back along the corridor toward the stairs and the library . " On the landing at the head of the staircase I almost collided with Henry , as he came out of the passage leading to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began . But then I saw his face and was appalled . Five minutes before he had been gaily asking riddles . Now he was an old , old man , pale as a corpse , but without the corpse 's serenity ; for there was an expression in his eyes and around the mouth of unbearable suffering . ' Is something wrong ? ' I asked anxiously . He shook his head without speaking . ' You 're sure ? ' I insisted . ' That was Katy on the phone , ' he said at last in a toneless voice . She is n't coming home . ' I asked if the old lady were worse again . ' That 's the excuse , ' he said bitterly , then turned and walked back in the direction from which he had come . " To be continued in the May issue After Hours UTOPIAS YOU WOULD N'T LIKE W HAT I do n't understand about science fiction is the way it has turned against science . In the long-ago Wellsian days ( H. G. rather than Orson ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machine ; it was Utopian at least to the extent that it imagined the Future to be an improvement on the Present . But now the old-time religion has lost its grip , and its doctrines have been savagely repudiated . Increasingly , science fiction is a literature of nightmare and polemic . Its authors typically view their worlds-to-come as projections of everything they detest in the world-as-it-is ; and what they detest turns out to be technology , rationalism , hygiene , bureaucracy , democratic man  --  in short , everything that makes the modern world modern . Of course , Utopian writers have ever been social critics , never more so than when  --  like Dean Swift  --  they construct Utopias in reverse . The present trend bath started and reached its peak outside of the enclave of professional writers for the sci-fi magazines and anthologies ; it owes much to Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World and seems unlikely to surpass , in pure hatred of the twentieth century , George Orwell 's 1984 . But it began to creep into science fiction proper a number of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or BEM ( Bug-Eyed-Monster ) , school was coming into disrepute . Like the detective story before it , sci-fi was invaded by taut , atmospheric , " psychological " writing . Where it had previously pretended to be scientifically " sound , " just as the detective story had pretended to provide the reader with clues , science fiction now revealed itself as art . Before the change-over , while the influence of the writer-editor Hugo Gernsback was still strong , much science fiction seems to have beenwritten ( and presumably read ) by scientists . But their images of themselves , and of science , were obsolescent ; their heroes  --  lean cerebrotonics with just a touch of megalomania  --  sallied out to master a hard , intractable universe . Their fantasies were of unimaginable power ( " we 're beyond the lunar orbit ; turn on the galactic overdrive " ) . Their enemies were safely subhuman , lesser breeds beyond the law of a beneficient League of Planets . They were the advance guards of a materialist 's millennium ( an engineering executive once told rue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars by preparing the public to expect new products ) . IT TOOK the " cool " generation to bring science fiction up to date  --  to accelerate its technique , intensify characterization and imaginative power , introduce more stylish motifs , and in the process undercut the assumptions of the elders . No longer were the writers amateurs at writing ; if they had scientific training , they no longer seemed to " believe " in it . Look , for example , at the third issue of the Ballantine anthology periodical , Star Science Fiction Stories . Out of ten items , only one can remotely be classified as pro-science  --  an attempt to make the idea of our future dependence on herds of whales romantic , by likening their submarine supervisors to cowboys . Of the remaining nine  --  to characterize them briefly  --  one is anti-medicine , one is anti-sanitation , one is anti-urban , one is anti-research , two are anti-Point IV , two are anti-commerce , and one seems simply to say that Martians , while loathsome , are preferable to people .

Two hundred years hence every well-to-do house is equipped with a mechanical Door , through which you can step into any other place in the world equipped with a similar Door . The Outside is regarded as unsanitary and forbidden . A small boy , whose family Door is broken , has to walk to school and thus becomes infatuated with Nature . A psychiatrist , called in to cure him of this malady , follows him Outside and is also infected . ( 2 ) " Foster , You 're Dead , " by Philip K. Dick . Competitive consumption in a future society has come to revolve around one 's air-raid shelter , with new models each year stimulated by announcements of enemy " improvements . " A schoolboy whose father is cynical about the system is terrified by his family 's lack of a shelter and talks them into getting one . But they ca n't meet the payments ; they lose the shelter and their son , who runs away to hide as far underground as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Salvation Bluff , " by Jack Vance . A group of Earth missionaries on another planet , where there are many suns that rise and set in baffling sequence , keep their sanity and sense of purpose only by means of an enormous clock set to Earth-time . The local inhabitants have filthy , irresponsible habits ; they resist " reform " and eventually destroy the clock , which they correctly regard as the source of evil . Thereupon the missionaries " go native " and become happily adjusted to the planet . ( 4 ) " Guinevere for Everyone , " by Jack Williamson . A technician has been sent to repair an automatic factory which has gone haywire and begun to manufacture and sell startlingly beautiful women , so that an aroused populace is about to destroy it . He buys one of the " Guineveres " and soon finds that the factory was set to making them by one of its last human foremen , who so feared Automation that he wanted to make it destroy itself ( the factory had figured the consequences , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mob , the technician returns to his girl , only to discover that she had been planned for quick obsolescence and had turned into a hag . Obviously each of these is not adventure fiction but social satire , edged with bitterness against the science-minded society of today , let alone tomorrow . Often , reading the stories like them , which grow more numerous in the anthologies each year , I have wondered what scientists make of them  --  if scientists still read them . Per-haps the unbelievers have taken over among the audience , as well as the writers , or perhaps scientists themselves have become more doubting and apprehensive . In either event , it seems odd to go on calling by the name of " science fiction " an ancient art form which has thrived for su long under a less misleading name . BON VOYAGE HE LAST time f had traveled on a French Line ship was on the Paris , of pleasant memory , in the days when enormous pipes doubled back across the cabin ceilings ; it was like living in a plumhing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder except the well-behaved sea itself that one was the creature of an enormous machine . Life was a round of consomm ? at eleven ; tea , ice cream , and biscuits at four ; Poke Williaius Belle-Helene ( pears , whipped cream , ice cream , chocolate shot , and chocolate sauce  --  a sort of cold French " Dag-wood " ) at dinner ; champagne by the glass ; and dinner music and dancing and conversations that have no beginning and are not meant to have an end . It is also the good game of passengers sniffing each other out . They stalk each other with their eyes and sort each other into categories . The fellow you have spotted as an academic turns out to be a plastics manufacturer , and the girl who must be a professional dancer is an important personage in the French Embassy . There is plenty of time to find out , and if you do n't find out it does n't make any difference . The Liberti ( which used to be the Europa before the inter-Allied Reparations Commission turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ship  --  old , that is , by comparison with the luxury liners that have been built since the war , but not old in spirit or in comfort . Its grandeur , considering how recently it was completely refitted , seems rnoderne rather than modern . There is a good deal of glitter and mosaic and gilt and tapestry and what would be garden sculpture ashore . There is even a winter garden with potted plants , a little more like Atlantic City than like the " good design " that industrial designers such as Henry Dreyfuss and Raymond Loewy have built into American liners . One has the feeling that . there is more " taste " per cubic foot on the Liberte than on anything
