txt President Eisenhower 's battle ( or the foreign aid program has begun to pay off , with Senate passage of a $3,637,000,000 foreign aid bill which contains almost everything the administration wanted . The measure trims only $227 , - 000,000 from the sum the Administration ultimately requested . It includes a two-year commitment on military assistance , and a special revolving economic loan fund for underdeveloped countries . The victory is still incomplete , however . The measure must still pass the House . But the biggest hurdle comes when the congressional appropriations committees vote the actual money  --  of which this bill is the formal " authorization . " Further foreign aid cuts could then be applied in Senate or House . But this vote victory was balm to the administration . It justified the President 's resort to a radio-television talk to the nation to explain the intricacies of the allegedly unpopular foreign aid program . It was a triumph for the assiduous efforts at friendly persuasion by administration spokesmen . Bipartisan Action oimuitaneously the measure displayed Senate bipartisanship in effective operation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas and William F. Knowland of California stood shoulder to shoulder beating off repeated attempts to strike funds from or shrivel the measure . The majority which passed the bill 57 to 25 , after a 13-hour session on June 14 , represented the " moderate " or center-of-theroad Democrats typified by Senator Johnson , the liberal eastern Democrats , what 's left of the southern liberal Democrats , and most of the Republicans excepting the isolationists and far rightists . The minority , which made repeated efforts to strip the measure of its long-term aid commitments or excise funds here and there , was composed , in varying arrangements , of a surprising group of western Democratic liberals , including Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon , the right-wing Republican and a contingent of southern Democratic conservatives , such as Louisiana 's Senator Russell B. Long and Allen J. Ellender . If the administration could do as well with its other major measures before Congress , it would count the session a success . Prior Cuts Made In his original budget message , Mr. Eisenhower had said he would ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration pared that figure by $500,000,000 before sending its aid proposals to Congress . The revised measures carried requests of $1,900,000,000 for outright military assistance and S900,000,000 for projects related to military defense , such as shoring up Allied economies strained ? by big defense budgets . In the foreign ' relations com- mittee each of these items was trimmed by $100,000,000 and there were other minor reductions . But at that point foreign aid supporters held the line . However , in urging rejection of further cuts , Senators Johnson and Knowland did not argue that additional reductions were out of the question . They called on the Senate to postpone any further paring until its appropriations committee had studied the aid program and its justifications dollar by dollar . ? Further cuts now , Senator Johnson said , would leave the appropriations committee with too low a ceiling to make cuts where in its careful wisdom it might feel selective cuts were still due . Long-Term Basis The bill as approved by the Senate establishes a three-year development loan fund for economic aid , as well as the two-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure ever to place the assistance programs on a continuing or long-term basis . The bill also provides that military aid appropriations will in the future be a part of the Defense Department 's budget . In the final vote , 26 Democrats and 31 Republicans voted for the bill , while 17 Democrats and eight Republicans voted against it . Republican ranks thus displayed unusual unity in this major test . Senator Ellender , an old foe of foreign-aid programs , proposed the deepest monetary slash5500,000,000 ? but he was turned back 26 to 61 . Senator Long made a bid to knock out the two-year authorization for defense support activities . He was defeated 34 to 55 . Senator Morse was defeated in attempting to strip the development fund of its continuing features . Senator William E. Jenner ( R ) of Indiana , made a blistering attack , claiming the foreign-aid program had brought no advantages to the United States , but he got nowhere . It was a big victory  --  but a partial one . Work has not yet begun on the appropriations bill for foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP on foreign aid : Page 13.
