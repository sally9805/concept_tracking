Rugged Bachelors of Okinawa While other services enjoy typhoon proof By WILLIAM L. WORDEN homes and plush clubs , the marines grimly train round the clock to fight wherever they are needed . TENGAN , OKINAWA . The green and mountainous island of Okinawa does not look like an insoluble problem . This largest of the Ryukyu island chain ( 167 square miles ) looks , and generally is , pleasant . Here are crowded highways , bustling villages , a neon-bright rebuilt city , a university on a mountaintop , and attractive houses marching up the hills . Okinawa is booming , and looks it . The hilltop headquarters of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyus is in keeping with the general atmosphere ; This concrete-and-glass building radiates permanence and thoughtful planning . inside , the executive-office attitude is calm and relaxed . So , apparently , is the Army 's Lt. Gen. James E. Moore , a slim man with a friendly and outgoing personality . Only his words do not fit all this . He says , " Okinawa must have three things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate ; then a statement of how long we 're planning to stay here ; finally , a chance for the Okinawans to know who and what they really arc . " Thus is destroyed the fleeting illusion that everything is all right on Okinawa because it looks prosperous . Okinawa has improved since 191.5 , when it was a battleground , and even since 1950 , when it was neglected . But no cure has been found for its intrinsic problem-670,000 people with nowhere to go and no real idea of what they should be . So they crowd in the streets on certain nights , shouting , " Go home , Yanks ! " ? though nothing worse for them could happen . They elect a leftist  --  perhaps a Communist  --  to the most important office they have to give . They complain about land requisitions , but do not work the land they have . They live better than Okinawans ever have lived in history , but feel abused . They think like Japanese and act like Japanese , but they do not really ever want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they 're uniquely our problem . The almost classic dilemma of the United States as a world power is a bad case of split personality . About military matters we 're realists , recognizing that we can not protect any part of Asia from Communism without bases for the protectors . We took Okinawa at great cost as a staging area for troops and planes in the war with Japan . There was no other purpose  --  not to free Okinawans , not to right any wrongs . And a military base it remains . Strategic Air Command long-range born bersrequire forward fields from which to refuel or on which to land in what may become World War III missions against the heartlands of Asia . Japan may or may not be on our side in such a conflict . Hence , Okinawa is essential if these bombers arc to realize their full potential . Okinawa 's harbors may be equally valuable to the Navy . This island is the only place near Asia where we may safely garrison any considerable number of troops on a combat-ready basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American character , individual and national , is that we 're horn missionaries . We 're unsatisfied unless people ( Continued on Page 86 ) ( Continued from Page 84 ) an invitation to train on a " look " basis with the St. Louis Browns in 1953 . He won a place on the pitching staff . and posted a seven-twelve record that year . The following season in Baltimore he had his most appalling year  --  three wins , twenty-one losses . However , Larsen gave evidence of being a much better pitcher than this . His earned-run average , for instance , was a not-so-bad 4,37 . There were such high lights as a game on May sixteenth . e.hen he had a no-hitter going against the Yankees until Andy Carey singled ' Anil two out in the eighth . II was at Baltimore that Larsen met his wife , Vivian . The couple have a twentymonth-old daughter , Caroline , but are currently living apart . News of the marriage was never made public until his wife went to court for back support on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to spot potential greatness in Larsen was Satchel Paige , the ageteSS Negro fireballer , who was a teammate of Don 's with the Browns in 1953 . " Right now , Robin Robert " ? Paige always shortened the name of the Phillies ' ace ? " is the kingfish of all the pitchers in baseball , " Satch observed near the end of the 1953 season , " But just give Long John " ? his own particular nickname for Larsen ? " a coupla more years , and he 'll be every bit as good . " Yeah , yeah , I know Long John won only seven games this year . How many more you think Robert woulda won with this club ? Three , four tops . Long John is faster than Robert , and he got just as good a curve . Nothing wrong with his control either . Little more experience is all he needs . Then look out ! He gon na win twenty , twenty-five games one year . And when he do , do n't forget 01 ' Satch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man not overly given to tossing praise around , predicted a week before the 1956 World Series that Don 's pitching would be " the big difference " between the Yankees and Dodgers . " No one mentions Larsen , " Williams said . " 1 ' 11 bet he makes monkeys out of Brooklyn . He 's one of the best right-handers in the league . I think I got only two hits off him all year . " Indirectly , Williams and the rest of the Red Sox were chiefly responsible for Larsen 's decision not to use a windup . " Some of the fellows on our club felt we were 1 ipping our pitches to the Red Sox , " for whom we 're responsible think as we do , share our morals and mechanical gadgets , and enjoy our governmental freedoms . And we feel a need to be loved . Nowhere do the two aims  --  military and missionary  --  reach a greater climax of frustration than on this island , about which we have n't decided anything permanent in twelve years . Along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent an unhappy two months on Okinawa in 1945 , but had seen only bits and pieces of it again until this year of 1957 . I found that almost nothing is recognizable after twelve years . Millions of American dollars have transformed the island . Huge Kadena Air Base , complete with shops and housing as well as runways , is only a starter . A 110-mile highway system skirts the shore and connects the cities . Officers ' and enlisted men 's clubs top the scenic hills . Barracks , warehouses , golf course , beach clubs and military piers arc new . Civilians have 4000 permanent Larsen explains . " One of their coaches , Del Baker , looked like he knew what we were gon na throw each time . So while I was warming up to pitch against Boston on September twenty-second I decided to try throwing without a windup . I had seen Dick Littlefield do it once when we were both with the Browns , and I thought it might upset Boston 's batting rhythm . 1 also figured it might throw Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Don was credited with a 2-I victory over the Rcd Sox , although Tommy Byrne mopped up in the ninth . Larsen was so pleased with the results that he disdained a windup when he faced the Red Sox again in his final start of the regular season on September twenty-eighth . He blanked Boston on three hits for seven innings , then left because Stengel wanted to save him for the Series . There are growing indications that Larsen 's no-windup delivery may be copied extensively by pitchers in both leagues this year . Teammate Bob Turley adopted it in the sixth game of the Series and pitched his finest game of the year , even though he lost to Clem Labine , I to 0 , in ten innings . Tom Poholsky , recently traded from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Chicago Cubs , says he plans to try pitching without a windup this season . Tom Morgan , of the Yankees , used the technique with outstanding results in an offseason charity game at Los Angeles , and several other hurlers gave it a whirl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting royalties from those guys , " Don says , grinning . " All the hitters seem to think I 'm never gon na use a windup again . I may fool ' ern , though . What 's stopping me from winding up one time and not doing it another ? I just may spring that on some of ' ern this season . " A special niche in Baseball 's Hall of Fame , al Cooperstown , New York , already has been set aside to commemorate Larsen 's perfect game . He gets fidgety whenever he thinks about this , and about the worshipful attitude or some of his admirers . " Just think , " gushed one of the movie people he met on his trip to Hollywood the past winter , " I 've just shaken hands with the Perfect Pitcher of all time . " " Oh , no , " Don quickly corrected . " It was only one game . I may be perfectly lousy in the rest . " The Yankees , however , are willing to give odds against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site of old Shuri castle . The capital at Naha has plenty of shopping centers , bars and dance halls . Okinawa now has good water systems , poster lines , bus services , hospitals , commercial docks  --  name a modern facility , and it 's almost sure to be here somewhere . There are nearly 5000 private automobiles . Docks handle 400,000 tons of cargo annually . New housing goes up even in remote villages , and department stores thrive . The transformation has come high . Through 1954 , our Congress had appropriated SI 77,000,000 for Okinawan assistance . In 1956 , the authorization request was for 543,983,000 . Air Force expensis , ; are 532,000,000 annually , with proportionate figures for the smaller Marine and Army units . Including contractors and individuals who hire servants , the United States directly employs 51,000 Okinawans  --  one out of every five cmployable . Wages are the highest in the island 's history . Okinawans have money to spend and stores in which to spend it . Why , then , is n't the island jumping with joy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many . The most common complaint is that the United States has taken too much land , mining the age-old sweet-potato economy of the island . " Return to Japan ? " is a favorite cry of politicians . " More money for land taken , " " More money for teachers , " " Too many troops , " and " Not enough freedom " appear in the anvil chorus of complaints . But none of these holds water very well . Most are only symptoms of what ails this confused island . It 's true that the United States uses a lot of land . Airfields and radio-antenna farms , warehouses and artillery parks generally require flat spaces . Immediately after the war , our Government seized 45,000 acres , some 16,000 of them out of the 80,000 considered arable on the entire island . For land used , we have paid annual rentals since 1952 . These payments now average seventy dollars a year for the typical family plot of about eight-tenths acre . The trouble is that an Okinawan farmer somehow managed to support his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it on seventy dollars in cash . Love may not really make the world go round , but it manages to make millions of phonograph records do so . ALMA DENNV However , he probably now has a job and may still be using the land part time , so he 's not necessarily desperate . Okinawa never was able to support itself before World War 11 , even though Japan kept the population level down by permitting a shockingly high infant-mortality rate and by encouraging emigration to Formosa . Nevertheless , subsidies of some kind always were necessary . Some idea of the postwar problem can be obtained from imports and exports . In 1955 , exports were only 513,400,000. against $62,500,000 imports . Chief exports : black sugar , plus large amounts of scrap metal . Exports in 1956 included $9,800,000 worth of scrap metal , which is bound to run out sometime . Its current economic importance is indicated by the fact that 163 persons were killed or injured in the first ten months of 1956 while combing old ammunition dumps for scrap . American methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes , sugar cane , paddy rice , soybeans , tropical fruits and livestock steadily since 1951 . There has not been any large acreage increase  --  in fact , much usable land lies idle while owners work at town jobs . Actually , even if Okinawans had all their land back , they could not support themselves because of overpopulation . The Okinawans themselves can think of things they would prefer to getting the land back . One delegation suggested that the United States simply pay the lump sum of S14,300,000 for the privilege of using land which we won in war , plus $8,200,000 annual rental for that part of it which had belonged to private owners . A special congressional subcommittee gulped a little at this . This request , it reported , meant " that if an Okinawan owned a piece of agricultural land which now is needed by the United States , our Government should support that indi vidual , and possibly his heirs , in the same manner and fashion as though he were spending long and arduous hours of work and accepting the hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... receive , without the expenditure of any labor , the equivalent of his total land productivity . " Nice work , if you can get it . The cry for " return to Japan " does net stand much closer inspection . The United States-Japan peace treaty included a paragraph in which Japan recognized American control over Okinawa and agreed to concur should the United Slates apply for a United Nations trusteeship . No such application has been made , however , so the island is actually controlled by the military as a prize of war , although official circles avoid the term . There appears to be no good reason why Okinawa should be returned to Japan . On the one hand , return of Okinawa to Japan outright could mean only economic and social ruin for the island . No Japanese government is likely to subsidize Okinawa for even a fraction of the $52,400,000 which is our estimated annual contribution . Return of Japanese control could only up , vet the Okinawan currency . There is very little Okinawan industry now , and that would fade away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation would have to be revised  --  Okinawans would revert to the inferior status they held for more than half a century . And return of the island government to Japan while we continued to maintain our bases could only mean trouble . Since the Japanese peace treaty , there has been nothing but strife about military operations in Japan  --  Communist-inspired farmers ' marches on military bases at Mount Fuji and elsewhere . When politicians here shout about return to Japan , what they actually mean is return of control to Japan . but with the United Stales continuing to pay all the bills . There is no indication in our experience in Japan that this would be a workable arrangement . Problems of military security would be multiplied and further expansion of bases , as needed , would become impossible . Our bases could not be used in war unless Japan approved . Among Americans in Tokyo today , the fashion is to laugh sourly about Okinawa . " Oh , sure , " a young lady said to me recently . " Everything will be fine in Okinawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Japan , in a year or two . " if it happens , this will be an unmitigated tragedy  --  for the Okinawans , the Japanese , the American taxpayer and the American dream of defending the free world in Asia . The side of American policy which wants all the world to love us has been active on Okinawa from the first , The improvement of health standards  --  which almost immediately resulted in an annual population increase of 20,000 ? was simple humanitarianism . The establishment of a prenatal form or representative government could have been only because we want other people to be like us . We were under no compulsion to give the Okinawans a voice in their government . They had no history of self-government and gave no sign that they were ready for it . Nevertheless , they now have its color , if not its reality . Towns and villages manage their own affairs  --  the days about which Teahouse of the August Moon was written are long gone . The island has a twenty-nine-man elected legislature . The results arc not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Civil Administration I USCARL As resident deputy governor of the Ryukytis , quiet-mannered General Moore is dictator // of theisland , although he dislikes the word , He has the power to appoint the Okinawan chief executive , to veto legislative action and to rule by decree . His power extends over taxation , land use , industry and immigration . Our administration here makes elaborate attempts to have the Okinawan legislature pass desired laws so that decrees will not be needed . USCAR did not interfere  --  although it thoroughly disapproved  --  when voters , in December , 1956 , elected as mayor of Naha one Kamejiro Senaga , who shortly before had completed a prison sentence for harboring another leftist and giving false evidence . ( One of the anti-American demonstrations had occurred when 5000 persons greeted him on his release from prison and listened to him promptly demand that Americans go home . ) The election of Senaga is typical of what Okinawans have done with the little power they have . One of the first legislative acts set up customs duties which taxed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in free . An American who built a shopping center found the village elders delighted to have him do so  --  and delighted , a few weeks later , to hand him a $6000 bill for school taxes alone . USCAR officers spend much time in heading off unworkable legislation . When this is n't successful , the deputy governor uses his veto . The American Government simultaneously tries to maintain essential controls for military purposes , to protect Okinawans from economic damage by smart foreigners  --  including Americans  --  and to allow the native government all the leeway it can . Some of the results arc fantastic . Okinawa 's foreign community includes 20,000 United States Air Force personnel and dependents , some 10,000 marines without any dependents , and about 4000 in Army families . In addition , 50,000 Japanese , 500 Americans and a few others are registered as commercial entrants . Many of the Japanese are here because of prewar residence or family connections , but the other civilians have been admitted on military permits based on one consideration : Can this person provide some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these various civilians keeps the military government wondering whether they should be protected from the school tax and other gouges dreamed up by the Okinawans , how much profit they should be allowed to export , and even which ones should go to school . ' There are only the Japanese-language schools and those operated for United States military dependents . To these latter , children of American civilians are admitted for a fee , but a Washington ruling says children of aliens may not be . On Okinawa , this means that about a score of foreign children  --  some the offspring of Filipino veterans of American military services , some Hindu and other children who have had their previous schooling in the United States  --  are barred from English-speaking classes . The result is that American education is a bootleg item in some special cases . American civilians generally are in an uneasy position here . Mention dictatorship and rule by decree a few times , and you become highly unpopular . A newspaperman says , " We try to be critical of the government at least part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that if they ever decide to throw us out , we can say it 's because we were critical . That 's the best protection we can have . " But the government itself has even less . The only clue it ever has had about its own permanence was a statement by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in 1953 that the United States expected to continue the present status " as long as conditions of threat and tension exist in the Far East . " Thus , to potential foreign investors , USCAR can only say : " The law of Okinawa is what the command says it is ; we 'll be here a while , but we do n't know how long . " Understandably , foreign investment remains low . General Moore and his staff need all the patience they can muster . Whatever they do , Okinawans will complain , as a matter of principle . Anything which gets unfavorable notice in the Japanese or Communist press brings complaints from Washington , supersensitive to world opinion . By comparison , the strictly military picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing so many Okinawans , has another year and a half to run . We now have excellent airfields and are equipped to defend the island against aerial attack . The military base , once neglected , now has swung to the other extreme . Housing , entertainment and fringe advantages  --  built-in baby sitters and maids at $17.50 a month  --  compare favorably with other overseas bases . The re-enlistment rate is high . and requests for extended duty here are frequent . The various clubs offer everything from twenty-five cent drinks to Christmas parties for the youngsters . But even more entertainment . of a sort , is in the villages which have mushroomed near every military camp . The Venus , the Butterfly , the Cinderella and the Chatterbox bars arc only typical of more than 1000 such joy palaces , each advertising with gaudy neon the presence of " many-beautiful-hostesses ! " Okinawans were used to Japanese troops before the war and accepted marriages of convenience . They now are delighted by what Americans are willing to pay for company and entertainment . Military police and Okinawan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen years there has been a steady stream of arriving Air Force and Army families , complete with children , dogs , automobiles and furniture . But for the last year the tenor of American service life has been disturbed . Into this atmosphere of permanency and pleasant living , the 3rd Marine Division came like a squall from another decade . Moving down from Japan , the division headquarters , special troops , artillery and one infantry regiment descended on this island with nothing but their combat gear  --  no dogs , no furniture , very especially no wives or children . Privates moved into bachelor quarters , and so did Maj. Gen. Alan Shapley and his staff . Battalions began running up and down hills in training , and artillery started slamming away at hillside targets . Amphibious vehicles churned the surf as if this were 1945 again . The marines acted precisely like men who thought they might have to fight at any time , and who never expected to settle down . Within weeks , most of these permanent transients were maneuvering 1000 miles east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Ryukyus , doing the same thing . Last November they went on a for-real alert during the Suez crisis . Reactions varied . In many a pleasant club , a young officer expressed himself , " Boy , I 'm glad I did n't join the marines . All those guys ever do is work . " American service wives were reduced to speechless rage when several Air Force and Army commanders admitted they thought the ArMy and Air Force could obtain more efficiency at less cost if they , too , left their wives at home . The marines themselves do not act abused . They listen when Army and Air Force wives sympathize ? " Oh , you poor men ! " ? and generally manage properly martyred expressions . But they were left completely without answer when Bob Vermillion , unabashed publisher of the Morning Star , complained loudly to a group of officers , " Out here I have to live with my wife , and I do n't see any reason you should get out of living with yours . " Blond Betty Vermillion only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him home . It 's obvious that there will be difficulties if this is to be an even larger military base than it already is . Actually , the troops may represent the only really solid future the island has . One American shrugged when l asked his opinion . " I think , " he said , " we could do worse than to keep two or three divisions of troops here permanently , If they were without families , it would n't cost much more than to keep them at home , and they 'd be in the right spot if we had a war . More important , they 'd provide enough lifeblood for the Okinawan economy to keep it going . It might be the cheapest answer we could find . " Of course , we could solve the problem simply by annexing Okinawa as a United States territory , declaring its people to be American citizens  --  as arc the Guamanians  --  and permitting free emigration to the United States . The other things we 're doing  --  encouraging resettlement to some of the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building up local agriculture and industries  --  appear to be nothing more than desperation stopgaps . So the dilemma remains . A Genghis Khan would have solved the problem of Okinawa in 1945 by slaughtering its people . Soviet Russia might have ignored them until enough died of neglect or hunger to remove the problem . An insular nation would ignore world realities and give the island back to Japan , no matter what the cost to us . But we Americans have a fine split personality . So we do n't slaughter , or solve population problems with hunger . We do  --  or let us hope we do  --  recognize Okinawa 's value in preventing World War III . But we can not answer General Moore 's demands for a basic law , a statement of how long we 'll stay , or a policy which will let the Okinawans know who they really arc expected to be . Because we just have n't made up our minds .
