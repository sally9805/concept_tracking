Who Rates the Rugs &; When <P> IN the hierarchy of U.S. business , a big problem is the question of executive prerogatives . Who eats in the executive dining room ? Who gets the best offices ? And when does a man rise high enough to rate a rug on his floor ? The scramble for the perquisites of rank is the butt of a thousand jokes , often leads to ludicrous situations . But to corporations themselves , the scramble is no joke . Says John D. Wright , president of Cleveland 's Thompson Products , Inc. : " This involves a problem of morale , and often the little privileges that go with an office are more important to an executive than a raise . You 'd expect executives to be more mature , but they frequently are n't . " Wright himself ran into real trouble on how to list the names on round-robin office memos until he finally decided to list them alphabetically . Since this put Wright 's name at the bottom , everybody was happy . <P> In many companies executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle art of being a jump ahead of colleagues in acquiring everything from better ashtrays to air conditioners . In general , the president and board chairman , who get the best of everything anyway , are rarely involved ; the struggle takes place among the vice presidents , and below . A few years ago , a Dallas company set up a new subsidiary with five brand-new vice presidents installed in identical offices . Everything was peaceful until one used his expense account to replace his single-pen set with a two-pen set . Within four days all five worked their way up to three-pen sets . Then they went on to bigger and flossier names on their doors , and other changes , until the president called a halt and broke everyone back to one-pen sets . A big Chicago oil company caused a major crisis a few years ago when it bought a new type of posture chair to test on a few of its executives . Those left out were so miserable that one man , to save face , bought a chair with his own money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation a vice president was lucky enough to wangle a choice corner office . His equal down the hall would not be appeased until he had a private washroom installed in his office . Some executives spend hours on such things as the " time chart " to prove that they get so many telephone calls and letters that one secretary alone can not possibly do the job ; therefore , they need two secretaries . <P> Rigid rules are often laid down to try to avoid such problems . Standard Oil of California , for example , classifies every employee from Type One ( draperies , wall-to-wall carpeting , walnut desk , etc. ) down to Type Four ( no private office , oak desk ) . A big Manhattan company has set up a chart for every contingency in preparation for moving into a new building now under construction . A top-echelon man gets 280 sq . ft. , " furnished to taste , " with or without private washroom , depending on whether he is a director . Lesser lights will get 210 sq . ft. , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Engineers and others who need privacy get 100 sq . ft. , standard metal desks 60 in. by 30 in. , two wooden chairs and a coat rack ; everyone else gets 70 sq . ft. of work space .
