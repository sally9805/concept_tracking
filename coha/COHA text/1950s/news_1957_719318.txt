txt The Supreme Court today gave the five states on the Gulf of Mexico forty-five days to answer a new move by the Federal Government in the extended dispute over offshore oil rights . In an amended complaint filed Nov. 7 , the Government claimed rights in all undersea land more than three miles from shore in the gulf . The states  --  Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida ? were ordered today to respond to that complaint . This latest legal test on offshore oil  --  the so-called tidelands dispute  --  involves a significant political turn by the Eisenhower Administration . Previously it had lined up with the states ' views on offshore rights . Now the Administration is in court against the states . Its assertion that state boundaries go only three miles out into the gulf is of great financial interest to the states . Money in Escrow The most active drilling for oil in the gulf has occurred so far off Louisiana , most of it beyond the three-mile line . Louisiana and the United States both claim fees for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being held in escrow pending determination of the lawsuit . So far some $98,000,000 in these fees has been put aside . If the Federal Government 's position on the three-mile boundary prevails , it will get this and all future money paid for drilling rights beyond the ' three-mile line . Politically , the inclusion of Texas as a defendant state is particularly notable . Texas has always claimed that its " historic boundary " is three marine leagues at sea  --  ten and one-1 half miles . And General Eisen-1 bower specifically supported , that claim in his 1952 campaign General Eisenhower cam-1 paigned in Texas on the offshore oil issue in 1952 . On Oct. , 14 of that year , in Houston , he said that Texas owned " the submerged area extending three // marine leagues seaward into the Gulf of Mexico . " In its new complaint the Justice Department takes the opposite view . The complaint says : " When the State of Texas became a member of the Union its boundry did not extend into the Gulf of Mexico more than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute is the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 , passed by Congress to fulfill the Eisenhower campaign pledge to give the states offshore oil rights . By the act Congress reversed a 1950 Supreme Court decision that the Federal Government had paramount rights in all submerged offshore lands beyond the low water mark . The act granted those rights to each state up to " historic boundary . " The Justice Department , seeking to prevent litigation over where each " historic boundary " lay , had asked Congress to draw an actual physical line on a map as the boundary of state offshore rights . But Congress declined to do so . The first test case under the act was brought by the Justice Department against Louisiana , which had claimed various boundaries ranging , according to the department , up to 180 miles into the gulf . In December , 1955 , the department asked the Supreme Court to settle what Louisiana 's " historic boundary " was . The case was argued last year by attorneys for the United States and Louisiana . Before the decision came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court asking that its interests be considered , The Supreme Court restored the Louisiana case to the docket last June 24 and said that the interests of all the Gulf States appeared to be so related that they all should be parties to the case . It invited the states to intervene . If ' they did not , it ordered , the United States should bring them in . Only Alabama took advamtage of the invitation to intervene . The United States then , in an amended complaint , , joined as defendants all five of the Gulf States . Although no detailed statement of the Government 's legal position has been presented , it apparently will be based on the view that under international law no nation may set a boundary farther out than three miles . This has been the State Department 's position internationally , and it is said to hold good for the offshore property rights of states also . Presumably all the states now in  --  the case will , file briefs and be represented in oral argument before the Supreme Court : It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue can finally be resolved . The Government 's new complaint does ask for speed , saying . that " there is urgent need for prompt and final settlement of the controversy . "
