txt The Atomic Energy Commission has started discussing with Industry the possibility of " stretching out " its uranium purchase program to reduce the Government 's total uranium bill over the next three fiscal years by as much as $50 million a year . The " stretch-out " would be limited to large mining-milling concerns , and would not affect smaller , independent uranium operators . The big companies already are organizing their opposition . Atomic Energy Commission officials note thaw uranium output in fiscal 1960 , 1961 , and 1962 will be greater than it has plans to use . The A.E C. proposal is to cut back in those years and then add to purchases in later years an amount equal to the cut-back . Uranium Bill Rising Rapidly The nation 's total uranium bill for material covered under ' long-term contracts has been rising rapidly . Including contracted imports from Canada and South Africa which account for more than half the total , uranium procurement cost $358.5 million in fiscal 1957 and $558.6 million in fiscal 1858 , ended last June 30 It is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and $739.6 million in fiscal 1960 , more than double the fiscal 1957 figure- . The " stretch-out " talks to reduce the future uranium load are still informal and the A E C. has made no decision yet . The discussions come at a time when U S purchases of Canadian and South African uranium are likely to become a hot political issue U S uranium producers and political representatives of both parties from Western states oppose extension of foreign purchase contracts as long as domestic production is restricted . On the other side , foreign governments , particularly Canada , are putting pressure on Washington to get the contracts extended . Support for Stockpiling Surplus Powerful Democrats in Congress reportedly favor putting surplus uranium concentrate production in an inventory or stockpile instead of cutting production . The A.E.C. has reported it currently has no stockpile of uranium concentrate beyond the normal inventory of its production operations . Uranium concentrate is the basic feed material for production of reactor fuels and uranium and plutonium for weapons . Industry officials object to the " stretch-out " on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will mean a sizable loss in possible profits to the companies . The A.E.C. 's basic uranium purchasing problem hinges on large contracts with Canadian and African producers negotiated and signed before the 1956 discoveries of huge uranium reserves in New Mexico and later in Wyoming . U S. domestic production of uranium has grown rapidly . In 1958 , 5,200,000 tons of ore were mined , up from 3,700,000 tons the previous year . Jesse Johnson , chief of A.E C. 's Raw Materials Division , predicts " another large increase in 1959 . " Boot in Concentrate Output In fiscal 1958 , the A E.C . purchased $197.9 million of uranium in the U S .. $204.1 Mi111031. in Canada and $156.5 million in overseas areas , mostly South Africa . U.S. uranium mills , refining the ore into the concentrates the A.E.C. buys , will produce in calendar 1959 an estimated 18.000 tons of concentrates with a value of about $300 million , up from $238 million for calendar 1958 . The A.E.C. still in practically the only market for uranium concentrates . A commercial market may develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to sell concentrates to European countries and companies . Commercial sales would be over the Government contracts which on June 30. 1938 , totaled $4.4 billion . The A.E.C.s ' uranium purchase program is divided into two parts , one of which terminates March 31 , 1962 , and the other at the end of 1966 . The agency currently is negotiating contracts with U.S. mills for the later period Company officials note these negotiations give the A.E.C. a strong hand if it should definitely decide on a " stretch-out . " Negotiations With Canadians Canadian companies recently sent a special report to Prime Minister John Diefenbacker urging their government to do everything po .. Bible to get uranium contracts renewed for the period after March . 1962 . Washington atomic officials believe negotiations with some C.i ? nadian concerns already have started , despite opposition of the U.S industry and some political leaders from Western states . Particularly galling to U.S. producers is the fact that the average price paid Canadian companies in fiscal 1958 was $10.77 a pound of concentrate , while the U.S. average was $9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even lower prices . As another means of holding down uranium production . the A E.C . is setting the rate of concentrate delivery it will accept from mills In some early contracts while the A E C was short of uranium , a total amount of uranium was set and the mill could deliver as fast as it could turn out the concentrate . Many of the mills can operate at 30% or more above their designed and rated capacity . The A.E C. is holding its suppliers . including Canadian producers , to the scheduled rate .
