During the past five years the most unusual museum on earth has slowly taken shape in a wooded valley of the Brandywine , four miles north of Wilmington , Delaware . There arc no art treasures from Greece and Rome in this institution , no mastodon bones , stuffed birds , or antique furniture . Its exhibits consist of a number of obsolete factory buildings , working models of out-of-date manufacturing equipment , rusty wheels , broken gears , pieces of shafting , old kettles , forges , furnaces and such stuff as is usually quickly deposited on the nearest scrap heap . The director of research responsible for this collection of examples of early mechanical ingenuity is a young historian named Dr. Walter Judson Heacock , formerly of Williamsburg , Virginia , the magnificent colonial restoration financed by the Rockcfcllers . Doctor Heacock heads a staff that has numbered as many as twenty modelinakers , artists , research assistants and librarians ?

" Lance blinked . " 1.1h , you mean that you do n't want me to go ? " he asked a little incredulously . " What about Bongo ? saw you riding with him in his convertible last Sunday and " " Bongo can go jump in the Potomac ! " Holly said in a choked voice and departed to powder her nose again . Lance stared at her retreating back with his mouth a little open . He took her home later in the ancient coupe , but neither had much to say . Without comment Lance headed for Hains Point again and this time he stopped , and what happened next was unpremeditated , but quite satisfactory to both of them . Later , Holly pulled hack a little so that she could see Lance 's crooked grin in the last of the moonlight . The grin looked unrepentant .

Most of them work in a handsome three-story stone textile mill that was an advanced industrial establishment in 1814 , and another twenty employees care for the surrounding grounds . This building is now the Hagley Museum , devoted to the industrial history of the Brandywine valley and , indirectly , to the industrial history of America . The museum takes its name from the land on which it stands , a tract called the Hagley Yards , where developed some of the early industry of America . The grounds extend over 185 acres on both sides of the river  --  a natural park covering the site of the first Du Pont powder works , dotted with the ruins of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-four of these structures in the grounds , most of them built between 1800 and 1850 , and almost as many in an adjoining tract not yet opened to the public . Visitors generally approach the Hagley Museum from downtown Wilmington , driving out Pennsylvania Avenue  --  which runs into Kennett Pike  --  turning right at Rising Sun Lane or Barley Mill Road ( Route 141 ) just beyond the city limits . These roads reach the Brandywine in about a mile , and at the creek a blacktop road leads upstream to the museum , which is open to the public every day except Monday . On one side of the museum itself the Brandywine foams over rapids and falls , or eddies before the next milldam . On the other side of the ancient building the millrace reflects the trees and shrubs planted in what was once a busy factory yard . Inside the museum there is a big relief map showing the location of old waterpower mills along the Brandywine . Map lights are synchronized with a tape-recorded account of the early industrial history of the creek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gristmill built by the first Swedish settlers in Delaware , a cast-iron water turbine , dug out of the ruins of an 1820 powder mill , and two models of water-powered flour mills .

Holly answered , said , " Yes , sir , " in a hollow voice and turned to where Lance sat with his feet on his now uncluttered desk . " The general wants to see you in his office , Lance . This is it , I guess . " " So here goes nothing , " Lance grunted and headed for the corridor . In the general 's outer office Bongo Harrison leered and said , " Go on in , pal .

TOW n ( Continued from Page 44 ) method of manufacture , using much manpower . The other is a four-by-eight-foot model with hundreds of working parts , the amazing , almost automatic factory that Oliver Evans invented in 1783 . Evans ' mill required only two men in a four-story factory building . The grain was moved by endless chains and conveyors , an automatic hopper-boy spread and cooled the meal , and the process was so efficient that no fundamental change has been introduced since Evans ' time .

On the strength of its indoor exhibits , the Hagley Museum is no more than a welcome addition to the few institutions devoted to preserving America 's industrial past . But outside , around the old mills and machine shops , the industrial history of the country becomes a living reality . Its setting makes the Hagley Museum the greatest of all industrial museums . The Brandywine valley was one of the major industrial centers of the United States from Washington 's administration to Lincoln 's . Before the Revolution there " Yes , sir , " Lance admitted , his knees beginning to knock a little in spite of himself . " I wrote them , " The general 's glower became Faintly genial . " Best damn paper I 've seen since I got shanghaied into this dump . Why ca n't some of the other people around here call a spade a spade once in a while ? Eh ? Answer me that , captain !

What I want around here is somebody to keep the rest of these professional staff wallahs off my neck . You 're it , young feller ! Get it ? " " Yes , sir , " Lance mumbled . Well , there went his chance to get back to his company at Fort McKuhn. he thought glumly . Then he suddenly remembered Miss Holiday Hicks and watching the moon at Hains Point last night and his spirits lifted a little . " Does the general mind if bring my secretary ? " he asked . " She pretty ? " Like a little heifer in a clover patch , general . " " Consarn it , boy , " the general roared , " do n't just stand there ! Go fetch her along !

At the peak of its productive life the creek was lined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania ( built in 1746 ) , to Oliver Canby 's flour mill in Wilmington ( built in 1742 ) . But the heart of this early industrial empire was in the region now enclosed in the Hagley Museum grounds . Paths and winding roads lead past a mile-long row of crumbling powder mills , twenty-one in all . Across the creek , downstream from the museum , stands Walker 's Mill , once a major textile plant , a superb example of early industrial architecture , now the workshop of the Hagley Museum modelmakers . Upstream is the site of the first cotton mill on the creek , built by Jacob Broom , a signer of the Constitution , who sold his millsite to Eleuthere Du Pont in 1802 to speed the production of gunpowder the young nation desperately needed . Eleuthere Irene Du Pont was thirty-one years old when he arrived at the Brandywine to build his first black-powder mill . President Thomas Jefferson promised him a Government order if he succeeded . Alexander Hamilton personally urged the Delaware legislature to help Du Pont get started . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been forbidden in colonial times , and the Revolution was fought with ammunition stolen , smuggled , captured or manufactured in improvised plants . And Du Pont , though he came to the United States as a botanist , intending to start an agricultural colony of French refugees in Virginia , had worked in the royal arsenal at a time when France excelled the rest of the world in powder making . According to James Du Pont , a descendant who sometimes lectures to Du Pont employees on the firm 's history , one reason why Eleuthere Du Pont settled on the Brandywine was that a number of French eriligIT 's lived nearby , and Eleuthere could n't speak English , " In ? ? ? other industries it did n't make so much difference if a workman did n't understand an order the instant it was given , " says James Du Pont , " but in black-powder making everybody involved had to understand everybody else or they would all be dead. ? Du Pont built his mills in pairs , with a large water wheel between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 15% ) and charcoal 110% ) . When a gate was opened in a millrace above the mill , the water poured over the wheel , and the shaft revolved in the mills on both sides . The mixture of saltpeter , sulphur and charcoal was ground to a dust-fine black powder . After opening the gate of the millrace , the workmen walked away . The mills were built with three walls of heavy stone . The fourth wall , facing the stream , was of light wooden construction , as was the roof . In the event of an explosion , the force was dissipated upward and outward over the water to avert damage to the other mills and injury to the crew . One reason why old mills remained standing on the Brandywine was that water power continued to be used in making explosives long after steam was used in making everything else . Steam had little to offer an industry that dreaded lire . The other reasons were more complex . In addition to producing corn meal , nails , snuff , paper for bank notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Brandywine mills also produced superb scenery . Nineteenth-century visitors from all over the United States and Europe made pilgrimages to the manufacturing area , exclaiming over the vistas of green woods , rushing water and busy factories , These earnest sight-seers set out from Wilmington on foot , passing the thirteen flour mills that made the city the foremost flour producer of the New World , then visited the Old Barley Mill , one of the oldest in America , paused at Isaac . Jones ' Snuff Factory , and followed a path along the stream to the Gilpin Paper Mill . The Gilpins carried hospitality to lengths that would stagger a modern public-relations department . They provided lemonade for all visitors , left the icehouse open for their use , as well as a greenhouse and a garden of lemon trees , and trained thirty women employees in neat starched aprons to conduct the daily crowds through the plant , Powder making at the Du Pont yards beyond Gilpin 's mill was too dangerous for visitors to be allowed in the grounds , but they were permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The idyllic period of Brandywine manufacturing when such practices prevailed  --  from about 1820 to 1850 ? surrounded the mills with traditions that helped prevent their going the usual way of outdated factories in the United States . Finally , the Brandywine itself contributed an atmosphere that preserved the past . The lovely greenish-gold stream , " dashing and foaming like mineral waters sparkling with fixed air , " was a favorite subject for painters and poets ; novels like were written about it , and the volumes of local historians who tramped along its banks make a sizable shelf . The pirate , Blackbeard , supposedly buried gold on the riverbank , Du Pont paid only $6740 for ninety-five acres , but it is on record that $40,000 was paid for a small rocky tract believed to contain the pirate 's booty . In more practical terms , the Brandywine drops 124 feet in its last five miles .

The power of the stream was so constant that several of its mills profitably operated w it t antique water wheels within // mistakable : Early rnerican industry was a hit . Sporadic atterr vts had been made to do something with the grounds , but they came to nothing . After the anniversary celebration , Crawford Greenewalt again approached the Du Pont family . " Most museums start with a collection , " says Doctor Heacock , " but this one started with an idea . " The primary need was to take care of the grounds , and the objective was to establish some sort of museum . A foundation was set up , financed by the income from a $6,000,000 trust fund given by the company . Mrs. Francis Crowninshield ( the sister of Henry Francis Du Pont , who built the famous museum of early American decorative art , Winterthur , nearby ) gave ninety acres enclosing the first Du Pont works . Among other major donors were Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a vast outdoor museum depicting American industry as it appeared more than one hundred years ago . the last three decades . Thompson 's Gristmill on the upper Brandywine ran from 1823 until it was destroyed by fire in 1940 . For all these reasons , sentimental , traditional and practical , the old mills survived along the little river . When manufacturing finally ceased in the original Du Pont works in 1921 , there was no thought of razing the abandoned plants . Still , no one had a plan for using them . The real estate had grown fantastically valuable with the building of great estates above the river . Ow nership was scattered among several members of the Du Pont family , When the Du Pont company came to celebrate its 150th anniversary in 1952 , it had become the world 's largest chemical company , with seventy-four plants in twenty-six states , 90,000 employees , 170 , - 000 shareholders , and sales of about $2,000,000,000 a year . A ceremony was held on the spot where Eleuthere ken &; Du Pont built his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the hoard , placed a plaque on a seven-ton grinding wheel , and Crawford .

The visitors prowled through the brick tunnel of the original saltpeter refinery , investigated the subterranean furnaces where willow branches were once converted to charcoal , and climbed into the powder rolling mills that stand like a row of prehistoric monuments . The lesson was unSimpson Dean and Mr. and Mrs. Lammont Copeland . Other heirs donated or willed their property , the Du Pont company gave another twenty acres , until the Hagley Museum grounds now cover 185 acres . As parks and museums go , that is an extensive tract . It is four times the size of the historic Common in Boston . The foundation was set up with six trustees , all members of the Du Pont family except McCoy . Actual operations began with McCoy and Luther Reed , the dinixtor , studying the relics to see what remained that could be used . As the greatest industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its industrial history . There are 3000 museums in the country , but only six are industrial museums , The achievements of Honus Wagner in baseball are properly enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown , New York , but the work of industrial pioneers like Oliver Evans is known only to scholars . So far as members of the Du Pont family were concerned , there was no question of their interest . As part of their inheritance they absorbed the history of the Brandywine works . Young Eleutherc Ireni:e Du Pont , the **25;825;TOOLONG of the founder , says he can not remember a time when he was not aware of the picturesque riverside grounds where the family fortunes began . In his childhood in the mid- ' 20 's , they impressed him as exotic ? ? a garden with A , ril 26 , 1958 ruins in it . " Like most of the family , he knew the landmarks  --  the place where Alexis Du Pont was killed in an explosion while dismantling a mill , in 1857 ; the old office that Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron hand from 1850 to 1889 , permitting no secretary on the premises and writing some 6000 letters a year in his own hand . The present-day Eleuthere Du Pont  --  who is secretary of the foundation running the Hagley Museum  --  summed up family sentiment by saying the purpose of the museum should be simple : To preserve a very beautiful part of the country and to perpetuate an important part of the history of the nation . When it came to dramatizing that importance to the public , " we had to get somebody to help us . " Doctor Heacock had gained experience in early industrial techniques in supervising the craft shops in Williamsburg . He drafted is sort of static scenario in which industrial relics were the actors  --  not merely the Du Pont works but the whole Brandywine industrial complex of which they were a part . The trustees accepted the proposal and sent it to Walter Dorwin Teague , the industrial designer . Teague 's layout provides.eventually for a sequence of exhibits that will reach from the first Indian-corn mills to modern industry . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national importance of the first Brandywine factories became evident . The techniques that were developed there quickly radiated out through the nation . Oliver Evans ' brother was demonstrating Evans ' automatic factory to millers in Virginia almost as soon as it was perfected . Two Quaker mechanics studied the Gilpin Paper Mill and launched the Red Stone Paper Mill , the first west of the Alleghenies . Du Pont 's method of making powder was copied all over the country . By 1809 there were fifty-three powder mills in Virginia alone , and Du Pont sued Brown , Page and Company of Richmond , alleging that their superintendent , who had previously worked on the Brandywine , had stolen 510,000 worth of their machinery . " on which the superiority of their gunpowder greatly depended . " In the event , the museum staff found itself involved with the history of American industry as a whole . The Eleutherian Mills-Hagley Foundation was incorporated as a broad-gauge scientific , charitable and educational organization . Its powers are as sweeping as those of a college . Under certain circumstances it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the museum is now regularly credited for graduate work at the University of Delaware , The charter of the foundation provides that similar fellowships , scholarships and courses in the history of science and industry can be established anywhere in the United States whenever its growth  --  and finances  --  permit . Of all forms of historical research , industrial history is perhaps the most exacting . Fast-growing American industry usually scraps its equipment every decade , and mislays the blueprints . The model of the Swedish gristmill in the Hagley Museum was made from drawings found in the Royal Archives in Stockholm . Some 200 ledgers dating from 1802 in the Hagley Museum library have been combed for physical details of forgotten industrial operations  --  the weight of iron in a seventeen-foot water wheel ( 17,000 pounds ) , or the cost of the wooden-pegged shoes that were worn in the powder mills to avoid the danger of sparks . The modelmakers of the museum include a retired sculptor , an artist who formerly constructed models of stage sets for the Metropolitan Opera in New York , and a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's authority on Oliver Evans . Over the years Akerman has been building the working model of Evans ' automatic factory from the descriptions and drawings in Evans ' hook , The Young Mill-Wright and Miller 's Guide . Visitors at the museum are struck by the contrast between the first crude mills and the gigantic factories of the modern world . But the essentially American contribution is evident in both . From the first , American industry was distinguished by laborsaving devices , practices to reduce the hazards of work , lower prices , shorter hours and better products . Its message to the world was communicated by self-acting conveyors or factory buildings designed to prevent loss of life  --  in short , by just such obsolete mills , rusty wheels , broken gears , and bits of historic scrap iron as the Hagley Museum is collecting . " No one can understand the industrial problems of our own time without a sense of the past of American industry , " says a museum official . The Hagley Museum stands in a region where American industry reached its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exhibits of a technology inspired by political freedom . The growth of the nation 's industry from the time of these beginnings requires no comment . As Doctor Heacock says , " The truth is impressive enough . "
