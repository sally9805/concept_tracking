Blonde Martine Carol , ex-wife of U.S. Actor Stephen Crane and France 's No. 1 pin-up girl , has no hesitation about climbing in &; out of her filmy clothes for the greater glory of Technicolor . Playing the skittish wife of a Napoleonic general occupying a northern Italian town in Un Caprice de Caroline Chrie , busty Martine bounces about in a low-cut bodice , splashes nudely in a shell-shaped bathtub , flits from moonlit gardens to candlelit bedrooms in a minimum of ninon . <P> Among Martine 's previewers was a church group who reported to Pierre Cardinal Gerlier , archbishop of Lyon . Wrote the cardinal in his religious weekly : " The lowly and licentious film entitled Un Caprice de Caroline Chrie . . . is a scandalous display of vice . " On church doors throughout France Caroline Chrie got a five rating on the Index of forbidden films : to be seen neither by adults nor children . Said Martine : " I 'm flabbergasted ! And what do they think about Mary Magdalene ? " Author Cecil Saint-Laurent accused the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film was passed by the French censorship , and with Cardinal Gerlier 's unintentioned advertisement , Frenchmen flocked to see Caroline Chrie . Paris receipts in the first three weeks were $140,000 . The film was rushed to the provinces . <P> At Niort ( pop . 29,068 ) in southwestern France , Caroline Chrie ran into the Abb Francis Ferrier . Rallying parents ' associations , parochial-school pupils , and politicians , the abbe demanded that Mayor Felix Lelant prevent the film from being shown . The mayor thought hard , decided that he might prohibit the film on the grounds that it was a " provocation to riot , " and got the municipal council so to rule . That night pro-Carolinians chalked the walls of Niort with the slogan : " Liberate Caroline . " The anti-Carolinians retaliated with : " Caroline go Home . " <P> Worried about the establishment of a new kind of censorship , based on the mayor 's interpretation of the riot act , the film studio threatened the mayor with a suit . He had not protested a few weeks earlier when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been shown in Niort ; why did he protest against Caroline ? The mayor admitted that he had n't seen Caroline Chrie himself . He would talk it over with the municipal council . Weighing the risk of civil suit against church displeasure , the council last week tried to satisfy both groups . They decided to let Caroline Chrie be shown , but the exhibitors should " wait a few months until tempers are calmed . "
