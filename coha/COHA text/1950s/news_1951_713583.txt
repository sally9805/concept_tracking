Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Congratulations on the firm stand your newspaper has taken in the Reserve-Treasury controversy . Your editorial of Feb. 7 , as well as the one which appeared several days ago , helps to reduce the miasma of confusion which has long restricted to the few the discussion of interest rates and Government debt . In this period of enormous and threatening inflationary pressures it is especially important to understand that the inflation which is rapidly making all past efforts to save futile , which is raising the cost of rearmament to our Government and , hence , to the taxpayer , which leads to consumer and business hoarding at a time when materials should be freely available for the defense program , is not an inevitable concomitant of rearmament . Relation to Rearmament Most of the inflation which we have observed in recent months is only indirectly related to rearmament . The figures on Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly begun . Moreover , present plans indicate that when it does begin it will not be of the enormous proportions of World War II ; indications are that rearmament will absorb about 17 per cent of national output as contrasted with close to 50 per cent during the war . In the light of these facts , the price rises which we have already witnessed can be explained only in terms of fear of inflation  --  an inflation arising not as the inevitable consequence of an unavoidable situation but inflation stemming from Government policy which if not deliberately inflationary is effectively so . In recent months the Federal Reserve Board has repeatedly pointed to the dangers of inflation and has put into effect the anti-inflationary measures , such as credit controls and increased reserve requirements , at its command . But these measures can not have more than a temporary effect as long as the Federal Reserve has one hand tied behind its back . As Government spending on rearmament begins to make itself felt over the next few months inflationary pressure may be expected to grow increasingly powerful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon be brought to bear without delay . It is especially important , as your editorial has so well argued , that the Federal Reserve System be permitted to carry out its primary responsibility . to the nation by making every effort to maintain a stable economy . False Economy The statement by the Secretary of the Treasury to the effect that he could not ask Congress for the additional funds which would be needed to service the debt if the interest rate rises is a touching , , but not entirely consistent , genuflection in the direction of economy . Should this newfound parsimony be genuine , however , it is nevertheless false economy . For many years it has been unfashionable to suggest that a hyper-inflation such as Germany experienced in the Twenties could ? occur in so advanced a country as the United States . But the danger has become more real than at any time since the Civil War ? with prices rapidly surpassing record levels of the intervening period . It would be tiresome to recite once more all the evils of hyper-inflation as they affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , however , that an effective monetary and fiscal system is almost as important a component of military power as industrial capacity . We can not afford to forget that in our type of , economy , at least , treasure is still the " sinews of war . " SIMEON HUTNER , FRANCES CORNIVekLL HUTNER . Princeton , N. J. , Feb. 7 , 1951 . Members of Eisenhower 's Command To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : THE NEW YORK TIMES of Feb. 11 published a letter to the editor from Lewis Galantiere asserting that the Department of the Army announced that Field Marshal Montgomery had been designated as General Eisenhower 's Deputy Supreme Commander and that General Juin had been appointed Ground Force Commander . The letter stated that these announcements were made without the knowledge of the British Government and while the Premier of France was on his way to this country . " This was an outrageous discourtesy " to the British and French Governments , the letter stated . This letter is in error and the facts are as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that Field Marshal Montgomery and General Juin had been appointed to General Eisenhower 's staff as Deputy Commander and Ground Force Commander , respectively . In response to inquiries by members of the press in Washingtono the Department of the Army , after conferring with S. H. A. P. E. representatives in France , announced that Field Marshal Montgomery and General Juin would be members of General Eisenhower 's command . This announcement by the Department of the Army specifically stated that no decision had been made as to what positions these two officers would hold . F. L. PARKS , Major General , G. S.

Minimizing Subway Battle To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The jamming at subway doors by crowds seeking to get in and out at the same time is , as pointed out by your correspondent Donn Sylvester , a shame and a disgrace . It occurs not only at Fourtienth Street and Fourth Avenue but at Grand Central , at Fourteenth Street and Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations also . And yet the remedy is so simple . Every subway car in operation has three doors  --  one at each end and one in the middle . During morning and evening rush hours , when there are extra platform guards to enforce it , let the rule be made that passengers enter only by the end doors , and leave only by the center door . Besides eliminating the unseemly battle between the two opposing crowds , such a rule would quicken service , as in-going passengers would not have to wait upon those going out , but could enter at the ends while the others were leaving at the middle . Perhaps signs posted in the cars or on the doors would aid in observance . Who knows , we might soon fall into the habit , as we have on the buses . SOLON DE LEON . New York , Feb. 10 , 1951 . Role of the Church in Spain Its Teachings Said to Be Identical With Catholic Dogma Elsewhere To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Cyrus L. Sulzberger 's article of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spain displays an ignorance of conditions in Spain that is abysmal , coupled with an ignorance of Roman Catholic dogma that is inexcusable . Extremely bad taste is shown in drawing a comparison between the Vatican and the Kremlin . Although Mr. Sulzberger 's anonymous informant may have been pleased with his flair for analogy , your reporter should have borne in mind that because the Catholic church has been the strongest bulwark against communism , and its chief target as well , Catholics will bitterly resent the comparison . No adult reader is deceived by the standard reporters ' dodge of using unnamed informants to express their own opinions . I have no desire to detail the inaccuracies and biased comments that make up Mr. Sulzberger 's article , but I can not refrain from commenting on one particular paragraph that shows both bias and ignorance . Reactionary Force " Word has been received by foreigners , " says Mr. Sulzberger , " of Catholic students being warned against the ' imperialist ' United States , a heathen country where such ' unnatural practices ' as divorce and birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain from Latin-American countries often are taken aback by this unexpected reactionarism  --  quite different from their own Catholic upbringing . " The theme is also expressed again , " The church in Spain is less liberal than elsewhere , " and " Roman Catholicism in Spain is a far different and reactionary force than in other nations . " For Mr. Sulzberger 's information ( and for the information of your nonCatholic readers ) Roman Catholics do not believe in birth control or divorce , no matter where they live , and we do not believe that this makes us reactionary . Furthermore , the Roman Church and Roman Catholics do in fact consider that birth control and divorce are " unnatural practices " and we do not feel that this makes us reactionary , either . We Catholics in the United States subscribe to these beliefs . The Roman Catholic Church does not have one set of teachings for Spain and another for the United States and another for Latin America . This fact can not be beclouded by insulting the church in Spain and paying grudging tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reports Mr. Sulzberger , is sterile and reactionary , but outside of Spain it is n't so bad . Well , Catholics inside and outside of Spain do not need or want any such sop as this . The church is the same all over the world and Catholics are proud of it . Pervasive Atmosphere It is true that in Spain ( as in most Latin countries ) the atmosphere of Catholicism pervades the national atmosphere more than it does in the United States , for example . Whether you believe that this is good or bad depends on whether you think the Catholic church is ' a good or bad influence . The fact remains , however , that Spain is the one strong bastion of Western culture in Europe . The Spaniard , proud and courageous , without help from anyone fought the Communist at home and defeated him . Far from being in a position to criticize the Spaniard , the present generation of Westerners have much to learn from him . And if they are to learn anything they will have to have somewhat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bayport , N. Y. , Feb. 8 , 1951 . " Timeo Danaos * * * " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I urge that when a correspondent wishes to make a report more vivid by bringing in a quotation from the classics about the fall of Troy he should at least remember who was a Greek and who a Trojan . Drew Middleton , in his article on Chancellor Adenauer on Feb. 8 , writes of him as sounding " like a modern Ulysses warning his countrymen to fear the Greeks when they bring gifts . " So Ulysses ( to.continue the Latinized name of Odysseus ) warned the Greeks to fear the Greeks ! However ' much Virgil may have wished to regard him as a traitor , he did not go so far as Mr. Middleton ; he really was careful enough to make Aeneas ( a Trojan ) say that it was Laocobn ( another Trojan ) who issued this warning . In any event , Mr. Middleton makes nonsense of his simile  --  or does he want us to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trojans as the Western Germans are of the Eastern ? G. J. L. Gomm .
