For nearly a year after he took over at SHAPE headquarters in France in 1951 , General Dwight D. Eisenhower was quiet and unassertive . He listened to his staff , he listened to the leaders of Europe , he asked questions . Some of his associates grew impatient . When was he going to show that he was in charge of the defense of Western Europe ? One day , at a full-dress conference on the big picture in Europe , he answered their question . After listening to repeated reports on Soviet strength , he abruptly announced that he was damned tired of hearing how helpless the West was before Soviet power . With eyes flashing , he told the men of SHAPE : " We are here to build the defenses of Europe , not to wring our hands at how bad they are ... I want to know from day to day what each one of you is doing about it . I want to hear from you how the defenses of Europe are increasing to meet the situation which paralyzes all of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the conference room , grabbed the knob , flung the door open and stalked out , his back set like a fixed bayonet . As he left , the SHAPE staff-Americans and Europeans alike-broke into applause and then began to cheer . The door reopened . Eisenhower stood there , smiling . He bowed slightly and closed the door again . After that , there was no doubt about who was in charge . <P> " Sensing " the Job . The scene in postwar France , recalled last week by an officer who was there , illustrates a basic personality trait with which Eisenhower 's staff officers in SHAPE in World War II also were familiar . Eisenhower is a slow starter . He likes to surround a problem , to watch , listen , absorb and learn all he can . Then he acts decisively , firmly . This was his method of operation in planning the invasions of North Africa and Normandy . It was his technique in the presidential campaign last year . He now recalls , with understandable enjoyment , the much-quoted August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running like a dry creek . " <P> This month Dwight Eisenhower came to the end of another great period of preparation . He had spent nearly a year , as one aide put it , " sensing " the job . While he was doing so , many a politician and editorialist asked : When is he going to take charge ? In Washington last week , there was no doubt that President Eisenhower was the man in charge . <P> One public indication of the change was the President 's United Nations speech , in which he forcefully seized the initiative in the world 's effort to live with the atom ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) . When he called in Republican congressional leaders to outline a legislative program last week , he clearly showed that he meant to lead in the privacy of the conference room as well as in the public eye . <P> The Details of Every Problem . To the surprise of some , it was Dwight Eisenhower personally-and not his staff-who outlined his program to legislative leaders . He did so from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points . Said one conferee : " It is absolutely amazing what the President has learned in the last year . He knows the details of every problem-farm , water , power , conservation , taxes , social security , anything . . . "
