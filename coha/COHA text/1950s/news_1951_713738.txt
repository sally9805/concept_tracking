txt On this Easter eve , I keep wondering what happened to the marine sergeant and the three little white rabbits he carried into battle a g a ins t the Reds in far-away Korea . They were soft , and pink-eyed , nestling in a cardboard box on a bed of r ice straw . They slept soundly thru the hammering of machine guns and the thunder of shelling as they crossed the Han river , sheltered in the sergeant 's arm . Right to Repeat The story of the sergeant and his rabbits has been told . But somehow on this day it seems right to tell it again : The September night was cold . A pale moon had dipped below the horiion when the marine heavy weapons compair , began climbing into the belly of steel amtracs for the crossing of the Han . Finally , our amtrac was filled with tense , silent men . The heavy steel door clanked shut to seal us inside . The amtracs lurched toward the river as dawn dissolved the darkness . The sergeant had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one arm and with the other he cradled the cardboard box . The men around him were careful not to crush the box because they knew what was inside . Sleeping Peacefully Then the sergeant saw the curiosity on my face . He opened the lid for me to peep inside . There lay the three white rabbits , sleeping peacefully thru the grinding racket of a war machine under fire . The amtrac crossed the Han , climbed the embankment on the Seoul side , and lumbered thru rice fields to the base of a small ridge . " Get ready to go : " The steel door fell open , the sergeant dashed out to throw himself on the protective side of a small embankment . Carefully , he placed the box beside him and then looked inside to see that the rabbits were all right . Screams and Falls Behind us a marine screamed in sudden pain . He fell beside the sergeant and blood gushed from a wound in his side  --  staining his green fatigues . Another marine screamed and fell . And then the marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes above us . Around the ridge came a group of Korean civilians , terrorized by the battle raging around them . Several children were sobbing , their eyes were filled with fear . The sergeant saw the children . Perhaps he had children of his own safe at home in the *United States . I do n't know . But he slung his hot carbine to his shoulder and picked up the box and walked over to the children . Ball of White He knelt down and lifted one of the rabbits  --  a tiny ball of white in his calloused , hamlike hand . He Smiled at the children . They stared thru their tears at the rabbit . Slowly the fear drained from their eyes . One took a step toward the sergeant . Then another . Then all of them crowded around the sergeant and they , too , peeped into the box at the rabbits . One child giggled . And soon the group was laughing and chattering and not afraid any more of the crashing sounds around them . The sergeant chuckled . He placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge with the box under his arm  --  a big man with a gentleness in his heart that could never be destroyed even by an enemy bullet .
