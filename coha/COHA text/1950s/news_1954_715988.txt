txt U. S. representatives refuse again to resume Korean peace conference arrangements until Reds apologize for perfidy charge . Details on Page 3 . BY WILLIAM MOORE CChlttrn Trihnn. g.r. - tpwl Washington , Jan. 14 ? Sen. Welker Idahol charged to . day that statements attributed in the press to Arthur H. Dean are ilar to the views of eel -- tain left wing columnists . He said individuals such as Dean a r e " chanting the siren song of collaboration with the rulers of Red China . " Dean is special ambassador to Korea and chief United States delegate in the Panmunjom conferences with the Chi- , nese- and North Korean Communists . He is also a member of State Secretary Dulles ' law lino . Welker challenged Dean 's authority to speak for the United States on far - eastern affairs and objected , in a senate speech , particularly to press reports that Dean is calling for a review of policy toward communist China and nationalist China . Alay Get Insulting Moreover , Welker said , Dean contends that if the United States does not open trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may reject a later offer " in an insulting manner . " Welker said that because of Dean 's official position the remarks he makes may tend to commit this nation to policies which Dean advocates . He asked what'authority Dean has to speak for the government . " I should like to ask , " Welker demanded , " if he is speaking with the blessing of the secretary ; of state or the President of the United States . " Certainly Dean was never confirmed as ambassador by the senate of the United States and can not lay claim to its approval . " Questioning U. S. Policy Welker said the American people do not want any change in ? American Asiatic policy . That policy , he said , is refusing even to discuss admitting Red China to the United Nations , and recognizing " the sacrifices in blood which American soldiers have made on the icy hills of Korea . " - " But today , individuals such as Dean are apparently beginning to question the wisdom of this policy and in a roundabout manner are chanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , " Welker Raid . " Chiang Kai-shek , the legal president of China , is tossed aside as ineffective and unreliable . We are asked by Dean to take a hard critical stare ' at his military potentialities with the total intention of pointing to the president of free China as the leader of a lost cause . " Here , as elsewhere in Dean 's remarks , the clearly suggested alternative is to turn hopefully to the Chinese Reds  --  the same Reds who have , turned the once great nation of China into a land of terror and death . The same Reds who have proclaimed their love for ' people 's democracy ' while exterminating it from the very earth . " Alluding to what he said is Dean 's contention that the United States must begin trading with Red China at once or risk rejection of a later offer in an insulting manner , Welker said : " I wonder , " Welker asked , " what the families . w of American dead of Korea would have to say today to Dean 's fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' insulting ' gesture from Mao Tse-tung and his band of thugs . " Chairman of I. P. R. Council Welker said that Dean was chairman of the I. P. IL 's Pacific relations council from 1946 to 1950. and that Dean " was a major contributor to the organization along with the millionaire communist Frederick Vanderbilt Field . " Welker said the senate internal security subcommittee found in 1952 that the I. P. ft " has been considered by the American Communist party and by soviet - officials as an instrument of communist oolicy , propaganda , and military intelligence , " and that " members of the small core of officials and staff members who controled I. P. R. were either communist or pro-communist . " Approved Lattimore Work Welker said Field invoked the 5th amendment when asked about " his membership in the Communist party . " and said the I. P. R. minutes of March 18. 1947 , recorded that Dean had defended Field as " one of the most valuable and objective members of the executive committee . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
