The husky former lifeguard had covered about 16 miles on his 361/2 mile course when he decided it was useless to continue to battle the heavy current . He had been in the water 13 hours and 15 minutes . Wife Gets Seasick By the time Griffith gave up , his wife Phyllis , riding in an escort craft , had become seasick .

This caused his escort vessels , tray cling slowly , to drift to the southwest . They had to compensate for the drift to keep him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliments to the persons escorting him on his vain attempt to conquer the lake . After abandoning the swim , Griffith entered the escort craft in which his wife was riding , and they returned to the 14th street dock from which he had started the yenture at 7:15 a. m . Tuesday . Two Previous Efforts On Griffith 's first attempt to master the lower end of the - lake , in 1957 , he gave up after 17 miles and 121/2 hours in the water , when a stiff northeast wind blew him backward half a mile .

It was estimated that in that effort Griffith actually swam 36 miles , but two navigational errors made during a heavy fog put him off course .
