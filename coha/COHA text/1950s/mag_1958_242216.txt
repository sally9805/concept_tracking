The Seventh International Cancer Congress in London this week heard the sobering results of a sweeping study of the effects of smoking on the death rate from cancer and other diseases . Author of the report : Statistician Harold F. Dorn of the U.S. National Institutes of Health . Dorn 's project was begun in 1954 as a check on the disturbing findings from the American Cancer Society 's famed Hammond &; Horn survey of 188,000 U.S. males . Researcher Dorn threw his statistical net even wider : it covered 198,000 men ( and a sprinkling of women ) holding Government life insurance as a result of military service between 1917 and 1940 . <P> All these cases were followed through the mountainous files of the Veterans Administration . The Dorn-VA technique : whenever a claim was filed to collect insurance , investigators double-checked both the primary cause of death and other contributory diseases with the physician who signed the death certificate , and ( if possible ) with the results of post-mortem examinations . Where the Hammond-Horn study had been attacked by the tobacco industry as statistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation could not be assailed on the same ground , although even before formal publication it was criticized by industry spokesmen ( " It can not possibly establish the cause or causes of any diseases " ) . The findings , startlingly similar to those of the American Cancer Society : <P> Men who smoke two packs of cigarettes or more a day have the biggest death rate in the age groups covered ( 30-to-80 , but largely concentrated on 50-to-70 ) . The rate : twice that for nonsmokers . <P> Those who smoke cigars or pipes as well as cigarettes have a lower death rate in proportion to the smaller number of cigarettes smoked . <P> Cigars or pipes alone cause only a negligible increase in the death rate . <P> Cigarette smokers improve their chances of living longer if they quit smoking . Those who stopped " prior to the start of the survey " have a death rate 1.4 times that of nonsmokers , whereas for all cigarette smokers ( any amount ) the rate is 1.66 times that of nonsmokers . <P> In absolute numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly from heart and artery disease . But the cause of death that shows by far the greatest proportionate jump is lung cancer : it is six times as common among all smokers as among nonsmokers , 9.35 times as common among cigarette smokers . <P> Britain 's Dr. Percy Stocks took up the question of lung cancer and air pollution , reporting on a study of more than 2,000 men who died of lung cancer in smoggy Merseyside areas ( centered at Liverpool ) and clear-aired North Wales . Among nonsmokers the hazard of smoggy air was clear : 2.3 times as much lung cancer in smoke-palled belts as in cleaner areas . But to the identity of the cancer-causing substance in polluted air , Dr. Stocks had no clue . In smoggy areas , the death rates were almost identical for light smokers ( less than a pack a day ) and nonsmokers . But among men who smoked more than a pack a day , the death rate rose , paradoxically , far faster in rural , smog-free areas . Explanation ? Dr. Stocks had none .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
