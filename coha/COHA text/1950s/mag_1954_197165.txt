The worldwide postwar revolt against colonialism last week licked at the foundations of the French empire in North Africa . In Morocco , where the French conquest was not completed until the Riffs were put down in 1926. arson , shootings and bombing killed scores and wounded hundreds . In Tunisia , where French paratroopers are engaged against nationalist guerrillas , French Premier Mends-France was trying to head off revolt with a belated promise of home rule . Evenin Algeria , a part of metropolitan France and the home of 1,000,000 Frenchmen , the Arab population ( 8,000,000 ) is rumbling with discontent . <P> Each of the three French territories ( see map ) has its home-grown strife and problems . But in the 20th century , history , geography and politics have converged to give their stirrings a singleness of purpose . Of the world 's 53 million Arabs , virtually all have received their independence in the past generation except the 20 million in French ( and Spanish ) North Africa .

Fanned by France 's retreat in Indo-China , by Britain 's from Iran and <P> Suez , their demands have caught fire at a time when Western opinion has decisively rejected old-fashioned imperialism , and when France herself lacks the power , and possibly the will , to extinguish revolt by force of arms . <P> <P> The French found North Africa largely desert , and in places they have made it bloom . The million and a half Frenchmen who now live there regard it as their only home . Equally important , France 's African empire , all of which might fall if strategic North Africa is lost , is the last remaining assurance that France is a great power . " Without it , " Frenchmen argue with incontestable pessimism , " France will have no place in the 21st century . We shall be 40 million Frenchmen against nearly twice as many Germans . We shall become another Portugal . " <P> Some kind of French retreat seems inevitable in North Africa , as it was in Indo-China . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We must leave , " said one French settler . " It could still be done today , gradually and without catastrophe . True , some French colonists may lose their estates . But if things go on as they are , they may lose their heads as well . " Probably not many colons in Tunisia would agree with him ; they hope to stay . Whether they will be able to depends on French wisdom and skill-on the wisdom to recognize a changing order , on the skill to adapt with it . So far , the signs are not promising .
