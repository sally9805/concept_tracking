The English-speaking peoples have yet to produce an enduring giant among composers . Edward William Elgar came close , though not very . Perhaps the best that can be said for him is that he admirably expressed his era . A discerning friend once wrote him : " You have translated Master Rudyard Kipling into music . " For long , palmy decades , the world heard Elgar 's brassy paddles chunking from Rangoon to Mandalay to Aldershot . When the trooper was on the tide , my boys , or when Tommy Atkins returned from defending dominion over palm and pine , or simply when the poor little street-bred people clustered around the bandstand at Brighton , Elgar 's Pomp and Circumstance must ring out . Yet for all its imperial bombast , Elgar 's best known composition also conveyed a sort of sweet innocence ; compared to some of the marches it was soon to contend with-Communism 's booming International or Nazi Germany 's gutter hymn , the Horst Wessel Song-it lacked steel . It was really a recessional . <P> This week a Britain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly embarrassed tribute to Sir Edward Elgar on the centennial of his birth . Extravagantly overpraised in his own day , Elgar is now in the shadows . The colder airs of Benjamin Britten rule Britannia- so much so that critics are taking pains to point out that Elgar , after all , was a skilled and inventive composer who opened a whole new musical tradition for his musically backward country . <P> Lace &; Mendelssohn . The wonder of Elgar 's career ( he died in 1934 at 76 ) was not that he failed to become a great composer but that he accomplished as much as he did in the stale , lace-curtained musical atmosphere of mid-Victorian Worcester , where he grew up . The fresh gusts of new music blowing off the Continent never stirred Worcester , and Elgar did not venture as far as London until he was 22 . His father was a church organist and sometime piano tuner , and Elgar was raised on warmed-over Mendelssohnian oratorios and cantatas . He played the bassoon , violin and piano in amateur groups , conducted the Worcester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band . <P> Elgar might have remained an obscure provincial composer if he had not been encouraged by his wife , a general 's daughter . At 43 he won fame at last with his thunderous oratorio , The Dream of Gerontius . As Edwardian England wandered toward World War I , his reputation rose on a great wave of public nostalgia . <P> Beef &; Beer . Elgar became Master of the King 's Musick . He fitted the public picture of clubman and country squire , complimented himself that he neither looked nor dressed like an artist . It was this pompous Elgar who turned out the first Pomp and Circumstance march ( its trio is also known as " Land of Hope and Glory " ) , along with The Crown of India , The Banner of St. George , Imperial March - all marked by bombast , contrived orchestral climaxes , syrupy sentiment . " I want to write something as typically and thoroughly English as roast beef and beer , " Elgar said , and he succeeded .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
