The President whirled through his two-day visit to Missouri at a collar-wilting pace . His first morning in St. Louis he was awake at 5:15 , shaved and dressed at 5:30 , and out striding along downtown sidewalks at 5:45 . At one point during his jaunt he spotted a naval enlisted man named William Hall , standing on the sidewalk in a heated post-dawn argument with a taxi driver . The President tapped the bluejacket on the shoulder and asked : " Where did you get all those battle stars , sailor ? " Hall whirled , goggled , hauled himself to attention and stammered an answer : the Pacific . The taxi driver drove off as though he had just seen the biggest traffic cop in the world . <P> Dash for Shelter . At 7 , Harry Truman was aboard a five-car special train , heading for Columbia and the University of Missouri 's commencement exercises . By 9:30 , in cap &; gown , he was marching in the faculty parade around the University stadium . By 10 he was beginning his 18 minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He raced through the speech ; it began to rain just as he started it , and a cloudburst sent his audience of 17,000 stampeding for shelter just as he finished . <P> Drenched but beaming , the President took refuge in a campus building to receive a Phi Beta Kappa key and an honorary doctorate of laws . He took lunch at the home of the university 's tall , grey-haired President Frederick Middlebush . Afterward in the living room he got a new round of laughter and applause by playing the Jenny Lind Polka as a piano duet with his sister , birdlike , 60-year-old Mary Jane Truman , and by giving her a brotherly poke with his elbow for making a mistake in her chording . <P> By 2:30 he was back on the train 36 miles up the track and making an off-the-cuff speech to a crowd of 5,000 at Mexico , Mo . He left his special car for an automobile at Robertson , Mo . and arrived at Beer Baron August Anheuser Busch Jr . ' s manicured , 550-acre estate , Grant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Service guard , he immediately climbed aboard a horse-drawn coach to inspect a herd of buffalo , elk and deer which roam the Busches ' acres . Then he joined the granddaddy of garden parties ( 200 servants had been assembled for the occasion ) , drank a slug of bourbon , nibbled some hors d'oeuvres , shook hands with his host , and was on his way again . <P> Battery D. He got to downtown St. Louis just in time to eat , dress , and appear at a ball which opened the 24th reunion of his old World War I outfit , the 35th Division . <P> The next morning at 7 he was breakfasting in the Jefferson 's mirror-hung Crystal Room with the particular segment of the 35th closest to his heart : the aging warriors of Battery D , 129th Field Artillery , whom he had commanded in France . That afternoon , while 250,000 people cheered along St. Louis ' sun-baked downtown streets , he led them - and the rest of the 35th - in a 16-block parade . <P> The President beamed and waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without drawing a deep breath ; he topped the day off with a speech ( see above ) to 30,000 people who had gathered along the Mississippi riverfront to dedicate St. Louis ' new park , the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial .
