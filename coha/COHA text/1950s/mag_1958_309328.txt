Working as a team , Ohio 's Republican Governor C. ( for nothing ) William O'Neill , 46 , and Senator John Bricker , 65 , crisscrossed the Buckeye State last week in an aggressive new bid for votes . Boomed <P> O'Neill : " Fear has spread over Ohio . There is use of power to instill fear . I deplore the thought that Ohio citizens should be afraid . " Roared Bricker : " If ever there was a clearcut call for non-partisan action , it was for protection of the union rank and file against the abuses of labor racketeers , the embezzlers , the professional goons , the Hoffas and the Becks . " So saying , O'Neill and Bricker plumped unequivocally for a hotly debated Ohio right-to-work bill on next month 's ballot . Explained a G.O.P. strategist : " We 're taking a chance on it helping the party . But there are many crosscurrents to right-to-work and we know it . " <P> Flood of Registrations . Crosscurrents swept in and out of the whole issue of labor bossism as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , with the exception of outpost Vermont , most candidates carefully paddled clear of the rip tides . But westward from Ohio , the revelations from Senator John McClellan 's Washington hearing room combined with drives for right-to-work laws* to produce a major issue . <P> Right-to-work propositions are on the ballot in five states besides Ohio : California , Washington , Idaho , Colorado and Kansas . They have produced floods of new registrations ; most of it is probably Democratic ; in California , only one of each four of 457,000 new voters registered Republican . But angry questions at political rallies , letters to editors , earnest debate at many a saloon and street corner indicate that even union rank-and-filers-not to mention farmers and white-collar workers-are seriously disturbed over Big Labor 's evident excesses . <P> Watch the Backlash . Even so , no Democrats-and precious few Republicans-have grabbed hold of the issue with the firmness of Ohio 's O'Neill and Bricker . Notable exception : the nation 's most stubborn right-to-work man , William Fife Knowland , California 's Republican candidate for governor , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the issue . <P> National G.O.P. leaders , who had once hoped that the unsavory record of labor racketeering would rub off on labor-oriented Democrats , all but gave up trying to hang failure of the Kennedy-Ives labor bill on the Democratic 85th Congress . No less a campaigner than Vice President Nixon warned that the issue would get all mixed up , could easily backlash to brand the G.O.P. as antiunion . Bigwig Democrats meanwhile whistled merrily , predicted a pro-labor vote that would swell the Democratic landslide . Fact was that the labor bossism issue was a sleeper and much of the whistling was in the dark . Many a candidate would not sleep peacefully until election night when he saw how the crosscurrents had moved and who had been carried off as flotsam . <P> * Right-to-work laws forbid union membership as a condition of employment , thus outlaw union shops , thereby go one step beyond the federal Taft-Hartley Act 's no-closed-shop provision . Eighteen states , mostly Southern and Midwestern , already have R.T.W. laws .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
