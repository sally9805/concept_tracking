Signs and Omens // For some weeks now , as the picture on the cover of this issue shows , the great signboard over the south gate of the Los Angeles Coliseum has carried an apparently simple legend : // OPENING GAME L A DODGERS VS S F GIANTS APRIL 18TH 1 30 PM // Students of baseball omens  --  and of California history  --  might do well to examine this information closely . // Is an augury of any kind to be found in the circumstance that the San Francisco Giants will make their first descent of all time upon Los Angeles on April 18 , the 52nd anniversary of something known around the world ( but not in San Francisco ) as the San Francisco earthquake ? And if so , is it the Giants or the Dodgers who are due for a shaking ? We leave these matters to the study of omen experts everywhere , confident that in just about four weeks ' time we 'll all have an answer . // But it does not take the seventh son of a seventh son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest moving and rocking that has ever hit major league baseball  --  the arrival of the big game on the shores of California . When Walter O'Malley and Horace Stoneham get together in the Coliseum on the afternoon of April 18 they can shake on it . // Ron for the Money // Use your arms on the bends , Ron , " said Jim Elliott , the Villanova coach . " I 'll call your lap times to you . " // " Righto , " said Delany . " If I 'm around 3:05 at the three-quarters , I 'll have a go at it . " // To Ron Delany , the likable gentleman from Ireland , records are something to play in a jukebox . He has , all year , run to win and he has won 28 consecutive races indoors . In his 28th , at the Chicago Daily News Relays last week , he turned the three-quarters in 3:05 and had a go at the world indoor mile record . He used his arms busily on the turns , propelled himself through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world indoor mile mark of 4:03.4 , 2/10 of a second under the old one . // After the race he sat on the edge of a judge 's platform , changing from natty white-and-red racing shoes to a pair of old , not-so-natty sneakers. // " No , I do n't think this track is much different from the others , " he said in answer to a question . " There 's one that 's like running through an Irish bog barefoot , but not this one . I could have set this record on the New York track if it had been convenient and the time had been right at the three-quarters . But then there 's half a dozen milers who can beat it . I might myself . " // He watched Iowa 's Deacon Jones begin a kick that carried him to the tape ahead of Max Truex in the two-mile . // " They ought to get on his back , " Delany said , a grin lighting the pleasant , bony face . " He runs like I do . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself tonight , ' Ronnie , you 're going to break the world record , ' I might not have done it , you know . But I was running that last quarter . I was n't taking it easy . " // He looked up at the full stands . // " Chicago is an Irish town , " he said . " I 'm going to stay here tomorrow and Sunday and ride in the St. Patrick 's Day parade with a shillelagh on my shoulder . There are lots of good Irish people here I want to meet . I do n't know what Philadelphia is , but it 's not Irish . " // He stuffed the running shoes in a canvas bag with Swissair on the side . In the bag were a towel and a loose dollar bill . // " My ultimate ambition is to retain my Olympic title , and I think I can , " he said seriously . " I should be at a peak by then . Meanwhile , I enjoy running . I 'm in America to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I enjoy keeping my end of the bargain . " // Added Ingredient // On the theory , perhaps , that the more distance they put between themselves and the fans up north the better , the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates occupy the southernmost spring training camp of all . A lovely , sea-lapped spot , it basks on Florida 's west coast at Fort Myers . // The Pirates have been going to Fort Myers for years , but this spring something new has been added to the camp . It is a huge lump of muscle named Ted Kluszewski . The first thing a reporter sees as he strolls into the Pirate clubhouse is likely as not to be the Klu stretched out on a rubbing table . Or he can stroll down to the pitching machine where the players are taking their practice cuts , and there is the Klu filling the cage like a moving van in an alley . Everywhere one looks , there is the massive man with No. 3 on his back . His presence pervades the camp , and one reason the reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp from the bat boy to General Manager Joe Brown is watching him too . // Not that the Pirates are counting on Kluszewski , or anything like that . Oh , dear , no . They got him from the Cincinnati Reds on a gamble with a sore back and they do n't expect him to bat .326 as he used to a couple of years ago . It 's just that if he does n't , they may all drop dead . // " I never saw anything like it , " said one seasoned observer last week . " The first day Klu walked into the batting cage , everything stopped dead . The pepper games behind the cage stopped . The pitchers running in the outfield stopped . The coaches hitting fungoes , they stopped . Everybody just stood there watching Klu hit . " // Working himself into shape slowly and easily , Klu himself is optimistic about the future . He 's still not sure exactly when his trouble began , this slipped disc that threatened to put him out of the game after nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fielding a ball during spring training in 1956. // " I went ahead and had a pretty good year , " he says , " but at times it was pretty bad and last year it hurt a lot . So many doctors have looked at me I could n't even count them . " In hospital and out , Klu has been punched and probed and pounded , sweated under heat lamps and frozen in ice packs . His powerful back muscles have been subjected to all manner of electromagnetic radiation . // His most recent gadget is a curious device resembling a sawed-off refrigerator with rubber cords sprouting from its sides . At the end of one of these is something that looks like a detached headlight , and when this is applied to Klu 's back , whatever is in the box goes into Kluszewski . " I believe this is doing him some good , " said the technician who controlled this monster last week . " I do n't know , " said Ted Kluszewski , " but keep it up anyway . It feels good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maych . These are three little words being heard with more regularity these days behind Russia 's Iron Curtain . Translated they mean , of course , " game , set , match . " Having decided to embrace tennis , it appears , the Russians have embraced some of the international language of the game , adding only a Russian accent . // A tennis friend of the editors has been able to establish this news after a certain amount of persistent digging . First he called a fellow who had spent some time in the Soviet Union . // " What is ' game ' in Russian ? " the fellow said , repeating the query . " Gee , I do n't know . I think it is igra or something like that . Why do n't you call Tass . They would know . " // So our friend put in a call to Tass , the government news agency , which has offices in New York . // The sharply accented voice at the other end of the line indicated complete confusion when asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in Russian . // " I do not know , " the Tass man said . " Let me look it up and you may call back , please . " // An hour later he phoned back . The Tass man had the answer . // " It is just like the English , " he said . " Geim , set , maych . We found out from our sports authority . " Our correspondent is convinced that Tass had cabled Moscow for the answer . // In adopting a word , the Russians do n't try to translate it but apparently use it in its closest derivative form . For instance , tennis in Russian is tennis . That 's not hard , now , is it ? But the proud Russians , who would like to dominate all sports , are finding it much more difficult to translate the game of tennis itself into Russian play at a level matching international standards . // They held a tournament recently in Moscow . The Belgian Davis Cup stars , Jackie Brichant and Philippe Washer , who almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Frenchmen Paul Remy and Robert Haillet. // The Russians showed poorly . The Belgians and French beat the best the Soviets had to offer , with only a negligible number of lost games . But the Russians are stubborn . They say their youngsters will play at Wimbledon . And they will have another international tournament in Moscow this July . // Meanwhile , America 's own tennis ambassadors are busy on the international circuit . America 's Davis Cup hero , Barry MacKay , is in Egypt with Mrs. Dorothy Head Knode on a tour sponsored by the State Department . Louise Brough is in South Africa . Budge Patty and Gardnar Mulloy are in the Caribbean . So is Althea Gibson . // The world circuit gets bigger all the time  --  and now Moscow . Incidentally , our tennis correspondent adds that the word love in tennis comes from l'oeuf , meaning egg or zero in French . Wonder how they say " egg-thirty " in Russian ? Our man forgot to ask . // Point and Counterpoint // Dirty Doug Donovan , a 27-year-old professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he performs . It makes him furious enough to go around kicking old ladies in the shins and things like that . // Take the night of July 5 , 1956 , for instance . Dirty Doug was grunting and groaning his darndest in an Albany , Ore . ring . In a front-row seat sat Mrs. Euchee Benson , an enthusiastic 73-year-old widow . Somehow , in a short time , the two made contact , upon which Donovan cut loose with an anguished bellow and kicked old Mrs. Benson . // Mrs. Benson , in a suit filed later , claimed Donovan kicked her without provocation . She asked the court for $75,000 damages . // Last week in a federal courtroom in Portland , Dirty Doug did not deny the kicking . It was not the widow 's sharp tongue which had provoked him , but rather a " sharp object " with which she had stuck him in the rear . // Attorneys for Donovan introduced in evidence a two-inch needle . Police testified the needle was found on the floor near the kicking incident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a good man for the job ) put the widow 's claim to the jury . // Not a cent , said the jury . Their reasoning was clear : you can needle a wrestler , but not really . // Precedent from Kiki Cuyler // As editor for the last 15 years of the Atlanta Constitution , Ralph Emerson McGill speaks his mind with all the assurance ( and rather more than the wit ) of a Supreme Court justice . Barring an undue influence during his young manhood , indeed , Ralph McGill might even have become a Supreme Court justice . That influence turned him instead into a sportswriter and an avid baseball fan . // It happened a long time ago when young McGill was a part-time police reporter and part-time law student at Vanderbilt University in Nashville . There was a rookie outfielder on the local ball club named Kiki Cuyler . " At the crack of a bat , " wrote Editor McGill in his Sunday paper , " Kiki could turn his back on the ball and go racing back with the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was within reach he could turn and take it effortlessly . Judge Ed Seay , who taught torts , could n't do that . " // The result was that young McGill spent less and less time at school , more and more at the ball park . And if the bar lost a promising recruit , the bleachers won a firm champion . Last week , in a time of widespread pessimistic ululations about the future of the national game , McGill penned a ringing and confident challenge . // " There will be some changes , " he wrote , " but baseball will not die . It is too much a part of our lives . The minor leagues are dying out , but it should not be overlooked that there are more youngsters playing baseball today than ever before . // " In time the cities themselves , or the major leagues , will get some organization to revive semipro ball along the lines of the Little Leagues . The majors , already in an agonized process of finding new patterns , will find cities to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from baseball , can also bring them back . There is no reason , for example , why the first-or the third-base line could n't have a multiterraced parking lot from which fans could watch in their parked cars if they wished . // " All sorts of new things could be done to amuse the fans . Why , for instance , do the listeners on television get so much more information about the players , their past records and so on , than do the people who go to the game ? Baseball has been acting like the railroads in the face of competition . It has been aggrieved and plaintive , but it has n't been thinking . // " It is the game which offers the most skill , the most thrills and the most entertainment for the least money , but it will have to change with the times . " // Be a good thing , in short , if the well-fed men who run Organized Baseball could show a little of the speed and imagination of Kiki Cuyler in going back for one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // This basketball team Has scaled the heights ; It 's playing the game With satellites .  --  FRANK O'BRIEN
