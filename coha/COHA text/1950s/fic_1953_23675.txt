FF ACH spring the two sisters from Crockett would drive fifty miles to the little 4 town of Charity for their annual work on the family Writ in the Charity Cemetery . They would bring potted plants and ferns and seeds for Old Maids and Periwinkles . In the mornings they would ride from the old family house where their sister Laura lived  --  she had kept it all these years  --  to the graveyard at the edge of town . Then they would sit under the cypress trees around the big rectangle that held the generations : their father and mother Mary and William Starnes , the two Starnes grandparents , a memorial marker for their young brother , Son , killed in France in the world war and buried somewhere over there , and their baby sister who had died in the flu epidemic . Here they would talk about the early days when they were all in Charity , three generations living together in the wide family house , work in the dirt plot with spades and forks , and shape up the worn graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gone somewhere else , now , and not in graves , " and that their memory was alive in the house they had lived in . She was peculiar that way . She lived by superstitions and signs and omens . But Lucy and Mary knew that it was her feelings that kept her from thefamily graves ; she could not bear it ; Laura was the emotional one , holding to the past and still refusing to give it up . She kept it alive by living within it , in the old house where she moved about , day by day , as though all were still there . Lucy and Mary , modernized and flourishing somewhat in the growing town of progress , Crockett , Texas , and having fairly successful husbands , railroad men , chided Laura for her refusal to face the " reality of today " ; but their rcprovals had slowly weakened into an indulgence of her hidebound ways , which seemed to shame their change and was what they really wanted for themselves , and so they came to humor her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world they had lost , she presided over it , saving it and protecting it within that house so that they could re-enter it every spring : there it was , as it had always been , waiting for them when they opened the front door with its frosted pane decorated with the fancy figure of a man riding a horse with frosty mane and flourishing frosty tail . The keeping of the graves , then , was their work , the honoring gesture toward what was gone , the tending of its dirt remains , though they would not admit it , even to themselves . They regarded it as a work of plain and practical duty , they de-Glared . Laura , the spit image of her mother and the eldest of the family , living just as her mother had , as though she were continuing the life of her mother in this house , would not talk of it . - This morning they had started late , for Laura had suddenly said she would go with her sisters to the cemetery . She had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her head , holding the hairpins in her mouth and saving the combed-out wisps of hair for the hair receiver on her dresser that still held the combings of her mother 's hair and had been hers before . But an omen had happened on Or dresser : her photograph of Mama , that had one eye eaten out by something in the cedar chest where it had been stored one winter , fell face down . Laura had got up from the dresser , in a kind of spell , and had gone back to the breezeway where Lucy and Mary were waiting , holding their breath , and said , " You all better go on , I 've got some butterbeans to shell , " and turned and walked back to her bedroom with a piece of her hair hanging down . " But why do n't you pack your lunch in the old armadillo basket that Papa brought to Mama from San Antone the year they were married , " she called out . Lucy and Mary looked at each other and Lucy made the sucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame " and shook her head . Mary called back , " But you shell your butterbeans in that armadillo basket , Laura . " " I 'll use my apron , " Laura answered . T HEY packed the lunch in the basket and went off in the car . They drove along a little sadly , remarking here and there on old family houses they passed , how they were so run-down , and mentioning members that were still in them or had passed on . At the graveyard , they unloaded their tools and plants and the basket lunch and walked through the graves to the Starnes family plot . They sat down quietly on a stone . Along the horizon some clouds were trying to gather , and occasionally they thought they heard a faint moan of thunder , far away . Yet it was still cool and so they sprang to their task of digging and planting and pruning . " Mama 's grave has surely gone to seed . " one of them said . " It needs more dirt . Why we pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . He does n't do a thing as far as I can see . " " But he 's got so many graves to keep , " the other explained . " And he is old and hobbly . " " We 'll just have to keep coming up here every year to do it ourselves , " the first concluded . " I 'd rather do it anyway . Seems like it 's our duty . " " I remember when I set this old canna lily out , " Lucy said , pulling up a dry stick of a plant . " I had my hands full that summer ; two of the children sick . But it looked so red and pretty , and Mama used to have hundreds of them all over the yard . Could n't kill the old things then , and they do bloom year in and year out . " Lucy was cleaning away the lichen from the stone at the head of her mother 's grave . " Poor old Mama  --  I8 ' 74 to 1929 . Seems only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure it was cancer . You remember how her stomach bothered her all those last years . Yet she never said a word . Just went right on , day after day . I 'm sure it was a cancer . " " And then poor old Papa . Lasted hardly a year after she went . Caught the flu in the sleet and rain and just gave up , to follow her , " Mary said as she threw an old broken pot against the fence . " We ought to use metal pots , I think , These other pots just do n't last . " " You know , I think the Jasper plot is the prettiest in here . It 's the cedars that do it , always making shade . I hope you 'll all keep me in the shade after I 'm buried . It 's awful to think of lying out under the glaring sun all day , or in the rain . And a cedar smells so good . " " Yes , it does . " " And I want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like little East Texas moss roses . Or maybe Shasta daisies in the summer . " " And a good big mound , kept all round and smooth . It would kill me to think my grave was flat or all run down on one side like an old shoe . A person 's folks should keep her grave looking nice as long as they have hands to do it . " Mary whined a little . They worked silently , shadowed by the certainty that they , too , would one day have a grave of their own to . be kept . " I remember when Mama used to bring us here . I remember the great big grasshoppers , how they 'd fly like fat birds . The boys said they spat tobacco juice and that if it hit your eye , it 'd put it out . And how they warned us not to drink out of the hydrants because the water was poisoned by the dead . " " I remember the old dried flowers scattered after a rain and their sick wet smell , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on the stones . " " And the neat little graves of babies . " A sheath of silence slipped over the two , as close as a glove over the hand . They sat mute , remembering the dead little sister Mary Lou , a fragile little girl born into the epidemic when they were just young girls and died from it within the month . " Well  --  the graves . We 've a lot of work to do . " " Son . . . " Mary sadly called his name . " Remember the flag we hung in our window for him when he was over there ? And how they burned Old Man Gloom in town by the Show , to keep up the spirit . " " Wonder what his life would have been like . He was just like Papa . " " I think it will rain . That would ruin everything . " T HEY started throwing up fresh earth with their little spades . In the west , over a pack of little Negro shacks lean-ing against each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the sun to obscure it . A muffled rumbling rolled through it like a faraway wagon over an old bridge . Suddenly a weak , slack-faced little man stood out from a cypress tree and said , " Good-day , ladies . " It was Mr. Crocus . " Oh , Mr. Crocus ! " Lucy shouted and dropped her palmetto rake , a little frightened . " We are working again , you see . " " Yes , ma'am . It takes a lot of labor , you know , on these graves ; and only one old man with a bad back to do it . " " I think the Charity Cemetery looks awful , " Mary said . " I 've never seen it so run-down . " " It 's the rain , ma'am . Such a wet spring . And no one but me to do all the work . The days are gone when the politicians would throw their all-day meetings in the graveyard and the whole town would bring their lunch and weed the graves and listen to the speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's gone away now . Getting so many new dead , too . Seems like all Charity is dying . But we all have it to do . There 's old Mr. Pollup down there in the corner ; yet it seemed he would never go , and was ninety-four when he finally went . " He spat tobacco juice into a scrubby hedge . Mary thought of the grasshoppers . " Died just last Tuesday . Big funeral . And the Leslie girl , laid up so long with the paralysis . Finally crept up to her heart . Sad thing , such a young girl . That 's two , and now old Grandma Bailey tomorrow . Two niggers been digging all day over by the fence . They might quit any minute , get tired and go home and set on their porches . And if it rains we 'll never finish in time- " " Poor old Grandma Bailey gone , " Lucy said . " Laura told us . All the old ones going . Mama would have been the first to make pies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Baileys . " " Never know who 's next , " Mary declared . A low drumming of thunder ran all through the west , over the Negro houses . A black barefoot woman stood on a porch of one of them and called to her children to come in . " We have n't even eaten our lunch , Lucy , " Mary complained . " If it rains , I hope Laura closes all the windows , especially the big one by the bed with the counterpane Mama crocheted . " " Do n't worry about that , " Lucy said . " Maybe that 's not for us , that cloud , " Mr. Crocus said , looking to the west . " They must be getting it in Conroe , I expect . Maybe we 'll miss it . Lordy , I hope so . It 'll be mud everywhere . " " It 's awful , burying them in the rain , " Lucy said solemnly . " We buried Papa that way . " The cloud had , in so little time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spire of Charity Christian Church , which was directly under it now , would stick up into it and burst it momentarily . It seemed to be reaching up to try to burst it . Thunder , full-grown , cracked down upon Charity . Children shouted and ran about the Negro yards . The women were closing the windows and the wind began to ruffle the trees . In a silent second Lucy could hear the grating of the Negroes ' spades against the abrasive earth , digging for Grandma Bailey . And then a razored scythe of lighting ran quick through the cloud , there was a blast of thunder , and heavy drops of rain started falling and spattering on the stones . Lucy and Mary began to gather up their things . " It 's going to storm , " Lucy cried . The Negroes digging Grandma Bailey 's grave stopped working and started trying to erect a canvas , and old Mr. Crocus ran scurrying , his back bent . And shortly long strings of rain came down . It began to pour thick drafts of rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . T HEY sat inside the Ford coupe , after they had snapped the isinglass window flaps , puffing and looking wanly outside . After a few minutes they took the napkin off the basket and began to eat the lunch , silently . Through the streaming windows they saw the Negroes digging under the dripping canvas which bellied in the wind , but the rain was flooding down through its holes . Already there was mud on their feet . Mr. Crocus was not to be seen anywhere . Lucy arid Mary watched the rain washing over the graves and saw the rain melting down the humps of earth . The rain was falling in torrents over all the graveyard . The sky was all mist and water now , and the little Negro shacks were dreary and dripping , washed gray . They did not even look lived-in , except for the forlorn face of a Negro at a window in a shot-gun house , looking out . They sat eating their good lunch  --  which seemed wrong , since they had done so little work to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . In a while , Lucy looked out and said in a sad watery voice , watching the rain flood over the graves , " The good Lord bless all the dead , " as if she had to make up to somebody for enjoying such a good lunch of chicken and pickled peaches . Suddenly she spied an armadillo lying ridged like a big spotted conch under a crapemyrtle tree . She quickly opened the flap of her window and threw the stone of a pickled peach at him . " Shoo ! " she shamed it . And then , in the melancholy rain , the two sisters saw the armadillo shagglc hideously and as if under guilt , dragging its ratlike tail , into the family plot . They were both silent and appalled . In a moment Lucy burst from the car and ran in the rain toward the family graves , crying , " Sooey ! sooey ! " But the armadillo was nowhere to be seen . She came back , drenched , and sat wet in the car . The noon whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lunch now , yet they did not want to go . " When we 're gone , it does n't matter , " Mary finally said , quietly . " Think of all the things that come at night to a person 's grave . Ca n't afford to think of it . We 're protected somewhere else . Hold to the living , that 's what . Laura 's right riot to come . Let 's go , Lucy , to see about Laura . She 'll worry about us in the rain . " They started the car and went back through the mud and steady rain to the house . As they drove into the yard to put the car under the big shadetree , they could see that some neighbors were there , on the breezeway . When they got to the door they could not believe what Mrs. Larjen , the next-door neighbor , in her bonnet that shook on her small trembling head , was telling them , that when she had come over to see Laura a little while ago she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that when Dr. Murray had got to the house he said she was dead . Lucy and Mary found her laid out on her bed and the neighbor women already sitting around her who looked , in her fresh death , more like her mother than ever . December : Of Aphrodite W. S.
