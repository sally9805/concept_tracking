( See Cover ) <P> The executioner 's rifle cracked across Cuba last week , and around the world voices hopefully cheering for a new democracy fell still . The men who had just won a popular revolution for old ideals-for democracy , justice and honest government-themselves picked up the arrogant tools of dictatorship . As its public urged them on , the Cuban rebel army shot more than 200 men , summarily convicted in drumhead courts , as torturers and mass murderers for the fallen Batista dictatorship . The constitution , a humanitarian document forbidding capital punishment , was overridden . <P> The only man who could have silenced the firing squads was Fidel Castro Ruz , the 32-year-old lawyer , fighter and visionary who led the rebellion . And Castro was in no mood for mercy . " They are criminals , " he said . " Everybody knows that . We give them a fair trial . Mothers come in and say , ' This man killed my son . ' " To demonstrate , Castro offered to stage the courts-martial in Havana 's Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern-day Madame Defarge . <P> In the trials rebels acted as prosecutor , defender and judge . Verdicts , quickly reached , were as quickly carried out . In Santiago the show was under the personal command of Fidel 's brother Raul , 28 , a slit-eyed man who had already executed 30 " informers " during two years of guerrilla war .

The biggest bloodletting took place one morning at Santiago 's Campo de Tiro firing range , in sight of the San Juan Hill , where Teddy Roosevelt charged . A bulldozer ripped out a trench 40 ft. long , 10 ft. wide and 10 ft. deep . At nearby Boniato prison , six priests heard last confessions .

Six rebel executioners fired , and the bodies jackknifed into the grave . Two more prisoners stepped forward , then two more and two more-and the grave slowly filled . Lieut . Enrique Despaigne , charged with 53 murders , got a three-hour reprieve at the request of TV cameramen , who wanted the light of a full dawn . <P> When his turn came , Despaigne was allowed to write a note to his son , smoke a final cigarette and-to show his scorn and nerve-to shout the order for his own execution . On a hill overlooking the range , a crowd gathered and cheered as each volley rang out . " Kill them , kill them , " the spectators bellowed . As the death toll reached 52 and the pit was halfway full , one rebel muttered : " Get it over quickly . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
