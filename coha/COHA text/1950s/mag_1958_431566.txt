 | THE COLUMBIA : MIGHTIEST POWER BUILDER ON EARTH " Operating " a river , through a string of dams ? here is a brilliant creation to see at work ! CRUISING my little airplane over the Pacific Northwest , I got my first good ) k at the Columbia River . That ever , with its tributaries , is now e biggest power river on earth . dwarfs the Tennessee . And on is power is built a regional development that dwarfs the TVA . It ias brought to the Northwest the Hanford atomic works ; it powers the giant Boeing aircraft factories and the shipyards on Puget Sound ; It has attracted aluminum mills and smelters . Already it has brought a million new people to work in the Northwest , so that , iii the state of Washington , one out of three persons is now a newcomer . Throughout this region I had seen a brand-new answer to those who are afraid that we are going to run out of food , land , wood , oil or whatnot . On the plains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be almost desert . The climate has not changed , and there is no irrigation ; men have learned how to grow wheat with less rain . In the mountains of Washington I had seen modern forestry grow 50 percent more wood per acre than nature would grow unaided . I had seen the gas pipeline coming in from the " Four Corners " region , 1000 miles away , bringing fuel to this region that lacks coal and oil . The answer to the fearful is : we can now create resources ? land , trees , fuel . Now , on the Columbia River , I was seeing men , in effect , create water .  | We think of the Northwest as rainy , and full of tall , dripping pine trees , and mountainsides sloping down to the sea . That 's true for the coast ? Seattle , Tacoma , Portland . But inland rise the Cascades , a mountain barrier almost as high as the Alps . And inland of that , in its " rain shadow , " lies the Inland Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Most of it is too dry for agriculture , and some is outright desert . Across this barren plain the Columbia wanders almost unseen , most of the way in steep-cut , somber canyons hundreds of feet below the operating level of the country . A river usually appears from the air as a strip of high-intensity civilization . But the Columbia for most of its course has no cities on it , no roads or railroads following it . For long stretches , there 's not a house , not a ranch , not a field . The cause of this strange situation is not hard to discern . The Columbia is fed by the glaciers , rains and heavy snows high up in the Rockies . So it has plenty of water , plenty of power to cut its bed deeper and deeper . But the country it flows through gets little rain , has almost no streams , and is not being cut down by erosion . So , through the ages , the river has dug down , while the country has stayed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows through arid country ; and millions of acres are useless because you ca n't get the water on the land . That 's what Grand Coulee Dam is all about . It lifts the water up the plain ? economically . From the air , Grand Coulee I ) biggest concrete structure on ca looks small , graceful , even Crag down there in its canyon . Actual it is a goliath among power dams ; develops almost three million liar power . It feeds its power into t regional network of high-tension lines . But a small part of its power used to pump river-water out of t canyon up to the level of the count The water flows up the canyon-side through a bundle of 12 pipes th look like organ-pipes , each one b enough to supply all of New Yo City with water . On top , the wat goes into a vast storage lake , sever miles wide , 27 miles long . The pumping-up is done in t spring , when the river runs high and in the dead of night , when th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , irrigation draws on that storage lake , while the dam devotes full time to power-making . On an impulse , I left the river here and followed the irrigation water , to see where it was used . I followed the lake , then a canal , a length of pipeline , a canal again . It led me across one of the strangest landscapes on earth . It 's lava country , mostly black , through which run canyons that make no sense because they have no rivers in them . I saw a Niagara Falls , only three times as high and five times as broad . The horseshoe-shaped precipice , the gorge ? it was all there ,  | except the water . It was a dead waterfall , along a ghost river . This region is called the " channeled scablands " of Washington , and it explains why Grand Coulee Dam is where it is . The country has been devastated twice : first by fire ( liquid lava boiling up out of cracks in the ground ) , then by water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it overflowed its canyon and arted off sideways , across the plains i stiffened lava , seeking a new channel to the sea . This overflow what tore up the country , dug ose canyons , made that waterfall . When the ice age faded , the Columbia went back into its old course , leaving the dry river courses . The canyons are called , locally , " coulees . " The biggest of them all , Grand Coulee , is now the storage lake for irrigation water . The old water course in general now serves as an easy crosscountry route for the irrigation water . Out of old devastation we 've made a Natural Resource . On the plain where the water is used I expected to see a nice expanse of green . I was wrong . The soil worth irrigating lies in patches only , interlaced with black lava-flows , hills , stretches of sand . Here and @#  | there , a settler 's house stands on the vast somber plain , no driveway leading to it , as if it has only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? because it is . To put new land under irrigation is a tough job . You have to drain as well as irrigate . If the soil gets waterlogged , it goes wrong ? in texture or in chemistry . The first years , all you can grow is alfalfa . Its roots dig deep down and loosen up the soil and bring it to life . All this takes money . People here say you must go $25,000 in the hole before such a farm begins to pay off . It is true that you get the land itself practically free ? under a successor to the famous Homestead Act , signed by Abraham Lincoln , which once offered to any man on earth a farm in America , free . But the settler must pay off , through the years , his share of the irrigation system . And what he gets is just raw land , with water delivered at one corner by the government . The rest ? the ditches and drainage , the house , the machines ? is up to him . It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toughest part is over . Farmers are beginning to make good crops of high-value products : peas , sugar beets , canning vegetables . They are paying old hills and buying new machines . I circled the town of Othello , Wash. ? once a mere nothing along the highway ? and found it an impressive little place : big school , big agencies for cars and farm machinery , a motor court and a landing strip within walking distance of everything . Clearly a lot of people are betting a lot of money on the future of l plain . I WENT back to the Columbia River and flew its whole length . The more I saw , the more I was astounded . I had known about Grand Coulee and Bonneville Dams . But these are prewar . Since World War II a dozen new dams have I built or set under way . Even since the Korean War the power on the Columbia River system has doubled ! Soon the river will look like string of lakes , with one dam bat . ing the water right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the dams are remote , and seldom see even by Northwesterners . But fief names pop up continually in local talk : Hungry Horse , Ice Harbor Priest Rapids , Chief Joseph ( goner ally called " Chief Joe " ) , The Dalles , McNary . For the last ten years half a million dollars has been spent every day to build new dams on th Columbia . In the next ten years million dollars a day will be spcn for more dams , to keep up with th power needs of the country . Who does all this ? That 's just the point . This is a TVA without the A No central all-wise Authority runs the development . Some dams are private enterprise ; some are U. S. government ; some belong to cities , some to " Public Utility Districts , " which means essentially counties . The development runs by argument , hearings , quarrels , lawsuits , corn-AIL  | promise . " But this interferes with my power . " " It hurts my fish . " " It floods out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government , with various of its agencies Bureau of Reclamation , Fish and Wildlife , Army Engineers , the Bonneville Power Administration , Indian Affairs ; five states , each with several bureaus and commissions ; plus Canada ( the Canadian part of the river , in British Columbia , is still mostly wild ) . Senators from the Northwestern states also make their sites known . And beneath the surface there is a life-and-death struggle ween public power and private power . Despite the multiplicity of interests , the river is operated as a single entity . I say " operated . " Once you have a string of dams on a river , you ca n't just let the water run . You have open and close the gates and spillways , to take care of floods and droughts and the varying demand n- power . Main tool of operation : the Northwest Power Pool . What 's that ? There is no organization of that name , no office , no letterhead .. It 's simply the fact that 11 the power producers of the reon work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dams . Each dam feeds its power into the grid ; each city , industry , Rural Electrification District draws its power from the grid . Electrically , therefore , the Northwest is one pool . Here 's how it will work , for instance , once the new dams in Idaho are completed . In the early summer , when farmers in Idaho draw a lot of current to run irrigation pumps , the Snake River , a tributary of the Columbia , has a good flow of water . The simple thing to do would be to supply the local demand with locally made current from the local river . But at this same time of year power requirements down-river and along the coast are fairly low ; the dams down there have more river-flow than they need and must let water run over the spillways , which means waste . Pool operation combines these two situations . Idaho Power shuts down its turbines , closes its dams and supplies its local farmers with power drawn from the grid . At the same time the dams downstream open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to make up for what Idaho draws . In this way waste of water downstream is reduced , and up in Idaho , as the water level rises behind the dams , a reserve builds up . So water has been , in effect , created . There is now a mass of water up-river , ready to work , that would not have been there without this trick of management . Imagine the bookkeeping ! Both water and electric energy are borrowed back and forth between the dams , power companies , government agencies . When extra water builds up behind Dam A because Dam B works extra hard , that extra water belongs to Dam B. It is valuable property . It is stored in layers you do n't see when you look at a  | reservoir . The topmost two feet of water may belong to the XYZ company , the layer of water next below to the ' Army Engineers , the next foot under that to the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation , or the City of Tacoma . A string of dams , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new creation of man . THE TROUBLE with the Columbia is ? its water comes at the wrong time of year . It runs highest in spring and early summer while the snow is melting in the Rockies . The power needs are greatest in the winter , when all the lights and electric heaters are on . So in fall and winter , until a few years ago , when Chief Joe Dam went to work , the region had " brown-outs . " Even now the aluminum plants , attracted to the region by the cheap electricity , have to close down every winter because there is n't enough power . This is as planned ; they get their power cheap on the condition that they may be cut off . But power that is n't " firm " ? that is , available year-round ? is for most industries and households not worth having . The best way to get more power is to doctor the river to flow more evenly : to build more storage reservoirs up-river . Each gallon you can hold up-river in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it run down the river in the fall , at low-water time . And now comes the miracle of " downstream benefits . " Suppose you build a dam and powerhouse high up on the upper part of the ri Behind your dam you have a reservoir which you filled in the spri Now , at the low-water season , you draw on your own storage keep your own turbines running , you release a lot of water which flows down the river and runs through everybody else 's turbines also . At each dam downstream pc water comes as extra water . It would not be available had you not h your dam . So " your " water do extra work which that darn co not do before your dam was built . Again water has been crea where there was none before ? rather at a time when there would have been none before . " Downstream benefits " are also political headache . They are worth money . When the Army Engineers analyze a new dam project , they ways take its downstream bend into account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pay the upstream dams for benefits received . This is , of tour merely a bookkeeping transact it but without it many a federal dam would show a loss to the taxpayer . But a private-power dam can not lect f o r downstream benefits from government-owned dams . The f eral government claims it owns t river anyway , and all improvements become its property ipso facto . This is part of the grim struggle between private and public power . THE COLUMBIA , with its tributaries , was the last place in the counMIGHTIEST POWER BUILDER ON EARTH 109  | here big , unused water power still left . Now the good dam are all taken up , or spoken for dam building becomes more hive as the country develops . time after 1970 , building of s will have become so expensive I t will be more economic to add steam power plants , possibly with atomic heat . is this the end of the river development ? there 's still another twist . Steam power needs water power as t of backstop . The demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night . steam power , to be economical , is to run at a steady pace . Water power , on the other hand , lends iself to operation in spurts . When shut it down , you lose nothing : the water rises behind the dam , and is available for your next run . And a water turbine requires no warmup : just open up , and let her spin . So , in most of the United States , water power is used now to " firm up " steam power and make it more economic . When the Northwest finally goes to the same regime , it will mean that more turbines can be installed in each dam . And more power can be got from each dam , in short spurts , than it now produces in steady operation ! Used that way , Columbia River power will be more valuable than ever . That 's what I saw on the Columbia : man can create resources . There is no end to our resources as long as there 's no end to our ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
