 | Some years ago , while in bed with the flu , I found in a stock of 25-cent books brought home by my wife a mystery story called , I seem to remember , The Big Kill , by an author named Mickey Spillane . After a few dozen pages I began to smile at the amateurish efforts to make dirty words sound important . After a few more pages I flung the book across the room in revulsion . Reading about brutality , bestiality , and dirty sex might have been Mr. Spillane 's idea of recreation ; it was n't mine . To me his backdrop of blood and lust was sickeningly tedious . Moreover , the happenings in the books were unbelievable , and the writing so bad I could n't see how even a fifth grader could bear it . Unfortunately my reaction was anything but typical . People , it seemed , wanted stories with just such sex and action . And the publishers gave it to them in the shape of books by Mickey Spillane ? books calculated to " please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover blurb referred to a particularly repellent Spillane yarn . Up to now Spillane books have been bought in the amount of 125 thousand copies in regular hard-cover editions , plus some 26 million in paper-backed versions , in this country alone , and have been translated into many foreign languages . Two books , I The Jury and The Long Wait have become movies . They were released by United Artists , complete with lurid and suggestive poster art , for the edification of movie-going children of all ages . A third movie based on a Spillane book , Kiss Me , Deadly , is in production . Servicemen , housewives , teen-agers , career women , and a few college professors have become avid Spillane fans . Until the editor of this magazine asked me to have another look at the collected works of Mickey Spillane , I had forgotten about them . But it was pointed out to me that , to account for their flamboyant success , there must be something deeper in the Spillanes than just gore and dames . One typical Spillane contains seven murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in this respect it varies only in degree from much other cheap literature . Spillane , after all , has no monopoly on literary prurience or violence . So what else , I was asked , do the Spillanes have that the other shockers do n't have ? I accordingly read , on assignment , the rest of these so-called thrillers , and I am now convinced that if millions of people are reading them voluntarily the public must be losing its senses . Let me explain briefly , for the dubious benefit of those who have never been exposed to " a Spillane , " the nature of these melodramas-in-mayhem and , particularly , the character of their hero , a fictional private eye named Mike Hammer . Mike Hammer relates everything in the first person . In The Big Kill an ex-convict trying to go straight is blackmailed into joining an extortion ring and is then murdered because he knows too much . Just before being  | killed , the victim rushes into a bar carrying his year-old son , tearfully kisses the boy good-by , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outraged that the child has thus been orphaned , tells how he vengefully tracks down the murderer by means of assorted seductions , killings , and brutal torturings of his own design ? devices that would never have been available to the regular police , hidebound as they are with rules and regulations . The villain , as usual in the Spillane formula , turns out to be one of the devastatingly beautiful women with whom Mike has been intimate throughout the book . But ? not as usual ? Mike fails to kill her this time . That little chore is attended to by the orphaned toddler , who somehow has magically grown enough to sneak a gun from a table and fire it into the woman 's face . Again , in I , The Jury , after promising some twelve times during the story to do so , Mike deliberately shoots the woman murderer through her " soft white belly . " This is done so it will take her longer to die . In all the books each sex scene , each beating , each killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article are from the less offensive passages ) . Pain is glorified as an enjoyable instrument of revenge . IN MOST cases Spillane uses a kind of sandwich technique . First there is a killing , then a chapter in which Hammer beats someone up , then a sex chapter , and so on for about five cycles . Inevitably there are a dozen or so chillingly antisocial speeches . These attack the law , the police , and the jury system , and espouse the philosophy that it 's good news when a self-appointed vigilante like the detective-hero kills a criminal rather than let him stand trial . Always Spillane has the chief culprit killed either by Hammer or through Hammer 's vengeance . Notice the titles ? I , The Jury , My Gun Is Quick , Vengeance Is Mine . Never under any circumstance is the culprit punished by due process of law . It is more than a little amazing that the public , manifesting what sociological disturbance I can only guess , should respond so eagerly to this particular brand of escape reading . Vulgarity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime extolled in these accounts is a dangerous and all too familiar pattern of twisted ethics . For Spillane 's Mike Hammer does more than merely sin . He justifies his lust , violence , and abnormalities by setting himself above evil and the law , by making himself sole arbiter of what 's right for society ( and incidentally good for Mike Hammer ) , without regard to established law or the dignity of the individual . And he uses this dangerous demagoguery as a license for brutality , bestiality , and the most sordid kind of animal behavior . In other words the books appeal by direct action to every low , brutal , cruel , sadistic , lawless impulse that humanity has been trying to master for thousands of years in the effort to maintain civilization . If Spillane 's millions of readers suddenly began acting like Spillane 's detective , Mike Hammer , the Soviets could take us over without dropping a bomb ? because the U.S.A. would be in chaos .  | Granted , a great deal of lip service is paid by Spillane to conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good must triumph , and wickedness must be punished . Mike Hammer is even a great patriot ( in his own opinion ) . He loves his country with desperation , he states ? even as , with his trusty .45 or his bare hands , he is busy making a mockery of every law , principle , and ideal painfully achieved and boldly defended by hundreds of millions of Americans , living and nobly dead . To be sure , Hammer 's cold-blooded killings are of " rats , " " scum , " gangsters , hoods , dope peddlers , international spies , murderers , traitors , and prostitutes . Mike regards himself as a one-man committee to rid the world of all such blight ? by precisely such means and methods as are employed ( or said by the author to be employed ) by these same rats and scum . And here , in my opinion , is where the crime ? and success ? of Mickey Spillane begins . " By ? " ( deleted by G. H. editor ) , says Mike , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not letting the killer go through the tedious process of the law . This time I 'm the law and I 'm not going to be cold and impartial . " And on page 7 , he explains further to a police captain friend , " You 're tied down by rules and regulations . . . I 'm going to plunk one right in ( the murderer 's ) gut , and when he 's dying on the floor I may kick his teeth out . " ( The murderer later proves to be a beautiful woman , and Mike ? sure enough ! ? does " plunk one in her gut , " an easy shot , since she has stripped herself . However , possibly owing to her femininity , he gallantly refrains from kicking her teeth out as she lies dying on the floor . ) Just in case the reader does n't get the idea that Mike is a person who brooks no interference from the law , he clarifies again on page 10 : " . . . you have n't got the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't break a guy 's arm to make him talk , and they ca n't shove a guy 's teeth in with the muzzle of a .45 to remind him that you are n't fooling . " MIKE is correct . Cops ca n't do such deeds . Nobody can , in a society in which anybody ? anybody at all ? is secure . That 's what law is all about ; but Mike 's contempt of law studs the books with just such wild , childish pronouncements ? except of course when Mike happens to be in a pious mood and prattles a bit about " justice " and " this wonderful nation . " The morally sick aspect of Mike 's nature is everywhere apparent . In One Lonely Night , two unsavory barflies try to pick up Mike 's secretary , Velda , a girl whose oft-described physical charms are of a sort to lead to such an approach anywhere by anybody . Velda throws a drink in one man 's face . Mike , arriving at this juncture , hurls the man to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then trumps him by drawing " Betsy , " his trusty .45 , to take full command of the situation . The scene might well end there ? but not with selfrighteous , avenging-angel Mike Hammer . He pistol-whips the man , after he has dropped the knife , until " . . . he was a bright red mask mumbling for me to stop . " In a similar act of chivalry in My Gun Is Quick , Sir Galahad Hammer flips his cigarette in such a way that the lighted end burns the masher 's eye , then  | kicks " the wise guy in the belly , so hard he was puking his guts out before he hit the floor doubled up like a pretzel . " Even Velda , Mike 's secretary , whom he plans to marry , is not really a nice girl . She is not nice because she condones everything Mike does . And she is not nice because , now and again , she too kills ? and enjoys it , accepting Mike 's rationalization of self-defense . Now , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on a hunt for him , and when you shoot him in the back , in a dark room where he is unaware of your presence . But that 's Velda 's " self-defense . " Mike Hammer 's infantile attitude toward law and justice is not the full extent of the crime , by any means . The viewpoint on women and sex that Spillane has given Mike is equally vicious . Mike is described as big ? two hundred and thirty pounds , as I recall it . He is not a young man any longer . He is ugly . He , and everybody else , harp on his immense ugliness . He is a sloven . He rarely wears a suit that 's not seedy , unpressed , and ( though the author seems to forget this ) necessarily blood-spattered . He lives on beer , burned fried potatoes , and coffee . He drinks continually . Finally , he is scarred . His face , after the beatings and what not , would presumably look like something worked over by plastic surgeons after a gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . The insulting implication , of course , is that bestiality and ugliness actually attract a woman 's interest . The women in the narratives have two things in common : They are uniformly gorgeous , and when their eyes light on Hammer they throw themselves at him forthwith . For his part Mike is usually caused to " wet his lips " or " drool " in response . The women 's predatory techniques are preposterously untrue to life . But Spillane describes them with such vulgar zeal that his intent could only be to provide an animalistic , if vicarious , satisfaction for at least a portion of his readers . If Mike Hammer were simply a seducer , his chronicles could be dismissed as servant-girl trash . However , his women are degraded ; they seduce Mike ( though he once confessed he likes to do a little of the chasing himself ) ; the ladies usually wind up with a " slug in their guts , " placed there on occasion by Mike ; finally , Mike more often than not walks away from such dulcet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike 's courtship , for he hardly ever touches a girl without hurting , bruising , or mashing her , and his girls frequently bite and claw . Is it reaching for conclusions to suspect that the weak-minded boys who may become our future sex maniacs and torture-thrill slayers are being " briefed " by such stuff ? THE sex in these books , in short , is not normal . Except for the insane and the emotionally ill , men and women do not derive pleasure from hurting or frustrating their partners . Women do not generally rip off their own clothing at the first sight of a man , ugly or not . Women are not attracted by cruelty ; they are repelled . And very few rational women take drooling as a true compliment . The man who created Mike Hammer , and who presumably endorses his philosophies , is thirty-six years old , a former Air Force captain ( non-combat ) and flying instructor , the son of a Brooklyn bartender , the husband of a Mississippiborn wife , and the father of two small children ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lives and works in a drab-looking one-story house , built mostly with his own hands , on a fouracre plot near Newburgh , New York , about 60 miles up the Hudson River from New York City . INANCIALLY free to pursue any way of life he chooses ? owing to the fact that so many people like to read about Mike Hammer ? Mickey Spillane 's choice is simple , inexpensive , and avowedly low brow . He intends to base permanently in the little house in Newburgh ( " No more of that city stuff for me . This is really livin ' " ) , although last year he took time out to appear in a Hollywood movie about circuses . He has a valuable collection of guns , contributed in part by admiring readers , and spends a good deal of time in shooting . Target shooting only , curiously enough . He refuses to kill anything and will not permit animals to be hunted on his property . He likes to fence and does so whenever he can find an opponent good enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trampolin performer . He tinkers with a hot rod , and he participates regularly in nearby stock-car races . He has a ready contempt for anyone or anything that could possibly qualify as " long hair . " This includes literary critics who decry the vulgarity in his books while praising Faulkner , Hemingway , and Steinbeck for describing the same things " more artistically . Some interviewers have found that Spillane personally holds what he deems to be the " little guy 's view of things , that he is impatient at legal delays and bureaucratic obtuseness and sympathetic with the small citizen who tries vainly to buck " the system . " This attitude is plainly reflected and magnified in Mike Hammer 's ruthless disregard for due process of law . There is , however , no actual evidence that Mickey Spillane holds any attitude save indifference to the social implications in his books . He has never publicly attempted to justify them beyond repeating , " Nobody likes my work except the public . I 'm not an author and never pretended to be . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for . " We might be able , as grown-up readers , to follow with interest the doings of Spillane 's homicidal moral coward ( as a sort of case history ) if the books were brilliantly written or if the stories themselves were well contrived . The very opposite is the case . Spillane depends on the blood that drenches his sadistic pages ? the cries of agony , cadavers , and grue ? to keep the reader going . It may be that , if he wished to , Mickey Spillane could write quite well . But he never takes the trouble in these slatternly stories . His grammar and usage , for one thing , are atrocious . He uses a good many words he does not actually know the meaning of . For instance : " He was still trying to rehabilitate himself to civilian life . " What Spillane meant was " adjust . " Ignorance of that kind is inexcusable in anyone who calls himself a writer , commercial or otherwise . When Spillane needs a fact , he invents one . His failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plots often leaves an intelligent reader in total disillusionment . And he likes to wind up with what he deems a " big " climax , but frequently his naivete makes these smash scenes ridiculous . For example , at the climax of One Lonely Night , a man who has been running for the Senate ? and one his enemies tried long and hard to " get " something on ? proves to be an escaped lunatic impersonating a twin brother who did n't look like him at all . How the whole world could miss that fact and Mike Hammer alone could hit upon it , I shall never be able to understand . Neither will anybody else who has the mind of an average twelve-year-old . How can " millions " of readers swallow such clear and present junk ? So much for the literary merit of Mickey Spillane . In my opinion , however . the real crime of Mickey Spillane is a far more serious one than literary incompetence . The crime of Mickey Spillane is that too many people are beginning to " think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a good thing ! To found a government or even private feelings on Mike Hammer 's philosophy would accomplish in no time what the communists abroad intend to achieve with ? if necessary ? H-bombs ; the utter ruin of freedom , human rights , capitalism , and us . From that standpoint Mike Hammer is like an enemy agent , a real foe of us all ; and he is that because he is afraid , a moral coward . WHAT is the antidote ? Not suppression . vv certainly , nor book burning . That is the way Mike Hammer would attack his targets , by violent , unreasoning force . What is necessary is more education . more attention to the mental health of everybody , and a wider dissemination of truth ? not a spotty , futile repression of evil . What America needs ? and already has to some extent if you stop to think about it ? is millions upon millions of citizens who , if forced to read a Spillane , would react with annoyed ridicule . The fact that a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books are good reading : it merely means that some people in fairly high places have bad taste in books and a latent infantilism , The remedy lies in ourselves . If we did n't buy Spillanes , the publishers would n't print them . We are not children , compelled to buy something because , like Mount Everest , " it is there . " If the publishers could n't find buyers for their books , Spillane would be obliged to reform and write better ones ? or give up writing ? which describes the only good method of censorship . Certainly the publishers , the long-established E. P. Dutton &; Co. and The New American Library of World Literature ( Signet paperbacks ) , sin more than a little in calling these postgraduate courses in depravity " good reading . " Good reading ? to use a phrase far too mild for Spillane ? in a pig 's eye . The crime of Mickey Spillane , to put it in another way , is that he stands in contempt of humanity . And a man in contempt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing but contempt for himself . Is it possible to fall any lower than that ? Come on , Spillane . Let 's see you write one about a real man who has real guts !
