Even the eyes of Texans popped a little last week at the size of the deficit run up by the National Football League 's fledgling Dallas Texans , successors to the defunct and debt-ridden New York football Yankees . After two months of the season , the Dallas club was almost $250,000 in the red . <P> The franchise had been transferred to Dallas this year with notable hullabaloo . Texans , priding themselves on the biggest and best of everything , foresaw a bright future for their professional team with an estimated 1,000,000 fans to draw from . In theory , all that the 16 owners of the $100,000 Dallas franchise needed to do was draw crowds of 24,000 a game to break even . Anything above that figure would be gravy . In practice , as the outmanned Dallas team lost seven straight league games , attendance dropped off to 12,000 a game . <P> Last week , unable to finance the team for the remainder of the season , the Dallas owners dumped the whole mess back in the lap of N.F.L. Commissioner Bert Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing on the road . Texans who have been clamoring loudly for the transfer of a major-league baseball franchise ( e.g. , the St. Louis Cardinals ) clearly had good reason now to restudy that project .
