The sun shone bright on old Kentucky homes , the meadows were in bloom , and the birds were making music all the day . But most Kentuckians could hardly no tice or hear last week above the political din that filled the state . Albert Benjamin Chandler , 57 , Kentucky 's governor in 1935-39 and U.S. Senator in 1939-45 , was noisily on the comeback trail ( TIME , April 11 ) . " Happy " Chandler was wowing the voters everywhere with his own special brand of political minstrelsy . His opponent for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , Judge Bertram T. Combs , 43 , of Prestonsburg , was still campaigning in a sober , solemn fashion that failed to win many laughs but was clearly winning some sober , solemn votes . <P> " Wetherbine " &; " Clementine . " Happy 's technique varied only slightly as he stumped from town to fish fry to camp meeting . Generally , he was preceded by a sound truck , blaring songs and the repeated injunction : " Be like your pappy and vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were tapping out the rhythms , the candidate himself rolled up in a big black car , grinning and waving , pumping outthrust hands . After his speech - always approximately the same ( " It 's won for me-why should I change ? " ) - Happy rang down the curtain with a song , usually There 's a Gold Mine in the Sky . <P> With the occasional aid of stage props ( including a horse and pet monkey ) , Chandler lampooned his opponents without mercy and with considerable corn . His chief targets : Governor Lawrence Wetherby ( " Wetherbine " ) and Senator Earle Clements ( " Clementine " ) , the acting majority leader of the U.S. Senate and absentee Democratic boss of Kentucky . Happy has made much of a rug in Wetherby 's office , which he says cost $20,000 , and of an $863,200 bill for air-conditioning the state Capitol . <P> Wetherby produced an invoice to prove that the rug cost only $2,720 , and pointed out that the $863,200 paid for a new heating plant for the Capitol , plus wiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air conditioning . But Happy paid no attention . " Did you ever see a $20,000 rug ? " he asked his audiences . " When I get elected , you all come to Frankfort , and we 'll take our shoes off and walk on it . " <P> Chandler treats Combs with contempt , never refers to him by name ( " Of course , Clementine picked this unsuspecting little fellow to run for governor " ) . Chandler described Wetherby as a spendthrift tosspot , dangling on Clements ' string : " Clementine just picks up his telephone in Washington and tells that little Hitler down in Frankfort what to do . " <P> " Cold &; Embalmed . " In retaliation , the Clements-Wetherby forces have hit hard at Chandler , bringing up the free swimming pool a contractor once installed ( 1942 ) in U.S. Senator Chandler 's back yard , and producing some damning canceled checks , totaling $32,841,40 , which Happy received from a liquor wholesaler at a time when he was Senator and baseball 's high commissioner . For a while Lawyer Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's checks , finally got the company 's former president to declare that they were legitimate fees for legal services . The nature of the services has never been explained .
