" We 're free , we 're incorporated , and we 're the eleventh largest city in the state of Washington , " shouted the master of ceremonies one evening last week , as 2,000 residents of Richland ( pop . 23,000 ) gathered to watch a simulated atomic explosion and a bonfire lit by an atomic fuse . Cause for celebration : after 15 years as a company town servicing the big-secret plutonium works known as the Hanford Atomic Project , Richland had voted itself out from under the paternalistic wings of the Atomic Energy Commission and General Electric , prime AEC contractor . And the vote had carried in the face of upcoming difficulties for the town . <P> Welfare 's Cocoon . After the war , Richlanders , on the face of it , never had it so good . The city had no slums , no unemployment , no parking meters , no taxes . It boasted a shopping center , a hotel , nine schools , 28 churches , a library , a 109-bed hospital . Three-bedroom apartments rented for $35 a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed the tightness of their welfare-city cocoon . No family could own its home . Not general necessity but General Electric determined the site of stores and set their rents . Police , firemen , even the city librarian were G.E . employees . More and more , Richland residents began to move out to nearby Pasco and Kennewick to own their homes and chat over the fence with non-G.E. neighbors . But not everyone in Richland was inclined to make a break . In 1955 a petition for incorporation as an independent municipality lost 3 to 1 . <P> The dogged one-fourth who wanted escape from the programed life , however expensive it might prove to be , stepped up their campaigning , got valuable assistance from their official landlords . When a federal law was passed allowing residents of the atomic cities of Richland and Oak Ridge , Tenn. to buy property , G.E . happily put 4,800 homes on the market , sold all but 600 , followed up by selling commercial property also . After another petition for incorporation was circulated , Richlanders poured out last July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxation . Last week , watching the formal presentation of the city charter by Governor Albert Rosselini , Richlanders recognized that there was many a problem ahead . G.E . paid its city employees wages 30% to 40% higher than scales in neighboring communities ; Richland must meet the rate or possibly lose them . Although the city is bond-free and takes title to debt-free city hall , sewage plant and waterworks , its tax yield at the start will be too small to meet expenses . The Hanford atomic plant is beyond city limits and untaxable ; property , liquor and gasoline taxes will be $250,000 less than the $2,500,000 annual budget unless services are cut back or taxable new industry and homeowners arrive . Nevertheless , Richland is optimistic . <P> Explained Mrs. Pat Mettil , 35 , mother of four , and elected by the new city council to be the first mayor of the city : " We always looked forward to self-government . We thought American citizens had a right to make their own mistakes . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
