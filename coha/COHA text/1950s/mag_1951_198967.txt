Few U.S. citizens know much about Creole Petroleum Corp . Yet this U.S.-owned enterprise is the world 's No. 2* oil producer . From 2,422 wells across Venezuela , Creole sucks up an average daily flow of 750,000 barrels of black crude , worth about $1,500,000 . In the 30 years since it sank its first well , Creole has invested $767 million , and the investment has paid off handsomely . On recent annual grosses of around $500 million , Creole creamed off some $155 million in profits after taxes . Alone , it accounts for more than a third of the consolidated net income of its parent &; owner , Standard Oil Co . ( N.J. ) , the world 's largest oil organization . <P> Creole did not always belong to Jersey . The name was engraved originally on the shares of a stock promotion of the ' 20s called the Creole Syndicate , which had concessions on an expanse of shallow water in Lake Maracaibo , in western Venezuela , covering a tremendous oil reservoir . Jersey bought control of the syndicate , combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched holes into Lake Maracaibo 's bottom from specially developed drilling barges . Now there are 2,000 lake wells , each a little steel-and-concrete island separated by a strip of water , forming one of the world 's great industrial spectacles . <P> 50-50 Profits . Creole is not only a giant producer . It is also a pioneer in the sensitive field of international public relations . Like Britain 's ill-fated Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. , it is a foreign-owned enterprise within a technically backward state , vulnerable to the 20th Century 's upsurge of nationalism . It has met the danger by a policy of 1 ) equality with Venezuela in profits and 2 ) concern for Venezuelan personnel . <P> " The oil in the soil of Venezuela belongs to Venezuela . . . " says a Creole policy directive . " By means of an arrangement that is mutually profitable to Venezuela and ourselves , we are converting the country 's greatest natural resource into the country 's greatest source of income . This brings us into a partnership <P> . . . " Creole in 1948 accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . <P> Chance for the Native . Creole 's program to integrate itself with the life of Venezuela includes these main items : <P> Employment of qualified Venezuelans in preference to non-Venezuelans wherever possible . All but 7% of Creole 's 14,544 employees are Venezuelans . <P> Compulsory lessons in Spanish for all employees who do not know the language . Housing , schools , hospitals and cradle-to-grave welfare measures for all employees . <P> Cultural contributions , including expensive relief maps for the schools and hundreds of scholarships . <P> The company 's personnel program has just paid off in a notable promotion for its most notable native employee : Guillermo Zuloaga , 47 , brilliant geologist and administrator , elevated this month to Creole 's board of directors . Stocky , incisive Zuloaga , who earned a Ph.D . at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , taught geology in Caracas ' Central University and set up the government bureau known as the Ministry of Mines &; Petroleum . Then , in 1939 , Zuloaga went to work for Creole as assistant chief geologist .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
