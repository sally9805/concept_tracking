txt Comments on the Far East Crisis WALDO CHAMBERLIN , MARY KELLOGG.WERNER LEVI.PERCY LAWRENCE MILLER , M.D.HORACE S ... Comments on the Far East Crisis Full Mobilization To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The present agonized confusion would - be materially eased and we could get on about the terrible business before us if the President of the United States would tell us what is the situation that confronts us , as we have not been told to date . For example , he could tell us that : The United States is at war with the Soviet Union . We are engaged in the early stages of a new kind of war , quite different from what we have traditionally understood war to be . Until June 25 we mistakenly believed that peace existed between the two countries , albeit a very troubled peace ; The United States is at war with the People 's Republic of China . This is not a new kind of war but rather a version of the old-fashioned " undeclared " war about which we should have learned so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor . If the President told us that these two statements describe the present situation , we could then do what a people does when it decides to prepare for a war  --  which exists ; rather than continue the agonizing process of trying to think up appropriate courses of action to use in a time of peace  --  which does not exist . On Dec. 5 the President is reported to have told the Mid-Century White House Conference on Children and Youth that " this struggle engages all our national life , all our institutions , all our resources . For the effort of the evil forces of communism to reach out and dominate the world confronts our nation and our civilization with the greatest challenge in our history . " How many of us believe that " all our national life , all our institutions , all our resources " are being used against " the greatest challenge in our history " ? It is difficult to understand how they can be so used without complete military , economic , social and moral mobilization . If the danger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that it is  --  we have no choice but to begin immediately to make those sacrifices which full mobilization entails . Once the decision for full mobilization is made we can concentrate our thinking on means of conducting this new kind of war which the Soviets have unleashed on the world . The Russians are no smarter than we are and we too can devise new methods of fighting this new kind of war . In the meantime we will be making adequate preparations for the old-fashioned variety of war if , or when , it comes . WALDO CHAMBERLIN , Professor of Government , New York University . New York , Dec. 7 , 1950 . Use of Atom Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : How hard it would be for other nations to believe in our peaceful intentions , if we dropped the atom bomb . This , we all agree , is the most cruel and devastating of all weapons . It can not help but kill and injure not only the foe against whom it would he directed but countless civilians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful propaganda that can be directed against us to point out that we are callous warmongers . Utilizing such a weapon would also , of course , invite a most terrible retaliation against us . Let us continue our - atomic research , let us have enough of these bombs to make us strong enough to discourage others from the attack , but , in the name of humanity , let us not be the first , this time , to use the atom bomb . MARY KELLOGG . Orient , N. Y. , Dec. 4 , 1950 . Our Formosa Policy To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The critical Far Eastern situation is viewed by many Indians as not altogether due to the aggressive policy of Russian or Chinese communism . They feel that the United States contributed its share , especially by the support of reactionary Governments and the failure to stimulate social progress in areas under its control . Their desire for neutrality is often explained not as an unwillingness to take sides but as a refusal to pursue democratic aims with the inept methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might improve the situation considerably . It may have little effect upon China 's policy but it would raise our prestige in Asia greatly . It would strengthen the hands of those who agree with our aims but can not second our policy in view of our despised support of Chiang Kai-shek . Also , many Indians feel that such a gesture , not merely talk , is necessary to allay Chinese fears of American aggression . While they are convinced that Russia is the motor of China 's policy , they nevertheless think that China 's fears are understandable and facilitate Moscow 's game of driving Peking into 1 desperate actions . WERNER LEVI . Delhi , India , Nov. 29 , 1950 . Task of Free Men To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Once again we face a situation similar to that faced by the western world in 1939 . The motives of the United States during the past five years have been the motives held by all peace-loving peoples of the world , resulting in the pitiful state of military unpreparedness when last we faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union during this same period ? From their every action it would seem that our erstwhile allies have not the slightest interest in the maintenance of peace . Every constructive effort made by the United Nations has been met with the most flagrant obstrucDiplomacy Not Appeasement To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Editorials and news columns in your paper are filled with wonder and chagrin over the hatred displayed toward us by the Chinese people , with whom we claim to have had for years the friendliest of relations . It seems that Russian propaganda is the only way to explain it : Even now we back Chiang . Men in prominent places advocate action . on our part to reinstate him . When we remember the indignation felt by the North against England for her aid to the South in the Civil War  --  so insignificant compared to our aid to Chiang  - -  we can surely understand why all former affection for the United States has been lost and hatred has taken its place . Again , it is we who insist on treating China as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People 's Republic , " who oppose her entrance into the United Nations , who declare that she should be summoned ' to Lake Success , not invited , who show ourselves unwilling to treat her envoys with even ordinary courtesy . As for Korea , let us make a supreme effort to put ourselves in their place , and imagine how we would feel if civil war broke out in Mexico , and Russia moved in to restore " order and freedom . " China is as close to Korea as we are to Mexico , and Russia is not as distant from Mexico as we are from Korea . Maybe this comparison is absolutely unfair , but in Chinese eyes it is perfectly fair and we are trying to understand the Chinese . We refuse to take Russian propaganda seriously , we demand from them acts , not words . Yet we expect the Chinese to believe the Voice of America even if our acts seem to contradict our words when we profess devotion for freedom for all peoples and give help not only to the hated Chiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a French puppet , defending colonialism against his nation 's war for freedom . We ask them to believe we are fighting for freedom in Korea , and then we . reinstate Syngman Rhee , whom they regard as an old-time autocrat , Is it not time to look at their point of view and to try to find common ground with them ; in other words , to use diplomacy instead of an exchange of accusations and insults ? It seems that we have given diplomacy a new name . It is now " appeasement " and contemptible . But the sword-rattling , the world-wide " containment " do not seem to work . Had the Chinese been sitting in at the conferences of the U. N. , meeting face to face with the rest of us and treated with the courtesy and respect that used to obtain in international conferences , it is possible that an accord might have been reached . THEohoitE S. KENYON . New York , Dec , 4 , 1950 . A Student 's Views To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Times , and wonder bow many of them come from peoplie m. age . At my college there has been a fanatical desire for peace . This has taken the form of petitions and letters to the President , . Secretary Trygve Lie and various newspapers . Can we do more ? Marks have fallen off at school almost 50 per cent because students feel no necessity for an education when faced with the prospect of a war . What good are our ideas , which apparently hold no weight with the policy makers ? Why struggle to learn when our efforts must go to physical and not mental force ? Will people heed letters such as this , begging for peace , from an idealistic youth who may have to inherit a ravaged world ? It must be realized that America 's prestige in the world community is considerably lower than it was during the war . This is a world not of one great nation but of many great nations , and we must pay careful attention to their ideas . Can we not swallow our national pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediation and concession ? JOANNA Litl'INCOTT . Brom:vine , N. Y. , Dec. 6 , 1950 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is galling enough for honorable nations to dignify the insolent statements of the Chinese Communist Government by the slightest recognition ; however , the United Nations forces are presently being subjected to attacks by the Chinese Communist armies . Peiping propaganda is making small pretext of cloaking these operations under a thin veil of so-called volun tary assistance to the North Koreans . Coupled with this is the vilification of the United States . The prowess and strength of the Chinese Communist armies is beyond question . There is no quarrel with them or their Government ; there is no threat of invasion to their country or question of usurping their rights and interests in the Yalu River installations . A bold counter-action by the United Nations , backed by the fullest support , is urgently needed . It is respectfully suggested that a United Nations mission capable of decision and action , together with sufficient technical and military advisers , be dispatched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border , The mission 's avowed purpose should be to settle the issues directly with the Chinese Communist Government in Peiping . It is felt that , if done properly , with a deluge of publicity , and if the mission is kept isolated from the actual war zone , the Chinese Communist Government may be prevailed upon to admit them and permit examination and investigation of their case . If entry is not permitted , it appears nothing will oe lost and the additional proof of Communist intentions can be exploited . JOHN R. SIIONNARD . Upper Montclair , N. J. , Dec. 4 , 1950. tionism ; indeed , the free peoples of the world have been vilified and accused ; actually made to defend themselves against the wild rantings that have passed for debate in the United Nations . Is n't it about time that we really began to meet these tactics with a worthy zounter-offensive ? Will it take another  --  and much more disastrous  --  Pearl Harbor incident to make us realize that we must mobilize our strength ? We need a full-strength intelligence and counter-intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bring about the realization that the world must live in peace , then our heritage of freedom and security is not worthy of defense . Such a program would not be easy . We enjoy what we have today because those who came before us were ready to sacrifice even their lives to secure it for us . Our task today is of much greater magnitude . We must secure the world to make it safe for those who come after us . PERCY LAWRENCE MILLER , M. D. Bradley Beach , N. J. , Dec. 6 , 1950 . Cease-Fire or Atom Bomb To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial " Mr. Atlee and the Bomb " is a sound , sober and logical appeal to reason . All Americans will agree with you that " the atomic bomb is the ultimate weapon to be used as a last resort  --  to save an army . " etc . At this writing an army is threatened with disaster . Should we not squarely face the situation , admit our terrific blunder , " write off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next endeavor to negotiate with the Chinese Reds for complete evacuation of our forces , including the release and return of all prisoners ? If they refuse to cease fire and negotiate , should we not use atom bombs without delay to extricate our men and avoid a Dunkerque de-bade ? Along with our own casualties and to a lesser degree the humiliation and loss of prestige and standing among the small nations of the world , the most terrible consequence of this fiasco into which our political and military leaders have pushed us is the total abandonment of our friendly North and South Korean allies to Communist murderers . HORACE S. STEWART . Bangor , Me. , Dec. 7 , 1950 . U. N. Mission Proposed Decision on Bomb To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The decision of whether or not to employ the atomic bomb should rest exclusively with field commanders in Korea and should be based upon military requirements and strategy . The decision of whether to employ the bomb should not rest with politicians in Washington and London and be based upon a phony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y. , Dec. 5 , 1950 . No U. N. Seat To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The American people , now bearing the brunt of the sacrifices in this new war , want to see plainly stated the case in favor of admitting Communist China to the U. N. We want to see it in print . ( And a lot of other things now hidden away from the voting taxpayers . ) Mrs. HARVEY E. Fisk . New York , Dec. 5 , 1950.
