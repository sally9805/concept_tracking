What Happened to the Magic of Childhood ? The thing is , I do n't understand what kids do with themselves any more . I have two boys of my own , I live in a suburb where three out of three fathers are up to here with catching that commuting train and paying that mortgage and burning those leaves and shoveling that snow , and when all else is indefensible , say , " But it 's a wonderful place to raise children . " Spock and Gesell and others of that Ilg are the local deities ; the schoolteachers speak of that little stinker from Croveny Road as " a real challenge " ; there are play groups and athletic supervisors and Little Leagues and classes in finger painting and family counselors and child psychologists . Ladies who do n't know ad hoc from a posteriori carry the words " sibling rivalry " in the pocketbooks of their minds as faithfully as their no-smear lipstick . And yet , I was with a bunch of kids a week ago , ranging in age from ten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them seemed to know what to do for the next fifteen minutes , I said to them , " How about a game of mumbly-peg ? " And can you believe that not one of these little siblings knew spankthe-baby front Johnny-jump-the-fence ? Nor do they seem to know anything at all about the other really important things of this world , like horse chestnuts , or corduroy knickers , or the difference between an immie and a , ; lassie , or what you do with the kind of baseball that used to he called a " nickel rocket . " have a feeling that even then inflation was on us and is nickel rocket cost ten cents . The first thing you did with a nickel rocket was to nip into somebody 's garage and hook a roll of friction tape . If the garage was dark enough , for a minute or an hour you would grab the end of the tape and pull it back quickly and see the blue sparks . None of my teachers told me about static electricity . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that anybody but me knows about it to this day . Some kid found out that if you pulled the end of the tape back quickly , you saw blue sparks . Some kid told some other kid , and some other kid told some other kid . When we got tired of watching the sparks , we wrapped the nickel rocket with friction tape . I guess I know now that the reason we did this with the nickel rocket was that if by any wild chance one of us had got a solid hit , the ball would have come apart . But that 's not the point . There was no reasoning going on then . You wrapped a nickel rocket with friction tape because that 's what you did with a nickel rocket . The kids I see playing baseball these days are in something called the Little League and have a covey of overseeing grownups hanging around and bothering them and putting catcher 's masks on them and making it so darn important that the kids do n't even know about one o ' cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I understand that , in the Little League , kids cry when they lose a game . Nobody ever cried in our baseball games unless he caught a foul tip with the end of his finger or unless someone slang the bat and caught the catcher across the shins with it . That same passel of child-directed grownups seems to have got its mitts on immies , because the only time I see kids playing immies these days is in the newsreels when they 're holding the national marble championships . What kind of an insanity is this ? Any kid on my block who called an immie a marble would have been barred from civilized intercourse for life , and who cares who 's marble champion of the world ? The problem is : who 's the best immie shooter on the block ? I 'll bet a hat the rules are written down in a book . On my block , the rules were written down in kids . The rules were that as soon as the ground got over being frozen , any right-minded kid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground at an angle of forty-five degrees and walked around it with his right foot until there was a hole of a certain size . What size ? The size of an immie hole . Then you drew a line with your toe a certain distance from the hole . How far away from the hole was the line ? The proper distance . Then , to start , you stood behind the line and threw immies , underhand , at the hole . There was a kid who moved from another town who said this was " lagging , " but we did n't pay much attention to him . We did n't call it that on our block . We did n't call it anything . We just did it . There 's a lot more to immies , like fins , or fens , and knucks down , and if it was fair to wiggle your feet while you were doing fins , or fens , and the legality of steelies and the value February 9 , 1957 What Happened to the ( Continued from Page 1 explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poison that killed , not only on contact , ambody who was foolhardy enough to open it , but it would strike dead , on the whole block , every person , cat , collie dog , It could also wither trees and probably melt the pavement . I do n't know things now like I used to know then . What we knew as kids , what we learned from other kids , was not tentatively true , or extremely probable , or proved by science or polls or surveys . It was so . I suppose this has to do with ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . We were savages , we were in that stage of the world 's history when the earth stood still and everything else moved . I wrote on the flyleaf of my schoolbooks , and apparently every other kid in the world did , including James Joyce and Abraham Lincoln and , I am sure , Tito and Fats Waller and Michelangelo . in descending order my name , my street , my town , my county , my state , my country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar system .

Damn Captain Video ! Once again , it 's because we grownups arc always around pumping our kids full of what we laughingly call facts . They do n't want science . They want magic . They do n't want hypotheses . They want immutable truth . They want to be , they should be . in a clearing in the jungle . painting themselves blue , dancing around the fire and making it rain by patting snakes and shaking rattles . It is so strange ; nobody , so far as I know , sat around worrying about the insides of our heads , and we made ourselves safe . Time enough to find out , as we are finding out now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then : facts , facts , facts . If you cut yourself in the web of skin between your thumb and forefinger , you die . That 's it . No ifs or buts . Cut . Die . Let 's get on to other things . If you cat sugar lumps , you get worms . if you cut a worm in half , he does n't feel a thing , and you get two worms . Grasshoppers spit tobacco . Step on a crack , break your mother 's back . Walk past a house with a quarantine sign , and do n't hold your breath , and you get sick and die . Cigarettes stunt your growth . Some people are double-jointed , and by that we did n't mean any jazz like very loose tendons or whatever the facts are . This guy had two joints where we had one . An Essex  --  if your family happened to own an Essex  --  was the best car in the whole world . We cut our fingers in that web and did n't die , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't recall getting worms , but the fact was still there . We 'd pass by the next day and both halves of the worm would be dead , our mother 's back never broke , my sisMao-ic of'Cliildhood ? ter had scarlet fever right in my own house and I MUM have breathed once or twice in all that time , and we really knew 111111 what came out of the grasshopper was not tobacco juice . lint facts were one Thing and beliefs were another . For example , the grownups believed the year was divided into months . Nonsense . When I was a kid , the year was divided into times . There was a time when you played immics . There was a time when you played sloop hall . There was a time when you built kites . There was a time when you made parachutes out of a handkerchief and some string and a rock . There was it time when you played football . There was a time when you played Red Rover , and statues , and oneand-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lverybody did it . It was like the trees coming into green , There was something that clicked and the gears shifted , and we all gut up in the morning and put our immics in our pockets be- 93 cause that was the day everybody started to play immics . And when the immie season was over , we all knew it . We did n't even talk about it . It was just the end of the immie season , and one morning we stopped playing immies and started making kites . We went to school , and we knew we were supposed to grumble about it , so we did , although if we had been put on the rack , I think we would have admitted it was not bad  --  just different , It was not , however , like school is now . School was school , and not-school was not-school . Our teachers did not understand us  --  they taught us . We did not , ordinarily , love them  --  we learned from Ilion , School was it creation of grownups , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we appeared in school , we were frisked . We were searched for the carrying of concealed dirt under the nails ; we were required to have , in lieu of an identification card , one clean handkerchief . I wonder , parenthetically , whether kids nowadays know the meaning of the phrase " Is it for show or for blow ? " This handkerchief was for show , it was a passport , and it did n't matter a great deal how grimy it was ; by law it was clean if it was folded and unblown in . Now , that was what you had to have . If , in addition , you bore any livestock , wittingly Or not , you were in the toils of authority . 1 for one , fell madly in love with a little girl who came from the wrong side of the tracks because she smelled so wonderful . She smelled of kerosene . Our teacher , walking down the aisle , had run a pencil through her hair , as she did to all of us  --  why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ; Rose had been packed off to the school nurse ; Rose had come hack smelling gloriously of kerosene . I loved the smell of kerosene . Rose smelled of kerosene . I loved Rose . She was an involuntary smuggler , but others were criminals by volition and were dealt with in open court . Other livestock , such as caterpillars , large beetles and small toads , were , if detected , carried outside by you , deposited somewhere in the yard , and later on you were kept after school . Knives were confiscated , not to be returned , if they became visible during school hours . This was more of The Law . You could have a knife in your pocket . You could carry the knife to school in your pocket . You could keep your hand on your knife in your pocket during school . But if that hand came out of that pocket with that knife and was seen by your teacher , you were summonsed , you marched to the desk , you put the knife on the desk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our school who openly and avowedly loved children . We found this out and made life miserable for her . She also loved literature , and taught us to do the same . I had discovered , at , I guess , about age nine , Mark Twain . I understand there are some people who do not believe that Mark Twain was a god , but number me not among these heretics . It was balm to my soul to discover him . because I had previously thought that James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving were supposed to be writers . The day I found Mark Twain 's essay about the literary offenses of Cooper was the day l came of age , whatever the vital statistics say . It was unfortunately about then that this wonderful teacher told the class that by such and such a date we would be expected to have read The Pathfinder . I rose to my feet and declined to do so . On direct examination , I averred that the reason I would not do so was that I had tried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most moderate terms my belief that he was not a very good writer . I said he was a lousy writer and I would not read him . After a brief recess and the clearing of the courtroom , I was induced to add that Mark Twain thought so too . I was informed by the judge that , my objections notwithstanding , I was banished from school , and I could not return until I had opened my mind sufficiently to admit the possibility of giving Cooper a second chance . I did not feel that he deserved that of me . It is always the fact that in all the crises of a child 's life , he can remember where it happened , the names of all the participants , the events leading up to the crime , the sentencing , but never the execution . What happened after that , I do not know , but I know that my parents were not summoned to the school , that I did not stay home even one whole day  --  there would have been no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the school , that I went on loving and plaguing the teacher , and that I never read The Pathfinder . Nor will I do SO 110W. .1 ) Dut the point was , then , that if the teacher said yes and the kid said no , the kid knew what was going to happen next . There were rules . If there 's anything in the world kids need , it 's rules . When I was a kid , we honest to God did the business of drawing a line on the ground and if a kid wanted to fight , he had a choice  --  to step over the line or not . There it was . No more arglebargle . Step over the line , and pow . Or stay on your side of the line . Keep the knife in your pocket in school and keep it , Take it out and lose it . Come in the house this minute , or straight to bed when I catch you . When my kids were smaller , their mother and I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , permissive upbringing . We privately , or at least I privately , thought it was a crock , particularly when 1 observed that my firstborn had permission to take his bottles at any time , provided those times were two , four , six , two  --  or whatever hours they were . And his nap was entirely at his discretion as long as it was when his parents were totally exhausted . He soon learned that he could do anything he wanted as long as what he wanted was what we wanted . Which is a fact of life , between parents and kids . I can no longer remember the crisis which involved my son , but in essence , it had reached the point , the point of all arguments , when he was saying the devil he would and I was saying the devil he would n't . I do n't know , go to bed , or get out of bed , or come in from the garden , or get out into the garden . He was two or three . His mother rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least Spock him or treat him with a little Ilg , and I went away . She then left him to his own devices . I found him later , ready to renew hostilities , but on his face and in his manner were much weariness , much fatigue and a kind of desperation . I had a moment of pure illumination : I stood there and saw inside his head as clearly as if there had been a pane of glass let in his forehead . What he was saying was , " Please , please , for heaven 's sake , somebody come and take this decision out of my hands ; it 's too big for me . " I grabbed him and picked him up and carried him to wherever it was I thought he was supposed to go . He was little then ; he hit me and bit me and wet me ; he hollered bloody murder and did his level best to kill me . I remember now , it was to his bed he was supposed to go . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side up . He was in his cage , and he had been put there by his keeper , and he went to sleep as happy as ever I saw him . There were rules . Nobody was going to leave him out in the middle of nowhere , trying to figure out what he was supposed to do , when he was too young to know what to do . Well , that was the way it was with us all the time when we were kids . There were rules . There was right and wrong , We may have been ignorant , but we were certain . l'elbruAry 9 , UM Another thing that kids did then , they do n't seem to do now . Nothing . That is not to say not doing anything . We did nothing , which is quite another thing . There was an occupation called " just running around . " It was no game . It had no rules . It did n't start and it did n't stop . Maybe we were all idiots , but a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ruined , water ran along the curb and we sailed twigs down the current , built little dams . In the winter , after the snowballs and the snow forts , after the sleds and the toboggans , there was the crusty snow , and there was the ( What to call it ? Not a game , not a sport , not even a contest. ) ? there was just the thing of seeing if you could walk on the crust without breaking through . There was ice skating , and a kind of primitive hockey , and we made slides on the sidewalk and nearly broke our necks , and then some grownup came out and spread ashes on it , and we grumbled . But there was also just the thing of standing on a frozen place on land and breaking the ice delicately by teetering , or even better than that , just rocking there and watching the water bubble , big as any balloon , slide back and forth under the ice . We did a lot more nothing . We swung on swings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in back yards and chewed grass . We watched things . We watched people build houses : we watched men fix cars : we watched each other patch bicycle tires with rubber hands . We watched men dig ditches , climb telephone poles  --  I can hear the sound now of climbing irons on a pole ; this was a race of heroes ! ? we watched trains at the station , shoeshine men at the station , Italian men playing bocce , our fathers playing cards , our mothers making jam , our sisters skipping rope , curling their hair . For at least a month I watched my sisters making beads ; they cut paper into long , triangular strips , put glue on them , wrapped them around hat pins , and then I think they varnished them . I do n't recall that they ever wore them , but I 'm here to tell you they made them . They also did something called tie-dyeing ; it was a rage , and it produced handkerchiefs of unbelievable ugliness . We strung beads on strings ; we strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string and belts and clothesline . We sat in boxes ; we sat under porches ; we sat on roofs ; we sat on limbs of trees . We stood on boards over excavations ; we stood on tops of piles of leaves ; westood under rain dripping from the eaves ; we stood up to our cars in snow . We looked at things like knives and immies and pig nuts and grasshoppers and clouds and dogs and people . We skipped and hopped and jumped . Not going anywhere  --  just skipping and hopping and jumping and galloping , We sang and whistled 1111k1 hummed and screamed . What I mean , Jack , we did a lot of nothing . We did n't mind it , we did n't think there was anything wrong with it , and the grownups did n't bother us much about it , except when Ihe noise got so great they could n't stand it or the silence so deep they did n't trust us . It seems to me that grownups in those days did a whole lot more when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't doing something , they were content to do nothing  --  openly , brazenly , lazily , sleepily . Either making noodles on the kitchen table or rocking in a rocking chair . Either watering the lawn or sitting in the sun , Either on or off . Up or down . One thing or the other . Something or nothing . Grownups now do n't seem to know how to do that any more ; we seem to have lost the ability to just plain sit down , and we ca n't stand to see our kids do it . Take a kid these days , standing or leaning or sitting or lying down , all by himself , slack-jawed and vacant-eyed , not actively engaged in any recognizable  --  by a grownup  --  socially acceptable activity . We see him and what do we do ? We want to know what 's the matter with him . There 's nothing the matter with him ; he 's considering his thumb ; or who he would be if his father had n't married his mother ; or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard enough ; or if he breathes differently when he thinks about breathing . Or else he is just plain sitting there . He is doing the work of the world , and please restrain yourself from explaining it to him . It is n't that either of you know more or less about it . He knows different things . Sometimes he needs you in his world and sometimes he does not . At this moment he has hung a sign on his forehead saying : Our TO LUNCH . BACK IN FIVE MINUTES . PLEASE Do NOT DISTURB .
