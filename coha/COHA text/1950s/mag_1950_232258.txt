Protestants do n't like to be considered mission-fodder for Roman Catholics-and vice versa . Last week in Italy , of all places , in Rome 's Holy Year , of all times , some U.S. evangelists were hanging on to an embattled beachhead . They were members of the Churches of Christ ( loosely affiliated fundamentalist churches with an estimated U.S. membership of 700,000 ) , most of them from Texas . <P> Their leader , tall , shock-haired Cline Paden , 30 , from Lubbock , Texas , had gone to Italy in 1947 and found the country " sorely in need of material and spiritual help . " With his brother Harold and eleven helpers , Evangelist Paden concentrated on the town of Frascati , four miles from the Pope 's summer residence at Castel Gandolfo . <P> The Americans opened an orphanage for boys , preached and passed out U.S. food packages . The Frascatians were unenthusiastic . The orphanage had room for 50 boys , but only 22 came . Last summer , Frascati Capuchin monks organized lectures against Protestantism . Then one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castel Gandolfo for a biweekly Bible class , were threatened by a crowd of Italians who , they said , advanced shouting : " We want the Protestants ' bones ! " <P> From Rome came " intimations " that they must close the orphanage and that their residence permits would not be renewed for 1950 . Apparent reason : most of the 250 converts claimed by the missionaries were Communists . <P> Stoutly denying any concern with politics , Evangelist Paden appealed to U.S. Ambassador James Dunn for help . In Dallas , 800-odd Churches of Christ members assembled , and 378 signed a protesting telegram to Secretary of State Dean Acheson . Texas Congressman Ed Gossett went with a delegation to the State Department where , he said , he warned officials that " if the Italian government runs this orphanage out of Italy , it may have a serious effect on congressional action on European aid funds . " <P> By week 's end , Paden and his helpers had new temporary visas , due to expire on March 31.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
