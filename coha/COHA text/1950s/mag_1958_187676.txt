The witness in the packed , TV-floodlighted Senate Caucus Room trembled with fright as he told his story to stern-faced Senator John McClellan and the labor-management rackets investigating committee . What brawny ex-Lumberman George Francis Heid , 35 , was afraid of was not the power of the U.S. Government , as represented by the McClellan committee . It was the power of the Teamster Brotherhood , the U.S. 's biggest labor union ( membership 1,500,000 ) . Heid knew that testifying against Teamster Boss Jimmy Hoffa and his henchmen might bring ugly reprisals by Hoffa 's ex-convict bullyboys . But with a pledge of protection by the committee . Heid huskily admitted that , under Teamster threats , he had perjured himself in 1956 by testifying in defense of a Minneapolis Teamster boss who was charged with blowing up the car of a rebellious fellow Teamster ( and duly convicted ) . <P> " A Living Hell . " Heid was only one of several committee witnesses whose evident terror proved the Teamsters ' power to punish and intimidate . Another Minneapolis ex-Teamster , Arthur Morgan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his life " a living hell " since he testified against Teamster brass before the McClellan committee a year ago . " Every night practically . " testified Morgan , " the telephone would ring all night long , and my wife would get calls that asked if the children were home from school , and she would say that they are , and they would tell her , ' Maybe you are lucky tonight , and maybe you wo n't be so lucky tomorrow night . ' " <P> Fear of hard-boiled Hoffa was evident in the behavior of witnesses called to testify about a $17,500 payoff that Detroit laundry operators handed over in 1949 to avert a threatened strike of Teamster truck drivers . Committee investigators had scraped up some persuasive evidence that at least $10,000 of the payoff had found its way to Jimmy Hoffa . Under questioning , Hoffa conceded that he got $10,000 in " loans " from the bagmen who collected from the laundrymen. but beyond that , his memory failed him . He could not recall any details about repaying the loans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did repay them . <P> Finding Hoffa uncooperative , the committee called up two Detroit laundrymen who had signed affidavits indicating that they thought at least part of the payoff went to Hoffa . But something had happened to make the witnesses wary . Obviously frightened , they shied away from their notarized affidavits , professed sudden doubts whether Hoffa really got any of the money after all . <P> A Thawed Curl . Despite Hoffa 's studied forgetfulness and witnesses ' fright , the committee added some gamy paragraphs to the malodorous Hoffa record. * According to committee documents and testimony : <P> A construction firm owned by Hoffa front men used $235,000 in Teamster welfare funds as working capital .
