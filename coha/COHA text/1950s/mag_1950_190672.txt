Sirens screaming and horn ablare , Benton &; Bowles are riding the air . Tinsel and paint and a jester 's cap , Tinkling bells and a moit of pap , Under our elms and over our maples Selling themselves as they sold their staples . <P> In this querulous doggerel , a disgruntled voter in the Hartford Courant last week recorded her opinion of the noisiest off-year campaign in Connecticut history . Benton &; Bowles , formerly of the advertising firm of the same name , were Governor Chester Bowles and William Benton , whom he had appointed to the U.S. Senate . Chester Bowles , a man whose left of Truman policies inspire a little of the same devotion in his supporters and rage in his opponents that Franklin D. Roosevelt did , wanted to be governor for four more years . Benton , trying to keep his Senate seat ( which he has held for ten months ) was running for office for the first time , with the best huckstering tricks conceived by the sincere-tie set . <P> Cold Air . " The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic Bill Benton , who owns Muzak , runs the Encyclopaedia Britannica , and as an Assistant Secretary of State once directed the Voice of America . He hired a helicopter , plastered a big sign on it : " Here 's Bill Benton , " and went hopping about the state like a man on an aerial pogo stick . A leather-chair type gladhander , he strove for the common touch . At country fairs , he handed out windshield stickers and buttons , told the crowd : " I will say for you ladies that I 've had an experience such as you may understand . Men 's trousers were n't made to be worn in helicopters-the cold air goes right up them . " <P> Benton 's one-minute radio spots were pre-evaluated for crowd appeal , his comicstrip ads pretested for reader interest . He set up street-corner booths , stocked them with pretty girls , ran off five one-minute movies showing Benton the homebody ( his wife showing off his scrapbook ) , Benton the internationalist ( his trip inspecting ECA 's Italian projects , aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( flashes of Marshall , Eisenhower and Baruch endorsing his " Marshall Plan of Ideas " ) .
