Most ivory-tower plastic surgeons are concerned with correcting some of mankind 's more serious deformities-not with making " cosmetic " repairs such as nose bobbing or face lifting . This attitude is too narrow and too stuffy , according to Dr. Adolph Abraham Apton of Manhattan 's Mount Sinai Hospital : anything that makes a person feel uncomfortably conspicuous leads to mental upsets and ought to be corrected if possible . Dr. Apton 's motto : " Plastic surgery is a surgical method of psychotherapy . " <P> In a new book , Your Mind and Appearance ( Citadel ; $3 ) , Dr. Apton defends his theory . Many children 's personalities are warped , he argues , because they happen to be born with jug ears , and get teased about them . Often the nose is the worrisome feature-and it does not have to be as big as Cyrano de Bergerac 's . The passion to possess a sort of U.S. standard nose , says Dr. Apton , brings him patients who want their broad , flat noses built up with a bit of ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Apton generally obliges . <P> Pure vanity is not the only motive that sends people running to the plastic surgeon . Often it 's a matter of cold business . Apton cites case after case ( but without mentioning names ) , e.g. , actresses who were able to go on playing youthful roles after face lifting , while others of the same age , with unlifted faces , got only middle-aged parts or none at all ; a pediatrician who had a port-wine birthmark removed from his face because it scared the kiddies ; a rabbit-eared radio announcer who had to have an operation to get a job on television . <P> Strongly as he believes in plastic surgery , Dr. Apton warns that it should not be used in purely trifling cases , or when a patient 's depression is actually rooted in something deeper . And with approval he quotes a Canadian colleague : " Scars obtained in honest toil or in battle for a righteous cause are not dishonorable . In fact . . . they should be regarded as a badge of honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
