What becomes of Princeton men after they leave Old Nassau ? According to a traditional Princeton song , they are " safe now in the wide , wide world . " Last week , as the graduate of 1934 and 1940 scanned his newly published class reports , it appeared that the song had it about right . <P> According to the reports , his income is now apt to be around $8,000 a year . He is pretty sure to be married . ( 93% for ' 34 , 85% for ' 40 ) , and has 1.7 and 1.6 children respectively . The average Princeton man is a Protestant , most likely an Episcopalian . He drinks moderately , plays golf enthusiastically and votes Republican . The class of ' 34 said that Gone With the Wind and War and Peace are its favorite novels ; the class of ' 40 voted for War and Peace and Gone With the Wind . Favorite poem of both : Kipling 's if ( perennial favorite of Princeton seniors ) . <P> So far , neither class has produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists or composers . The average Princetonian seems to be a sound and solid gentleman who reports that , on the whole , he is quite happy .
