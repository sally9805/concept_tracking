Arrested in their Manhattan apartment on charges of spying for Russia , Lithuanian-born Jack Soble and his wife Myra replied " not guilty " when a clerk at the federal courthouse last February asked them how they pleaded . Last week , pale , haggard but looking strangely relaxed , the Sobles switched their plea to guilty on a count of conspiring with Soviet agents to " receive and obtain " U.S. defense secrets . Maximum sentence : $10,000 fine and ten years ' imprisonment . <P> In the two-month interval , a lot had happened to Jack Soble , 53 , and his Russian-born wife , 53 ( TIME , Feb. 4 ) . They found out that while they were spying , the FBI had been on their trail . And when they faced the prospect that the Justice Department 's case against them might well be unbeatable , they had to face up to the grim fact that in 1954 Congress raised the maximum penalty for peace time espionage from 20 years ' imprisonment to death . <P> Last Chance . The guilty plea on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sobles had made a deal for their lives . Probable deal : the U.S. Government would drop the death-penalty charge of conspiracy to " communicate , deliver and transmit " defense secrets to Soviet agents if the Sobles would tell all . <P> There was , it seemed , plenty to tell . The Sobles , said their lawyer , are " two anguished individuals " manipulated by " the long arm of Russia " and " suffering intensely from experiences they had gone through before they emigrated to this country and since . " Jack Soble , also known as Peter , Abram and , in earlier years , Abromas Sobolevicius , arrived in the U.S. in 1941 by way of Japan . He and Myra became U.S. citizens in 1947 . Soble worked as a dealer in animal hair and bristles , but behind his faade of respectability , the U.S. charged , he served the Kremlin as a spymaster in a ring that operated in the U.S. and Europe for more than a decade . Among the spies working under him in the U.S. , charged Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Soble 's home town of Vilkaviskis , Lithuania . Arrested in Manhattan the same morning the FBI closed in on the Sobles , Albam , 64 , was still clinging to his not-guilty plea last week , but he , too , seemed on the verge of deciding to change his mind . <P> Next Questions . The most improbable conspirator in the Soble ring was a roly-poly , harmless looking mystery man named Boris Morros , who used to be well known in Hollywood and Manhattan as musical director of Paramount Pictures , and later as a movie producer ( Tales of Manhattan , Carnegie Hall ) . Over the past decade or so , Russian-born Boris Morros had little to do with moviemaking , spent much of his time in Europe . Just what he was up to was a puzzle to his old Hollywood acquaintances . Shortly after the FBI nabbed the Sobles , the Justice Department identified Morros as its star witness . There were strong hints that Morros had been serving as a U.S. secret agent while operating inside the conspiracy as a trusted courier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' admission that they had obtained U.S. defense secrets raised more questions : Who gave them the secrets ? To whom were they passed ? Presumably , behind the locked and guarded doors of a grand-jury chamber in Manhattan , Jack and Myra Soble were singing the answers .
