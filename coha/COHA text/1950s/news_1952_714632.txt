txt Britain 's Conservative government appears to have extended its " austerity " program to include elimination of one of the favorite luxuries of its Socialist predecessors  --  crystal-ball gazing . The Socialists took a fancy to publishing annual " economic surveys " every April , forecasting what the year ahead had in store . The " plan " for that year was then geared to these projected trends . Needless to say , the result was a yearly crop of prize miscalculations . In April of 1949 , the late Labor Government predicted Britain 's balance of overseas payments would be " roughly in balance " for the first half of the year , though the nation 's economic health could not be expected to improve quite " as markedly " as in 1948 . A slight understatement  --  for in the month of June alone the country 's trade deficit was up ' to nearly $217 million and in September the pound sterling was devalued . The planners did n't count on a slight trade recession in the U. S. that year , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterling-area gold and dollar deficit of $785 million by the yearend . Along came the Korean war , which had n't showed up in their crystalball , and the boom buying of sterling-area rubber , tin and wool enabled them to finish the year with a surplus . In April last year , the " economic survey " predicted Britain 's ' trade would break even for 1951 . It prophesied exactly how much the cost of Britain 's imported raw materials would rise . There was a slight blurring of the crystal ball , however ; import costs rose more than was calculated , and Britain finished the year in the midst of a grave economic crisis and with a $2,209,000,000 trade deficit . The Conservatives published an " economic survey " for 1952 Tuesday ? but reports from London say it skipped the forecasting . It stuck to a few home truths , such as a warning that Britain " can not expect to survive in a competitive world without constantly adjusting the pattern of its production to meet changes in the overseas demand for its exports . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed where it belongs ? at the nation 's many private businessmen . Planning by a centi.al government ' agency is necessarily risky and fallible . It is made doubly so by the need to draw tip plans within the framework of predictions and projections about world trends which no one can really plan or control .
