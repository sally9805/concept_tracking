Walter Philip Reuther , 49 , the redheaded boss of the 1,500,000 United Automobile Workers and vice president of the 15-million-man A.F.L.-C.I.O. , remained utterly aloof from the tawdry discourse about Jimmy Hoffa and Johnny Dio going on in Washington . Instead , the U.A.W. 's Reuther chose to initiate a new public debate , not about labor corruption , but about economics . Aware of public concern about inflation , Reuther astutely proposed that the big three automobile makers cut prices on 1958 models by $100 or more below 1957 prices , whereupon his union would give " full consideration " to lower company earnings in preparing wage demands ( TIME , Aug. 26 ) . <P> The automakers were unanimous in their answer . " Another publicity maneuver , " shot back General Motors Corp . President Harlow H. Curtice . Retorted Chrysler Corp . President Lester Lum Colbert : " You are proposing that management abdicate its responsibilities-and that months after sustaining a drastically reduced income , a company would go before the U.A.W. or before a three-man panel to attempt to justify its need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rapid increases in wages of automobile workers over the past ten years , which were negotiated under the duress of your demands , have unquestionably contributed to inflation . Thus , having poured gasoline on the fires . . . you now stand by and tell us how to fight the blaze . In return , you say you will consider using less gasoline next time-or maybe only kerosene . " <P> Net result of the exchange : a spate of publicity for Walter Reuther and his odd theory that U.S. private enterprise should be limited by some kind of labor review and control . As Walter Reuther must have realized all along , neither the proposal nor the discussion made any real contribution to the critical struggle against inflation .
