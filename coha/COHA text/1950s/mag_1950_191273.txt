Appropriately for the Christmas season , a Manhattan gallery was showing some of the most elaborate grownups ' toys ever made : automatons produced largely in the 18th Century by Swiss and British craftsmen . There was a gold caterpillar that , when wound , inched along a tabletop in a pretty fair imitation of nature . A gold mouse , ridged with pearls , scurried , stopped , spun and darted about as if in real fright . An emerald-green frog jumped and croaked . <P> Eighteenth Century automatons were born of the realization that clockwork is a power source that can be used for more than just telling time . Such triumphs of ingenuity as Venice 's famed Clock Tower , where the hours are struck by a pair of huge mechanical Moors , could be , and were , imitated in watches and snuff boxes made for the dandies of the day . Casanova thought himself half naked without several such showpieces about him . <P> Those who traveled less than Casanova embellished their drawing rooms with fragile fancies : a clock mounted on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a monkey with a lorgnette in one hand and a tiny cigar in the other , smoking with bestial relish , or a dueling pistol which , with a pull of the trigger , released a tiny singing bird . <P> Last week 's show was made up of collectors ' items and almost none of it was intended for the Christmas trade . This , in a way , was a pity . Shoppers working their way down Fifth Avenue from the gallery could hardly hope to find baubles so fine , even at Tiffany 's or Cartier's.
