Composers are seldom ordinary citizens , but Serge de Gastyne , 25 , is extraordinary even among composers . He is 1 ) a count , 2 ) an Airman First Class , * assigned to write music for the Air Force , and 3 ) the composer of three symphonies . <P> Count de Gastyne , Marquis de St. Maur and Viscount de Montauriant , fought with the French underground in his teens , and in 1947 came to the U.S. , where his dazzling piano-playing soon won him scholarship grants at the University of Portland and the Eastman School of Music . Between studies he took a flyer at salesmanship ( encyclopedias ) , earned enough to finance a cross-country trip by bus . In 1952 he enlisted in the Air Force , which decided that it wanted him at the keyboard of a piano , not at the controls of a plane . At Sampson Air Force Base near Rochester , N.Y . ( Major General Richard Lindsay commanding ) , he set out to compose a huge musical " panorama " celebrating the 50th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : General Lindsay 's daughter Raylyn , to whom he is now married . <P> Early this month the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra under Conductor Thor Johnson played De Gastyne 's third symphony . Critics found it to be a highly promising work , but with far too many ideas-a potpourri of styles recalling Stravinsky , Ravel , Gershwin . Best feature : confident orchestration that sounds as if Composer de Gastyne enjoyed playing around with masses of pleasant sounds . <P> Last week , at Washington 's Boiling Air Force Base , De Gastyne was at work on his latest assignment : converting songs by ex-King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia into a symphonic rhapsody . <P> <P> * Air Force equivalent of an Army corporal .
