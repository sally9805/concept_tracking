Many airplanes , especially heavy-laden bombers , are launched by booster ( jato ) rockets whose powerful push gets them into the air without too long a take-off run . The rockets are expensive , whether they use liquid or solid fuel , so the West German Ministry of Transport asked jet-propulsion experts to evaluate hot-water rockets , a prewar German idea that never got a thorough tryout . Recently , Physicist Werner Michely told a meeting at Freu-denstadt that hot-water booster rockets look promising . <P> Michely constructed a simple device : a strong-walled pressure vessel with a valve and a nozzle at one end . When used as a rocket booster , it is filled with 66 Ibs. of water heated electrically to 504 F. The water can not boil because it is confined , but its pressure rises to 50 atmospheres ( 735 Ibs. per sq . in . ) . When the valve is opened , part of the water turns into steam , and a jet of steam and water spurts out at 1,140 m.p.h . The reaction , Michely claims , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket , and much more cheaply . When electricity is used for heating , the same amount of thrust costs less than one-seventieth as much as with a solid-fuel rocket . Other heat sources would be even cheaper . <P> Michely has tested his hot-water rocket only on the ground , but he thinks it has a bright future in the air , both for horizontally and vertically launched aircraft . Besides its cheapness , it is comparatively safe because of its low pressure and temperature , and its single valve is its only moving part .
