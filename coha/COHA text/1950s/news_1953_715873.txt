txt Eight years : after World War II , 374,000 Italians still live in caves or illegal - shanties , without water ; light , or sanitation . There are 942,000 who live in cellars , attics , or warehouses never intended for human beings and officially condemned by health authorities ; 4,375,000 live more than three to a room , usually in ramshackle slum buildings or hideous filth . Another 5,647,460 live two to three to a- room in comparative luxury . If every family were to have a kitchen , a bedroom for the parexits , and a room for every two children , about 7 million more rooms would be needed at once . The present rate of building , with heavy government subsidies , is somewhat more than 700,000 rooms a year . But the population is increasing by nearly 300,000 a year . Construction Rises Since 1946 , when building began again , about 2,500,000 rooms have been completed . The annual rate of construction has risen steadily from 140,000 in 1946 to 700,000 in 1952 . On a national average , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavatories , stables , henhouses , pigsties , granaries , garages , and all other accessory rooms in a predominantly agricultural nation . It is of ten impossible to draw a line between the parts of a dwelling occupied by human beings and those occupied by animals . Italy has never recovered from the damage and slowdown in building caused by World War I. , The housing shortage of 1918 has grown progressively worse as the traditional outlets for the country 's excess population have been sealed off . Rents Controled In 1934 , when Mussolini 's plans for economic self-sufficiency threw the country 's economy into chaos , rent control was introduced . It has been continued ever since , depriving the little man of one of continental Europe 's tradition al investments : to buy a ' house , live . in part of it and rent the rest . Eighteen years of controled rents have scared big as ' well as small investors away from building . Private investors still demand around 20 pet cent return on money they put into dwellings , instead of the 8 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no private building of low rent dwellings since the war , but a spectacular wave of luxury building . Depend on Government Only the - rich can afford an apartment in Rome 's most startling private building , called the " Sunflower , " because of its vivid impression of swinging on a pivot to catch the sun . The bulk of Italy 's 47 million people depend on the government for new housing . Five different government projects have been launched since the- war . They range from direct government building for the homeless or those living in caves and shanties , to long term loans at 4 per cent interest for those who can put up a little money .
