This week Dick Nixon once more appeared on the nation 's TV screens . This time he was not defending himself ; he was an accuser . The subject : Communism in the U.S. Government . <P> " The failure of this Administration to deal effectively with the Communist threat , " said Nixon , in earnest and subdued tones , is the " greatest issue in the election . " To demonstrate the failure , Nixon retold the story of the Hiss case : Whittaker Chambers ' first accusation , the confrontation of the two men , Alger Hiss 's admission , after twelve days of denial , that he had known Chambers after all . Nixon outlined the Administration 's attempts to " cover up " the case , including an executive order by President Truman , forbidding " the FBI ... to cooperate with the Committee on Un-American Activities in its investigation . " <P> He recalled that Harry Truman had called the Hiss case a red herring " not only once , but seven different times . " Beginning in 1939 , Chambers again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists . The Government did nothing " except to promote the members of the ring , " said Nixon . If the Government had acted , " we might have nipped the Communist conspiracy in the bud ; " other Communist agents might have been prevented from stealing atomic information which gave Russia the bomb five years before they might have had it . <P> Communists and fellow travelers , asserted Nixon , " have not yet been cleaned out of the Government . " He quoted a member of the President 's loyalty review board , who had said of the way the loyalty program is operating in the State Department : " They 're taking the attitude that they 're there to clear the employee and not to protect the Government . " <P> Which candidate , asked Nixon , is best qualified to do something about the Communists in Government ? Stevenson , he recalled , testified that Hiss 's reputation " for veracity , for integrity and for loyalty was good , " and he did so 1 ) after the essential facts of the Hiss case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Nixon , " has never expressed any indignation over what Hiss has done . " Nixon quoted a Stevenson speech in which he said : " There are n't many American Communists-far fewer than in the days of the great Depression , and they are n't on the whole very important . " Then Nixon quoted J. Edgar Hoover : " In actual numbers , their Communists membership may not be large . This has been cited by the ignorant and the apologists and the appeasers of Communists in our country as minimizing the danger . . . " <P> Said Nixon : " There is no question in my mind as to the loyalty of Mr. Stevenson , but the question is one as to his judgment ... He has failed to recognize the threat . . . " <P> Eisenhower , on the other hand , " will need have no fear of finding Communist skeletons in his political closet . " Many Americans wondered , said Nixon , whether " we may lose the struggle . . . against Communism . " His reply : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
