 | little house was dark and , since no coat or hat was hanging on the hall tree , it was obvious that Irad had not yet returned . Once Sam had closed the door , they stood facing each other , they hesitated , then kissed again and again before stepping breathlessly into the little parlor . He had removed her ostrich-trimmed evening cloak when suddenly her skirts gave a quick rustle and she spun about . By the hall-lamp 's dim light he was aware of Sylvia 's eyes suddenly becoming enormous , of her lips writhing apart to reveal the faint glint of teeth . As her head went back , she dragged down the ballgown 's shoulder straps until she had freed swelling pointed breasts and a pallid tumultuous bosom . " Ah-h  --  darling ! " she gasped when he caught her so tight that his cold gold buttons dug deep into her flesh . " Oh  --  Sam , Sam , take me , take me  --  please . " She panted . At the same instant she was thinking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Irad 's blood . This is n't wrong . Irad wants an heir almost as much as I. " To the soft rustling of skirts and petticoats Sam carried her over to the Chippendale sofa . " Sylvia , darling ! " he panted . " You  --  I ? " Fingers soft as feathers sealed his mouth ; then only the quick catching of their breaths disturbed the silence . YVIII NADIR OF ' HIS RETURN to the Eutaw House , Lieutenant Seymour , U.S.N. , had no recollection whatsoever . What had recalled him to consciousness was strong spring sunlight beating through the window shutters and creating across the counterpane a series of tigerish stripes . All the hammers of hell were beating against his temples just as they had the only other time he 'd got so royally drunk  --  when he 'd been granted his passed midshipman 's commission . What the hell had happened ? His mouth tasted like the inside of an old felt slipper and his throat burned so intolerably that he  | lurched across to the washstand and swallowed several deep draughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers , he lay staring blankly at a brown water stain on the ceiling paper . What ? Oh , yes , they were playing " Dixie 's Land " at a dance . Whose dance ? Oh , yes . Mr. Thomas Winans ' cotillion . He was drinking champagne with his arms looped through a girl 's . Which girl ? There had been so many . Oh , yes , Sylvia ! Sylvia ! SYLVIA ! Gradually he recalled details of that breathless , reckless , and deplorable interlude in his brother 's house . Sylvia 's face incredibly lovely in the hackney ; the hollow sound made by the front door closing ; those hungry , wide and glistening eyes ; lovely bare breasts and panted endearments ; descent into a weird and lascivious maelstrom . Try as he would , he could not recall even an instant 's debate , love-making or tender , redeeming vows ; nothing of the sort . Sam realized that he wore only a long-tailed dress shirt reeking of stale sweat . By raising his throbbing head he could see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen from him . Maybe this had all been a hideously distorted nightmare ? Of course , of course ! Comforted , he lay back breathing more equably until a small , harassing doubt drove him reluctantly to examine his memory with more care . God Almighty ! Then , like a tidal wave , bitter , killing remorse engulfed him . He had committed a crime for which there could be no forgiveness . To have seduced a happily married gentlewoman would have been evil enough had she been an outsider , but to have tarnished his own brother 's wife ! What hell was hot enough to burn away such guilt ? " How could I ! " Never for a moment did it occur to Sam Seymour that perhaps he had not been entirely to blame , that the whole affair had not been of his contriving . What an utterly ignoble thing for a Seymour , for an officer and a gentleman , thus to repay those who so devotedly had cared for his motherless child . After a while he got up and , taking care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What to do ? One thing was sure . The slim black outline of a razor caught his eye . That ? No . Only poor whites and niggers would use their razor for such a purpose . He 'd never be I '  | able to face either Irad or Sylvia again . He went over to his sea chest and in it found one of his clumsy , brass-mounted pistols . Using absurdly precise movements , he loaded the weapon , tamped home a gleaming leaden bullet and finally slipped a bright copper percussion cap over its nipple . Drawing a deep breath he leveled the weapon in line with his temple ; then lowered it wondering , " Is this the most fitting atonement ? " He seemed to hear Amanda Seymour 's even voice observing , " Only a weak coward would kill himself . " An admitted suicide could cause his family only additional humiliation and grief . Many persons had watched Sylvia depart from the Winans ' in his company and so could be able to add known facts into the correct and shameful sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon and its percussion cap glared like a wicked eye when he removed it . " Why not make my death of some account ? " he asked of himself bitterly . Torn by indecision and mordant remorse , he hesitated in the center of the hotel room , a grotesque , blear-eyed and disheveled figure , until at length his eye encountered Lieutenant Maffitt 's letter . Once he had prepared the final draft of his resignation from the Federal Navy , he penned a note to Irad in which he explained that he had received , from the Navy Department in Montgomery , summonses so urgent that he could not ignore them . Since he had become convinced that Virginia was about to secede he was departing within the hour , which rendered it impossible for him to take leave in person of Robbie , Sylvia and himself . Lips colorless , he made over a pay check for three hundred dollars and promised to forward further sums towards Robbie 's maintenance . No matter what might chance , Irad was always to think of him as a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude with a paragraph of bitter self-accusation . That he was resigning his commission was just as well , he thought , while applying a signet to sealing wax . Certainly an officer who had fallen so low as he scarcely was fit to wear the honored blue uniform . Hold on . Was he any more fit to don the Confederacy 's gray ? He found refuge in a sophistry . The old Sam Seymour would have nothing to do with this new loyalty . Perhaps , through devoted service to  | the South , his soul might achieve a rebirth and his mind surcease horn the torments of conscience . XIX EXODUS WHEN SYLVIA SEYMOUR finally aroused herself , Irad had long since departed to the shipyard . What a mercy it was that Master Robbie must have been taken marketing by old Melissa . For a good while she lay utterly inert against the pillows amid the generous disorder of her long , light brown hair . Her mind had been in such a turmoil she 'd not bothered to braid her hair as usual or secure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawn escaped her , then after stretching in almost feline grace she settled back again , smiling . She supposed she should feel guilty , immoral and abandoned to decency  --  but she did n't . Never had she felt better . Never had her body been more glowingly sensitive and its hungers so well satisfied . " Well , " she thought , " let 's hope I 've got what I want . Too bad rad cant seem to give me a baby  --  but now I 'll have one . I know I can . Now I can be like other women and have my own little darling to brag about and fuss over . " She actually chuckled . " What 's more , no one can ever truthfully say my child is n't a Seymour ! " What a lover Sam was . Among the covers she blinked like a sleepy kitten . No wonder poor dear Janet had always appeared so contented , pleased and proud . " Of course , " she promised softly , " I wo n't ever let anything like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left me last night ; reckon he was pretty jingled . Well , he 's a seafaring man and wo n't get too penitent over our little affair , especially since it wo n't be repeated . " Her voluminous nightgown billowing about her , Sylvia slipped out of bed and went to consider herself in a mirror above her chiffonier . " Lordy ! " she thought , " it 's just as well Irad 's gone out ! "  | A distinctly unfamiliar expression shone in her wide and heavily lashed eyes and beneath them lay two , pale brown , feather-shaped shadows . Because of the weight of Mechlin lace ornamenting it , the gown fell apart and slipped until her elbows checked it . On impulse , she let the fine lawn robe fall all the way to the floor while she remained an erect , pale pillar in the center of that white pool it created . Gently she tested upstanding pink-nippled and well-modeled breasts , found them still gorged and sensitive . Next she considered her abdomen . Its smooth surface was beautifully curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy bring about ? Some women grew into shapeless lumps , but there were others . Jane Turner , for instance , stood straight as a spruce for all that she 'd given birth to four children . Maybe Jane would confide her secret if properly approached and flattered . " He-e- cr-a-abs ! Hi , ho , he-e-e cra-a-bs . " The singsong voice of a fish peddler advanced down an alley back of the house and aroused her from her daydreaming . Blushing suddenly at her nudity she pulled on a peignoir and knotted a ribbon about her hair . It was well she had done so for just then the doorbell jangled and its wire rasped dully as the pull was let go . The caller proved to be a small black errand boy wearing the livery of the Eutaw House and conveying a letter unmistakably addressed in Sam 's handwriting . " A love letter already ? Who 'd have thought he 'd prove so impetuous a gallant ? Reckon I 'll have to handle Mister Sam with kid gloves . " From a flower vase reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lad , whose eyes and teeth glistened at such munificence . Sylvia knew that she was being dreadfully extravagant but was so pleased with life she did n't care . Then to her dismayed astonishment she noted that this missive was addressed not to her , but to Irad . That golden delicious haze into which she had awaked evaporated in a twinkle . For the first time it occurred to her that possibly Sam had n't dismissed their dalliance as merely a gallant interlude . Come to think of it , the Seymour sons always had deemed their family honor as a mighty precious possession . Irresolute , she paused in the hallway revolving the square yellow envelope between trembling fingers . What could Sam have written ? Surely he was n't being so colossal a fool as to make a clean breast of  | everything ? God forbid ! Such a move could wreck her marriage and set at naught her many subtle , far-reaching ambitions . Panic began groping at her mind with cruelly sharp talons and her heart commenced hammering as if she had run up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she pressed Sam 's letter to a windowpane and tried to read it , but alas the paper proved too thick . After thrusting her head out of the front door to make certain that Melissa and Robbie were not in the street on their way home , she scurried to the kitchen  --  where , praise be , a kettle was steaming lazily . To ungum the flap without marring it required a distressing length of time , but at length Sylvia was able to pluck out the message . When she had read it she dropped onto a stool , sobbing in relief . Ile had n't made any confession , thank Heavens ! A noise at the front stoop prompted her to replace the letter and enclosed bank draft and use a cold sad iron to reseal the still-gummy flap . To all intents and purposes , Sylvia was airily peeling an apple when Melissa shuffled in , bent under her market basket . Master Robbie romped past her . " Me some , " pleaded the boy . " Of course , dear . You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the child as if she 'd never before seen him . Her son , if she had one , very likely might come to resemble Robbie . Yes , she 'd been really clever in this matter . Family resemblances were so easy of explanation . " Trouble , trouble , " mumbled Melissa , hanging up her shawl and depositing the wicker basket of provisions . " Dey say in de market de Gov'ment gwine send mo ' sojers tuh Balt'mo ' . " " Merciful Heavens ! Why ? " " De Gov'ment suspecks dey 's a powerful lot of  --  of  --  Sesech sentiment " ? Melissa was obviously proud to use the term ? " yere abouts . " " Robbie , dear , why do n't you run along and play in the yard ? It 's a lovely warm day so you wo n't have to wear that heavy cap and coat . Keep an eye on him , please , Melissa . I really must get dressed . " " How was de cotillion ? " The ancient Negress ' curiosity was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Gov'nor ? Expeck yo ' was the purtiest lady dere , was n't you ? " Sylvia laughed a little loudly . " Maybe . Baltimore is n't Savannah . Oh , come up to my room and I 'll tell you all about the party . You  | can watch Master Robbie from the window . " This was just like old times , the good old days at Beau Rivage . Sylvia spun a fine , vivid tale , made the new gaslights gleam , the uniforms glitter , the ballgowns glow , all to appropriate comments and criticism . For generations it had been the obligation of the Magofhin ladies to render such accounts to their servants , so she did it well . " Laws , laws ! Dat must have been a mos ' ippicanarious a social occasion . " Melissa sighed , then knelt to tie little tassels securing the laces to Sylvia 's small gray Balmoral boots . " Pity , Miss Sylvia , you ai n't been to mo ' sech elegant pa'ties . Misto ' Irad he do look so grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senatuh . " " Oh , from now on he and I will attend a lot of such affairs . " Sylvia was looking well , she realized , her color higher than usual . No one would guess that she had been up until dawn , that she 'd experienced a very great event in her life . When , presently , she departed for the Tuesday Morning Sewing Circle she must look entirely serene . All would have been well , so much easier , if Sam had n't elected to disappear so abruptly . If only she could have talked with him she might perhaps have been able to dispel some of that distress so well concealed in his letter . Where was Sam likely to be stationed ? Wilmington or Charleston ? She felt pretty sure of one thing  --  Savannah would scarcely be his destination , if he could help it . Should she wear her mulberry cloak with its pretty gray squirrel collar or  --  she never arrived at a decision because at that moment the front door crashed back and Irad came storming upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her features . " He knows ! " was her thought on facing her husband 's blazing eves . " ' Lissa , leave the room , " Irad directed in harsh , flat and unfamiliar accents . " God help me ! He intends killing me ! " had Seymour had never stood taller . She stood waiting , anticipating the words which would blast her marriage forever . How could she have been such an utter little fool as to risk respectability , social advancement ? How in the world had he found out ? Some very early rising neighbor , no doubt . To her vast amazement the starch went out of Irad 's back and he  | crumpled into a sitting position on a black horsehair sofa . A measure of courage came welling back into her although she could not yet understand why he did n't rant and rage . " What  --  what is wrong ? " she stammered . Hands twisting before his knees , he said without looking up , " It 's rotten  --  damned unfair . The truth is , Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been discharged . I  --  I 've lost my position . " " Oh ! Is that all ? " Sylvia burst out despite herself . " All ? " He gaped at her . " All ? Do n't you realize it means ruin ? Absolute financial ruin for me ? " Tears of indescribable relief stung Sylvia 's eyes as she flung herself onto the floor beside him . " Oh , Irad , my darling . I did n't understand ! Forgive me , please , forgive me . " She crouched at his side pressing herself to him and kissing his forehead . " I  --  I was so surprised  --  but you looked so shattered and tragic . " She slipped an arm about his shoulders . " Surely , my heart , there are other shipbuilders ? " " Yes , but Yankees and black Abolitionists to the man . " " But , dearest , what did happen ? " Now that her breathing was easier her mental processes became alert , anticipatory . " Reeder called me in . Seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Leon Duchesne 's toast to Maryland 's secession . It the General Wayne Inn . He 's convinced that I 've been a Confederate secret agent all along and has threatened to have a United States marshal arrest me the minute hostilities break out . " Irad removed his glasses and commenced uselessly to polish them . " What am I to do ? " She would have answered save that he really was n't asking her , but himself rather . " You know how hard-up we 've been . I 've not been able to save enough money to support us for a single month . " Sylvia nodded . " Yes , my darling . But , Irad , what do you intend doing ? " Her husband drew a deep , shuddering breath and heaved himself to his feet . A sudden impatience bordering on contempt seized Sylvia . Why had n't he long ago foreseen this possibility and made plans ? Really , Irad was n't the least bit shrewd or far-sighted . Only weak and vacillating . Again she was in error . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he growled ,  | " by God I 'll be one  --  one of the best ! After all , I 'm a Virginian and a Southerner . " After restoring his spectacles to position he commenced to pace , much as had his brother earlier that fateful day . " My dear , we must face the fact that I sha n't be able to obtain a marine architect 's post in or around Baltimore . That damned Reeder and his crowd will see to that , and I 'm determined not to move further north . " " Why not ? " Sylvia demanded . " Last night several people told me that in New York there are hundreds of Southern sympathizers . At this very minute influential men up there are buying equipment and arms for Confederate troops . Why , I was reading the New York Herald only the other day and , Irad , its editorials were so Secessionist you would n't have believed it had been published in New England . " " New York is n't a part of New England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across marine architects , draughtsmen and shipwrights to spare because nearly every English or Scotch engineer who comes to America settles north of the Mason-Dixon Line . " Stroking his short golden beard , Irad steadily considered his lovely young wife sitting stiff and pale across their room . " I intend going south , Sylvia , and there prove my shipbuilding theories . Perhaps in so doing I can serve my country better than a lot of fire-eaters rushing about in uniform . My principles are sound although some of them may seem revolutionary , but I know they are practical and their application to our new Navy would place it well ahead of the damned Yankees and their obsolete wooden tubs . " Never before had Sylvia beheld her husband so intense , so determined . Mercy , how little , after all , she appreciated the depths of this man she 'd married ! Apparently it required a crisis like this to jar him out of his wellbred , tolerant and easygoing way of life . She ran up and flung both arms about him . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she could , and would , help his star to rise in so many subtle , purely feminine ways . Family connections , which were legion , and still more numerous friends must be enlisted and allied  --  largely without Irad 's knowledge ; he was ridiculously touchy about being under obligation to anyone whomever . Her arms tightened about him as she lifted a glowing countenance and offered Sam 's letter .  | As covertly intense as a defendant studying the foreman of a jury on the point of rendering a verdict , Sylvia scrutinized her husband while he read the communication through twice . " Well , I 'm damned , " he said slowly . " Sam has beaten me to it . He 's sent in his papers and started for Montgomery . Wonder what caused him to make up his mind so all-fired quickly ? It 's not like him . " " Oh , is n't it just the times , dear ? " was Sylvia 's suggestion . " People arc doing so many things on impulse these days . Action is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Do wish we could have said goodbye . " 1 le reached for his tall stovepipe hat . " May not see each other again for a long time . " " Where are you going , dear ? " " To book us passage to Norfolk , " he announced crisply . " I 'll try for the Baltimore Steam Packet 's Georgeanna tomorrow . You and Melissa had better get cracking . " XX REVERBERATIONS : 12 APRIL 1861 BECAUSE OF WILD demonstrations inspired by news that a Federal fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina , had refused to surrender and was under bombardment , the Baltimore Steam Packet 's ship Georgeanna sailed at six-thirty in the evening  --  two hours late . Wildly exaggerated rumors circulated that Carolina State troops had carried Fort Sumter at the point of their bayonets ; that a Major Anderson , apparently the Federal commander , had touched off the magazine and had blown himself , the attackers and his whole garrison to glory . Such was the excitement that , long after the steam calliope had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land , " very few of the Georgeanna 's male passengers went to bed , but lingered in one or the other of the bay liner 's spacious bars .  | Long after Sylvia , her servant and the boy had retired to one of the Georgeanna 's few staterooms , Irad Seymour continued to linger on the spar deck . Idly , he watched the great walking beam 's jet outline rising and falling against the stars like a gigantic seesaw , followed the course of streams of sparks whirling off to leeward in their frenzied ephemeral course . Thank God , that infernal steam calliope had finally given up ! In bitterness , tinged with regret , he had watched the tangled silhouettes of the shipyards lining both banks of the Patapsco recede over lazy swells and a lacy wake created by the Georgeanna 's massive paddle wheels . Ahead , a double line of small yellow-red lights indicated the ship channel out to Chesapeake Bay . It went without saying that there would be several people aboard he knew ; luckily these were acquaintances rather than friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , these individuals had noisily insisted on standing him to drink after drink of Zeigler 's and Brownelle 's Baltimore Rye Whiskey , beer and brandy . With the third round he had become infected by raging partisanship emphasized sometimes by terrifying displays of pistols and daggers ? every male aboard , himself excepted , appeared to go armed . " Yes , gentlemen " ? more than a bit soused at the moment , Irad had banged hard on the bar ? " I tell you 01 ' Federal Navy 's obsolete an ' wooden . Ca n't stand up to the new ironclads we 're goin ' build ! I know ! " " Viva ! Hurray for you ! " A towering individual who claimed to come from Texas , described a glittering arc with a scalping knife above the cringing bartender . " Hi-ya-h-h ! " he screeched . " We 'll cut them goddam ' Abolitionists inter kybobs and little rashers . " Far away and faint as if admitted by a pinhole puncturing the horizon , came noises made by huge flocks of ducks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden barking roar of pistols . Some volunteers traveling south to join the Confederate Army were expressing their exuberance by discharging cap-and-ball Colt 's revolvers at the sky . Frightened protests promptly arose from passengers sleeping in odd contorted positions about the deck . When the Georgeanna had backed out of her slip , Fort Sumter had not been taken , nor had it surrendered , but still was firing . As near as Irad could ascertain with any degree of accuracy a whole  | nation was holding its breath , apprehensive as a person suffering the first pangs of some still undiagnosed disease . The communiques forwarded from Charleston had sounded so biassed , so full of bombast , that obviously they must be the product of someone 's overfertile Imagination . The only non-participants in the almost general jubilation were a small party of naval officers and enlisted men , obviously returning from leave to Fortress Monroe or to the Gosport Navy Yard . A captain of Marines was the only other occupant of the George.nuaa 's spar deck . I-le was quietly smoking his pipe while thoughtfully gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine officer arose and commenced to walk back and forth , every once in a while fanning at mosquitoes which , incredibly , appeared in droves . " Evening , " he grunted , but Irad only nodded ; he was still trying to clear his head . From below resounded a volley of drunken shouts . " Let ' em yelp and enjoy it , " commented the Marine , illuminating smooth flat features in the glow of a long-stemmed German porcelain pipe . " Those braggarts will be howling a different tune before long . " " Indeed , sir ? " Irad still felt belligerent . " And what , pray , leads you to such a conclusion ? " He was surprised at his own pompousness and a trifle pleased . " Why ? Because , friend , even the few ships we maintain in ordinary ' at Gosport can deny the whole of Chesapeake Bay to those noisy traitors . Our guns can batter Norfolk into a heap of smoking brickbats . " In monumental dignity Irad Seymour drew himself up , said stiffly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Marine shrugged . " Oh , so you 're Secesh , too , are you ? It 's a wonder you 're not getting drunk below . My mistake , good evening . " The Marine captain , in no great hurry , turned on his heel and stalked off . Irad thought he ought to call the fellow down but he felt too groggy and ended by venting his resentment on a mosquito stinging his cheek . Lord ! How much could happen in a short space of time ! If anyone had predicted forty-eight hours ago that tonight he would be without employment , would have given up his career in Baltimore , and would be traveling south to join the Confederate Forces , he 'd have thought  | that person plain demented . Yet here he was aboard the Georgeanna and bound for Norfolk ! Poor Sylvia . At first she 'd been wonderfully brave and excited but when a van had appeared to load their trunks , valises and packing cases , she had cried and cried . Although 33 Caroline Street had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their big four-poster bed , the Magoffins ' lovely Sheraton hunting board and the Chippendale sofa . A uniformed bluejacket clumped by and spat tobacco juice over the rail . On the back of his hand he wiped bearded lips . " Well , Mister , I allow the old Georgic wo n't be making this here run much longer . Seems like the Rebs sure have tipped over the apple cart today . " " Seems like it , " Irad agreed . " You think Virginia will go out ? " The bluejacket stared , tugged embarrassedly at his wind-pulled neckerchief . " Why , no . Not if they ai n't dumb-locks , they wo n't . " The sailor spat again , then disappeared down a companionway beyond the busy port paddle box . " What with all this commotion down in Carolina , Virginia may very well get carried away , " Irad mused . " If so , there ought to be plenty of good construction jobs open  --  and near the top , too . Surely Mr. Mallory has n't had extra many marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of finally wearing naval uniform . Would n't it be grand were Sam and he to find themselves on the same station ? The steady tchunk ! tchunki of the Georgeanna 's paddle wheels was having a steadying effect . " Where can Sam be headed after Montgomery ? " Irad wondered . " Funny for him not to have mentioned his destination when everybody at the Winans ' was telling just where he was going . " Briefly Irad debated going below to occupy one of those bunks which , in tiers of three , lined the Georgeanna 's forepeak  --  and decided against it . The sleeping compartments below he knew were separated only by dirty muslin curtains and torn netting , so every snore could be plainly heard . Moreover in their present mood some of his fellow passengers undoubtedly would prove to be fighting drunk or else getting sick all over the deck .  | Dawn revealed huge clouds of ducks , geese and swans rising like smoke from the water at the Georgeanna 's approach . Presently rows of tiny yellow lights appeared far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last night there had been much speculation concerning its fate . Would the Virginians dare emulate the attack on Fort Sumter ? Once Virginia seceded it was to be expected that there 'd be plenty of violence ; were n't the Virginians mighty handy fighters , and quick-tempered to boot ? In some excitement Irad observed a vertical string of signal lanterns climbing to a signal staff but , contrary to his expectations , neither of the two big steam frigates lying at anchor off the fortress appeared to have steam up . The smoke rose from their funnels only in sleepy slender threads . Soon the paddle steamer churned closer in to a dark , low-lying shore . Paddle wheels splashing and threshing in reverse , the Georgeanna eventually coasted up and made fast to a strong wooden pier upon which glimmered the bayonets of Marines on duty below . Once a gangplank had been thrust into position , several Army officers and about thirty hilariously exhilarated or sodden soldiers stumbled off over the dew-wetted planking . One of the officers on reaching the dock turned and , shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , ye dirty sneaking traitors and we 'll teach you ? " The balance of his promise was lost because the George ; ulna 's steam trumpet roared as , creaking in every fibre , she backed well out into Hampton Roads before starting across that great estuary formed by the confluence of the Elizabeth and the James Rivers . Pretty soon Irad was able to distinguish roofs of Norfolk bright with recent rain ; some of the numerous church steeples appeared to be on fire so brilliantly did they glow in the sun 's first rays . How wonderfully familiar the distant city appeared ! Yonder was where he and Sam and Reynolds had gone to school , had fished , sailed and shot and had teased the girls . Under one of those distant roofs his parents lay asleep . His eyes stung suddenly under this vivid , homely reminder that Virginia was his State . From this distance Norfolk appeared to be as peaceful as usual , gracious hostess to myriad ships of all rigs and nationalities . By the dozen they rode anchor or lay tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitter business , to be returning jobless like this ; Mother  | was certain to be disappointed . He guessed , too , she 'd be far from happy at learning his decision to join the Confederate Naval Forces . Would Pa disapprove ? True , he also was Virginia born but had he not served most of his career far removed from his native State ? Ahead and to starboard of the Georgeanna 's present course lay Portsmouth and beyond it the barracks , ship houses and other buildings constituting the great United States Navv Yard at Gosport . Soon he recognized the grim , sable outlines of the many ships-of-war habitually anchored near the mouth of the Elizabeth River . Easiest to identify , of course , were ships-of-the-line , distinguishable by their triple streaks of gunports . There were four of these obsolete behemoths . The U.S.S. Delaware and the U.S.S. Columbus lay idle in the stream but he was interested to perceive that the gigantic Pennsylvania , robbed of top spars and all but essential rigging , still was doing duty as receiving ship for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging sullenly to those same moorings which she had occupied for years . The poor old hulk presented a sad and expensive picture for , although her lofty sides had been pierced to mount one hundred and twenty guns , the Pennsylvania never yet had flown a commission pennant or spread sails to an ocean breeze . He thought he recognized the New York lying in stocks over by Gosport . Anchored in the immediate vicinity and faithfully mirrored in the glassy river rode the modern steam frigates Cumberland , Raritan , Columbia and the old sailing frigate United States  --  that same gallant old paladin which , under the command of dashing young Stephen Decatur had pulverized H.B.M.S. Macedonian long ago during the War of 1812 . Smoke was rising from their funnels but the only activity noticeable among this silent , motionless armada was aboard the steam frigates Cumberland and what looked to be the Merrimac , forty guns . The latter vessel lay to a stone wharf to the east of the drydock where she must have been undergoing repair . The first-class sloops Germantown and Plymouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed ready for sea . The minute hostilities commenced these should prove invaluable . Steadily the big bay liner plowed on down the harbor . Could the Navy Yard be captured by some sudden foray ? Probably not . Surely , the Federal Government must appreciate that here in Gosport was  | situated the principal naval shipyard in the United States . What could not be manufactured here was n't worth troubling over . Over the still and shining waters beat a sudden bray of Marine bugles blowing Assembly . Years ago , Irad had learned to recognize the various calls . He lingered , studying , reviewing the position of the Navy Yard 's huge storage sheds , the three lofty ship houses , the rows of red brick barracks and those sinister piles of cannon and pyramids of shot . Puffing pillars of woolly black smoke from her twin funnels and playing her steam calliope like mad , the Georgeanna continued up the Elizabeth River . More and more passengers came struggling up to the spar deck , for the most part unshaven , red-eyed and swollen of countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel worn . Sylvia appeared , looking small and irritable . " Oh , Irad , I 've been looking all over for you . Come quickly or there wo n't be any breakfast left . Robbie is simply ravenous . " When they came up from below , the Georgeanna was nosing her way through a fleet of oyster boats lying gunwale-deep with those luscious bivalves so vastly appreciated along America 's Eastern seaboard . Also there were fishing sharpies , the masts of which were raked backwards to an almost ludicrous angle , pungies and all manner of produce sloops and lumber schooners . Some of these had bent weather-beaten United States colors on to their signal halyards , but most of the small craft showed no flag at all . A faintly sour smell suggestive of wide mud flats , of spoiled oysters , fish and fruit , came rolling over the bay liner 's rail like a noxious miasma . XXI THE HONORABLE JUDGE RENDERS AN OPINION VERY LITTLE SEEMED to have changed , either about Norfolk or the Seymour home , a neat red brick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the corner of Charlotte and Cumberland Streets . It was , by public opinion , far more modish and comfortable than most property owned by aging naval veterans . Captain Felix had never been spendthrift , and up in Boston , Amanda Ashton Seymour 's family usually had earned more than " moderate bread , " as they put it , as ship captains in the China trade ; also Amanda had been a lone female child among seven stalwart sons . To an observant caller the Seymour residence bespoke naval neatness and solidity plus a certain Yankee severity modified by good taste . During those sixteen years in which the Seymour family had lived here a series of handsome flower gardens had been laid out to surround the big , two-storied house with banks of blossoms . This was one reason Amanda always had mourned the lack of a daughter who might have been persuaded to take an interest and maybe help keep them up . A heavy spring thunderstorm had come rumbling and grumbling up from the south  --  much like that political tempest commencing to stir and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gosport and began rattling loose window frames and shutters and sending householders scurrying out-of-doors to retrieve perishable items . An oppressive humidity prevailed in Captain Felix Seymour 's big sitting room , a space quite as large as the parlor which was a chamber used only for such special occasions as when the minister or some foreign admiral or a friend from abroad came to call . Here the Seymour ladies sat stitching , making transparent efforts to avoid overhearing what deep masculine voices were saying in what Captain Seymour called his " quarterdeck . " In reality that room was a library , cum trophy room , cum study , cum a retreat into which any female ventured at the risk of life and limb . " You look flushed , my dear , " observed old Mrs. Seymour in her crisp New England voice . " I fear the effects of the past week must have tired you greatly . " She was rocking gently beneath a fine Gilbert Stuart portrait of Colonel Robert Ashton , her grandfather , as a student at Harvard College . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced up and directed a gay little smile at her mother-in-law . " Oh , Heavens , no ! I really could n't feel better . "  | As a matter of fact , she was feeling uncommonly well for this particular date . Normally , she would have been fretful , unusually pallid ind conscious of dark semi-circles beneath both eyes . Until recently she had n't dared to decide whether those moments in a certain small parlor up in Baltimore were going to cause physical , as well as mental , remembrances . Now being several whole days past due , she felt sure ? a realization which proved to be at once reassuring and infinitely disturbing . To pretend to herself that nothing untoward had chanced on the night of the Winans ' cotillion , she had found surprisingly easy . No hint of what had happened between Sam and herself had ever betrayed itself in her manner ; of that she felt convinced . Therefore her needle flashed surely , delicately , back and forth through the embroidery she was working on a tambour frame . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aye , tricked into this folly ! " Judge Arthur Kenyon 's deep voice rang so loudly down the corridor that Amanda Seymour discovered no difficulty in overhearing his every syllable . " Perhaps then , Your Honor , you will be good enough to explain such an opinion ? " That would be Lieutenant C. M. F. Spottswood , thought Sylvia . Intensely patriotic and excitable , the most violent Secessionist sentiments were ever on his lips . " Young sir , I seldom elaborate upon the reasoning behind my opinions . " The Judge sounded almost disdainful . " In this case , however , I will make an exception . What I mean is that this unhappy movement has been initiated not by the old , established Southern States , saving South Carolina  --  States which have fought two wars for freedom  --  but by a group of selfish , criminally ambitious parvenus from Alabama , Missouri , Mississippi , Louisiana and the western or new part of Georgia . " Captain Seymour 's voice  --  it was still big and strong despite his seventy-odd years  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fail to grasp your meaning . " Someone said , over a sudden drumming of rain against the shutters , " Why , Judge , you 've just named the principle slavery extentionist States . " " Quite so , " the Judge agreed . " What do we see in the far South , in the lower Mississippi Valley but a fixed determination to own more slaves and more land , in order to grow still more cotton , and so amass  | more power and riches ? Why , damn it , we all know well that , for a long while , slaveholding has been on the wane not only in the Border States such as Delaware , Maryland , Kentucky and Tennessee , but in Virginia and North Carolina . " A sudden peal of thunder momentarily drowned out the jurist 's declamation , permitting Sylvia to steal a sidewise look at Irad 's mother . She seemed to be knitting extra-hard and sat bolt upright with lips set in a " prunes , prisms and persimmons " line . " I maintain , suh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed , " and as I fear she will , then she will become a cat's-paw , risking Northern fire to further the selfish schemes of cotton kings and sugar barons . " For a while no one spoke in " the quarterdeck " until Irad from his seat beside Pa 's chart chest inquired , " But surely , Judge Kenyon , you do n't contend that we should go on permitting the North to trample upon our rights ? " " The fulminations of ignorant demagogues to the contrary , " came the even reply , " the North thus far has n't trampled on our rights . Indeed , Irad , for some sixty-five out of the seventy-two years this nation has been independent , the South has controlled Congress and run the Government . " Captain Felix tugged perplexedly at his short white goatee . " Well , then , what 's happened to change everything about so ? " " The South , Felix , that governed so long and so well was the Old South ; a region represented by true patriots and able statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give you boors like Joe Brown and James M. Mason of Virginia , or downright charlatans and political chameleons like Tom Cobb or John Slidell . " A vivid flash of lightning converted the window frames into rectangles of silver-gold . " Let us suppose , Your Honor " ? Lieutenant Spottswood leaned forward , intense and handsome in his naval undress uniform ? " that Virginia remains in the Union . Where will she stand with regard to her Northern neighbors ? As a poor-relation State , sir ! She 'll be considered the very tail of the Union , whereas " ? his voice rose ? " should she elect to secede , she then can join this Great New Confederacy and queen it over all her lovely and valiant Sisters . Indeed , gentlemen , Virginia must stand at the head of the Southern Confederacy. "  | From a waistcoat pocket , Judge Kenyon produced a pair of little scissors with which he commenced very carefully to trim his fingernails . His tone was bitter . " Exactly , Mr. Spottswood . You prognosticate extremely well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzled into accepting a leadership which may very well prove disastrous . " His gaze shifted to Captain Felix 's craggy , brown and mottled-pink features . " I believe myself to be a loyal and patriotic Virginian ; therefore I intend to abide by the will of my fellow citizens and support our arms to the end . " About our willingness to fight I entertain no doubts whatever ? nor on our ability to do so . It is in the quality of the men controlling this new Government that I find the greatest dangers . Consider Jefferson Davis . He is able , no doubt , but possessed of so little loyalty as actively to conspire against the very Government he served while still in office ! What of the Confederate Secretary of the Navy ? " At this all three listeners stiffened , forgot to fan themselves . " Stephen B. Mallory possesses so little education that he ca n't even write a grammatical letter . He 's a second-rate politician from Florida , knows nothing whatever concerning naval matters . " " At least , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Vice President is able ? " " Aye , Alexander Stephens is clever , but do you know that he held out against Secession until the very last minute and only accepted his post with evident reluctance ? " Spottswood frowned . He was n't enjoying this clear summation in the least . " We all hear the Secretary of State , Judah P. Benjamin , is shrewd and extremely able . " " My dear , Mr. Spottswood , shrewd ' is a kindly term for men of Benjamin 's kidney . If it is shrewd to be expelled from Yale for stealing his classmates ' jewelry  --  then I will agree with you . ' " That charge has never been fully substantiated , Arthur , " Captain Seymour objected . The Judge fixed a steady regard on his life-long friend . " I beg to differ , Felix . I was attending Yale at the time . I know that his name was expunged from the rolls , that Benjamin 's abject application for readmission was rejected by the Board of Regents . Why has he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge was now in full cry . " If the Montgomery Convention had possessed a grain of politi- cal acumen , they would have elected Howell Cobb President , or possibly Robert Toombs . Both were Constitutional Unionists back in ' fifty-six . " " They made some pretty poor political choices during our Revolution , yet we seem to have survived . " Captain Seymour arose and in some agitation rang a bell . " Four mint juleps , Phillip , " he instructed the servant . " Be sure to use only young leaves , and make them  --  er  --  convincing . " Thought Irad , eyes narrowed behind steel spectacles , " Pa really has n't made up his mind yet  --  but when he does , he 'll go Virginian . I 've never seen him so upset , so undecided . Good thing he 's too old for active duty . I wonder what Captain Farragut has told him ? Old Davy Farragut 's a Tennesseean , of course , so he 'll likely send in his papers . What 's Pa saying ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals in the Old Army and many excellent naval officers have adhered to the Secessionist Cause . " Pa looked older than usual standing there with his leonine shock of white hair and silvery beard but his jaw line still was jutting and firm . " When it comes to stupidity " ? Captain Felix pointed at a copy of the Norfolk Day Book sprawled across the map chest 's glistening mahogany top ? " Mr. Lincoln must have gone completely mad to issue a call for seventy-five thousand volunteers at a delicate moment like this ! " Irad 's father scrutinized each of his guests in turn . " How dare he summon the citizens of one State to invade the territory of another ? " " That does appear a grave blunder , " Judge Kenyon admitted and , opening an old-fashioned tortoise-shell box , helped himself to a pinch of snuff . A diamond glittered briefly among starched ruffles descending his shirt front . " But what other course could he adopt when South Carolina seizes and destroys Federal property belonging to all the States ? " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's service in the Far East , glared across the room at a row of Polynesian devil masks . Funny , that Irad should , at this instant , recall that the dog with a tiny chip off its scarlet tongue was his ; the other slightly smaller one had always been considered Sam 's . " Legalize and rationalize as you will , gentlemen , hostilities had to start somewhere , " Lieutenant Spottswood observed while lighting a  | paper spill from a lovely Japanese bronze lantern . A mirror behind the light reflecting Spottswood 's buttons cast tiny reflections on the ceiling . " But in the eyes of the world , Colonel Ruffin  --  I understand ' t was he who jerked the lanyard on the first cannon  --  and his supporters used extremely bad judgment . South Carolina stands branded as the aggressor , " the Judge had time to point out , before averting his head to indulge in a very genteel snuff-sneeze . " What does your friend , Captain Farragut , think ? " " I do n't know , Arthur . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to anyone save on official business . " " That 's a damned unpatriotic attitude for a Southerner , " Spottswood broke out . " Even if he is only a Tennesseean . " A small silence ensued , in which the lively thump-thump of a mallet smashing ice for juleps could distinctly be heard . Finally , Captain Seymour heaved erect his short stocky figure ; despite habit and will power , its shoulders were commencing to bend under his seventy-three years . " God knows where this all will end . Where in hell are those juleps ? " he growled . Then , " I presume some unlicked puppy is going to tell me I 'm too old for active service , me who helped open up Japan ! " His gaze wandered to a series of outlandish prints purporting to depict the American arrival at Tokyo Bay . There they were , as seen by Oriental eyes , the United States ships Mississippi , Plymouth , Saratoga and his own vessel , the Susquehanna , all flying huge and absurdly incorrect versions of the Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American sovereignty and honor ! The old man 's throat closed spasmodically as he added , " I 'll volunteer the moment Virginia goes out , but I must say that my heart wo n't be wholly in this quarrel . " " It will be , sir , " Spottswood predicted warmly , " from the minute the Yankee President starts sending his troops across the Virginia line . " Phillip , grave and soft-footed , reappeared bearing a tray of greenly nodding juleps . It was remarkable that no one offered a toast ; they only chatted on trivialities until young Lieutenant Spottswood set down his cup . " That was most delicious , sir , and now , if you 'll excuse me , I will go  | and make my manners to Mrs. Seymour . I must return to the Navy Yard by eleven o'clock . " He smiled bleakly . " Commodore McCauley ' is taking all possible precautions . At your service , sir . " A trifle stiffly , he bowed to Judge Kenyon who surveyed him in obvious distaste before inclining his handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain had ceased and only the water dripping from the chestnut trees caused the pattering sound . Then he touched Irad 's arm . " Care to walk down to the corner ? " " Yes . I  --  I wanted a word with you , Charles . " The air was cooler and from the north , but a damp breeze redolent of the harbor had begun to stir young water oaks and myrtles . Taking care to skirt wide puddles , the two men started towards the river . Spottswood said presently , " I did n't dare tell half of what I know before Judge Kenyon . As a Federal judge , I  --  well , I do n't trust him too far , but let me ask you one thing . If invited , would you be willing to take part in  --  well , attempting to capture the Navy Yard for the South ? " " Yes . I know how badly we 'll need its ordnance and facilities , " came the thoughtful reply . " Have you made any plans ? " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're quite complete . You see , an unusually large number of Southerners are on duty there  --  Ex-Secretary of the Navy Toucey saw to that . There are quite a few of us officers and many of the enlisted men , " he continued , " who are Secesh to the heart and ready to risk all in capturing the Yard . " " I see . " Irad nodded , his gaze following the furtive progress of a cat across Captain Farragut 's narrow lawn . Lights were glowing in most of the rooms . " Charles , what of the ships ? They could blow all Norfolk , Portsmouth and Gosport into rubbish . " " We have little to fear from that direction . They lie purposely undermanned , " Spottswood replied promptly . " The minute Virginia secedes several trainloads of troops will start down from Richmond . Our local militia companies are well armed and craving action . Well , Irad , will you lend a hand ? " " Of course , " came the instant reply . " As a marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Confederacy . You have only to instruct me . " Lieutenant Spottswood grinned and patted him on the shoulder .  | " You 'll soon be hearing from us . " He strode off , the skirts of the blue naval uniform coat snapping briskly about his legs . XXII VARIOUS PLANTINGS ALTHOUGH SHE DESPISED the very sight of a rake or trowel , no one would have suspected that Sylvia Seymour took other than a passionate interest in gardening as , wearing a wide straw hat , gloves and a pretty blue denim apron , she worked over the nasturtium bed old Mrs. Seymour had planted , New England fashion , in a worn-out skiff . " It must be such fun making different sorts of flowers blend together . Only I could never do it anywhere near as cleverly as you . Mamma always doted on heliotrope . It smells simply divine and looks so well with any kind of yellow flowers like  --  like primroses . " Old Mrs. Seymour smiled quietly . " Your mother must be very able to grow primroses so far south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my heliotropes to come up . " She eased herself down on her thin old knees , using a muddied pillow for protection . Sylvia actually put some weight behind her trowel . " Oh , is n't it wonderful to be out-of-doors again after that horrid long winter ? " " It was a long and miserable winter , especially because one could n't escape from the eternal discussion about Secession and war , " Amanda Seymour said , deftly dividing a clump of chrysanthemums . " Wars ! Wars ! Seems as if I 've never known anything else since I married Irad 's father . First it was that expedition against Quallah Battoo . I can see you 've never heard of it . Well , ' t was a punitive expedition against a Malayan sultan , a beastly heathen who had murdered some of our merchantmen . Then came the Mexican War and the troubles with various Spanish American republics  --  so-called . You can thank your lucky stars , my child , you have n't married into the Navy . " " But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Navy wife , " Sylvia said diffidently as she commenced to weed a heart-shaped flower bed .  | It was so cool Sylvia really did n't need her broad-brimmed straw hat , but she recalled that Mamma invariably wore something of the sort when gardening or playing at it  --  the black gardeners really did everything . Before developing the subject of Irad 's future career she deemed it wiser to wait ; to permit Mrs. Seymour to wax enthusiastic over the fine manner in which her beloved sweet peas and nasturtiums were sprouting . " Probably Mrs. Magoffin obtains wonderful results , " Mrs. Seymour was hazarding between thrusts of a hand fork . " I have seen truly magnificent gardens about Wilmington , Charleston and Savannah ; lovely dreamlands they were , but this soil is far from good . It 's either too sandy or too heavy with clay . " " Oh , that 's hard to credit , Mother Seymour . Your flower beds are so exquisite ! " The younger woman 's voice carried conviction and her animated , pointed features were quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . " It 's only a question of enough mulch and peatmoss . No matter where the Captain and I have been stationed , I have been able to produce flowers that none of my neighbors could . " " Of course , it must be the hardest kind of work to raise northern flowers so far south as Pensacola , " Sylvia murmured and , sitting back upon her heels , wiped a beading of perspiration from her upper lip . In so doing she created a small muddy mark which , somehow , pleased Mrs. Seymour inordinately . " You are a dear girl , Sylvia , " she cried softly . " You always seem to guess how to please me . I ca n't tell you how nice it is to have a  --  a daughter take so intelligent an interest in my poor little gardenings . Now be sure you do n't tire yourself , my dear . Your hands are so tiny and soft . You 're to be careful , else you 'll develop blisters . " " Oh , I 'm quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How insufferably humid it must have been in Florida . Irad tells me that you and Captain Seymour were stationed at Pensacola when he was a little boy . " Amanda Seymour 's coral-pink lips relaxed in a smile of reminiscence . " Mercy , yes ! Captain Felix " ? Mrs. Seymour always referred to her husband as such within the family ? " was stationed there as Chief Ordnance Officer during eight years . That was where Irad and Samuel  | learned to speak Spanish . My dear , you never in the world could guess ho taught them the language . " Sylvia knew very well , but it was not her intention to admit that knowledge . Of course , I could n't . Do tell me ! " " None other than Mrs. Mallory , wife of the present so-called " ? she sniffed ? " Secretary of the Rebel Navy . Mrs. Mallory was a charming creature , though a full-blooded Spaniard . Coming from Spain itself , she spoke purest Castilian . " " Is n't that fascinating " ? Sylvia ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy lady like Mrs. Mallory would even remember I rad ? " Firmly , Mrs. Seymour drenched the newly planted chrysanthemum shoots . " Do n't you doubt it ! Manuela made a regular pet of him . " " Then you must have kept in touch with Mrs. Mallory ? " Sylvia inquired softly . Only off and on . Mr. Mallory was n't Navy , you understand . He was editor of the local paper and very able , as I recall . " " I suppose you know , Mother Seymour , that Irad is offering his services to the Confederate Navy ? " Never had Sylvia 's voice sounded richer , more charged with deep emotion . Mrs. Seymour 's petite and straight-backed figure relaxed into a sitting position and the thin shoulders drooped a fraction of an inch . " Yes , Sylvia . I heard what you said a while ago about becoming a Navy wife . " Sylvia dropped her eyes in confusion . Then , " Why did n't you say anything , dear ? " " I wanted time to sort my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She brushed a scattering of pale green leaves from her apron and looked squarely into her daughter-in-law 's great golden-brown eyes . " It comes hard for me to say what I 'm about to say , my dear , because I 'm a New Englander born and bred and I have five brothers who 'll soon be fighting for the Union . There 'd be six of ' em , only one  --  Eliphalet  --  is dead . " " How awful this trouble must be for you , " Sylvia murmured in genuine concern . " It is . I 've been married to a Virginian for near forty years  --  not that I 've often regretted it  --  and during that time I 've set foot in New  | England only twice . So " ? she sighed and looked at her wrinkled , earth-stained hands ? " if my husband and my sons elect to support the Southern view , does it leave me any choice but to support them and give them all the love and comfort I find in me ? " Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic resignation to fate . Impulsively Sylvia rushed over to fling slim arms about the older woman and kiss a very soft and withered cheek that smelt faintly of lilac water . " Dear Mother Seymour , please do n't look so unhappy . I  --  I ca n't bear it . I 'm certain you 'll never regret your decision because " ? her voice now rang rich and true ? " our Southern Cause is righteous , almost holy ! " " I wish I could believe you , " sighed Amanda Seymour . " But I do n't know , I really do n't know . " They fell to gardening again in a silence which endured until at length Sylvia said , " I 've been thinking Irad would be wasted as a mere marine draughtsman assigned to some Navy Yard . I suppose he always has had very original ideas , but some of them were practical enough to interest a shipbuilder in Baltimore . Up there , Irad read and made detailed researches until I used to rage at him because for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My eldest son always was studious . " Mrs. Seymour 's small eyes of faded gray narrowed . From the start she 'd been pleased by Sylvia 's brilliant charm and subtle flattery , although she had n't been the least bit taken in by it . In fact , she had appraised her Georgian daughter-in-law far more accurately than that clever young woman ever suspected . She proved so now . " I presume , my dear , that you would n't object to my writing a letter to Mrs. Mallory , possibly suggesting that her husband find some suitable post for Irad ? " " Why  --  why , yes . " Sylvia stared in round-eyed astonishment . " But how ever did you guess it ? " A fleeting smile was all the answer she got before Amanda Seymour continued , " I believe you were about to remind me that , with Irad 's eyesight being as bad as it is , he could prove far more valuable in the Reb  --  er , Confederate Navy Department rather than superintending construction or trying to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stealing , Sylvia could not have appeared  | more confused , more aghast at having her supposedly secret ambition ins anticipated and exposed . " Why  --  why , yes , " she faltered . " Is that so wrong of me ? " " I did n't say it was wrong , my dear . " Mrs. Seymour gave her daughter 's hand a reassuring pat . " Besides , life for you in the Confederate capital should prove far from dull , especially for a young lady of your particular talents  --  and charm . Why the Rebels picked remote country town ' way off in Alabama for their capital I vow I 'll ever comprehend . " The old lady caught up her rake , commenced to smooth the ground where shortly clumps of bleeding hearts would glow . Sylvia regarded this brisk , wren-like old lady with new respect . " And what else am I thinking ? " " Should n't wonder but you 've calculated that precious few officers of Naval Administration will get themselves killed in battle . " Such insight was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet darkened Sylvia 's cheeks . " Why , I declare ! " she gasped . " I never thought such a thing , really I did n't ! I would n't dream of encouraging Irad to shirk . " ? Tut , my dear . Do n't get your pretty self into such a swivet . I do n't want him killed , either ; not if I can help it , because Sam and Reynolds " ? she broke off , turned abruptly away ? " ca n't be stopped or cozened from sea service , not they ! " XXIII THE CONSPIRATORS LATER THAT SAME day , April the sixteenth , Mr. Mahone , principal proprietor of William Mahone &; Sons , Wholesale Ship Chandlers , lingered in the rear of his well-stocked warehouse in Norfolk . In order that he might personally admit a number of individuals who appeared strolling , oh so innocently , down a back alley , he found tasks to occupy his shipping clerks in the sail lofts on the second story .  | His callers approached , picking a gingerly route along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other marine refuse . By five o'clock there had gathered in Mr. Mahone 's stuffy little private office a group numbering ten men , of whom Irad Seymour could recognize about a half . What with the news of Fort Sumter 's surrender he was feeling more than a little tense and excited and was perspiring under his sober brown frock coat . " Joe , just you go and stand outside the back door , " the merchant instructed his son . " If anything seems amiss , you 'll knock twice , then three times . Understand ? Tom , you 'll not let anyone back of the rear counter , understand ? " All right , gents , find yerselves seats . Reckon there 's enough chairs to go around . " A not-unpleasant blend of odors originating from cordage , pitch , canvas and paint filled the air ; dust motes danced gaily across a beam of golden sunlight that intruded through a shutter to create a glowing puddle in the midst of a table about which the company was seating itself . In rapid succession Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , brown Dundreary whiskers , introduced Commander Robert G. Robb and Lieutenant Spottswood , from the Navy Yard ; they appeared both embarrassed and uncomfortable in civilian garb that was by no means fashionably cut . Present also were a Major Tyler , a quick-eyed silent individual who , only that day , had traveled down from Richmond ; one John McCarthy , Captain of the local militia company ; an assistant editor of the Norfolk Day Book ; and three officials from the muncipalities of Portsmouth and Norfolk . Once the gathering had been presented all around , Mr. Mahone employed a businessman 's directness and plunged quickly into the matter which had caused this oddly assorted group to congregate . Irad felt his pulses quicken . After all these years he was about to enter upon active service ; despite himself , his hand sought the butt of a revolver dragging at his coattail . " Major Tyler , please repeat to these gentlemen what you 've already told me , " said Mr. Mahone . " I came to inform you , " said the Major and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bayonet-sharp mustaches , " that ,  | deleted page  | " He 's the one who 's been refitting the Merrimac , ai n't he ? " demanded a Mr. Fenton , who owned a line of tugs and barges . " Yes . " " But I thought repairs on her were to take a month and more ? " Fenton persisted . " That 's what we reported to Washington , " Spottswood interjected . " But now we 've got to move quickly or Isherwood will get the Merrimac to sea despite all the delays McCauley and the rest of us can invent . " The young naval officer 's somber eyes circled the table . " Come what may , we simply can not allow that ship to escape ! " " Why ? " the militia Captain wanted to know . " Why ! Because the Merrimac is undoubtedly the most powerful single vessel and the most modern , in our ? " he corrected himself , " ? in the Federal fleet . " " Well , then , what 's to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Robb lean forward , elbows on the table . " For one thing , order those misguided zealots who are throwing up batteries on Sewall 's Point and Craney Island to desist . The erection of those works are the most telling argument Isherwood can present towards forcing McCauley to carry out certain defensive measures he was ordered to take over two weeks ago . " Irad could n't help asking , " But , Commander , how dares the Commandant ignore orders like this ? " " The poor devil 's on the horns of a dilemma , " Spottswood explained . " You see , in one breath Washington orders him to defend the Yard and ready the men-of-war for sea ; then in the next he 's instructed to offend Virginia in no way . Which is lucky , damned lucky , for us , I may say . " " Say , Mister Spottswood , what have you in the Navy Yard  --  aside from the ships , I mean ? " drawled Jay Lewis . As became a good newspaperman , he had been listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " Over twelve hundred cannon , some of them modern Paixhans , Columbiads and Dahlgrens . There are mile upon mile of cables , sails enough to fit out a whole fleet , engine parts and propellers of all sizes . Regarding small arms , they are there by the tens of hundreds and ready for use . All this is in 141 addition to huge stores of shot , shell and the finest machine shops and shipyards on this side of the Atlantic . " Commander Robb 's voice quivered and all eyes attached themselves to that big rangy figure dominating this little office . " Gentlemen , we must not fail in securing these supplies  --  and those ships out in the river ! " Dramatically , he swung open a shutter and pointed out of the window at the men-of-war dozing in the distance . " Mr. Ex-Secretary Toucey and the present Northern Government have as good as presented the Confederacy with a ready-made fleet ! " " You bet we 'll take them vessels , " boomed Fenton . " Next we 'll take Washin'ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England . " For several moments the meeting degenerated into a pre-victory celebration . At length , Mr. Mahone rapped for order . " Sure , we 'll take the Yard , gents , but first we 've got to do something to make sure them warships wo n't be towed off if the Yankees suddenly wake up . Right ? " Commander Robb 's assent was vigorous . " Correct . It would prove an easy matter for the Merrimac alone to rescue at least three or four sailing ships or un-manned sloops such as the Germantown and Plymouth . " " We 've one advantage , " added Spottswood . His friend did n't like to be left out of things , Irad noticed . " All the ships-of-the-line lie in ordinary . " " Ordinary ? " inquired Jay Lewis , making notes on the back of an envelope without looking up . " ' In ordinary ' means that a vessel is without a crew , mounts no armament and has had her yards and rigging sent down . " " In other words , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Major Tyler 's dark eyes lit . " I-Iow many ships , sir , are in ordinary ? " " The frigates Raritan , sixty guns ; Columbia , fifty guns ; and the old United States , forty-four . " Spottswood checked off the names on his fingers . " Then there are four line-of-battle ships ; Delaware , seventy-four ; Columbus , seventyfour ; Pennsylvania , one hundred and twenty and the New York ; she 's even more helpless than the rest because she 's in stocks at the moment . " " About how many ships you got ready for sea ? " the freckle-faced  | and tow-haired militia Captain wanted to know . It was clear that he was greatly impressed , but definitely out of his depth . " The Merrimac , forty guns ; the Cumberland , twenty-four ; the Germantown , Plymouth and the brig Dolphin . All of them , the Cumberland excepted , are seriously undermanned or almost without any crew at all . " " Glory be to God , what a rich haul ! " exclaimed Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rung in Richmond and Montgomery . " " Could I point out , Major , that we have n't won them yet ? " was Robb 's wry reminder . " Now , following that line , here 's what we in Gosport must know . What may we expect by way of support ? How many troops can you guarantee ready to move " ? he paused , glowered at a flyblown ceiling ? " say by the twentieth ? " Tyler and Jay Lewis looked startled . " You do n't plan on moving before the twentieth ? I doubt that we can get the troops here until that day , " said Tyler . " No , that wo n't do . I tell you McCauley 's so bewildered and contradicted he 's taken to drink and just babbles . We , the Southern officers , tell him just what to expect . " He squared his shoulders . " Again , Major Tyler , Captain McCarthy , what kind of support may we  --  Captain Rich of the Marine Corps and I  --  expect on the twenti-eth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted the militia Captain , uneasily rumpling his hair . " We just got two companies of local boys who know how to vote and shoot  --  and that 's just about all . " " Cheerful prospect , " grunted Robb . " Can they drill ? " " Hell , no ! Most of ' em wo n't even obey orders lest they argue . " " How many do you number ? " " Mebbe , two  --  three hundert if the weather 's fine . " A slight choking sound escaped Commander Robb , but all he said to Major Tyler was , " And you , sir ? What help will Richmond afford us ? " Major Tyler 's chest again inflated itself . " I feel at liberty to inform you , sir , as a patriotic Southerner that once the Ordinance of Secession is made public , two fully armed and trained companies of Virginia State troops , four hundred men from the Richmond Grays and three companies of Georgia troops , will entrain at Richmond . You , sir , " he bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | of General Talliaferro and Captain Robert B. Pegram , C.S.N. Governor Letcher has  --  er , will  --  designate them to be Army and Navy Commanders over this District . " Two dogs chose that moment to initiate a gloriously noisy fight in the alley outside , which continued until someone , presumably young Mahone , settled the dispute by means of a couple of well-directed kicks . " Does n't seem there 's much to be done , right off , except for two things , " Mahone observed , once the racket had subsided into a series of shrill yelps . " First , this feller Isherwood has got to be shut up no later than tomorrow night . " " You can count on me , " announced the tow-headed militia Captain . " I 'll get the police to rig some charge and run him in . What else ? " " Some hulks ought to be sunk across the Elizabeth River blockin ' the channel , say opposite McPhail 's wharf . " Little Mr. Fenton jumped up . " Say , that ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some wore-out barges and a wuthless of schooner . They 'd be easy to scuttle . Say , when you want ' em sunk ? " " Tonight and without fail , " came Commander Robb 's prompt reply . He mopped at his forehead . It was growing pretty hot in this office , what with all these people present . " It is quite as important that we prevent outside help from coming in as it is to keep those vessels lying off the Navy Yard from escaping . " There ensued an interval during which those present were assigned tasks . " Say , Charles , what about me ? " Irad demanded , a little chagrined at being ignored thus far . " I 'm ready for anything . " Spottswood chuckled . " Eating fire , already , eh ? Well , Irad , the instant the Yard is captured , you 're to lead a party of dockyard people aboard the Merrimac and see that no harm is done . With her we can clear Chesapeake Bay in a week . " Irad blinked behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely upon it , gentlemen , that the Merrimac will be ready for duty when Virginia 's flag climbs above Gosport . " A buzz of excitement circled the table . " You claim that troops from Richmond ca n't possibly arrive here before the twentieth ? " Robb cast Major Tyler a quizzical glance . " The  | twentieth ? That wo n't do at all . " Commander Robb bent over the council table . " As I 've told you , old McCauley has grown timorous , though he was brave enough in his younger years , so I wish there were some way to fool him into believing , tomorrow , that a substantial number of troops has arrived from Richmond . " Mahone 's bald head gleamed to an upward jerk . " Listen , fellows , I think maybe I have an answer . If Captain McCarthy " ? he nodded to the militia Captain , " can fit out a few dozen of his boys in uniform of some kind , then I 'll get Andrews of the Seaboard and Roanoke to couple up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load the cars with volunteers ready to cheer and yell for Jeff Davis loud enough for old McCauley to hear . Will that do the trick ? " Commander Robb thought it would . XXIV HOLOCAUST SLEEP SIMPLY WOULD not come to soothe Sylvia Seymour 's troubled mind . Possibly this was because she missed the warmth and sense of security lent by Irad 's presence in this huge , old-fashioned bed equipping the elder Seymours ' guest room . Possibly it was because Robbie , for once , had become fretful  --  usually he slept as if drugged  --  waking it seemed every hour or so to demand a drink of water . She felt sure there was nothing more serious to blame than a change of food , water and habits . Since the child 's arrival in Norfolk , of course , he had formed a small center of attention . That old Mrs. Seymour should be inordinately proud of her one and only grandchild was only natural , but that Captain Felix should run on as he did was surprising when one considered his usually undemonstrative manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there were no admirals these days  --  and their wives must call to pat the little fellow 's long golden curls and admire his straight back and sturdy legs .  | Or could this restlessness be ascribed to her becoming pregnant ? Although now she felt convinced on the subject , she intended to make no mention of her condition for another twenty-six days . She must be absolutely certain for , on one previous occasion , she had been mistaken , thanks , no doubt , to a bad case of influenza . Besides , Irad was so tense , so overwrought , these days that she hardly recognized in him the self-possessed and methodical person she had lived with going on four years . Not from him but from Charley Spottswood had she learned this evening of the militia 's only partially successful effort to block the channel of the Elizabeth River , of Mr. Isherwood 's mysterious escape from arrest and his flight to Washington on a bay boat . " Some traitor must have warned him , " Irad had declared when the matter came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She squirmed into a more comfortable position but lay more wideawake than ever , staring at a pale , black-crossed rectangle cast on the ceiling by a light on the corner of Charlotte Street . " Of course I ca n't sleep , " she sighed . " Reckon I 'm too excited . Wonder if that handsome Charley Spottswood is right ? Will poor old Commander McCauley surrender the Yard tomorrow morning ? Charley swore everything is arranged for the Virginia troops to take peaceable possession . " She brushed a stray curl from her forehead . " I low wonderful if the transfer comes about without any shooting or killing . " To her vast astonishment she began to experience pangs of increasingly sharp anxiety concerning Irad . Her husband must be among those partisans clutching their weapons , shivering and waiting to deliver an assault if one became necessary . Probably there would be no fighting . If the Federals intended to defend so valuable a property , surely they would have sent more than a tug and the little Pawnee to McCauley 's relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had become twisted into a series of hot and uncomfortable folds . Why , oh , why , could n't she get to sleep and forget all the turmoil , doubts and alarms of the afternoon ? It surprised her to find how clearly she could recall every detail of what had happened since four o'clock . She and Captain Felix had mounted to a gazebo atop the house to see what was chancing over  | in Gosport . From the " widow 's walk " ? as old Mrs. Seymour called it ? an excellent view of the harbor , of the river , and of even Hampton Roads , could be obtained and through use of the old officer 's powerful spyglass few movements remained hidden from the watchers . Old Mrs. Seymour had been all of a twit because it was seldom indeed that Captain Felix took more than a single julep or glass of wine before the midday meal . Today , however , he had taken to muttering to himself and gulping down such quantities of that old seafarer 's drink , rum and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unhealthy pinkish gray . Hardly had they climbed the gazebo ladder than he uttered a sharp exclamation . " Look ! Look , Sylvia , look ! Look at the Pennsylvania ! Am I crazy , or is she low by the head ? " Obediently Sylvia had raised her own little spyglass . Irad 's father was quite right . It seemed that the great hull was slanting , her triple row of white stripes towards the surface . " God in heaven ! " gasped the old man . " She 's sinking ! " " Look ! Look ! " Sylvia cried . " Are n't those small boats pulling away from the Germantown ? What does that mean ? " A whistling groan escaped Captain Felix . He put down his spyglass and with both hands clutched the lookout rail . Curiously Sylvia stared , watching the old man 's shoulders commence to shake under his blue coat , then to heave as he bowed his head . " Oh , my God ! Those dirty , lily-livered cowards are scuttling the fleet ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Oh , Sylvia ! Sylvia ! I 've lived too long . " He commenced to sob . " Oh , G-God , please strike them d-dead ! They 're murdering those beautiful ships . T-there 's my last command  --  the Plymouth . " The trig little sloop 's topmasts were assuming an ever-increasing slant to port , but , before she could roll over , the Plymouth had reached the bottom and so came to rest with decks awash , amid a mad tangle of floating gear . Her fighting tops and spars remained undamaged . Cursing softly in savage undertones that employed many foreign words , Captain Felix grabbed out a blue bandanna . He said brokenly , " McCauley 's accomplished what no naval power on earth could do ! Sunk a whole American fleet . I  --  I guess I ca n't see ? Sylvia , take my  | glass and tell me . Have the dastards harmed the Merrimac ? Where is she ? " " Tied to the granite wharf ? Ah , I see her now . She seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney . " " Funnel , " absently corrected the stricken old man , " or ' stack , ' if you must . " " Father , which are those huge ships moored nearest to the point ? " " The near one 's the Columbus . The far one 's the Delaware . " " They 're going down , too . " All over the Elizabeth River estuary , ships were sinking . One after the other , more than a dozen men-of-war commenced to settle , some by the head , some by the stem . Captain Felix turned aside and commenced to growl , " As a Southerner I  --  I suppose I should rejoice , but thank God I 've never before seen the American flag go down without some sort of a fight . What miserable cravens they must have in the Navy Department nowadays . Imagine six millions ' worth of ships lost without a shot fired in their defense or even an attempt made to tow them away ! " It was then that Sylvia noticed that the great liner Pennsylvania had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two of her three white streaks showing above the debris-littered river . So it was also with the other line-of-battle ships ; the frigates as a rule managed to keep spar and quarterdecks and foc'sles above the surface . Sylvia demanded breathlessly , " Why do n't those vessels sink out of sight ? " " Because they ca n't sink any further , " the veteran snuffled through his handkerchief . " The river 's too damned shallow . " Angrily Captain Felix dashed aside tears of mortification , recovered his heavy , brass-bound telescope from Sylvia and once more surveyed the scene . " The Federal commanders over there in Gosport are not only knaves but bunglers , which is worse , " he snapped . " Despite everything , McCauley is making the South a really handsome present . " " I wonder where the militia is ? " Sylvia inquired . " Should n't they be attacking the Yard ? " " I ca n't imagine ! Now is the moment for such action . " In black throngs the people of Norfolk and Portsmouth could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on piers and wharfs like  | gigantic insects . Others crowded rooftops or went sailing out in small boats and yachts to watch the last Federal crews go rowing ashore . Why had neither the Cumberland nor the Merrimac shared the general fate of the squadron ? There seemed no plausible explanation save that the powerful batteries of the latter vessel could be made useful in covering a retreat . The Merrimac lay secured to a wharf near the drydock from which she had emerged only a few days previously . " At least she is going to make a run for it , " predicted Captain Felix soberly . " Probably she 'll take aboard the crews of the scuttled ships and then try to tow out the Cumberland . " How still it was at this hour ! Sylvia realized that , in reconstructing the afternoon , she had all but fallen asleep . Where was Irad likely to be right now ? She knew now she loved him  --  and dearly . She sighed . Tomorrow , if the Navy Yard had n't surrendered , a general attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived . Mr. Mahone 's stratagem concerning the pseudo-troop trains had succeeded to perfection , convincing poor , addled , rum-soaked Commander McCauley that overwhelming forces were at hand a full day before the first company actually arrived from Richmond . Towards sundown the wildest kind of rumors spread like water spilt on a hardwood floor . McCauley had committed suicide ; Northern and Southern naval officers were shooting one another ; a part of the Navy Yard had already fallen into Southern hands . Sylvia finally lapsed into a light doze which must have lasted longer than she thought for when Robbie next wailed it was after four o'clock . She went down to warm some milk which had the desired effect for the child sank promptly into peaceful slumber . Once more wide-awake , Sylvia sought a window facing the doomed Navy Yard . The reassuring possibility occurred that a transfer of authority might already have taken place . Perhaps the Federals had surrendered ? Not to know just what was going on proved galling . She hoped Irad was using good sense in the matter of exposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place over yonder . There were a lot of lights , far more than normal , glowing at the Navy Yard . She strained her eyes in the general vicinity of the scuttled ships  | and , by the clear starlight , seemed to distinguish a great many dark objects pulling about on the river . Suddenly , from the midst of those sombre islands created by the sunken fleet , what resembled a miniature comet appeared , climbed up , up , up into the sky until it burst into a frightening and garish splash of scarlet-gold flame . " Why would the Yankees be sending up rockets at a time like this ? " Sylvia wondered while gathering her nightrobe more closely about her . A terrible explanation was not long in presenting itself . It looked as if the whole of Gosport were taking fire all at once . With the speed of a wind-fanned forest fire , flames soared into dazzling eminence not only throughout the Navy Yard , but among the scuttled ships as well . Sheer terror froze Sylvia a long instant , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nightshirt , cap and all , and came arunning with a cocked boarding pistol in either hand . " What 's wrong ? Tell me , what 's wrong ? " shouted the old man . " Where is he ? " But Sylvia could only stand shaking , pointing numbly towards Gosport . Mother Seymour , pulling a cloak about her , came running down the corridor but stopped dead when she saw a throbbing pink highlight outlining her daughter-in-law 's cheek . " Well , seems as if there 's a fire somewhere , " Mrs. Seymour observed quite calmly , putting an arm about Sylvia . " Let 's not get excited . " ' here have been such fires before . " She was wrong . Never would anyone who lived through the next three hours again behold anything approaching the conflagration which grew , and spread until it bathed the whole city , the bay and even distant Newport News in a cruel , blood-colored glare . Captain Seymour turned , muttered something , then pulled on an old watch coat and went toiling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In neighboring houses and from various slave quarters arose frightened wails and questioning shouts . The town 's alarm bells wakened at last to fling their fearful , nerve-shaking clamor into the night . Lights blinked on , terror-stricken householders in night clothes ran out into the streets under the impression that the conflagration was near at hand . Children howled and men  --  volunteer firemen for  | the most part  --  commenced dashing off into the dark , shouting , dragging on their clothes as they went . To old Captain Seymour 's haggard eyes the scuttled ships suggested so many South Sea island volcanos spewing flame , sparks and smoke high into the heavens . He saw the consuming element run up a battleship 's weathered shrouds , then race out along her yards revealing them as if penciled in glowing gold . Stunned , utterly aghast , he watched the end of the mighty Pennsylvania as she lay revealed to the least detail by fire spouting from her more than one hundred gunports . Vessels such as the Dolphin , the Germantown and the Plymouth , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails , burned with an especial brilliance . Like great flaming birds , huge shreds and tatters of burning canvas , propelled by the incandescent gases , went soaring upwards only to be overtaken and passed by smaller brands . " Those yellow swine have fired the ship houses and barracks , " Captain Felix muttered to himself . " Have they ? Yes , there goes the rope walk , too . " Similar to but infinitely larger than that rocket which had initiated this terrifying holocaust , balls of combustible gas commenced to burst into blinding glory so high above that sea of flame engulfing Gosport that they illuminated all of lower Chesapeake Bay . " That will be the turpentine , benzine and coal-oil stores going up , " Felix Seymour told himself . " My God , what 'll happen if the magazines explode ? If they take fire there 'll surely be a long column of souls applying for admission to Heaven . " As if some pyrotechnical competition were under way , each ship and building appeared to be attempting to out-flame its neighbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seymour called from the foot of the ladder . " Why , why  --  she 's safe . No ! Oh-h my God ! She 's afire too ! " His voice broke . To think that the Merrimac , the glorious Merrimac , pride of the United States Navy was about to die like Caesar  --  stabbed in the back . As in a nightmare , he watched the little Pawnee , assisted by the Navy tug Yankee , lash herself alongside the Cumberland , and commence to tow that tall frigate out into the channel and towards the obstructions off the Naval Hospital . Successive explosions momentarily silhouetted these fugitives to the  | ultimate detail , then they were revealed in full color , their disgraced Union flags fluttering crazily this way and that under the influence of violently conflicting air currents . The stumpy masts of the Columbus suddenly commenced to rock in deathly paroxysms until they fell overside , generating huge billows of rose-colored steam . Towards midday of April the twentieth , only the charred ribs and a few blackened spars remained above water to mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gosport Navy Yard 's combustible buildings had resolved themselves into piles of white-hot coals giving off trailing tendrils of gray-blue smoke . Three facts of prime importance became known to everyone in Norfolk . The priceless granite drydock was still in existence . Some Southern sympathizer was reported , at the very last instant , to have severed the fuse leading to a series of mines which would have blown it sky-high . Secondly , nine millions of dollars ' worth of heavy ordnance , chain , armor plate , ammunition and small arms , had not been consumed and so had survived to arm the new Confederacy . Finally , at daybreak , Lieutenant C. M. F. Spottswood had hoisted the handsome white and blue banner of Virginia to that same signal mast from which the Stars and Stripes had been flying for nearly a hundred years .  | The Turbulent Mississippi QUEEN OF THE SOUTH IN MID-MAY THE sun beats down upon New Orleans and the shipyards across the Mississippi at Algiers with an enervating severity which discourages , probably wisely , any activity during the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours had goaded Lachlan Brunton , Chief Construction Engineer for Hughes &; Company 's Algiers Yard , into many a futile outburst at easygoing subcontractors . At this rate the Confederate Navy cruiser Sumter would never be built and ready for commissioning by the middle of June . To stride about the shipyard pleading with mechanics and shipwrights to go back to work proved futile ; they simply would n't stir out of the shade while heat waves shimmered , danced and blurred the towers and steeples of New Orleans across the turgid Mississippi . " Ah , well , a mon canna fashion a rope out of sand nor make vinegar taste like whiskey . " Eventually he 'd shrugged and , being an eminently sensible fellow , had taken to seeking the welcome coolness of a palmetto-thatched coffee shop situated not very far from the shipyard . I  --  Iere he would sit fanning himself and looking out over the river , or contemplating the razed hulk of that fast little steamer which , until the war began , had fetched passengers and Cuban fruit to New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Thoughtfully Brunton surveyed spiderweb-like clumps of rigging created by idle coasting ships and brigs . Further downstream ten or eleven river boats had been tied up for lack of trade with the North and so lay idle , the rust growing brighter each day on their cold twin smokestacks . Considerably more than a month seemed to have elapsed since he had arrived by rail from Baltimore with the ink barely dry on his contract and good gold dollars dragging at his money belt . During this period many changes , subtle but indicative of the future , had taken place . Each day more river steamers came panting down the Mississippi from the Red , the Yazoo and the Alabama with gunnels nearly awash under stacks of cotton bales which no one would buy ; already the levees , sheds and warehouses were filled to overflowing . Consequently the number of smoke clouds hanging over the river were fewer and all except local traffic had thinned to a depressing trickle . For some reason beyond the comprehension of Brunton and many astute Louisianans the authorities at Richmond  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlawing the export of cotton for fear of offending England and France , were employing every other means at their disposal to prevent shipment abroad of the precious stuff . Naturally , this absurd embargo enraged numerous neutrals who could easily elude the shaky and newly applied Federal blockade . " We will cotton-starve the Britishers , " reasoned Jeff Davis , " until they send for King Cotton with men-of-war . The Yankees will try to stop them , a fight and a declaration of war will then follow and the South will find the British Navy at her disposal . " Except for one consideration , Brunton deemed this to be a logical bit of reasoning . New Orleans , the young Scot had discovered to be as distinctive from other American cities as an egret among a flock of crows and was becoming increasingly fascinated by this great , sprawling metropolis and its polylingual many-hued population . For instance , he experienced considerable difficulty in making himself understood by Madame Boileau , in whose boarding house on Dryades Street he had rented a large bedroom , cool because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow balcony of cast-iron from which he could view not only the narrow and  | generally noisy thoroughfare below , but also the roofs and spires of the city . About a great port such as this it stood to reason that he would encounter many Englishmen and Scots , mostly in shipping . Many , however , had become merchants or professional men . It was the first category which raged loudest and most bitterly against the Davis embargo on cotton shipments . At the Anglo-Caledonian Club , a beet-complexioned sea captain had effectively summed up their bewilderment . " Why do n't the Rebels rush as much cotton abroad as fast as they can ? Then , instead of rotting along the levees , it 'll build their credit over in Europe which they 'll need when the Yankees tighten their blockade about the mouths of the Mississippi . " No one could offer a satisfactory explanation , but certain potbellied and well-bejeweled cotton brokers remained smug of expression ; they knew the answer but were n't going to tell . Mr. Davis intended cotton prices to rise mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although there were above two million on hand ! In fact , the Richmond Government was advising planters , to their pained surprise , not to plant cotton this year but corn and other foodstuffs instead . A world cotton shortage , and a severe one , was about to occur if the Confederate Government had its way . Brunton 's humid meditations were interrupted by the appearance of a big , loose-jointed individual wearing a nondescript uniform coat . More than a little drunk , he came swaggering into the coffee house glaring about at the patrons and tapping significantly on the butt of a huge pepper-box revolver thrust along with a bowie knife into a wide rawhide belt . " Ifiin yer ai n't showin ' yer colors , I 'm sellin ' these cheap , " he boomed , waving a dirty handful of crudely stitched red , white , red rosettes , the accepted Confederate design . He won only disdainful looks for , almost without exception , the patrons were wearing miniature Stars and Bars flags on their lapels . He came clumping over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Pears like this hyar 's a right loyal lot . " He swayed on booted feet . " Say , Mister , why ai n't you displayin ' yer sentiments ? " The Scot smiled , delved into a pocket and produced the cockade he had bought several days ago in self-defense.  | " There you are . " " Well , then , just you put it on ! " the vendor growled . " Yer wastin ' a patriotic bearcat 's time . " Without waiting to see whether Brunton obeyed , the shaggy fellow tramped out , his huge figure momentarily darkening the entrance . From up the street came strains of martial music which swelled until everyone ran out of the cafes to stand in the sunshine and cheer a file of youths in gaudy blue and yellow uniforms . They appeared , strutting behind a six-piece brass band . One of them perspired heavily under a placard reading , " Volunteers for the Louisiana Tigers ! Join up before the fight is over ! " A horde of wild-looking , barefoot and screeching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stars and Bars , a flag which , strangely and tragically , resembled the now well-hated Federal ensign . Its design consisted of two very broad red stripes separated by a single equally broad white one and a bright blue square in the canton corner . In this canton anywhere from six to nine white stars were arranged in a circle . " Vive les engages ! " A handsome young woman  --  Creole by her dark complexion  --  caught up a bouquet she had been carrying and tossed its pink roses , forget-me-nots and cornflowers to a black-bearded lieutenant marching at the head of the volunteer detail . He broke step , and halted on the curb to bow , lift his kepi and blow the Creole girl a kiss . It was all very debonair and gallant . Brunton had followed the proprietor out onto the sidewalk . Never was there such tireless enthusiasm , he decided . At any time , any day the Orleannais would drop everything to run out , wave , cheer and throw flowers at a military procession , no matter how unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . Some were clad in rich and elegant garments while others slouched along under threadbare coats such as law or banking clerks might wear . The rear was brought up by perhaps three dozen swaggering , gap-toothed and sinewy fellows , beyond doubt the wildest-looking individuals Brunton thus far had encountered in America . Their belts and occasional bandoliers fairly bristled with weapons . They were not tall , but bandylegged , and wore their tangled hair so long that it tumbled , mane-like , over their leather-clad shoulder blades .  | As they went swinging by , Brunton noted that these fellows , without exception , were sallow , hollow of cheek and so restless of eye that they suggested newly trapped wildcats . Although a few wore ungainly big boots , a majority marched on dusty and callused bare feet . These last volunteers lugged long-barreled Kentucky hunting rifles , fowling pieces or even antique flintlocks . Not a few carried Indian war hatchets jammed into their belts of rawhide . One volunteer , Brunton noticed , was equipped with no less than four hand guns of patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose above the shifting reddish road dust . " Hurray for Gov'ner Moore an ' Jeff Davis ! " " Down with the Abolitionist bloodsuckers ! " " Wive Beauregard ! " Once the column had disappeared down a side street the cafe patrons returned unconcernedly to their tables , recovered newspapers and commenced noisily to sip strong black coffee grown cool during their absence . In rising impatience Lachlan Brunton glanced at an horloge ticking placidly above the patronne 's sleek black head . Full-bosomed to an almost alarming degree , Madame Bonnecaz possessed , in addition to alert and beady black eyes , a mustache more imposing than most of those shading the lips of certain youths at present on their way to join the Louisiana Tigers . Only two o'clock . Damn , not until three would there be any use in returning to Hughes ' shipyard , so Brunton fished out of his pocket a copy of Grantham 's Iron Shipbuilding and from between its pages plucked a blue telegraph form , every word of which he knew by heart . Dated Illinoistown , April fifteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ON WAY . LOVE . CHRISTINA . Why , oh , why , had n't she amplified that message ? What mischance could have befallen her ? Nothing short of disaster would impel her to come without being sent for  --  he understood her that well . Since her telegram 's arrival nearly a month had elapsed and the mail clerk at Mr. Hughes ' shipyard was waxing facetious over Brunton 's oft repeated queries concerning a further message . Why should Tina apparently have left Baltimore so precipitately , and so soon after his own departure ? Again , why should so dependable a little person not have appeared within a reasonable length of time ,  | or have failed to communicate further ? When he considered her character this silence proved more than a little frightening . He had prepared a letter to be dispatched to Tina the instant he obtained an address . In part , he had written in his crabbed Scottish fist : My decision to come to New Orleans has proved a wise one , I think . Here there exist facilities for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , my own heart , the day of the wooden vessel is past , as I told you once in Baltimore .

By use of studious application and industry combined with foresight , I feel convinced that riches lie within my grasp . For the moment iron still is cheap and easy to come by , but this situation can not last long . There is a rolling mill to be built at Baton Rouge . The people of New Orleans are easygoing and friendly . Foreigners like ourselves are numerous and hardly noticed . You will be glad to know that many Germans have settled and do business here . They form an important and respected segment of this community . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table before him . He jumped to his feet . " Losh , Commander Farrand , this is indeed an unexpected pleasure ! " Although he wore the brand-new gold and gray insignia of the Confederate Naval Service  --  two broad stripes on the cuff and two gold stars on either shoulder strap  --  Commander Farrand , like so many others had been forced to attach them to his old uniform of Federal blue , the Army having long since gobbled up every shred of cloth approaching any shade of gray . Commander Eben Farrand , Senior Commissioner of the Confederate Navy Department in New Orleans , stood medium tall and was distinguished by thin , black-dyed hair and side whiskers . One of his mahogany-tinted cheeks had been bisected by a long white scar inflicted by the same keen weapon , a Mexican machete , which had driven a deep nick into the point of his chin . " I trust , Mr. Brunton , that I do not intrude upon your leisure ? "  | " Not at all , sir ; indeed , I welcome your company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ye ken , but  --  can nothing be done to keep the carpenters at work during midday ? " Commander Farrand seated his generous body , at the same time heaving a sigh eloquent of disgust . " No , and I wager you wo n't be pleased to learn that three more of your best engineers have listened to Army blandishments and are off to win laurels before the ration runs out . " The aged naval officer 's handsome head wagged slowly . " Silly fools seem fearful this war , will be won before they can get their pot shot at some Yankee . Here , boy ! " Farrand beckoned a waiter and ordered a brace of juleps although the Scot attempted to refuse . " In all frankness , Mr. Brunton , tell me about the Sumter 's engines ; are they really worthless ? " " No . Such as they are , Commander , they are perfectly sound , " came the prompt reply . " But , mon , they 'll not develop near enough horsepower to meet the demands o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her top decks , shortened her spars and cut out her cabins . " The waiter reappeared bearing not only the juleps but also a great dish of chinquapins and almonds . Although the naval officer lifted his frosty glass in a silent toast Brunton kept right on talking ; it was n't always you came across a senior officer willing to listen to a mere civilian . " On the other hand , Commander , we must allow for the weight not only of those thick beams installed to support the guns and their carriages , but also that of the ammunition and the other supplies a man-of-war carries on a long cruise . " Farrand 's brow fell into wrinkles and absently he ran fingers through flowing and well-dyed sideburns . " Speaking of supplies , Mr. Brunton , " he lowered his voice , " is it true that the Sumter will not be able to stow coal for more than eight clays of steady steaming ? " While sampling Commander Farrand 's hospitality , Brunton nodded , wondering just how many hundreds of persons , Federal spies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient bunker capacity . " What , sir , " pursued the older man , " were you able to devise for boiler protection ? I 'm told you have met with difficulties . "  | " Difficulties ! " snorted Brunton . " Ye may well say that ! JIr . Roy and I have combed not only this city but Baton Rouge as well in search of iron plates . There are none to be had , saving miserable threequarter or one-inch thicknesses which give no adequate protection . " A gray and red parrot in a cage behind the cashier 's rostrum commenced to burble , then tactlessly to sing a few bars of " Yankee Doodle . " The patronise rushed to drop a silencing cloth over the offender . " Therefore , " Brunton continued , " I have devised a scheme of securing iron bars close together in oak frames . Such an arrangement will not stop solid shot of heavy calibre , but it will prevent shell fragments from reaching the boiler . " The waiter , a gaunt slave , was perspiring heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , additional juleps , crisp and most delectable of aroma . To Brunton 's surprise , Commander Farrand frowned , and remained lugubrious . " Alas , my friend , now that ice ships will be prevented from coming south , I fear we will not be enjoying many more of these lovely potations . Ah , well , sufficient unto the day ' ? I suppose . To your very good health , Mr. Brunton , which I offer in all sincerity . Captain Semmes has described the marvels of ingenuity you have devised . Now about contriving a carriage for the pivot gun ? " A brief silence ensued , since they both knew that no such thing as a carriage for a powerful eight-inch rifle existed nearer than Gosport and transportation from the East was cruelly slow and uncertain . Brunton produced the stub of a pencil and commenced a sketch on the back of a menu . " Mr. Roy and I have been thinking that the only iron in plentiful supply heareabouts is railroad rails . Now we 've the notion that at the Leeds ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable carriage  --  maybe something of this nature . " He offered a rough but clear and proportionate drawing of what he intended . Immediately the Navy Department 's Commissioner brightened . " By God , sir , this seems feasible . Have you informed Captain Semmes ? " A flush of pleasure climbed towards the small Scot 's flaming hairline . " Not yet , sir . I must feel more satisfied that this design is practical and contains no hidden errors . Yon poor gentleman already has met  | with far too many disappointments ; what with our broadside guns a month overdue from Gosport , with our best shipwrights joining the Army , and , saving your presence , Commander , no competent direction from Richmond . " Farrand absently tinkled the ice in his drink and at the same time fanned away a nimbus of persistent flies . " Do n't imagine that we higher-ups have n't even heavier problems  --  worse for being on a larger scale . " While watching the progress of a tug towing a series of lumber rafts upstream , Commander Farrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana . For one thing , they had discovered a dearth of merchantmen suitable for conversion to men-of-war ; next , there were in the vicinity of New Orleans no iron mills suitable for rolling armor plate over an inch and a half thick . When a clock in the tower of a church struck three mellow , richly sonorous notes , Commander Farrand sighed , commenced to do up the gold buttons of his double-breasted blue tunic . " May I ask ye a question , sir ? " Brunton inquired . " A dozen if you wish . I notice you 've a purpose behind them . " The Scot settled back onto his chair  --  at the shipyard they never made trouble over late returners  --  and fixed brilliant blue eyes on Farrand 's scarred countenance . " Can ye not persuade Captain Semmes to delay till I can devise a hoisting gear for his propeller ? Ye see , sir , the Sumter will move fast enough with the screw at work under a full head of steam , but remember yon cruiser carries dangerous little coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail alone . I need not point out that the drag exerted by an idle propeller is not trivial . " The Commissioner held up a hand . " Please say no more on the subject , sir . While Captain Semmes and I quite agree with you , he holds orders from Richmond to get to sea at the first possible moment , before more than a token blockade seals the mouths of the Mississippi . " Undaunted , Brunton persisted . " But , sir , do ye credit that the Yankees can blockade effectively ? At last report the Federals had less than twenty-four men-of-war o ' all classes available for such duty and is not the Confederacy 's seacoast three thousand miles long ? "  | Earnestly he studied the Commissioner . " Tell me , sir , is it not worth losing a few weeks to send the Sumter to sea at her best ? " Farrand tossed a new Confederate bank note upon the marble and zinc-topped table . " Since you are not a naval officer , Mr. Brunton , " said he stiffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a naval officer receives an order he complies , promptly and without question . " II C.S.S. Sumter TIED UP AT Mr. Hughes ' construction dock that craft which was to become the Confederate States cruiser Sumter appeared depressingly small and inoffensive . This was so because only the stumps of three masts stood , her funnel was rusty and her superstructure had been only partially rebuilt . All the same she was designed along speedy lines . Of only four hundred and thirty-seven tons burden , the new cruiser was one hundred and eighty-four feet long by thirty feet in her beam . In addition to barque-rigged sails , she was propelled by a single fixed screw driven by a horizontal , direct-acting engine . Due to the inventive bent of Messers Rov and Brunton , she had been blessed with a collapsible smokestack which might swiftly be lowered to permit the quick manipulation of her lower canvas . By the fifteenth of Mav , 1861 , any onlooker  --  not necessarily a Southern sympathizer , either  --  could note that this former passenger ship 's bulwarks had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just forward of the smokestack , the carpenters further were completing a platform designed to support a long-range , deadly eight-inch rifled gun , if such a piece of ordnance ever did arrive from Norfolk . As usual , Captain Raphael Semmes , stiffly erect , though in civilian clothes and wearing a broad-brimmed leghorn hat , prowled about his incompleted vessel . Occasionally his leonine shock of gray-streaked  | black hair stirred in a gentle breeze beating up the Mississippi from Pass a l'Outre , one of river 's three principal exits . Far below decks , Lachlan Brunton , greasy and sweat-bathed from efforts to recondition the engines , could hear Semmes ' deep voice saying , " Mr. Kell , pray present my compliments to Mr. Yaggy at Leeds ' Foundry and ask him why , in Heaven 's name , they have n't yet delivered my water casks ? Also , you 're to warn him that I must have those copper tanks for the powder magazine tomorrow , no later . Mr. Hughes says he ca n't get ahead with the berth deck till we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , the sun poured its rays onto the shipyard , intensifying the cleanly pungent odors of pitch , fresh-sawed timber , hemp and rosin . As usual , crowds of visitors , men , women and children , had taken the Algiers ferry from New Orleans in order to picnic and view this , the first vessel built to show a Confederate flag on the high seas . These onlookers did not hesitate to question the shipwrights , to come aboard and look about as much as they pleased . Despite Captain Semmes ' angry pleas , no attempt was being made to guard the vessel beyond the posting of a few somnolent militia sentries over the more aluable materials . Captain Semmes was utilizing a red silk handkerchief to mop his high and slightly protuberant forehead when he noted a flash of blue and gold from his post of vantage on the Sumter 's nearly completed quarterdeck . At the shipyard gate two militiamen on duty had roused themselves from conversation with a group of women and presented arms with a lack of precision that wrung Semmes ' heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than walked , through the yard , and smartly saluted the Stars and Bars flying above Mr. Hughes ' main office . Picking a course among piles of cordage , chain and lumber , the stranger advanced to the foot of the gangway . Um . Would the newcomer salute the quarterdeck of an uncommissioned man-of-war ? If he did , he would be merely a reservist . There the newcomer merely paused , deliberately surveyed the vessel a moment , then hitched his sword higher and , grasping its scabbard , strode lightly up a laborers ' gangplank and onto a deck littered with piles of sawdust and odds and ends of lumber . Now Semmes was able to obtain his first clear impression of this  | solid-appearing young officer , a lieutenant by his single star and two stripes ; he 'd be nearing thirty years of age . Now he was climbing the quarterdeck companion , white-gloved hands bright in the blinding sunlight . " Good day , sir . Can you direct me to Captain Semmes ? " " I am he . " " I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new arrival 's smart salute was a hallmark of the professional . " Lieutenant Samuel Seymour , sir , reporting for duty . " " Your orders , please ? " Captain Semmes demanded , once he had returned the courtesy . A white-gloved hand disappeared beneath Lieutenant Seymour 's double-breasted blue tunic and reappeared with a document secured by a single strand of red tape . Piercing gray eyes narrowed against the glare of sunlit paper , Semmes read the orders with care . " Very good , Mr. Seymour , and where are your effects ? " " Aboard the receiving ship , Star of the West , sir . " " Very good , Mr. Seymour , glad to have you aboard . Please report yourself to my Executive , Mr. Kell . He will explain your duties as First Prize Master . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Seymour was turning away when Semmes checked him , at the same time relaxing his formal manner . " You were one of Johnnie Maffitt 's prize captains , were you not ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Maffitt at present ? " " At Port Royal , I believe , sir . He was sent down to assist Commodore Tattnall in fitting out a squadron . " " He was well when you last saw him ? " " His health was excellent , sir , " replied the erect figure in the blue of the Old Navy . " He is determined to see that our Navy gets off to a good start . " The cursing of some riggers attempting in vain to fit small-boat davits into the Sumter 's very narrow rail rang loud in the heated air . A look of distaste ruffled the serenity of Captain Semmes ' expression . " Very good , Mr. Seymour . " He ran a finger around his sodden collar . " Oh , on second thought , you had best report back to the  | receiving ship , but you have my permission to secure quarters in the city . " " Aye , aye , sir . However , I would prefer ? " The floppy brim of Semmes ' leghorn hat became twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star of the West is overcrowded and I hear a case of yellow jack has been reported aboard . Ca n't jeopardize trained officers . That will be all , Mr. Seymour . " III THE RIVER BOAT Silver Wing DARK HAD FALLEN before the last of the freight accumulated in mounds on the wharf of Illinoistown  --  later to become East Saint Louis  --  had been manhandled aboard by chanting Negro stevedores . The river steamer Silver Wing was fairly new and so smart that each of her twin stacks , mounted abreast , was surmounted by an elegant crown cut from sheet iron . The points of these ornaments flared boldly outward like a morning-glory blossom , and so blew a million glowing sparks straight up into the sky . Anticipating quick departure , gangs of half-naked slave stokers had begun to toss logs into the furnaces . " Quit scratchin ' yerselves , you lazy black bastards , and git humpin ' . Captain 's hollerin ' fer a full head of steam , " the second engineer was bellowing , his hickory shirt already darkened by sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're shovin ' off a hour late , " the engineer explained to his chief oiler . " Christi We 're ridin ' deeper than ever I see , but the Old Man will raise hell if we do n't turn up sixteen knots . What he do n't know about engines would fill a big book ! " Like the rest of the officers of the Silver Wing , the second engineer was impatient to cast loose ; as never before speed meant money and time was of the essence for all hands . Because war clouds were piling up in the East ever more ominously , every steamboat owner , captain  | and crew on the Mississippi and its tributaries , was out to get in as many trips as possible before the storm broke and free navigation came to an end . Of course the wildest kind of rumors were prevalent here in Illinoistown and even more so across the river in St. Louis . Over there street fighting was expected to break out at any moment and everywhere in Missouri black people went creeping about in fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities were building all manner of forts and batteries further downstream . Soon they would permit no Northern vessels to pass . On the other hand , everyone swore that the Unionists were planning to build some iron-clad gunboats , a whole fleet of them , with which to convoy their trade down to New Orleans . Only yesterday a squad of blue-clad soldiers , gawky , self-conscious militiamen fresh from enlistment with the Illinois State Government , had appeared to guard the steamboat landings . To a final rumbling of hand trucks and the thud of freight being dumped in a hurry , splintery gangways were hauled up into a vertical position on board and hawsers sent slithering over the rail like hairy brown serpents . After a few steamy discords the Silver Wing 's calliope commenced to blare , " Columbia , the Gem of the Ocean . " The middle " E " whistle got stuck and screeched like a damned soul in torment , but the operator  --  none dared call him a musician  --  kept blithely on playing the vessel out into the River . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great stern wheel commenced to splash , sent the creaking of the Silver Wing 's fabric into a rhythmic tempo . Captain McEnnis was justifiably proud of his command . Being comparatively new , only ten years old , she did n't groan and complain about the speed asked of her . After cutting a chew of his plug of " eatin ' " tobacco , he turned to a pilot busily twirling the six-foot wheel . " Mister , this trip I aim to fetch N'Awlins in a big hurry . Make it in five days and there 'll be a hundred dollars extry for you and ver mate , so look alive . " The pilot 's shaggy head inclined . " Gim me th ' speed , Mac , then me and Luther will fetch her in on tiptoes . " Captain McEnnis whistled down the speaking pipe to the engine room . " Elmo ? Yer to drive this old hooker like a bat outer hell , " he an- nounced . " Make them heavers o ' yourn hump themselves even if you have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable satisfaction that presently he surveyed a mass of humanity jamming the Silver Wing 's foredeck . By God and by gravy , the profits of this run promised even to surpass the small fortune earned by his last trip . Stacked aboard was more than a capacity cargo of machinery , lumber and all manner of manufactured goods ; some of this last would be ruined if it came up to rain really hard , but the owners were so keen to do business that they 'd released the line of any and all responsibility . Yep . One more round trip like this and then Frank McEnnis could quit the River and its damned shoals , bars and snags forever . Never before had so many passengers struggled to get aboard . Staterooms had brought double and triple the normal price and his overworked purser declared that he could have sold each cabin three times over . " What with all them folks aboard , Josh is sure going to catch hell in the dining saloon , " McEnnis observed to the pilot . " He 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do n't know how many . " Captain McEnnis chuckled , addressed his first officer who unwisely had chosen this moment to appear . " Hank , just you trot below and say to Greenwood I want he should open up a temporary bar on the afterdeck . My God , the passengers already is five deep round the one on the promenade . " Mr. Verroux , the first officer , said , " Sure thing , Mac . Say , you do n't really reckon them Rebs have guns mounted downstream ? " " Naw . Spoke to Joe Fithian o ' the Pacific which got in from N'Awlins last night . He says he did n't see hide nor hair of any batteries all the way up . " " That 's good , " commented Verroux after picking an ample nose and inspecting the gleanings . " I sure hope them Southern heroes ai n't movin ' no faster nor they gin'rally do . I 'd hate to feel a eight-pound cannon ball fannin ' my coattails . " To Christina Reigler , seated not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk proved a thrilling and memorable occasion . The screaming calliope , the diffident waving of the blue soldiers , the hoarse commands of shirt-sleeved deck officers and the mournful , re-echoed whistlings of other river boats  --  she enjoyed it all .  | My , how lovely were the lights of St. Louis ever so far away across this vast river ! She wished it had been possible to see St. Louis , but neither time nor the contents of her purse had permitted it . So , during eight long hours , she 'd lingered , more than a little frightened , about the Ohio &; Mississippi Railroad 's western terminal . Not that she 'd been bored ; it was fun exploring small mountains of freight as varied as it was picturesque . Since most Southern governors had threatened immediate war on the North , many shippers had grown ckiary of using the railroads , and prompt confiscation of their property . In Marietta she had first heard reports that the Rebels were attacking a fort somewhere in the Carolinas . It had amazed her . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it was the Stars and Stripes , sting usually sensible people into such a frenzy of hate ? Especially , she wondered , since it was reliably reported that no one had been killed on either side . She could n't believe her eyes when , in Parkersburg , she had watched strong , sober-appearing citizens assemble before the local telegraph with tears in their eyes and search their souls for curses to lay upon the Carolinians . A pack of murdering , boastful traitors , was the least opprobrious term . Oddly enough , it was very seldom in the Middle West that she heard slavery or abolition even mentioned . What " riled people clear down to their corns , " as a friendly brakeman put it , was the fact that a party of noisy Rebels had fired on and pulled down the National Flag . It seemed that to Northern folk the Flag constituted not only their symbol of national dignity , but also the spirit of Liberty and Freedom . Tina slumped against the rough netting binding of the cargo bale at her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half so dirty , or so bone-tired . A poignant twinge reminded her that her stomach had been empty nearly twelve hours now . Still , as a panacea there remained the wonderful realization that , from now on , she would be traveling straight in the direction of Lachlan Brunton 's sheltering arms . If only she could be certain of the reception he 'd give her . Plenty of men would be furious over a girl 's turning up unsent-for . " In another seven or maybe only six days , I shall be with Lachlan , " she reassured herself happily . " The ticket seller promised that this is an extra-fast boat . "  | She hugged thin arms about her knees , watching the dark shore retreat steadily as powerfully thrusting machinery imparted to the deck and the bale behind her a gentle , jouncing motion . What troubled Tina most was that she 'd found she could no longer Accurately visualize every detail of her intended husband 's face . Next loomed the problem of whether the two and a half dollars remaining in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how meagerly , down to New Orleans ? Despite the most drastic of economies the cost of her journey west had eaten steadily ' Tito the thirty-six odd dollars with which she had set out . How long ago it seemed that she had ridden the stage out to Ellicott City where , providentially , no sheriff had been awaiting her . Washington to Harper 's Ferry had proved perhaps the most exciting and picturesque segment of her journey largely because troop trains rolling in the opposite direction were numerous . From the Ferry she had ridden the Baltimore &; Ohio to Marietta ; a miserably slow , sootand cinder-drenched trip from which she had emerged dark as any quadroon . To bathe in a public bathhouse had required the expendihire of fifty precious cents for towels and soap . Though she still had a sliver of the soap left , this had been sheer extravagance . Yet at the time she knew she 'd fall sick or go mad without a bath and a change of underwear . Once Washington lay behind , Tina had deemed herself reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that police officers were n't likely to take notice of a pale young girl walking quietly along with shawled head modestly bent . Despite severe resolutions to the contrary she often would discover herself standing straight , as Papa had made her ; and because the contents of her carpet bag were so light she had added a couple of bricks to remind her to walk stooped over . Her meals , snatched at way stations whenever the engine paused to water and fuel up , never had cost more than ten or fifteen cents and they had n't been worth even that . What the passengers generally were offered were grisly chunks of cold and greasy pork piled on sodden bread and lubricated with watery gravy . Sometimes , though , she 'd been lucky enough to buy a mug of milk for a couple of pennies . A single meal ordered in that glittering new refectory car attached to the train at Harper 's Ferry would have cost fifty cents at the very least .  | Nothing of an adventurous nature occurred to her until , on a ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to Moore 's Junction near Marietta , a couple of drunken soldiers had pinched her buttocks , then patted her hard little breasts and had made such indecent suggestions that she 'd burst out crying in shame and outrage . They were attempting to kiss her and would have succeeded had not a black-bearded lieutenant of Ohio Militia interfered and sent her persecutors slinking away . It was he who had offered a very practical suggestion . " Now , Missy , so long as you are traveling alone , just you keep that shawl pinned high and do n't spruce up more than you have to . " Tina hated her present unkempt and malodorous state with a feline intensity . Lord , how she yearned to wash her hair , gone so dull and greasy ; some fine railroad cinders still were lodged in her braids . First chance she got , she intended to wash her other set of underclothes . IV DECK PASSAGE THE Silver Wing gained speed steadily until high white plumes spurted to either side of her low bow and trailed behind her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through a low-hanging purplish haze stars commenced to wink and blink by the thousand and the tens of thousand . Christina Reigler was delighted by her discovery that while sparks whirling from the tall and slender smokestacks suggested red-gold stars , real ones shone silver-gold . At long last the calliope emitted a final , wheezing gasp and , dribbling condensed steam , fell into a blissful silence . Then and only then was the girl aware of voices all about her . Most pleasing of all were the softly melodious tones of Negro deck hands gossiping with servants belonging to those lordly creatures who inhabited staterooms on both upper decks . From immediately above her head , sounded peals of  | laughter , liquor-heated voices raised in argument , and the cheery clinking of glassware . The bar up yonder must be doing a land-office business . From her seat on the deck cargo Tina witnessed the appearance of a young couple who advanced to bend over the rail of the deck above and view that tangle of humanity of which she was a part . The girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture that it billowed gently , gracefully in the faint upriver breeze . Her companion , obviously her new husband , proved very solicitous and kept attempting to arrange a cloak about her shoulders . Smiling , Tina thought of Lachlan . Would he ever fuss so delicately over her ? No , she guessed not ; he 'd be too busy earning their living . By the time they could afford such clothes she 'd be well on the way towards middle age and she knew that men did n't fuss like that over middle-aged women . Sighing , she turned away , determined that someclay she would travel in a stateroom , a big one , and have colored servants waiting below to attend her . She watched a lanky white man appear and use a flaming torch to ignite cressets or iron baskets already crammed full of pine knots . Once these took fire , they created a dramatic scarlet glare by the light of which the commoner sort of travelers brought out food baskets and prepared to sup . Tina of course did n't have a basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper and a bag of peppermint candy . The Negro peddler declared this pie to be chicken , but proof revealed it to be mostly dough enveloping a few shreds of stringy meat which might have been anything from veal to tomcat . Still she consumed her purchase with all the eagerness generated by a healthy young body of eighteen years . Presently the air grew chillier and the breeze stronger . Being country-bred enough to know that this sort of night precipitated heavy dew , Tina decided to look about , by-and-by , and learn whether some better shelter were not available . For the present she felt too tired to institute an immediate search so remained viewing the black , low-lying silhouette of the eastern bank . Here and there the lights of some farm or a village glowed like fireflies , then gradually slipped out of sight . A river steamer bound for St. Louis came pounding up , her lights  | blazing like a heap of stirred coals and her whistle stridently calling for recognition . Like the other passengers , Tina hurried to the rail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very new , if the brilliance of her white and gold paintwork meant anything . To a courteous tootling of Captain McEnnis ' steam trumpet , the stranger sped by , thin tongues of flame trailing gracefully aft from her stacks . Now whole rows of lights sprang into being and by them everyone could see fine spray misting about her paddle boxes . Christina could read the stranger 's name in tall and elegant gold letters : The Sultana of Baton Rouge . Sultana ? The name so tickled Tina 's fancy that she repeated it several times . " My , she 's lovely , " Tina whispered . " Just like the fairy queen 's palace . " A little later the Silver Wing overtook a lumber raft nearly a quarter of a mile long . This curious contrivance was secured by chains into a floating island with roughly pointed ends and supporting three wooden tents ? " wigwams " someone called them  --  designed to shelter crews working hard at sweeps and steering oars . The raftmen off duty had collected about a big fire burning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tina could see rough , wild-appearing fellows standing up to yell derisive comments and wave earthenware jugs at the steamboat 's passengers . By dint of waiting a half hour , Christina at last was able to enter the women 's lavatory , where , with an old handkerchief , she scrubbed everywhere she could without indecently exposing herself . Her fellow voyagers looked far from prepossessing . Most of them were leather skinned , shrill creatures wearing shapeless dresses of calico or homespun , but others traveled in over-elaborate clothes and much cheap jewelry . These last ladies devoted great attention to their frizzed hair and the application of paint from the tiny pots they carried . Little brushes spread not only carmine on their lips but also tinted brows and eyelashes a bold and unconvincing black . Tina found comfort in the presence at the washbasins of several severely garbed females who by their plain and decent appearance she guessed to be schoolteachers . " This sure is a mighty fine ship , " observed one tired-looking old  | lady . " With all this speed and travelin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll sight N'Orleans inside of six days . " Tina agreed , timidly inquired about food and learned that a counter for the accommodation of deck passengers was located just forward of the boiler room . " You kin buy a gre't big plate o ' sausage , coffee and all the corn dodgers ye want fer fif'een cents . ' Tai n't bad cooking , neither . " Tina felt vastly encouraged because her slender resources would not only feed her down to New Orleans but even leave her enough to buy a day 's shelter in case Lachlan could not readily be found . Clutching her carpetbag Tina returned on deck and presently was lucky enough to discover a narrow space between two bales which proved just wide enough to permit her to wriggle in . By folding her other petticoat and placing it on her carpet bag she created a fair pillow . Her spare dress , the one which had caused her so much trouble , she used for a cover and presently fell into an uncomfortable doze from which she soon was aroused because the Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedlam ensued as she had never heard ; engine bells clanged in short , irritable bursts , steam roared through the exhausts and , because the great stern wheel had been reversed too suddenly , the whole boat bucked and groaned like a speared leviathan . Through a gap between the cargo that protected her , Tina , by the light of torches and cressets , could see cotton bales being carried aboard by gangs of Negroes . Eventually the Silver Wing 's whistle screamed loud enough to wake the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus , and she backed out into the Mississippi once more . V MRS . LEDOUX INTERVENES THE NEXT TWO days of the voyage passed pleasantly enough , the weather having retained a spring-like mildness . Everybody declared  | it was the Lord 's own mercy that the mosquitoes had n't yet got started . To Christina Reigler the river banks , all newly green and yellow , presented an endless succession of strange scenes and especial wonders , while the river itself proved an even more fascinating subject of observation . All manner of ducks and waterfowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupying the promenade deck to dash into their cabins and return in time for a quick shot at these migrants . More often than not they dropped a bird but perforce left it to drift uselessly onto a snag or sand bar where some buzzard would find it . On the third day , however , Tina awoke aware of heavy , painful throbbings in her head and of a sour taste in her mouth . By the gripings in her bowels and stomach she judged she must have eaten something spoiled from the counter . To make matters worse , rain commenced to fall for the first time since leaving Illinoistown . To begin with the drops descended gently but soon came lashing down in blinding swirls that drove the ever-increasing crowd of deck passengers to fighting for any kind of shelter . Twice , people tried to share Tina 's crevice but , surprisingly enough . withdrew on finding it already occupied . During the morning Tina 's biliousness degenerated into waves of nausea so powerful that she was forced to quit her retreat in order to vomit over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer passengers . A second seizure left her so weak she had to cling to the rail , gasping for breath . Her knees began trembling so violently that they threatened to buckle at any moment . A voice began calling from above , " Young woman ! I say there , young woman ; you in the gray shawl ! " At length Tina found opportunity to glance upward over her shoulder . She beheld a very fat old lady in a big-brimmed straw hat and a magenta gown , topped by a yellow cashmere shawl peering down . " Young woman ! Can you hear me ? " Tina was just able to nod before yielding to a fresh series of agonized retchings . She wanted to be sick again but her stomach now was empty so she could accomplish nothing save to gag and pant . At first she hardly realized that someone 's hand had closed over her arm just below the shoulder . Tina rolled swollen eyes about and so  | caught a glimpse of a row of official-looking brass buttons , a blue coat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the stranger commenced . " Do n't take on . " " I  --  I could n't help it , " Tina gasped . " I  --  I 'm so sorry , and I 'll clean your deck . I  --  I just could n't help it . " " Maybe not , " the man in blue muttered while hurriedly she wiped mouth and chin . " Come along . " At this , Tina began to weep . Surely they did n't arrest people just for throwing up when they could n't help it ? The other passengers began crowding about . " Reckon that there baggage must have tried pickin ' someone 's pockets , " observed a sharp-featured female . " They 's signs up all over this here boat warnin ' against gamblers and sech . " By a miracle Tina found strength to stand straight and look this red-faced officer in the eye . " Please , Mister , I have not done anything wrong and I have paid for my passage . " She coughed , kept on trying to clean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind those bright buttons grinned . " Who says you have ? Just you come along quiet-like , Missy . Ai n't nobody fixin ' to hurt you . " Still gripping Tina by the arm , he unlocked a whitepainted door , pulled her inside , then reclosed it upon the curious crowd . How vivid a contrast the saloon passengers ' lounge presented to the hot and smelly foredeck . Here thick , dark green carpets felt ever so soft underfoot , potted palms , mirrors and chandeliers everywhere caught the eye , and clean odors of furniture and brass polish were strong in the air . At a piano a wispy-looking young strawberry blonde was playing Mr. Eugene Dawson 's " Monterez Waltz . " Panic suddenly seized Tina and she tried to break away sobbing , " Please , Mister , please let me go . I have done nothing wrong . " " Quit strugglin ' , ye poor little starveling , and just come along , " the officer advised . Presently he conducted her up a broad staircase and along a gallery lined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ohio , Virginia " she read , then realized all at once why such accommodations had become , rapped twice . A sharp voice called , " Who is that ? " " Mr. Greenwood , Mum . The purser. "  | it has all I own . " " Do n't worry about your bag . Mr. Greenwood will find it , " her hostess assured her cheerfully . " Now let 's git acquainted . Me , I 'm Flora Ledoux , otherwise Mrs. Aristide Ledoux . But I 'm no Frenchy . Purser should have put me in the stateroom marked Maine , ' ' cause that 's where I hail from . Dear , dear , you certainly are a sight . What 's your name ? " Tina told her and , feeling a trifle less queasy , made bold to say , " I did not ask to come here , Ma'am , and I would not have , only I fee so weak . " " Maybe so . I notice you 've got spirit . Where I come from we set considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you traveling alone ? " " Yes , Ma'am . I  --  I am going to New Orleans . " There was no hint of morbid . curiosity in Mrs. Ledoux 's voice . " You are a good girl ? Of course . Do n't know why I asked that because if you were n't you 'd not be traveling all by yourself . Um-m . Let 's see now . You 've only a deck passage and no place to sleep . That 's true , is n't it ? " Tina only nodded . She was too busy fighting down another paroxysm of nausea . In so doing she must have turned very white , for Mrs. 176 PROUD NEW FLAGS " Oh . I must say you 've taken your own good time . You found her ? " " Yessum . " A moment later Tina found herself inside a stateroom and undergoing the scrutiny of that same woman who had called down from the boat deck . She wore jet , tightly curled ringlets on either side of plump and shiny red features . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her in from patched and dusty shoes to bedraggled blond braids . " Mercy , ai n't you a sight ! Sit down , you pore young thing . " She waved to a red plush settee . " ' That 'll be all , Mr. Greenwood , and thank you . Here . " She passed over a carefully folded greenback . Floppy straw hat in hand , the purser bowed so low that a big goldfilled watch chain across his black and white checkered waistcoat swung way forward . " Thanky , Mum . If you require me again , you 've only to ring for old Becky . " Tina felt too weak to do more than mutter , " Find my bag . Please ,  | Ledoux suddenly jumped up , grabbed a reticule lying atop a chest and produced a small cut-glass bottle . " Smelling salts , " she announced . " Breathe deep . Now tell me , dearie , what do you figure ails you ? " " My stomach , " Tina replied when her head had cleared . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well now , Miss Reigler , paregoric will fix you up in two shakes of a lamb 's tail . " " Oh , no . I  --  I feel all right now . Really . " She struggled to rise , but Mrs. Ledoux 's magenta , bombazine-clad arms proved to be powerful . " Now just you listen to me , " snapped the older woman . " I 've paid in full for both berths in this cabin and since I am headed for New Orleans , too , why you 're welcome to travel with me . " " But  --  but , I ca n't pay cabin rate , " Tina protested weakly . " Fiddlesticks ! Ai n't I just said I 've paid for the hull cabin ? ? vlr . Ledoux is very lavish with my travel money so I 'll easy ' tend to the difference for your deck passage ticket . " To refuse such unexpected luxury came hard , but Tina 's shoulders squared themselves . " You are very kind , Ma'am , but I can not accept unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Back in Baltimore ? " She shuddered . Heavens ! She 'd let the cat out of the bag for sure by mentioning that town . " All right , all right ! " Mrs. Ledoux 's sharp voice interrupted . " I 'll find work enough to ease your conscience . Now I am going for Becky , my black maid , who 'll wash you and put you into the extra bdrth . If you do n't mind an old-fashioned nightgown , I guess I can spare you one . " Mrs. Ledoux rang , gave Becky instructions , then patted Tina on the shoulder . " I 'm going to play whist in the lounging saloon so go to sleep and do n't you dast stir out of that berth till I return . "  | A GLOW ON THE RIVER CONSIDERABLE SATISFACTION , ALTHOUGH tempered by regret , was manifest in Captain McEnnis ' expression . " Will you jes ' look on that foredeck ? " he invited . " The Twelve Apostles ' emselves could n't stow another bale nor a barrel aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freeboard was all that prevented the Silver Wing 's cargo deck from disappearing beneath the Mississippi 's tawny surface . " Yes , sir , and a feller 'd need a shoehorn to ship another decker , " agreed the first officer , lantern jaw working on a fresh chew of tobacco . " I declar ' there ai n't room fer most of ' em to lie down . Yes , sir , this 'll prove the most profitable trip ever ! " Both officers felt relieved now that Vicksburg lay astern and no effort had been made to halt the Silver Wing ; especially because long streaks of raw , yellow-red earth had appeared to indicate the existence of gun emplacements and really impressive fortifications . Similar defenses had been remarked not only along the bluffs above Vicksburg , but also on several strategically situated islands . The Silver Wing squattered past a huge flatboat lumbering downstream under a stained brown squaresail . " With any luck , Hank , we 'll fetch N'Awlins come the day after tomorrow , " McEnnis remarked jovially . " Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin log another round trip afore either side shoots at us . " " Yessir , we likely can  --  but we got to hurry . Memphis papers was talkin ' mighty war-like . " McEnnis turned to his second officer . " Go below and tell them loafers in the engine room to feed them boilers more pitch knots . " The second mate hesitated on his way out of the Texas . " Think we oughter ? It 's so mighty close below the passengers in  | ' California ' and ' Virginia , ' they 're complainin ' their staterooms is too hot to live in . " " Ah , the hell with them , " grunted the Captain and watched the pilot guide his vessel past the drifting trunk of a huge tree . Upon its weed-draped limbs rested a trio of white herons . In delayed resentment they went flap-flapping in leisurely flight towards the Mississippi shore . " Just you keep them complaints to yerself , Mister , " Captain Mc- ' Ennis drawled . " One more trip like this and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quit the River afore I get shot at , and buy into any brother 's feed business . He 's making a mint outfitting waggin trains headed west . " Towards sundown the Silver Wing ran into the first bad weather she had thus far encountered . The wind mounted in velocity , drove huge banks of storm clouds boiling over the western shore . The Mississippi , nearly two miles across at this point , commenced to stir , then to froth and finally to writhe under terrifically violent squalls ; some gusts proved strong enough to heel the steamboat ' way over on her port beam . Soon solid sheets of rain commenced drumming down , beating the engine 's smoke and curling streamers of flame low over the tumultuous water . Some of the passengers got so frightened that an itinerant preacher on the foredeck judged this to be an auspicious moment to hold a revival meeting and to circulate a plate . At nine o'clock the engineer whistled up to the Texas . " We 're takin ' too much water over the bow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some . " This was true . The Silver Wing was so overloaded that she could no longer buck the storm waves without their leaping the low bow and flooding the freight piled on her foredeck . All this McEnnis could see by the almost continuous glare of lightning which hissed and crackled all about . But time was to be won . He yelled down the speaking tube , " The pumps will keep her dry . Hold her at full speed , you yellow hound-dawg , or I 'll knock yer ears . " By now the gale had risen to a tornado 's velocity . Fierce squalls rattled stateroom windows , sent spray vaulting over the weather rail and so fed the engine drafts that long banderoles of flame streamed from the iron crowns atop the smokestacks . Reeling , plunging , re- lentlessly urged on by her huge stern wheel , the Silver Wing drove headlong through the wind-driven rain and darkness . The pilot knew the river to be wide and straight in this reach . Mrs. Ledoux woke up , hot and sweaty as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said aloud to herself , " That 's wood smoke , sure as I 'm born . " At once she turned up the wick of the small kerosene light held in a bracket above the head of her berth . An icy dart shot the length of her back when she discovered little tendrils of bluegray smoke working through a crack in the white-painted wainscoting beside her bunk . She was reaching for the call bell when a peculiar rushing noise drowned out the familiar sounds of a steamboat under way . " Wake up ! " For all her corpulence Mrs. Ledoux was out of bed in a flash and shaking her unconscious roommate . " Quick ! Wake up ! " Christina roused up on an elbow , pushing hair out of her eyes ? she 'd felt too exhausted to braid it . " What ? " " This boat 's taken fire ! " Mrs. Ledoux cried over an ever-increasing roar . " Get some clothes on . Quick ! " There could be no doubt that a fire had broken out somewhere because heavy feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gong commenced to clang-clang , made the whole hull reverberate to its brazen uproar ; simultaneously the even throb of the Silver Wing 's engines faltered , then died , and her steam trumpet commenced to screech hysterically . Borrowed nightgown billowing up under her arms , Tina jumped down from the upper berth , saw Mrs. Ledoux stripping the case from her pillow . Into it she was shoveling rings , bracelets and other valuables . Her fat shoulders were shuddering to the violence of her movements . " Put this cloak about you , " Tina begged , holding out that garment . " Here are your shoes . " Mrs. Ledoux actually smiled through the graying air . " Wish you was my own daughter . I admire folks who keep their heads . Now let 's figger what we 'd best do . " Something must be done , and promptly . But what ? A low cry of fright escaped Tina 's companion because , in appalling suddenness , a palpitating orange glare illumined the window 's rainstreaked glass .  | The shrill screams and screeching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in upon them now began to sound over that infernal crackling roar . Like most river boats of her type the Silver Wing 's woodwork was heavy with oils through annual painting and therefore combustible as ally torch . Although sluicing rain drenched her exterior it affected her vitals not at all . Tina was ruching for her worn and twisted shoes when a report like that of a cannon discharged at close range sent her quivering to her feet . Mrs. Ledoux screamed , " We 'd better try ? " She got no further because someone set up a frantic hammering at their stateroom door . Obedient to the older woman 's command , Tina slid back a brass bolt only to be flung violently back by a gust of blinding hot gases which struck her with the force of a giant 's fist . Pressed fiat against the cabin 's far wall Tina , as in a nightmare , beheld a woman 's body slumped across the threshold with clothing and hair brightly burning . Mrs. Ledoux must have been far stronger than she looked for , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it required the united efforts of both women to reclose their door . Even as Tina 's fingers closed over the door bolt another tremendous gush of fire roared up the corridor and blew the door open again . Coughing amid the suffocating fumes , Mrs. Ledoux grabbed up a night pot and hurled it through the window . " Out ! " she screamed , a dim and grotesque figure amid the murk . " Out ! " Tina grabbed at the pillow case of valuables . " After you . " But her companion 's nightgown had exploded into a ball of flame and she tumbled face downward yammering and howling out her agony . Another great explosion shook the dying river boat from stem to stern . Possibly it was the blast thus generated which propelled Tina bodily through the window just as she had grabbed at its jagged outline . Outrageous , intolerable heat beat at her back , something slashed at her arm and fire licked at her face before she was flung an immeasurable distance through the flame-filled dark .  | RIVER OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared Christina Reigler 's reeling senses sufficiently to permit her to realize that , although totally submerged , she was rising . When her head struck on some object and checked her progress towards the air a hideous panic gripped her . She struggled blindly until , magically , the obstruction overhead moved aside and fresh air suddenly gushed into her aching lungs . For a while none of Tina 's senses , saving that of touch , seemed able to function . Because she had learned to " dog paddle " on a cold lake back home in Wisconsin , she was able to thresh about , coughing and half-strangled until her hand came in contact with a rough surface capable of buoying her with head clear of the surface . Gradually , like laggard and unwilling sentries , Tina 's other senses returned to duty until she became aware of a dazzling scarlet-gold glare pulsating somewhere not far off . Its source , however , was effectively concealed by dense clouds of smoke hanging funereally low . That the water was very rough and that great , icy raindrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the fact that beating through this rose and gray pall of smoke came appalling screams and despairing cries for help . Gradually her vision improved so much that , when a slant of wind blew away the smoke , she was able to discern what appeared to be a flame-spouting island drifting along some two hundred yards downstream . A minute or so later this weird island erupted , was instantly disintegrated by a monstrous explosion which hurled flaming brands , small boats , timbers and huge sections of the steamboat high into the rain-lashed night . Then , as if by some magician 's trick , the glare vanished all in an instant and the river flowed on dark , silent and terribly lonely .  | Sobbing , Tina clung to what proved to be a bale of cotton . For a while it smoldered sullenly along its upper side , but presently rain extinguished the fire . Small pieces of wreckage , some still burning , dotted the water all about her , but the current must have snatched the larger pieces of flotsam away faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard someone floundering and a woman or a boy 's voice yelling , " Help ! For God 's sake , help ! " When she tried to call out , " This way , " all that resulted was a curious croaking sound . The hot gases she had inhaled had left her throat raw and seared . Now she must be nearing the spot where the Silver Wing had blown up , for yells , cries , groans , sounded all about her . In the windfilled darkness she could see nothing at all , however , so clung weakly to the bale after thrusting a wrist through a loop in its bindings . A swimmer came struggling out of the blackness towards her . " This way , this way ! " she managed to gasp . Someone must have reached the other side of the bale because she felt it turn a little . " Hang on , help will come . This will keep us afloat . " She had spoken in German , she was that frightened . Du lieber Gott , how her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " came a feeble reply . " I think  --  whole back 's burned off . " There sounded more splashing sounds close by , but gradually river noises and the lashing rain blotted them out . Now that lightning no longer played to relieve the abysmal gloom there was no telling in which direction a shoal or an island might lie . Once Tina 's breathing leveled out and a measure of self-possession had returned , she could feel the current tugging at her hair and became aware of an odd sensation along her left side . It was n't hurting , only felt as if the skin had been stretched too tight . Once Tina cried out sharply because the cotton bale almost snagged itself on a sunken tree and submerged branches suddenly clawed at her legs . The man on the other side of the bale emitted a hollow groan . " Where are we ? Ca n't last much longer . " " Right close to an island or something , " Tina lied , trying to sound confident . " Just hang on a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe on shore . "  | She had no idea how much longer the bale spun and bobbed downstream before her unknown companion gasped , " Oh , God , " then the cotton bale rode higher in the water . " You will not let go , Christina Reigler , you are still quite strong . Hang on ! Hang on ! " Endlessly she repeated those two words , first in English , then in German , until she drifted into a timeless void and was only dully aware that the rain had ceased and the waves were dropping . How black and lonely it was in this weird and unlovely world where absolutely nothing was to be seen , not even the surface of her precious cotton bale . At length she roused to the fact that her support 's bobbing motion had ceased . In fact , the bale was aground and soft mud lay beneath her feet . In order to summon a measure of strength Tina had to draw many deep breaths and while so occupied became aware that a milky , gravblack quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bale until she was able to see a tangle of branches not far away looking black and gnarled as the hands of a threatening witch . Some clouds must have been blown aside for all at once her immediate surroundings became clearly revealed in silver-gray tones . Beyond her cotton bale a stretch of sand climbed towards the tangle of trees she had noticed . " Oh , my Heavenly Father , I thank Thee , " she gasped , then reeled off towards the shore with sodden hair streaming pale and free over neck , shoulders and breasts . Under a huge cottonwood she glimpsed a little gully choked by dead leaves and grass and into it she collapsed . VIII WILD GRAPE ISLAND SUNLIGHT WAS BEATING SO persistently upon Christina Reigler 's closed eyelids that she reluctantly returned to consciousness and promptly  | became aware of a dull pain shooting through her left arm and shoulder . She roused surprisingly quickly and was appalled at the state in which she found herself . She lay huddled on a bed of dried and sandy willow leaves as naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first breath into her tiny lungs . Himmel ! To lie all exposed like this for all the world to see was horribly indecent . By raising her head a trifle , she could see her body stretching away , the view of her legs interrupted by the contours of her breasts . They and the rest of her were smeared with dried blue-gray clay . Although her head still swam , Tina sat up and attempted to analyze the pain in her arm . No wonder it hurt ; three long gashes ran redly across her upper arm . They were n't very deep and had largely stopped bleeding , though a few ruby drops still were oozing through scabs which had begun to form . Her next discovery was that her face was so fearfully swollen that she could see hardly anything with her left eye ; she learned also that practically the whole length of her left side had been scorched and blistered into a hideously tender area . Wonderingly she tested her hair , found it amazingly short and its ends thick ; she used finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyebrows should have been , there remained no hair at all . A recurrent weakness forced her to lie back again permitting the sun to warm her and lend renewed vitality to her battered body . Two small , bright yellow and dark green birds settled in a creeper above and balanced there , surveying her with brilliant inquisitive eyes . Gradually memory commenced to serve until she recalled Mrs. Ledoux 's waking her up amid a hellish roaring of flames . Shuddering , she remembered that flaming corpse in the corridor and curiously enough remembered how Mrs. Ledoux 's single black braid had dangled over her shoulder like a sable serpent . She stiffened , for surprisingly near by a voice was rasping , " Aw , put yer Goddam ' shoulder under it , Rufe . You too , Billy ; we got to hurry . ' Twill be broad daylight soon . " " I 'm doin ' the best I kin , " panted a nasal voice . " Wish to God we 'd got us a mule . Come on , Billy , git yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yere bales is wuth a hun'erd dollars each . " Men ! Men , right close by ! And here she lay in shameful nakedness.  | Yip ! Yip ! A dog commenced a series of joyously excited barks descriptive of starting a cottontail . Tina cringed , looked about for cover but , finding none , frantically tried to burrow under the leaves and grass , and almost immediately struck hard , sandy earth . " Come on , ye lop-eared bastards . Heave , heave-ho ! " " Ah  --  to hell with the cotton ! Water-soaked like this , them bales is too damn ' heavy . Looky ! Yonder 's floatin ' down a chest o ' drawers . Me , I 'm goin ' after it . " Teeth chattering in terror , Tina struggled up onto her knees although the blistered skin of her side felt as though it must split . Employing infinite care , she parted the undergrowth and saw , not fifty yards distant , three shaggy , half-dressed men hard at work . Two of them were using poles to lever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third , younger and slighter of build , was splashing out over the shallows towards the river . " Hi ! Back yonder comes ' nother deader , " shouted the youth , now up to his waist in the slow , coffee-colored current . " A man this time . " " Leave that chest be , " directed a gruff voice . " It 's groundit anyways and fetch that cadaver ashore . Mebbe we 'll find a ring onto him . " Utterly aghast , Tina watched the boy wade further out and grab at a green-coated arm rising rigidly above the Mississippi . " Gawd , Lord A'mighty , Buck , yer right ! They 's a sock-dologer big ring onto him . " Heart hammering in terror , Tina watched these wild , half-naked men  --  they were clad only in ragged breeches suspended from a single gallus  --  haul a corpse into shallow water . " Christ ! His fist 's stiffer nor a poker . Billy jest you fetch that axe . " The axe flashed down tchunk ! against a billet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go through the bastard 's pockets ' fore ye push him off agin , " directed the brown-bearded man the others called Rufe . " You , Buck , keep yer dad-burned eyes skint and we 'll earn us a mint out o ' this wreck . " Twice more the freckled , tousle-headed youth either waded or swam out to pull ashore stiff , unlovely relics of humanity . The ghouls had levered three cotton bales into concealment amid the underbrush before their rabbit hound began racing along the  | beach in futile pursuit of some sandpipers . All at once he halted , swung a flea-bitten black and tan head towards Tina 's refuge and began to sniff . " Herr Gott ! Please do not let them find me , " prayed the girl , but to no avail . The little hound began raising a furious , excited clamor . At first the rivermen paid no attention , but at last the one called Billy asked , " What ails Snapper ? Reckon must be a bobcat in thar . " Rufe straightened , used the heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That ai n't no bobcat-rookus Snapper 's raisin ' . " The mongrel hound circled about Tina 's thicket all the while raising a heart-stilling clamor . " Billy , jes ' you go see what that li'l son-of-a-bitch 's found there . " The youth grunted protest , but came splashing along the beach . " Come off that , Snapper , you danged fool ! " Billy whistled several times but the dog only kept on raising an alarm . Frantically , Tina squirmed down into the gully and tried to hide wider the leaves . Branches threshed . " Yo 're a big fool , Snapper , come away ? Glory ! Here 's a fee-male critter and  --  and , why she 's nekkid as a egg ! " The other two cane pounding up to stare down at the cowering , utterly terrified girl . " Je-sus ! It 's a woman , all right , but ai n't she a mess ? Must 've come offa that wreck , " was Rufe 's sublimely intelligent observation . " Shucks ! " grunted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's only a skinny young gal . " In utter terror , Tina used her arms to cover her breasts . Since she 'd been six years of age , no one , not even her own mother , had ever beheld her completely unclothed . Blue eyes , white-ringed in apprehension , stared fearfully upwards . " Yer right , Rufe , she 's sure been roasted to a turn . " Rufe , the biggest and the oldest-appearing of the three , scratched at his matted mane . " Damn ' iffen ' she do n't look jest like a half-singed spring chicken  --  an ' a damned scrawny one to boot . Billy , just you canter down an ' fetch my shirt . Now look hyar , gal , do n't git yourself so lathered up . We ai n't fixin ' to harm you . So pull on this shirt . Billy will fetch you down to our shack an ' give yu sumpin ' to eat . "  | THE YEAGER BoYs A WEEK DRAGGED by before Christina Reigler felt able to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful in the extreme because not only had her side been burned to about the intensity of serious sunburn , but those cuts on her arm festered , took on proud flesh and for a while remained discolored , badly swollen and feverish . By degrees her slim body commenced to mend , once her abundant and youthful vitality asserted itself . First the blisters subsided leaving shiny red patches , then her brows and eyelashes commenced to grow back during almost endless hours of sleep . Probably the factor which contributed most towards her recovery was the neglect accorded her by the Yeagers . Buck and Rufe Yeager , she decided , must be brothers , while bucktoothed Billy was their first cousin . All three were coarse , primitive creatures always ready to brawl or to blaspheme anyone or anything in order to assert their manhood . Not one of them could so much as read or write a line . Their talk was so larded by Indian words and river slang that half the time she could n't understand what was being said as she lay limp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering an ancient and greasy quilt . Since no window graced this shack , whatever light penetrated its dim and musty interior entered through the door or beat down a mud and wattle chimney . These rivermen had no regular meal hours . Whenever they got hungry they would fry themselves a mess of catfish , a muskrat or some kind of waterfowl . After sundown all three retired to lumpy , sour-smelling bunks , there to snore and grunt like a whole styful of pigs . The only one who manifested the least sympathy was young Billy ; he smeared bear 's grease on her burns and sometimes refilled the big gourd dipper of water she drank from .  | Occasionally one of the older rivermen would pause to stare downwards from blank predatory eyes . At the end of a week she was able to be about , garbed in a stained gingham gown which she suspected , because of a burned area on its sleeve , must have been stripped from a victim of the Silver Wing disaster . Buck , grinning shyly , brought in a well-worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-soaked shoes . These last were obviously intended for a boy but still were several sizes too large . She rendered them serviceable by binding strands of manila rope over her instep . Tina came to realize that these rivermen pretended to be trappers , but also worked on flatboats , rafts and occasionally had fought as jayhawkers in the terrible Border wars between Missouri and Kansas . Rufe she guessed must be a fugitive from justice , for every time he heard an unexpected noise outside the shack he moved over to the oldfashioned fowling piece he kept ready beside the door . The loss of the Silver Wing must have been a fine windfall for even at the end of a week the Yeagers were still salvaging all manner of flotsam brought to Wild Grape Island by a favoring fluke of current . By dint of scouring the bottom of a baking pan Tina was able to receive a dim impression of her likeness . Himmel ! Was this the neat , clean creature Mr. Brunton had admired ? At once horrified and relieved , she set down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witch out of " Hansel and Gretel " no man in his right senses would dream of molesting her . Of course Tina set about to make herself useful ; every bit of clothing she came across she hung up to pegs driven into intersections between the cabin 's twisted and mud-streaked logs . Next she swept out as much dirt as a birch-twig broom could move . She even stirred up a pan of corn pone and fried some catfish to greet her hosts upon their return from the river 's edge . " Wal , reckon yer tougher nor ye look , " Buck observed that evening , while utilizing a broken fingernail to dislodge a troublesome shred of meat . " I 'd not have risked two bits ye 'd live to bury . " " Thank you . I feel very much better . "  | " That 's good , " rumbled Rufe , his eyes bright and predatory as a hawk 's . " Ye can sew up my britches tommorrey . " " Why , of course . I 'd be pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty bare foot over the other . " Ye 'd better be . A wench had better keep on the jump come suppertime . When I gits hongry I do n't admire waitin ' . " Tina forced a tremulous smile . " Yes , sir . Mind if I go fetch a pail from the spring ? " Buck thrust out a long leg , halted her progress to the door . Large yellowish teeth shone in the candlelight . " Now jest do n't you git no fine idees ' bout runnin ' off . Why ? ' Cause you cai n't get off this island , and there ai n't no place on it where us and Snapper cai n't find you . That 'd be plumb ongrateful and you 'd earn a taste o ' this . " He tapped a heavy brass-studded belt securing shapeless trousers of brown homespun . " I kin make a gal squeal real loud if I 've the mind . See ? " He was so dirty , so bestial about the mouth that Tina shuddered but rallied enough to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , Mr. Yeager . You all have been so good to me , and  --  and  --  kind . " " That 's as may be , Sis . Once ye get rid o ' them scabs and fatten up , we got plans fer ye , me and Buck . " Rufe it appeared was the leader of the group . " Yes , sir , you sure are a lucky gal , Teenie . Soon me and Buck is goin ' over to town and cash some o ' that there plunder . Iffen we gits good prices , why mebbe I 'll buy ye a shimmy-shirt with red ribbons into it . " " And  --  and I , why , I 'll buy ye a  --  a , well  --  a pretty blue and yaller calico dress , mebbe . " Billy refused to be outdone in generosity . " Never mind all that . What I  --  I really want is some soap and a comb . " " You 'll take jest what we 'll give ye , " Rufe observed through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't had a real good look at ye yet . " Restive as a colt about to be saddled for the first time , Tina limped over to where Rufe sat on a salvaged cabin hassock , picking pone crumbs out of a ragged , brown-black beard . " Stand closer , gal . Now let 's look at them hacks in your arm . Um ! Do n't back away like that . I do n't like it . " He peered at her scars . " Ai n't no more proud flesh . That 'll do . " Awkwardly his fingers tested her unbound hair  --  she had deemed it  | wise not to make braids . " Damn ' me , if ye do n't look singed and shaggy like a she-coon fresh run o ' a brush fire . How 's the rest of them burns ? " " Healing very well , " she cried hastily and would have stepped back except that his huge hand shot out and imprisoned both of hers . To admiring guffaws he held the girl helpless while with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the over-slender body all the way to its hips . Billy goggled and Buck half arose at this vision of twisting nacrepale legs and thighs . " Do n't ! " she panted . " This is no way to treat a decent girl . " She squirmed desperately to get away . " Aw , " cried Billy , " do n't torment her . She cooks real good . " " Who says it ai n't decent to see a pore gal 's hurts ? Damn it , Sissy , do n't you dast try to lecture me . " Rufe drew his hand back as if to slap her but let the skirt slip back into its place and allowed Tina to pelt frantically out into the dark sobbing and scarlet with outrage . Two days later Rufe and Buck appeared from somewhere poling a solid , well-built raft . It was perhaps eighty feet long , crudely pointed at one end and equipped with a pair of ten-foot sweeps , rude affairs consisting of a peeled pole improved by a slab of board nailed to one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five chairs , a big brass hurricane lamp , two strips of slightly burned green carpet . Rufe carried the real loot in a leather poke ; rings , bracelets , watches and such other jewelry as had been looted from the Silver Wing 's luckless passengers . Hope began to well up in Tina like a gratefully warm flood when all three Yeagers actually began to pull on crude rawhide boots , and crack coarse jokes ; then they donned collarless shirts the fronts of which soon became stained by the tobacco juice they were forever squirting in all directions . Buck and Billy put bear 's grease on their long sunburned hair and even attempted to comb with a twig brush . Rufe only jeered , called them dudes . Unhappily Tina watched the trio haul their small dugout canoe aboard the raft ; trust them to deprive her of that means of escape . Of  | course they had learned that she could n't really swim . She noticed that , for some reason , the older men were guffawing a lot and winking behind Billy 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone for even a little while and afforded an opportunity to explore the island , Tina watched them lash down the last of their weirdly assorted cargo . Buck turned to Billy . " Trot up to the shack , Bub , " he drawled , " and fetch me a little ditty bag yell find under some rushes at the haid of my bed . " " Aw , no . I 'm busy  --  send Teenie fer it . " " God damn ! I said fer you to git it ! Hump yerself or yell earn a clout on the jaw . " So menacing was Buck 's beetle-browed scowl that Billy , cursing futilely , went shambling up the bank towards the cabin lying wellhidden in a hollow out of sight from the river traffic . The moment the boy had disappeared , the brothers put weight to their poles and quickly shoved the raft well out into the stream . By the time the youngest Yeager returned hopping mad because he had failed to locate the nonexistent ditty bag , the raft was well out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Not even along Alice Anna Street had Tina overheard such lurid profanity as was shouted by fifteen-year-old Billy . " Come back for me , you sneakin ' mother-seducin ' bastards ! Come back an ' I 'll cut yer dirty livers out . " In his fury Billy trotted along the shore alternately shaking his fist and hurling rocks which fell far short of their mark . Tauntingly Rufe 's voice beat over the coffee-colored Mississippi . " Do n't git yourself so lathered up , Bub , else you 'll take to strangling . Besides , me and Buck will be back in mebbe two , three days . Iffen yer good , we 'll mebbe bring yer a jug o ' good forty-rod along with your money share . " " It 's all fer yer own good , " jeered Buck . " Yer too young to be hittin ' the high spots of a wicked meetropolis like Bruinsburg . " " That 's a damn ' lie ! " screamed the boy , now weeping in impotent rage . " I had me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts , come back for me ! " Tina , wringing roughened hands in an agony of disappointment , could just hear Buck 's reply .  | " Naw . Now just ye mind the traps an ' keep an eye on our female critter . Ye 've got that there ash cat to keep ye company . " Billy paralleled the raft 's smooth progress quite a distance all the while screeching his furious disappointment , but to no avail . Under application of the sweeps the raft continued gliding further and further out onto the shining expanse of the Mississippi until it resolved into a tiny black dot . If she had to be left alone with any of the Yeagers , Tina philosophized , she 'd prefer it to be Billy , although at fifteen he was as big and almost as powerful as his cousins . He came stamping back , the little , greenish yellow eyes in his freckled red face aglitter with rage . " That was a dirty mean trick , " Tina tried to console him . " I  --  I 'm ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he snarled and made as if to strike the slight figure in greasy calico . " It 's all on yer account they crossed me ; I 've always went to Bruinsburg before . " Still spouting blasphemies , Billy jerked out his skinning knife and with a movement as smooth , swift and deadly as a rattlesnake 's strike , flung it at a big sycamore stump . It lodged there , blue-white blade glimmering evilly in the hot morning sunlight . After he had appeared to quiet a little , Tina brought him as appeasement a tin plate of doughcakes and a glass of water mixed with wild honey . " Am I mistaken , Billy , or have n't there been very few steamers go by here these last three days ? " The boy 's long , sharp-chinned jaw worked steadily before he replied . " Du n no . Ginerally they 's easy eight or ten go by each direction . I wonder what 's up ? Mebbe it's'this war they bin talkin ' about down to Bruinsburg . " Tina smiled and seated herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you born near here ? " " Naw , up Kansas way . " Billy inspected the end of a sassafras twig he had been chewing . " Hull family got massacreed in that there Border war , five  --  six year ago . " Tina felt she was succeeding in her efforts to sooth the boy 's outraged vanity . " I guess you must be a better trapper than your cousins . "  | The flat , freckled features broke at last into the grin she had been hoping for . " Sure am . I can take coons , minks , otters and muskrats two for one ' gainst Buck any day , and he 's a leetle smarter than Rufe ; cuss their mangy hides . " Angrily , Billy flung aside his chew-stick . " Please , Billy , wo n't you show me how you set some of your traps ? " Tina was thinking fast , but her manner was innocence itself . " All right , but gals do n't understand trappin ' . " Before long he was leading the way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among weed-festooned jungles caused by driftwood branches and trunks in various backwaters , he charmed and amazed her . Why , in traveling he made no more noise than the cottontails that went racing away ! He kept warning , " Do n't create such a gol-danged rumpus or we 'll never see nuthin ' . " Once he let her almost tread upon a huge , muddied black snake sunning itself beside a fallen sycamore and roared with laughter at her frightened shrieks . Presently he showed her a red-eyed vireo 's delicate nest , that of a song sparrow containing four tiny chocolatesplashed eggs , and finally the huge , ungainly home some fish eagles had built atop a lightning-killed pine . " The young ones is teeterin ' up yander . Say , " he said . " Yep . Say , you are interested in wild critters , ai n't you ? " " Do you earn much money trapping ? " she smiled . Thank fortune , things were going better than she dared hope . " In the winter we do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fell timber . Mostly we jest loaf about " By this time their tour found them walking along a wide and muddy beach curving towards the southern tip of Wild Grape Island . Billy rolled up the store pants he had expected to wear into Bruinsburg and waded out to inspect a promising-looking barrel lying half imbedded in the shoals . Tina , however , wandered on , her toes sinking comfortably into the soft warm mud . The sensation reminded her of childhood adventures around a muddy swimming hole back of Breyfogle 's quiet mill . Before she realized it Tina had emerged upon a miniature headland heavily crowned by muddy alders and willows . There she halted , heart in mouth , for yonder , on the very southern tip of this island , a party of men was digging , leisurely piling up the rich black earth into  | what appeared to be a series of small banks . A furtive glance over her sunburned shoulder revealed Billy busily scooping mud from beside the cask . Obviously her companion had not heard the pounding or chopping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an axe head or a spade flashed in the sunlight . She turned , tried not to hurry or betray her wild excitement . " Danged barrel 's full of molasses , but it 's spoilt , " he announced . " Too bad . Say , Billy , I am getting very hungry . Let us go back to the cabin and I will fix us something good to eat . " He pulled out a charred corncob pipe and lit it before he drawled , ' Reckon I 'm a mite peckish myself . You 'll fix up somethin ' real tasty ? " X BATTERY SIXTEEN A MIDDAY MEAL of fried hominy grits and stewed rabbit passed pleasantly enough , although occasionally Billy would frown and curse beneath his breath , that loud and loutish youngster seeming to have become reconciled only with difficulty to his cousins ' treachery . Employing a pine splinter , he settled under a cottonwood beside the spring , alternately picking yellow , uneven teeth , and sucking at his noisome corncob . Freed of boots , his big broad toes spread themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a shack , " he said , " but she do keep the rain off and were of Miss ' to riz up sudden-like  --  and she do , come springtime  --  and wash her away , we 'd have no great loss , I reckon . " Tina sat , bare feet drawn up under her , in the shack doorway attempting for the first time to braid the dreadfully oily and tangled mane into which her hair had degenerated . " My ! Does the river actually rise up to cover this island ? " " This end , sure , " Billy told her , lazily slapping at flies attempting  | to settle upon a sore above his leathery-looking ankle . He swung his head sharply , like a buck deer scenting some suspicious odor . " Hear something ? " Tina asked . " Dogged if it did n't sound like somebody hammering . Did n't you hear nothing ? " " No , maybe it was only a woodpecker . " Presently Billy searched his pockets for the pig 's bladder he used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't empty . " He arose and , belching noisily , shuffled into the shack and commenced poking around . " That bastard Rufe 's got some hidden somewheres . " All of a sudden a ringing whoop made the hollow resound . " Jesus ! Hyar 's a jug under his pallet ! " Once in the open sunlight Billy shook the brown earthenware jug experimentally , then wrenched out its corncob stopper . " 01 ' son-of-a-bitch 'll be plumb mad I found it , " Billy chuckled . " Wal , reckon there 's ' bout enough . " He winked clumsily . " Buck and Rufe ai n't the only ones gon na have a high of time , no siree . Now , Teenie , jest you trot over to the spring and fetch me a dipper o ' cold water . This hyar snake-juice smells tolerable warm . " When she returned he had already set out a pair of battered tin cups on a piece of board . " Come on , Sissy , he'p yerself . " He grinned , peering through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go ahead . They 's plenty fer the both of us . " " Thank you , Billy , but I  --  I do n't drink . " She stood there miserably uncertain . Oh , if only he 'd not come across that jug ! How would the fiery Monongahela affect him ? Probably he 'd just get sick and go to sleep ; a boy of his age would . Fervently she hoped so  --  or that he 'd just get happy the way Buck did . " Aw , come on , " he waved the jug under her nose . " I 'll Tarn ye . Shecks , you ai n't no kid , yer a woman ; yer eighteen year old , sure enough . " " But  --  but  --  to drink is against my religion . " " Ai n't no religion around hyar . Leastways not so 'd ye 'd notice it . " Billy scowled , swung the jug to his shoulder , splashed out half a cup of the tea-colored fluid then swallowed a long pull and gulped water from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of times then slapped his flat and  | naked belly . He had shed his go-to-town shirt and refilled the cup . " S'yer turn . " He hefted a skinning stick , pointed with it to the tin cup and gourd . " ' Tai n't polite to leave a gen'man drink alone . " " Please no , Billy . I do n't want to . " " Go on , drink ! " His small green-yellow eyes commenced to narrow themselves as he took a step forward , with stick raised . There was nothing for it so she slopped in water until a fair amount of the whiskey overflowed . " You  --  your good health . " That was what she 'd heard men saying that wonderful evening when Mr. Duchesne had taken Lachlan and her to supper . So long as she had to give in she might as well earn a hill measure of good-will . Merciful Heavens ! This drink was like liquid fire . Tina gasped , coughed and her eyes filled . " Haw ! Haw ! Ho ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raucous bucolic amusement . " No need to drink so fast , Teenie . " He patted the earthenware jug . " Plenty here fer the both o ' us . " Only pleasantly stimulated , he made her join him under a locust tree where they could sit and look out over the river . Presently a towboat appeared from the direction of New Carthage spouting clouds of sooty smoke and dragging a big scow . Since it passed not a quarter of a mile distant , they both noticed that the scow was crowded with armed men . The sunlight kept glancing off musket barrels and other small arms , but what the color of their uniforms might be they could n't tell because a shimmering heat haze kept distorting details . " ' Pears like there mought be some fightin ' somewheres , " the youth drawled . " They 're sure ' null headed up to Memphis . Ever see any fightin ' ? skirmishes , I mean ? I have . " Omitting no gory detail , he then launched into stories descriptive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that set Tina 's already unhappy stomach to quivering . He took another big drink out of the jug and this time his speech became slurred . At length he dug dirty knuckles into his eyes and gaped prodigiously . " Reckon I 'll jest take me a leetle snooze . " " That is a mighty good idea , Billy . A nap is just what you need . " She must have agreed a little too readily for , somewhat unsteadily , he lumbered to his feet to stand peering down into her pointed and sunburned features .  | " Say , why you so all-fired keen fer me to snooze ? I 'll bet yer figgerin ' on runnin ' away . Wal , ye cai n't fool me ! " His big hand shot out to close , trap-like , over her slender wrist . " Buck and Rufe shore would skin me alive iffen they find you gone when they gits back . Come along . " Despite her tearful entreaties and pitifully ineffective struggles , he employed a thong first to lash Tina 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young pin oak . All the same she kept her head and strained to keep her wrists as far apart as possible while he was tying the knot . " Please , Billy , I will be good , " she quavered . " I wo n't run off . " " Not now , you wo n't . " He stared stupidly at his handiwork . " Yes , sir . Yer gon na stay right there but yer rigged so 's ye can set down iffen yer so minded . " Bare shoulders shining bronze-yellow in the hot sunlight , he swayed over into a patch of shade cast by the shack and tumbled onto the trampled earth to fall sound asleep . Presently his mouth sagged open . Bluebottle flies crawled freely in and out of it , while a smaller , black variety unmercifully hit and stung the helpless girl . Billy had been in error , her lead thong was just too short to permit her sitting down . What did he intend when he roused ? He did n't seem either cruel or vicious for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implored Divine assistance in order to banish a sense of panic that continued rat-like to gnaw at her peace of mind . " You must escape , Christina Reigler , you must ! There is no telling what that young savage will think of if he goes on drinking . " Meanwhile she flexed her wrists in all directions until the thongs nipped so hard that she had to pause . Because the wind had died out the afternoon 's heat grew so intense that , presently , trickles of perspiration commenced to slip down her arms and over the tender area along her side which had been scorched aboard the Silver Wing . Was she actually creating a little play in the thongs ? It seemed so . She blew desperately to drive those pestiferous flies from her face and continued to work and twist her wrists . Granted just a little more opportunity , she felt sure she 'd soon be able to slip a hand from under the encircling leather but probably at the cost of some skin . Sundown was not far off and Billy still lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottoms , came trotting serenely back into the clearing . The hound 's moist brown nose sniffed at her knees , then he wandered over to his recumbent master . The youth must have splashed rabbit gravy or something equally desirable on his bare feet for the ribby little hound commenced to lick eagerly at them . Presently Billy shifted , curled his toes from the tickling . " Snapper ! Come here , " she pleaded in a soft voice . " For Heaven 's sake , please stop that . Here , Snapper , here ! " It proved sheer agony to watch her tormentor display unmistakable indications of waking , when she needed only another five minutes . The dog paid her frantic commands not the least attention . Billy awoke to the continued tickling , reared upon an elbow . " Git ! You tarnation pest ! " He flung a stick at the dog , then yawned cavernously and foolishly grinned at his disheveled and despairing captive . " Wal , that forty-rod shore do pack a wallop like the kick of a bluenose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing he did was to take a long drink from the jug ; then he belched and came over to view her from red and owlish eyes . He was still drunk , but apparently no less amiable than before . Billy giggled , scratched at his mop of tow-yellow hair . " Come to think on it I never have seen a female critter close to , " he remarked to Snapper , now busily crimping at a flea . " Leastways not by daylight . " " And you are not going to now , Billy Yeager . Do n't you dare touch me ! " Though she flinched away to the end of her tether , he nevertheless undid buttons securing the front of her calico gown , hooked a rough finger inside and tested her bud-like nipples . " Aw , stand still . I wu n't hurt ye . " " God will punish you ! " she choked , her throat closing from terror . " Let me be . Oh , please , be good . Let me alone . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iffen you rile me I 'll have to give you a good hiding . My , ai n't you got softest skin ! Just like a winter marten 's pelt . " At the sudden wickedness in his expression she reeled backwards , wailing , and tearing frantically at her bonds .  | " Le 's see how them burns o ' yourn is comin ' along , " he panted and , using both hands , pulled up her skirt . She commenced to scream . At once he clamped a hand over her mouth . " Let one more yip out o ' you , " he growled amid a fog of whiskey fumes , " and I 'll shorely peel you jay nekkid . I tell ye I jest want to look careful at a female critter , " and he yanked down the fragile cloth concealing her above the waist . " G-gimme a kiss , Teenie . " His freckled face and sun-cracked lips swooped down . Tina screamed again , then lurching aside , she felt the thongs suddenly give way . She leaped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsteady , sprawled onto the trampled loam . As if to atone for his previous ill deed , the dog romped up , yapping delightedly to join this horseplay and , for a priceless instant , got between the boy 's legs and so delayed his rising that Tina was able to snatch up a stick of firewood . This she brought down with all her strength upon the back of that hateful , yellow-brown head . Afterwards she recalled the queer , strangled grunt Billy emitted before he flopped back , face down onto the ground . Pursued by the still-frolicking dog , Tina raced southwards along the shore , half expecting to hear Billy start in pursuit . How she ran ! She kept driving her legs along until her breath came in like some scalding vapor . A stitch in her side forced her to slow down after a little and lent opportunity for her first backwards view . Miraculously , no one was visible on that shoreline arching back towards the hollow . The only creature in sight was Snapper disconsolately trotting back towards the shack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driftwood log and fought for breath while pulling up her dress into a decent state . Luckily , its buttonholes were large and thus had permitted the crude horn buttons to slip through instead of being ripped off . Twilight was robing the Mississippi with a silver-blue mist , and long lines of raucous-voiced herons were flapping on their way to roost when Tina timidly neared a log earthenwork revetted by fascines of willow and alder . A party of soldiers left their cook pots and grabbed up muskets when her bare foot snapped a little branch .  | " Halt ! Who goes there ? " challenged a tall young fellow wearing three scarlet chevrons on each sleeve . Around the fires more soldiers  --  they turned out to be artillerists ? jumped up and came running past stacks of shovels , picks and other on trenching tools . " Please , sir . Do n't shoot  --  I ? I 'm only a girl . " Tina saw a dozen muskets aimed at the thicket in which she stood . " You alone ? " came the sharp query @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of there slowly , " directed the tall young sergeant . " Anybody else 'll get shot . " " Heyo , Sis , " bellowed a big fellow wearing gray red-striped pants and a checkered black and white shirt . " Got any pies to sell ? " Everybody laughed at the ridiculousness of all those rifles trained on such a small , slim and pathetic figure . " No , please . Please , I am in such trouble . Wo n't you help me ? " A tall , heavily mustached individual wearing a black slouch hat and a gray blouse set off by a scarlet collar came striding up from the center of the battery . Silvered spurs fastened to a pair of handsomely cut riding boots tinkled gently . He peered through the dusk , motioned carelessly towards his hat brim . " And who might you be , Ma'am ? " " I am Christina Reigler from  --  from ? " again she almost said " Baltimore , " but in time altered it to " from Washington . I am a survivor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently an officer , came striding over the sand . " Welcome to Battery Sixteen , Ma'am . I am Lieutenant Robert MacQuarrie , Third Alabama Field Artillery , and at your service . What 's wrong ? " In a dead faint , Christina Reigler had collapsed to lie like a small bundle of rags amid the light of the ruddy cook fires .  | Now THAT NORTH Carolina and Arkansas had voted and adopted ordinances of Secession , albeit a trifle belatedly , the patriotic ladies of New Orleans were puzzled about how to add two more stars to various existing flags . Some odd variations of the Stars and Bars resulted , and everyone yearned for the arrival of that happy day when Maryland , Kentucky and Tennessee would join their revolted sisters and so justify use of the historic number thirteen . To Lieutenant Samuel Seymour , somber of mien in these days and much given to taking long and solitary walks , it appeared touching that in every possible manner the new Government should cherish and imitate traditions reminiscent of the founding of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original Federal Constitution with only one change , and that for the better . President Jefferson Davis was enabled to veto in detail objectionable sections of an otherwise acceptable bill , while endorsing the measure as a whole . Drums nowadays were rattling louder and more frequently than ever along New Orleans ' narrow , ill-ventilated streets , for , in almost every one of the city 's faubourgs , various companies , troops and batteries could be viewed at drill . Private regiments by the dozens were being recruited  --  regiments which , alas , named on their rolls frequently less than a hundred men but provided color-loving Creoles with a valid excuse to adopt uniforms calculated to outshine all rivals . The armies of His Imperial Majesty Napoleon the Third furnished such military tailors as M. S. Hedrick and M. Bouligny with satisfactory prototypes and soon to be seen on the streets were chasseurs , Zouaves , dragoons , spahis , hussars , and even lancers , although to what use lancers could be put amid the tangled forests and rough terrain of North America no one seemed quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside his bedroom upon a balcony of intricate iron grillework over which bougainvillea had draped itself , ever so gracefully . At this twilit hour before her night life really began , New Orleans seemed to be catching her breath . His interest rose on discovering that , from this point of vantage , he could just discern the Sumter 's topmasts . Urn . Yonder trim little cruiser should , within a week 's time , be ready for commissioning . But would she ? Had so many delays ever before attended the completion of a man-of-war ? Sam doubted it , chewed angrily on his seegar . This big and noisy city , to his jaundiced eye , appeared to celebrate a perpetual succession of holidays . The Creoles especially possessed an inexhaustible capacity for amusing themselves in more or less dramatic fashion . Band concerts were offered every night , while the bars of all hotels , especially those of the Royale , the City and the celebrated St. Charles , were always jam-packed . In every square self-appointed orators spouted fire , brimstone and patriotism at anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks to loosely cut linen pantaloons and the thinness of a ruffled cambric shirt , Sam was feeling cool and comfortable for the first time since sunup as he contemplated once more a letter received that day . His brother 's firm script informed him briefly that Reynolds , their scapegrace young brother , apparently owned and was selling shares in a privateer fitting out in Savannah . He wished Irad and Sam to see whether the services of some ex-naval officers might not be secured in that connection . Where Reynolds has come across sufficient money to buy shares in so costly a venture , I have no idea but I do not intend to co-operate and imagine you also will refuse . Pa always has said that the principle of privateering interferes with a regular naval establishment . Do you not agree ? My immediate duties are to examine the remains of the Merrimac which soon is to be raised . To me her hull appears to be sound but her engines , by all reports , were far from satisfactory even before she was scuttled and burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks under water . Chief Constructor John L. Porter and Lieutenant John M. Brooke are hard at work planning radical changes both as to her armament and structure . From this sixteenth day of May I will have the honor of collaborating with these gentlemen .  | Sam 's lip crept in between his teeth . Always a sense of bitter shame stung him whenever Irad or Sylvia entered his thoughts . Another significant item imparted by Irad was that Sylvia was with child at long last ! Despairingly Sam clung to the possibility that this baby might indeed be Irad 's , but it was a tenuous hold . After all , had not Irad and Sylvia lived as man and wife without issue for nearly three and a half years ? He lingered on the balcony , staring with unseeing eyes at the sunhis fingers tight on the settee 's iron arms . How was Sylvia reacting to this knowledge now that the worst possible consequence of their folly had been realized ? Since that awful , soul-shattering morning in Baltimore , he had prayed on his knees for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening and whenever a service was held he attended the Lafayette Presbyterian Church . Perhaps , by consequence , his sense of guilt had become somewhat less overpowering until receipt of Irad 's letter . Surely an all-wise God could weigh the difference between an impulsive , unpremeditated outbreak of lust and a deliberately planned seduction ? " Oh , God , " he groaned , softly . " So Robbie is to have a bastard for his half brother . " Again Sam deliberated seeking out his brother and making a complete confession in order that Irad might shoot him down as he deserved . He brooded so often that his fellow officers aboard the Sumter noticed and wondered , and nicknamed him " Silent Sam . " Two days later , however , Captain Semmes and the wardroom noticed an abrupt change for the better in Sam 's demeanor . What brought this about was the arrival of a second missive from Norfolk ; this time from Sylvia . She wrote that she and Irad were much concerned over his health . Was n't New Orleans supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquity ? That she was going to bear Irad 's child rendered her very proud and happy . Twice she had underlined her husband 's name . Mercy , they had just about abandoned hope of having issue . The writer then went on to dwell on family matters , of exciting days following the burning and surrender of Gosport Navy Yard . There was considerable rebuilding being done and Irad worked all  | hours designing an ironclad warship for the Confederate Navy which was in the process of being created . Sam was not to worry over his son because Robbie was thriving ; evcryone thought him at least a year older than he really was . Every day the boy was learning new words and now chattered like a magpie . She remained his affectionate sister-in-law . Written in pencil was a postscript which burned itself into Sam 's mind as if written in fire . My child will be Irad 's . It could not be otherwise . I KNOW ' This reassuring and emphatic intelligence lifted much weight from Sam 's conscience ; but still he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had cared so tenderly for his motherless son . On another evening Sam went out to lean over the railing of his little balcony , ignoring the few early mosquitoes abroad ; later they were to become an intolerable pest , forcing him to anoint himself with lemon oil before resuming regular evening study of that dull Dutchman , Grotius ' " Laws of War and Peace . " How pleasant it was to stand here fanned by a breeze and watching hundreds of lights wink into existence . Below pianofortes tinkled and violins commenced to sob out a waltz in Monsieur Pierre 's popular cafe , located a bare half block down St. Charles Street . As usual he ended his visit to the balcony by studying the distant Mississippi flowing violet-red in the sunset . It was mighty stimulating to reflect that , any day now , the Confederacy 's first ocean-going manof-war would be placed in commission . To be sure the Privateering Act , published on April seventeenth , had sent some hastily manned , ill-adapted and badly armed privateers to sea . Such vessels as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed to make some brilliant captures , yet their careers would soon end . Far better than most of his associates he was aware of the heavy handicaps under which the Sumter must operate . Imagine being forced to close action with so powerful a steam frigate as the Brooklyn , the Minnesota or the Wabash , or any of a dozen others ! He was too  | much of a realist to dream that anything but the Sumter 's complete annihilation would result . Along with a majority of his fellow officers , he agreed with Commander Josiah Tattnall 's tenet that it was futile for the South to engage in a shipbuilding race against the numerous and well-equipped shipyards of New York and New England . Furthermore , everyone , except a few old die-hards , was aware that the age-old usefulness of wooden warships was ending . Construction of the Warrior by Her Britannic Majesty 's Admiralty and of the French Emperor 's equally powerful La Gloire  --  first of all armored ships  --  was pointing the way . If a single ironclad of comparable construction were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lovely wooden frigates and sloops of the Northern Navy plunging down forever to rest among the cod and barracuda . An exciting business , this , of participating in the birth of a navy which someday would rank with the world 's foremost . Although the Sumter , mounting as she did a total of but nine guns , represented but a pitiful first effort , still her commissioning remained significant in that a Confederate man-of-war soon would be flaunting the Stars and Bars over the high seas . No wonder that Raphael Semmes , who suggested a Rive Gauche poet or a latter-day prophet rather than a hard-bitten naval officer , fumed and fretted over the endless delays . Of late , Sam Seymour had taken to spending his over-long midday meal period in the company of a likeable and highly intelligent young Scot . The fellow was a veritable bundle of energy and as full of engineering innovations as a round shot of iron . This civilian dockyard employee could , and with any encouragement would , draw clever sketches of extraordinary engines , steering gears and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunton discussed a ram under present construction at Henderson 's Yard which he described as a low-lying , enormously powerful seegar-shaped vessel . She mounted but a single cannon to be fired through a Cyclopean gunport mounted forward , yet she was being so cleverly designed , and with so massive an iron beak , that inevitably she could stave in the toughest warship afloat . Sam grew fond of the diminutive Scot , appreciating his realistic approach to problems at hand with the Sumter . Despite repeated  | rebuffs from Naval Commissioners Rousseau and Farrand , Brunton respected their gray beards , energy and patriotic purposes . Sam exploded a blood-gorged mosquito on his cheek , heaved a reluctant sigh , then went indoors to turn up a kerosene lamp by which to refurbish his knowledge of the Spanish language and international law . Spanish quickly returned to him because he recalled readily Mrs. Mallory 's liquid Castilian accents from boyhood days in Pensacola . Perhaps more far-sighted than his fellow officers , Sam reckoned that a knowledge of these subjects might prove of inestimable value aboard a Confederate man-of-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1861 , an experienced observer could anticipate the cruiser 's finished appearance . Barkentine-rigged with tall masts raking sharply aft , the Sumter further mounted Brunton 's collapsible smokestack just forward of her mainmast . Shorn of cabins and upper works , the Sumter 's silhouette lay low to the water , a very great advantage in a commerce destroyer . His command , proudly thought Commander Raphael Semmes , already had assumed the aspect of a genuine naval vessel with black hull satisfactorily sleek and shrouds shiny frorn fresh tarring . Once t Ire carpenters had largely completed their toil , he ordered the cruiser 's crew aboard . Alas , few of these were men he had hand-picked nearly six weeks earlier when , fatuously , he had dreamed of getting the Sumter to sea by the middle of May ; too many fine but impatient seamen had departed for the Army or had shipped aboard some neutral merchantman . Consequently , at the cruiser 's first muster , one recognized British , Scandinavian and German accents , for all that a majority of Semmes ' ninety-odd men remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whit what flag they served so long as good food and prize money lay in prospect . Every day visitors of all sorts , all ages and of both sexes , thronged John Hughes ' shipyard , among them businessmen speculating upon the new cruiser 's ability to destroy Union commerce . Also came politicians bent on foreseeing personal advantages to be derived from a knowledge of the ship 's capabilities . One afternoon Lachlan had worked later than usual , the adjustment of a lignum vitae propeller-shaft bearing having displeased him . By the time he reached the deck the yard proved all but deserted save for some Negroes throwing dice between a stack of pitch barrels and a pile of cannon awaiting their carriages . Coat over arm , Brunton started down the gangplank . One of the sentries drawled , " They 's been someone waitin ' to see you . " He leered a little . " A gal . Been here near ' four hours . " " For God 's sake why did n't you send word ? " " She would n't lemme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken from your work . " Puzzled , Lachlan strode along the dock until he suddenly halted at the sight of a small , straight figure standing solitary beside the new cruiser 's cutter . Being Scottish , Brunton neither called out nor ran , only quickened his pace until he came up to Christina Reigler and so could put arms about her slim body . " Be kind , Lachlan , " she pleaded softly . " Do n't be angry . I had to come to you . " " Angry ? Oh , Tina , Tina , my heart ! " Succumbing to a rare impulsiveness he kissed her so hard on the lips that her blue eyes closed and , regardless of the grinning sentry , her slender arms crept up about his neck . She clung tight for a long while . At length he was able to ask , " And where have ye yet been these past six weeks ? ' T is near dementit I 've been . " " I was on the Silver Wing . " His small blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features . " So that 's where ye came by yon burn ? " Tina flushed to the roots of her neat , silver-blond braids . " Yes . Is  --  is it so very unsightly ? " " God bless ye , no , lass ! But luckily I never dreamed you might have been aboard that ill-starred craft . I  --  why , I 'd have gone mad ! "  | I le slipped an arm about her waist . " Let 's be finding some supper and tomorrow we 'll see about getting married . A double room is no ' so dear as two single ones . " ARRANGEMENTS GENTLY BUT FIRMLY Christina Reigler refused to be married until she had obtained employment , which she did with Mr. Zogbaum , a German baker whose son had departed as a volunteer for the Washington Artillery . " We are poor , Lachlan , " she explained smilingly , " and so can not afford to be idle  --  either of us . " During the week preceding their marriage , they tramped far and wide searching minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during their still-futile search , she said , " We must keep on looking . It is worth while because you are an Englishman and so can not be conscripted to fight in this senseless war . " Lachlan 's auburn side whiskers fairly bristled . " Good God , lass ! Never call a Scot an Englishman ! But ye 're right , we must search until we find exactly the house which suits our needs . Ye see , I have decided that New Orleans is where I will settle , where you will bring up our children . Of course , " his voice deepened and he looked hard at this grave , pale girl across the table , " some day I will build us a fine big house that will be the envy of everyone . " Her China-blue eyes steadily returned his gaze . " And why , Lachlan , are you so sure that New Orleans is to be our home ? " " Think on it a bit , lass , " he invited . " Where else in this great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , New York or even in Baltimore . Look about ye . Here in New Orleans Frenchmen , Spaniards , Germans and Italians , even British " ? he grinned ? " are considered to be as good as the next man . " " Yes , that is so . Besides , most people here do not understand the  | real meaning of work . We do , you and I. " Beneath a red and white table cloth on a table of Vonderbanck 's Restaurant on Common Street , her hand groped for and closed on his . " Then you have formed plans  --  business plans ? " " Yes . No matter which way this war ends , " Brunton lowered his voice , " New Orleans can not escape being a principal port of America , One day seagoing vessels will be constructed here , they must be , and I will be among the first to build them . All that is built now are mere coasters and little river steamboats . " He winked gravely . " Because of that , this war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've an eye on a fine big yard over in Algiers which will go bankrupt before this year is out : also , I have made some few influential friends . " Maybe I can land a war contract . There are many here who are disgusted with the Confederate Navy Department . " Elbows on table , he talked faster , more seriously . " Can you imagine it ? The Confederate Navy contracts for so many million feet of lumber and so much hardware , but Governor Moore o ' this State orders such supplies diverted to complete his State-built men-of-war . On top of all this argy-bargy , private shipping contractors are defrauding and defying both authorities for their ain profit . " Tina leaned closer over the table , her pale hair for once more golden than silver beneath the gaslights . " You said , Lachlan , that you have your eye on a shipyard ? " " Aye , Miss Nosey . " He grinned . " But I 'll not say more till the deal is closed  --  if ever it is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yell have bought a dress for our wedding ? Was ten dollars enough for it ? " Tina flushed , glanced aside . " You were much too generous , Lachlan . I did very well with seven dollars ; the extra three I have put aside . " " Tish , tush ! We 'll be getting married but this once . " Before they had done talking Vonderbanck 's Restaurant became filled , emptied itself and then filled once more . There entered an amazing variety of resplendent uniforms and ladies of pleasure scarcely less brilliantly garbed than their escorts . " I would like for us to marry in the Lutheran Church , " Tina announced as they prepared to depart . " I am told the Reverend Predikant will be satisfied with a fee of two dollars . "  | deleted paragraph THE plain , hard-working Scottish engineer should have asked him of all people to witness his wedding had surprised and pleased Lieutenant Samuel Seymour . So , on a sunny Thursday in late May , he repaired to a flower shop in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clatter of steel-shod hoofs and noted that a colored footman was with difficulty restraining a pair of sleek black carriage horses harnessed to a smart yellow and black town carriage . From it sprang Leon ) uchesne . " Ohe ! Sam ! " Looking mighty handsome in the dazzling light blue uniform prescribed for the Louisiana Navy , the Creole 's spotless teeth glinted in his dark and facile features . " And whither , my old friend , are you bound ? Is that so-beautiful bouquet destined for the eye of some lovely quadroon of Rampart Street ? " " Nothing so romantic , " Sam chuckled . " It 's only that a civilian engineer at our dockyard is about to be married . He is Scotch and his  | bride , I gather , is from away , so they do n't know a soul in town . I 'm on my way up to help get them spliced . " " Nom de Dieu ! Just poor little strangers in wicked old New Orleans , eh ? This touches my heart . Ohe , Maman Zele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage . We must encourage the bride . " " Oui , M'sieu Leon , tout de suite ! " The old mulattress bobbed a curtsy , then her yellow tignon flashed as , hastily , she employed strands of raffia to bind a stock of roses and lilies into great glowing sheaves . " And now , " Leon announced , once he had pushed Sam into the carriage , " we shall find this bride an attendant . " He snapped his fingers . " Bigre ! I have it ! We will call on my cousin Louise and see if she will not be amused to oblige us . One suspects that after six years in Paris , New Orleans bores her to extinction . " Although thoroughly embarrassed , Seymour could not dissuade his voluble comrade in arms and soon found himself in Conti Street gazing up at a handsome three-storied house of time-mellowed yellow brick . A moment later he was surveying the interior of a home such as he had not imagined could exist in America . Against walls of sage green , light blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountains in the dim light . The furniture was of the Louis XVI and Directoire periods , more delicate by far than the solid English mahogany pieces encountered around New England . Leon vanished upstairs leaving Seymour to fret and glance anxiously at his watch . Damn Leon and his friendly bullying ; that they would be late at the church was now inevitable . Light footsteps sounded on an elaborate circular stone staircase protected by a handsome guard rail of Spanish wrought iron . Descending was a rather tall and slender-waisted young woman wearing a wide crinoline of lemon-yellow voile . Besides a reticule of yellow and black beading , she carried a long-handled , dark green silk parasol . For a moment Sam could discern nothing of her face because its features were concealed by a wide and floppy leghorn hat . " Mademoiselle Louise Cottier ! " Duchesne bowed gracefully on the staircase . " May I present Mr. Samuel Seymour of the Confederate States Navy ? " Miss Cottier paused , hand on newel post , smilingly to regard her cousin 's square-shouldered friend . Sam for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lady handsome rather than beautiful . Perhaps it was because of her rather heavy straight brows and strongly modeled features . Nonetheless he was captivated by the vivacity of her clear , amethyst-blue eyes shaded as they were by unusually long lashes . Curls , gathered into little clusters over each temple by small yellow bows , were the glossy blue-black of a grackle 's wing . " Your servant , Ma'am , " he declared as Duchesne snatched up his cape . " Shall we make our manners en route ? I fear our bridal couple are waiting . " It proved a gay , hurried drive , through crowded , vividly colorful streets . Leon 's flowers , roses , lilies , camellias , magnolias alike , lay in fragrant bundles upon the laps of the trio . About Louise Cottier , Sam was discovering a pleasurable lack of affectation for when she regarded him she did n't peep up as if frightened half to death . He liked , too , the easy fashion with which she participated in the conversation . The blacks were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bridle handles . Recognizing the ingredients of romance , a vari-colored crowd had collected , for all that weddings were the order of wartime . " Ma foi ! Are all Protestant churches as somber as this ? " breathed the Cottier girl on entering . Sam found no time to reply , for out of the vestry strode Lachlan Brunton , perspiring heavily and looking definitely harassed . " And where , Monsieur , shall I find your young lady ? " Louise Cottier presently demanded , smiling at the Scot from under her leghorn 's wide brim . " I presume she is unattended ? " Brunton indicated the vestry door . " Aye , aye , please go to her , Ma'am . She 's in need of a female 's comforting . " Just then Leon came running up the steps lugging a double armful of flowers and for the first time caught sight of Brunton . " Mon Dieu ! It can not be ! Sam , this is my rescuer at that sacre theatre in Baltimore . " He tossed the bouquets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war makes so many impossibilities plausible , does it not ? And your lady ! Ah , how well I remember her Grecian profile and marble complexion . Oh , Sam , Louise , this is but incredible ! "  | " Losh ! I wouldna ' ha ' credited it , " Brunton exclaimed pumping Duchesne 's hand . " Sam ! ' T is him who got me my position doon here . Ye must ha ' brought him a-purpose so that I 'd have two friends on hand . " Leon Duchesne would entertain no demurring whatsoever about the newly wed couple 's proceeding for an impromptu wedding breakfast at his residence , a pretty little Spanish-built house on a sleepy , oak-shaded square off Bourbon Street . Tina , still dazed by the actuality of her marriage , for the first time in her life tasted champagne and commenced to enjoy Leon 's gay gallantry and Miss Cottier 's tactful suggestions . Not since the catastrophic aftermath of Mr. Winans ' ball had Sam Seymour drunk champagne , but he found it as fascinating as of yore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched her glass and sat bolt upright on a gilded little Louis XVI chair , unconscious that her plain blue dress was singularly at harmony with its canary-yellow upholstery . Himmel ! How could so many lovely things exist in one place ? One day , she vowed to herself , that quite without envy , she and Lachlan would own such a room . When Sam Seymour offered a plate of petits fours she said , shyly , " In Baltimore I once worked for a Mrs. Seymour , a very lovely lady . Is she by chance a relation ? " A tiny ting ! drew Louise Cottier 's attention to the fact that the stem of Lieutenant Seymour 's glass had snapped . He said quietly , " Yes . Mrs. Seymour is my brother 's wife . " " Oh . " Tina 's pointed features lit . " Then you must be that sweet little boy 's father ! " A scarlet flush welled from under gold braid binding the collar of Sam 's undress uniform . " You  --  you liked him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how dear Mrs. Seymour adored him ! " The Cottier girl 's slim fingers delicately smoothed a napkin on her knee as she laughed , " Trust Leon to forget mentioning that you are happily married , Mr. Seymour . " " Oh , no , " Tina interrupted in sudden distress . " This Mr. Seymour is a widower . " " Indeed ? " Louise Cottier turned quickly . " Your son is of what age ? "  | Sam drew a breath deep enough to lift his jacket 's gilded buttons . " He will be three come next month . My brother and sister-in-law have cared for him since my wife died . " " Such kind people they are , " Tina burst out . " You see , Miss Cottier , my  --  my husband and Mr. Irad Seymour worked for a time at the same shipyard . " The bride blushed to the roots of her gleaming silverblond tresses , smiled at Sam . " Please would you tell them about Mr. Brunton and me ? " While driving his cousin back to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold forth on the Manassas , that strange new ram being built by private parties . " Imagine , " he cried , tooling his buggy about a dog lying asleep in the street , " this wonderful craft lies so low in the water that ordinary ships can not hit her , and if they should , why , her back is turtleshaped and so cannon balls will glance harmlessly aside . Further , she will be fitted with an iron beak and is to carry a single great gun . " He shot a sidewise glance at those serenely lovely features half concealed beneath the leghorn . " Miserable fine , you do not listen to me . " " Enfin , my dear Leon , I own little interest in these engines with which you men so cleverly assassinate one another . " She tilted her parasol to cut off the sunlight . " This Navy friend of yours ? Were you aware he is a widower and has a little son ? " " But yes . What of that ? " Louise settled back after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just why should Monsieur Seymour snap the stem of a wine glass when his sister-in-law suddenly was mentioned ? " " Because he must be in love with her , " Leon laughed . " Sylvia Seymour is most attractive . " He twirled a bayonet-like mustache . " I do not think he is in love , mon cher , " the dark-haired girl observed over the cob 's brittle-sounding hoof beats . " Again , if he is a Virginian , why does he not talk like one ? Mon Dieu ! I find him more like a Yankee . " " You had better not tell him so if you wish to see him again . " " And who says that I do , mon cher cousin ? " laughed the Cottier girl .  | " I do ! " laughed Leon Duchesne , deftly guiding his buggy into myrtle-shaded Villiere Street . " One is not so entirely absorbed with men-of-war as all that . " " Va-t'en , imbecile ! " she cried and stuck out her tongue , smallgirl fashion . XV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of June the third , 1861 , in a state of ill-subdued excitement because today they would witness the commissioning of their Confederacy 's first ocean-going man-of-war . Such newspapers as the Memphis Avalanche and the Galveston Civilian , not to mention the local journals , had waxed so lyrical over the event that from surrounding plantations and villages crowds arrived by carriage , steamboat and rail . Everyone was keen to hear the patriotic address His Excellency Governor Moore would deliver following those of His Honor Mayor Monroe and Commander Rousseau , venerable Commissioner from the Richmond Navy Department . Morning dawned disclosing , alas , an ominous gray bank lying in the southwest and it was still as frightfully hot as it had been all week . Armorers mounting the new cruiser 's guns had had a miserable time . All the same , huge crowds made their way towards the waterfront . The Sumter lay trim and neat as a yacht alongside Hughes &; Company 's construction dock . Her crew , through having come aboard several days earlier , evidently knew their way about and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severest martinet of the Old Navy could justifiably have found nothing to criticize in the spotlessness of the Sumter 's decks , the lustre of her brightwork nor in the smart bracing of her yards . For this grand occasion the new cruiser 's officers appeared for the first time wearing double-breasted , long-skirted coats of field gray over  | dark blue-striped gray trousers . A general atmosphere of high good humor became tempered by solemnity whenever Commander Semmes appeared . In the Captain 's deep-set dark eyes , thought Lieutenant Seymour , gleamed the inspiration of a zealot dedicated to a high and holy cause . Usually jovial Lieutenant Robert T. Chapman from Alabama for once was wearing a grave look while ranging himself beside his captain on the quarterdeck . Next to him stood Lieutenant J. M. Kell who was of medium height and seemed older than he was because of a few gray streaks in his brown hair , whiskers and mustaches . When he spoke it was with a flat and unmistakable Georgian accent . John M. Stribling , Third Lieutenant , was probably the handsomest officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lieutenant William E. Evans . Only twenty-four years of age and very slim , young Evans was further distinguished by having a brother on duty as a major general in the South Carolina State Army . Among the officers assembling amidst black and yellow shadowpatterns created in the rigging by the sun now forcing its way through the clouds stood Lieutenant Samuel Seymour , assigned to the anomalous duties of First Prize Master . How grand it was once more to tread a quarterdeck and feel the familiar tug of a dress sword at his belt . For the tenth time he inspected the cleanliness of his white kid gloves and exulted that , among hundreds applying , he should have found a post on this handsome little cruiser . A Marine 's bugle sounded a staccato warning that sent the crew , bravely clad in dark blue trousers , white shirts and pale blue scarfs , running to form up in the waist . A buzz of excitement arose from a huge crowd gathered on the quayside when bayonets glittered as the Marines presented arms in honor of Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone frostily in the sunlight as he came striding up the Sumter 's gangway bearing a long scroll secured with a gray , gold-edged ribbon . While the bosun 's silver pipe trilled and warbled , the cruiser 's Executive Officer called all hands to attention . At the head of the gangway Commanders Rousseau and Farrand saluted the quarterdeck , then briskly the Commissioners advanced towards the foot of the mainmast . Awaiting them there stood Commander Semmes , his officers , Mr. Hughes and his partner in the shipbuilding business .  | Once Semmes and the Commissioners had exchanged salutes , Commander Rousseau formally accepted the Sumter into naval service from the civilians who had rebuilt and armed her . From beneath his arm commander Rousseau removed the cruiser 's commission and solemnly gave it into her captain 's hand . A silence born of intense solemnity vaulted the man-of-war 's rail and spread to the onlookers ranged alongside and crowding the rigging of near-by vessels . Everyone could hear Raphael Semmes read the Navy Department 's order of commission in a penetrating and most impressive voice . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue commission pennant was hoisted to spiral lazily at the main top , Lieutenant Kell stepped forward bearing a neat compact parcel upon a black velvet cushion . No one on board had to be told that this was that ensign upon which ladies of New Orleans so long had been stitching . At a curt command from Commander Semmes , the quartermaster saluted , accepted and bent the colors to a halyard . Then , while the music of the First Louisiana Zouaves played the " Marseillaise , " field pieces boomed and the Stars and Bars soared smoothly to the signal gaff where , unfurling , it undulated gracefully to a gentle breeze beating up the mighty Mississippi . Speeches followed , so charged with high spirit , self-confidence and defiance , that tears came to many eyes . Mayor Monroe touched the oratorical heights in picturing the Sumter as a gallant knight about to defend the fair city of New Orleans from a swarm of Abe Lincoln 's licentious hirelings . Later , in the privacy of his cabin Commander Semmes felt so moved that he wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oft that fearful question will intrude ! ' T was but an instant past  --  and here he stood ! And now ! ? without the portal 's porch she rushed , And then at length her tears in freedom gushed ; Big , bright , and fast , unknown to her they fell ; But still her lips refused to send " farewell " ! For in that word  --  that fatal word  --  howe'er We promise  --  hope  --  believe  --  there breathes despair .  | When he had done , Semmes knelt and prayed , fiercely , like a prophet of the Old Testament for strength and wisdom with which to smite shrewdly the satanic minions of the Northern tyrants  --  in a courtly , honorable fashion , of course . That evening the Sumter 's officers were enjoying more-than-lavish hospitality and acclaim at Mayor Monroe 's reception . Here the finest of vintages of France and Spain splashed freely into gleaming glasses and the refreshments were something to remember . " Such confidences as were heard expressed this morning , I find sublime . Surely such spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell , correspondent of the august London Times to Lieutenant Seymour . " Enthusiasm undoubtedly has its uses , " Seymour replied , nibbling at a callas  --  a doughnut of pecans . " However , I 'd a damned sight rather see the money squandered on this affair devoted to the purchase of arms and ammunition . " The Englishman raised a white-kid-gloved hand to stroke very long and pale yellow side whiskers . " Indeed , Mr. Seymour ? Then you do not subscribe to the theory that one Southerner can whip five Yankees ? " The stare to which Seymour treated him brought color to Mr. Russell 's lean , bright red features . Quickly he muttered , " I apologize , sir . During my visits to Charleston , Savannah and Mobile , I well ? have heard so many , too many such boasts . " He accepted a glass of sherry offered by a liveried black footman . " I wonder , sir , whether you have any idea of the absurd misconceptions entertained by certain presumably well-educated Southerners ? " " As a neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be our most grievous error ? " Although they occupied an obscure corner of Mr. Monroe 's library , Russell glanced through the tall French doors , then quizzically considered this broad-shouldered young officer in the unfamiliar gray naval uniform . " Do you prefer a frank , if unpleasant , answer or a tactful evasion ? " " I have made sufficient cruises in foreign waters , sir , to prefer an honest reply . " " Very well . I presume that you have read your President 's recently  | voiced opinion to the effect that the Confederacy needs no navy because , within sixty days , the Federal Navy must find itself exchanging broadsides with British men-of-war fighting for the South ? " " I have . " Sam frowned into his julep cup . Mr. Russell delicately inhaled from a freshly lighted seegar . " You appear to entertain some doubts as to the validity of that theorem ? " " I voice no doubts , sir , but I value your opinion . " " Since I have learned , to my sorrow , that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construed as British policy , I must secure your promise not to repeat what I shall say . " " It is yours , sir . " " I am truly sympathetic with your Southern attempt to win independence , Mr. Seymour ; perhaps only because we British entertain a penchant for the underdog . " Russell leaned forward and lowered his voice . " Before long , the British Crown must decide whether it prefers to have cotton , that staple which means bread for a large part of its subjects or ? " " ? What could outweigh such a consideration ? " Sam interrupted without shifting his gaze from the Englishman 's long and impassive features . Russell answered quietly but impressively . " ? The enslavement of five million Negroes , Mr. Seymour . We can never forget that here in your Southland five million human souls are being held in involuntary servitude . " In the ensuing silence the music and the light laughter of many ladies which penetrated the library 's cool dimness sounded , somehow , frivolous . " Do you imagine that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our detestation of slavery and all of its hideous and immoral aspects ? " " It will , " Sam replied slowly , " if it is true that the United Kingdom is , as we are informed , ruled by merchants and the upper classes . Surely our Confederacy will be recognized . " Mr. Russell combed his long side whiskers and smiled faintly . " May I invite you to recall , my dear sir , that , at a cost of twenty millions of pounds , slavery was abolished throughout the United Kingdom and its possessions in 1833 ? And by the French in 1848 ? " Seymour 's white-kid-covered hands tightened . THE TURBULENT MISSISSIPPI 221  | " Are you sure slavery is abhorred to that extent ? You must have seen that with a few exceptions our slaves are well and kindly treated . " " True , but most Europeans wo n't believe so ; least of all the British public . No , Mr. Seymour , I very much doubt that England will ever ally herself with your Confederacy . " The newspaperman dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Pray do n't look so put-out and recall that you asked me the question . What do you say , shall we seek a cup of is Honor 's claret punch ? " Sam 's first impulse was to follow the correspondent out of the library , but instead he wandered out onto a balcony opening invitingly to his left . It was cooler outside ; besides he could watch the reception through open French doors , a brilliant spectacle , thanks to its bewildering variety of uniforms , banks of flowers and evening gowns even more splendid than any to be seen about Baltimore or New York . How soon might the Sumter go to sea ? Several days must elapse since the new cruiser had yet to conduct trial runs and charge her magazines and bunkers . Again , her raw gun crews must undergo further training and learn not only to load , point and fire , but also to pass powder boxes and serve her two small boat howitzers . The Sumter 's men had best learn their gunnery for , since the twenty-sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memof-war had begun to cruise on blockade off the Delta some forty miles below New Orleans . It was reported that the U.S.S. Brooklyn was patrolling Pass a l'Outre , while the U.S.S. Powhatan was watching both the Southwest and Grand Pass exits . Sam knew from intimate knowledge of the Old Navy that the guns of either could easily sink the little Sumter ere her cruise had even begun . Light issuing from the library momentarily became obscured by the passage of a couple entering the next balcony to his . Quickly he recognized the lady as Duchesne 's cousin , Louise Cottier , radiant in a cerise evening gown cut daringly low , and wearing strands of seed pearls twisted through her glossy sable tresses . In easy Spanish she was conversing with her escort , a tall Spaniard darkly handsome in the somber blue and silver uniform of the Foreign Legion of New Orleans .  | " Que calor ! At this moment , " she declared , fanning gently , " I set fresh air above rubies and much fine gold . " " And your loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quien es ? " Sam , aware that his presence had been noted , bowed and called , " Good evening , Miss Cottier . " Over the chatter of footmen and coachmen lounging in the court below he heard the Cottier girl saying , " It is chillier than I had expected , Senor Teniente , will you be good enough to fetch my scarf ? It is of green silk and with silver sequins ? " " And where , Senorita , is this scarf to be sought ? " " Alas , I am not sure , " the Cottier girl laughed carelessly . " Perhaps you will come across it in my carriage , or possibly I left it upon a sofa in the Honorable Monsieur Monroe 's music room . " " Your wish is my command , " declared the Lieutenant , then hurried off with lamplight glancing bravely from his ponderous epaulettes . On her balcony , Louise Cottier deliberately faced about , moving her fan in graceful arcs . " Are you so difficult to please , Monsieur Seymour , that none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He hurried through the library to join her . " I would have begged a dance of you , but  --  but  --  your admirers were too many . " Her dark red lips curved slowly into a provocative smile . " If you fear odds  --  should you have joined our Navy ? " " There are odds  --  and odds . Your admirers would fight much more fiercely for you than for the Stars and Bars . " She lost a little of her light manner . " I hope not , for all that yours is a well-turned compliment . Perhaps you will dance later ? " " I would , save that I have danced very little since my wife died three years ago . " Deliberately , he introduced the subject . Her white-gloved hand crept out , came gently to rest upon the pointed loop and two gold bands indicating his grade . " May one who is almost a stranger offer sympathy ? " her rich tones softly demanded . " Your grief is written in more than your speech . Does your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid not . Robbie looks deplorably like me . " Her teeth gleamed briefly in the starlight . " Of that he need not be ashamed . It appears that you view this war seriously , not like so many of my gallant but feather-headed friends . "  | " On the slave patrol I saw men killed , " he explained . " I know something of what battle means . Besides , I know a great many Northerners . " And how do you esteem them ? Money-grubbers ? Poltroons ? " " Why , the ones I 've known are mostly unspectacular and slow to anger ; once aroused , however , they fight bravely and , mark this well , are tenacious to the end . " " Will you fetch us some champagne ? " " But your Spanish friend ? " " That was a mere ruse de coquette ; there was no scarf , mon ami , so he will be a long time finding it . " Louise 's laugh rippled like still water into which a stone has been cast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear about your exploits at sea . " XVI PASS A L'OUTRE AT THE HEAD of Passes , the C.S.S. Sumter , reeking of new black paint , lazily swung to her anchors . Down in his cabin Commander Raphael Semmes was once more deliberating upon which of the three main exits into the Gulf of Mexico he would attempt . His answer , he was forced to admit , lay in the hands of Providence and the movements of the blockade ships Brooklyn and Powhatan . For ten days now , his command had waited poised to make her bid for access to the high seas . Among the Sumter 's afterguard was an officer who once had served aboard the Brooklyn ; gloomily he informed his anxious fellows that , while proceeding from Tampico to Pensacola the year before , the Federal had steamed at an average of thirteen knots . No one knew for sure what the Sumter could do under steam alone since during her time-trials off Baton Rouge , she had either been checked or assisted by the Mississippi 's swift current . This Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Third Lieutenant , John M. Stribling on duty as officer of the deck and  | supervising the stowage of gear preparatory to the holding of Divine Services . The crew , unfeignedly grateful for a day 's respite from " Old Beeswax 's " eternal gun and boat drills , prepared for Sunday muster in heat so intense that , long since , ungainly gray-brown pelicans and sable cormorants had flapped off in search of shelter . Presently , a small boat pulling over from the Pilot Station attracted Lieutenant Stribling 's attention  --  something about the way her black oarsmen were bending their eight-foot sweeps bespoke urgency . Stribling , therefore , was at the head of the ladder to meet the caller , a gaunt and yellow-faced river pilot . " Say , Lootenant , I just spoke the Empire Destiny , " he panted . " Her skipper claims the Brooklyn 's put out to sea after a blockade runner . " " He 's positive ? " snapped Stribling , black eyes lighting . " As sure as God 's above . Here 's the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker 's lantern jaw was working excitedly on his chew of tobacco . Within five minutes the Sumter fairly seethed with activity as small-boat booms were swung in , crewmen dashed below , tearing off their Sunday uniforms and lugging sea bags back from inspection . Still in their Sunday best , the officers sped about their duties while from the barkentine 's funnel dense columns of sooty smoke commenced to pour in volcanic fury ; Engineering Officer M. J. Freeman , had orders to raise steam with all speed . " On a still day like this so much smoke will be seen for miles , " anxiously commented Lieutenant Kell . " Is n't it just our luck ? " Outwardly calm but with cavernous gray eyes snapping , Commander Semmes stood at the break of his brief quarterdeck listening to the capstan 's pawls begin to click , clack , slowly at first , then faster . Once her anchor had been broken out , the Sumter commenced gradually to yield to the current and swing her bowsprit downstream . The pilot demanded , " Which pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you value your life , Mr. Harrington , make no mistake . " Once he felt the deck commence to throb beneath his feet , Sam Seymour experienced a curious and unfamiliar thrill . Below the Delta lay no slaver but the United States steam frigate Brooklyn , swift and so heavily gunned that one well-directed broadside from her could  | smash the little cruiser into a tangle of blood-streaked spars and timbers . Was this pilot 's information correct ? Once , previously , misinformation had induced the Sumter to waste precious coal . The bare feet of seamen , furiously employed , slap-slapped about the deck , and topmen swarmed aloft , ready at an instant 's notice to set the barkentine 's canvas . The screw turned at increasing speed until the barkentine 's bow waves went curling whitely away across the placid current . The gun crews now began to cast off protecting tarpaulins , removing tompions from the guns and fetching powder boxes on deck . Additional shot and shell were fetched up from lockers below . Lieutenant Seymour , Acting Gunnery Officer , superintended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-inch Paixhan capable of throwing shot some nineteen hundred yards . His gaze mechanically checked the presence of the fifteen gunners serving this princess of destruction  --  there should , by regulation , have been twenty-five , but the Sumter was too small . Both loaders , and all lever , springer and compression men were in their assigned positions , but one tackle man was lacking , also a shell man . The First Gun Captain soon located them , completing secondary duties ; already stripped to the waist , their white torsos shone silvery in the sunlight . The departing man-of-war 's course took her very near to the Pilot Station , so close , indeed , that her crew cheered a pretty young girl standing on an iron balcony there and waving a scarlet handkerchief . " That 's my woman , " the pilot grinned . " She 'll soon go to pray for you . Everyone watched Commander Semmes sweep off his cap and , as the Sumter darted by , make a gallant bow in her direction . More petticoats swayed out onto Lighthouse Wharf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Harrington , the pilot , braced big feet against the horse block , shot Semmes an anxious glance . " You know , sir , they 's a Bremen ship , sir , gone agrount half a mile below ? She 's makin ' ready to kedge and warp and will likely foul us lest they slacken their hawsers in time . Mebbe ye 'd better make sig-nal ? "  | " I hardly think so , " came the equable reply . " They will have observed our smoke . " An undertone of excitement arose from the ship 's company when , on rounding a bend , they beheld the German vessel hard aground on a bar , but even as the Sumter appeared a taut line attached to her kedge commenced to slacken and to sag into an ever-deeper ellipse . When , moments later , the little cruiser thumped by her , the crew raised yells of gratitude to which the Germans answered with a ringing , " Hoch ! Hoch der Sumter ! " Once he had conned the barkentine across the bar off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican Gulf shimmered in the distance , the pilot departed flushed under the eloquent thanks of Commander Semmes . As Mr. Harrington set foot to the ladder he bawled up to the quarterdeck , " Now , Cap'n , you are all clear . Give them hell and let ' er go ! " The passage of only a few minutes was required before an anxious knot of officers on the C.S.S. Sumter 's quarterdeck realized that , for a second time , they had been misled . The Brooklyn had not chased out of sight , but was cruising along under easy canvas perhaps four miles distant ! " Oh , God ! " groaned Lieutenant Kell into his big beard . " She 'll have the foot of us at by least five knots , and will you look at her stoke up ? " Geysers of smoke came boiling from the Federal 's squat single funnel . Incisively Captain Semmes directed , " Heave the log , Mr. Seymour . " During the prescribed interval Sam watched the knots whirring over the stem rail , then stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sober when he called , " Eight and a half knots , sir . " Semmes ' craggy features contracted . " You must be mistaken . Heave again . " When the result proved identical , expressions grew anxious among the afterguard . To a midshipman Semmes barked , " My compliments to Mr. Freeman and will he report to the quarterdeck immediately ! " Red-faced , blackened by grease and coal dust , the Chief Engineer reported . " I 'm doing my best , sir , but we suffer a drawback just now due to foaming in our boilers . " " Foaming ? " rasped Commander Semmes . " What do you mean ? "  | " Such often occurs , sir , when steam is got up in a great hurry . When the foaming subsides we should be able to increase speed by half a knot . " " Thank you . Return to your post and coax your engines to their best efforts . " " Brooklyn 's cracking on t'gallants , sir , " called Lieutenant Chapman . It proved depressing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread her canvas , then braced yards more sharply on to the starboard tack . " Make all sail , Mr. Chapman , " snapped Semmes . " We must gain as much headway as possible while the current still favors us . " To any but the experienced eyes of the ex-Union officers aboard , it would have appeared that the Sumter 's courses , gallants and royal mizzen sheet were set and trimmed quite as expertly as those propelling the blockade ship ; yet her topmen proved not quite so adept as their counterparts manning the Brooklyn . Once the yards creaked under filling canvas and the Sumter heeled well over , Lieutenant Evans observed , " Curse itl They have a little the weather gauge of us . " At the same time he glanced hopefully at a huge black rain squall rolling up from starboard . " True enough , " Seymour admitted after deliberation . " Still , we carry larger headsails and so should sail nearer the wind . " " Provided this wind holds yonder squall should overtake us in short order , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps we can lose yonder damned big brute in it . " To everyone it became apparent that the great , high-sided Brooklyn was slowly , but perceptibly , overhauling her smaller antagonist , for all that the latter 's black gang were so plying their shovels that ruddy fingers of fire came groping out of the Sumter 's funnel . Despite his mordant anxiety Sam felt fine to be at sea again , to feel the deck lift and sway , to hear the hiss ! ? hiss ! of waves under the cutwater , the rhythmic creak of lofty spars and the soft thrumming of stays and shrouds . All at once the Sumter seemed to gain speed , then an assistant engineer came running up to report that the foaming had ceased . Barely had he done so when , with a whoop and a howl , the rain squall came roaring over the weather rail like an enemy boarder . In an instant such torrents of rain fell that a gray wall reduced visibility  | to a few yards and every man on deck was drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mate were hard put to retain their grip on the wheel 's handspokes . Even so the Confederate cruiser heeled dangerously far over to port . Semmes clung to the weather rail , jet eyes fixed on the straining canvas although the barkentine listed over until a torrent of loose objects went tumbling across her rain-silvered decks . Still the wind 's velocity increased , whipped lacy spindrift from the crests of rising waves . Of the Brooklyn , absolutely nothing was to be seen . Lieutenant Stribling raised a streaming face and prayed aloud , " Oh , Great God , permit us to escape . We 've got to teach those damned , arrogant Yankees a lesson . " As quickly as it had raced up , the rain squall howled off to leeward , magically clearing the horizon . Aboard the Sumter arose a concerted groan for , with the suddenness of a conjuring trick , the great , highsided U.S.S. Brooklyn reappeared and undoubtedly much nearer . Since the Sumter mounted no stern chasers there was nothing to be done save rely upon the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sodden group agonizing on the fugitive 's quarterdeck expected to see the frigate 's bow chaser let fly . Stonily , Raphael Semmes turned to a midshipman . " My compliments to the paymaster . Direct him immediately to fetch up the public pay chest and our papers . " Presently Paymaster Henry Myers appeared carrying under his arm a canvas sack weighted with two bars of lead and heading two seamen who labored over a heavy iron chest . Semmes , long hair whipping about his eyes , carefully studied the ship astern , then in a quivering undertone observed , " By God , Kell , we 're beating her out of the wind . See , gentlemen ? See ! She 's falling to leeward and we may yet win free . She will have to furl sail the minute she falls into our wake . " The paymaster waited breathlessly , his thick body swaying like an inverted pendulum to the cruiser 's rolling . Presently the inevitable occurred ; the Brooklyn , unable to sail as closely into the wind as her adversary , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furl . A ragged spontaneous cheer burst from the anxious men aboard the Sumter 's decks . The Brooklyn began dropping astern so fast that , at  | half past three , the baffled blockader came about and commenced sullenly retracing her course to Pass a 1'Outre , leaving the Sumter free to surge on towards the destiny awaiting her on the high seas . XVII THE Golden Rocket THE Sumter 's AFTERGUARD was aware that , according to the Letter of Instructions received by Commander Semmes , they were expected " to seek , burn , and destroy the commerce of the United States in a manner adjudged most practical to the current injury of the enemy 's commerce in the shortest time " ; but of where " Old Beeswax " intended to cruise they had as yet received no intimation . The course set on the first day after the U.S.S. Brooklyn had been eluded was east-southeast , benefiting the cruiser with a slant of the northeast trade wind and , by use of sail , thus conserving her tiny coal supply . In the wardroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sumter was heading over calm seas in the general direction of Cape San Antonio at the west end of Cuba . Presently Commander Semmes made it known that his intention was to cruise along the southern shore of that Spanish possession , coal at some convenient point , then cruise to Barbados and there refuel before steering for rich pickings to be found off the Brazilian coast . Sure enough , dawn of the second day revealed Cape Corrientes on the southern coast of Cuba lifting itself above sparkling , blue-green waters . Off to the cruiser 's right lay the Isle of Pines , that former buccaneer paradise . Despite the drag of her non-retractable propeller , the Sumter proved speedy under sail , but all the same Chief Engineer Freeman often wished that the urgent warnings of a certain Scottish engineer named Brunton had not been disregarded . Prize Master Sam Seymour , taking his turn as deck officer , reveled in the bracing , sunlit air free of the reek of mudflats , bayous and the  | eternal whine of mosquitoes . Still another school of silvery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the barkentine 's foaming cutwater and disappeared into the back of an ultramarine roller . Somewhat to his surprise , Sam found himself dwelling again on that last evening in New Orleans  --  and Louise Cottier . What a fascinating blend of intelligence , sweetness and coquetry ! Had he found courage to beg an ambrotype of her , would she have ? ? " Sail ho ! " came ringing down from the foretop ; various officers interrupted their duties to crane necks skywards . Sam snatched up a leather speaking trumpet , bellowed , " Where away ? " But , instead of answering , the lookout sang down , " I see two sails , sir , three points off the port bow ! " " How do they sail ? " " Towards us , sir . " Tucking a blue and white checkered shirt into his trousers , Raphael Semmes came running from below followed by his servant bearing an ordinary blue civilian coat . To his signal officer , Lieutenant Chapman , Semmes snapped , " Bend on and hoist a British ensign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on demand heaved to , displaying the red and yellow colors of Spain . Amid excited comments from the Sumter 's crew , the launch was dispatched to inspect this stranger . When the EIena proved indeed to be Spanish , out of Cadiz for Vera Cruz , Lieutenant Evans , despite deep chagrin , offered suitable apologies in a clipped British accent , then permitted the Spaniard to resume his course . Without hoisting in her launch the Sumter got under way towards the second stranger , her British ensign flapping red and convincing in the sun-warmed breeze . In a fever of excitement , the cruiser 's rifled gun crew lined the rail , long since having drawn tompions , run in , loaded and primed . They stood ready to assume battle stations at the first roll of the Marine drummer 's instrument . The Marines aboard , a tough , hard-bitten lot , numbered twenty , which was a good many for so small a man-of-war . Supremely confident after witnessing the Spaniard 's release , the second stranger altered her course not at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a handsome bark with a New England look about her .  | When the Sumter fired one of her eight-inch guns in warning , no one was surprised to see the Stars and Stripes rise proudly to the stranger 's mizzen gaff . Despite himself , Sam Seymour felt a violent constriction in his throat . Could that once-revered ensign be an enemy Rag ? On the sun-darkened faces about him he read similar reactions , but Raphael Semmes ' powerful features were set in fierce eagerness commingled with bitter hatred . " Mr. Chapman , pray show our colors , " came his icy command . Down came the British flag and a spontaneous yell burst from the ninety-two men composing the Sumter 's enlisted strength at beholding the Stars and Bars go streaming skywards . Without awaiting a second gun , the bark 's captain hove-to his lovely , clean-lined vessel and held her in the winds eye , with snowy sails slatting lazily . This time Commander Semmes addressed his prize master . " Mr. Seymour , examine yonder vessel 's papers and should she prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced further unhappy twinges on approaching this vessel flying the beloved Old Flag . Somehow , he had never subscribed to that perfervid bit of poetry which Raphael Semmes forever kept repeating : Tear down that flaunting lie Half-mast the starry flag Insult no sunny sky With Hate 's polluted rag . The vessel 's master , an ample-bellied middle-aged man wearing great , orange side whiskers , stood waiting in the gangway . His face was so long and crabbed-looking that he might well have posed for some caricaturist 's typical Yankee . He was hopping mad at being halted like this , and said so . The prize , so her papers revealed , proved to be the Golden Rocket of Bangor , Maine , and was spanking new . Of some seven hundred tons burden , she sailed in ballast in search of a cargo of Cuban sugar ? a matter of keen disappointment to the boarding party . Nonetheless here was a fair prize ; Union-owned and manned , untainted by neutral cargo . Mighty serious of mien , Seymour tucked the bark 's papers under  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is herewith declared a prize to the Confederate States cruiser Sumter . Captain , you will accompany me aboard my vessel . " " But  --  but , " sputtered Captain Snow , leathery face turning from purple to pink-gray , " there ai n't no sech thing as a Confederate cruiser ! " By the time the Sumter 's boarding party returned , Captain Semmes and his executive had donned uniform , and with broad smiles greeted the information that their prize hailed from the black Republican State of Maine . " A clap of thunder from a cloudless sky could not have took me more aback than the sight of a Rebel flag in these here latitudes , " Captain Snow mumbled from the depths of a miserable daze . Semmes ' dark eyes glittered as he jerked a stiff bow . " My duty , sir , is a painful one , to destroy so noble a ship as yours , but I must discharge it without vain regrets ; and as for yourself , you will have only to do , as so many thousands have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yourself and your crew will be well treated aboard my ship . " All through the afternoon , the little cruiser 's boat crews toiled mightily in transferring from the prize such useful stores as food , sails , paint and cordage . Accordingly , not until ten o'clock at night was Lieutenant Seymour ordered to burn the Golden Rocket . Instead of elation , Sam experienced only profound distaste in executing this duty , for the Golden Rocket was indeed a magnificently well-proportioned vessel and had been beautifully kept up . Although it was one of the darkest nights he had ever seen thanks to a high overcast blotting out all stars , Sam could make out the doomed vessel rocking gently on this Stygian sea with mainsail set aback and courses flapping loose . Growled the coxswain , " Here 's at least one damned Yankee wo n't carry no more freight fer the goddam ' Blue-belly Armies . " Carrying a dark lantern , Sam swung aboard followed by the coxswain and a sergeant of Marines and found the once-orderly deck littered by a profusion of unwanted supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew 's personal belongings had been touched . Captain Semmes ' orders had been adamant on that score . Sam Seymour paused long enough to watch his coxswain and the  | Marine sergeant depart on their missions in foc'sle and main hold . The rustle of the canvas and the faint creak of yards against their parleis sounded so protesting and ghostly that he glanced apprehensively at the Sumter lying under easy canvas some three hundred yards distant , low , menacing and watchful . Only an occasional spark from her funnel spiraled up to reveal her exact position . Papers littered the floor of Captain Snow 's cabin but his bunk remined neat and white and his books ranged on their shelves . Sam sighed , gathered up a big , double armful of charts and heaped them on Captain Snow 's berth , then he unscrewed a kerosene cabin lamp from its gimbals and sprinkled its supply of coal oil liberally about . This accomplished , he removed the candle from his dark-lantern , touched it to the edge of a crumpled chart , then turned and hurried up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serpents of ' ' I smoke come writhing up from the main hatchway . The coxswain appeared , grinning from ear to ear . " Stove in a couple of barrels o ' turpentine down there , sir ; she 'll burn like a bark wigwam . " The sergeant called , " I 've set a blaze in her paint locker , sir . I 'll bet she goes down by the head ! " Indeed , before the launch could shove off , vivid tongues of flame had already begun to lick up from foc'sle and main hatch , dyeing the bark 's useless canvas a fatal and brilliant crimson . Seen against this pitch-black background , the Golden Rocket 's death throes remained forever stamped in the memory of the crews of both vessels . These crowded the cruiser 's port rail but said nothing after the first dazzling flames appeared . Commander Semmes remained stern and stiff beside the Sumter 's binnacle , but when the fire really got going Captain Snow turned aside , sobbing like a whipped schoolboy , " My ship ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Poor devil , " muttered Lieutenant Kell . " Must be hard to see his livelihood lost for him by those damned tyrants in Washington . " Stribling , however , growled , " Damned if I understand why Old Beeswax ' is so tender with a pack of Yankees . Did n't they fling the crew of our privateer , Savannah , into irons and bring ' em into New York charged with piracy ? " Again an unnatural silence descended , broken only by a savage , spine-tingling roar of flames beating across the water because the  | Golden Rocket had been caulked with old-fashioned pitch and oakum , and so blazed extra-brilliantly . Like fiery gymnasts , clumps of flame sped up well-tarred ratlines , thus outlining the shrouds in blazing relief . Like scarlet serpents , flames writhed out along the yards , touched off first the courses and spanker , then the dying bark 's topsails , gallants and royals until the whole area was flooded by a hellish , throbbing light . Great sections of burning canvas commenced to drive skywards under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suggestive of great golden gulls , these shreds soared high , higher , above the conflagration . Even at a quarter-mile distance the roaring sounded like that of a mighty waterfall . " That there 's a foretaste o ' what Abolitionist Abe and that bastard Stanton will find in the hereafter , " hooted a voice on the main deck . When its various stays , shrouds and braces had burned through , the victim 's foremast commenced to sway in a peculiar circular motion until , raising a geyser of sparks and with a resounding crash , it toppled overboard soon to be followed by main and mizzen . It was hardly noticeable when the Golden Rocket first commenced to sink by the head , but then she went down fast ; and , raising a sound as of a hundred thousand angered snakes , she filled the night with whirling rose-colored steam clouds and disappeared , leaving behind only a few bits of smoldering wreckage . Darkness once more claimed the sea . XVIII GRAY WOLF IN THE SHEEPFOLD THE DAY FOLLOWING , being July fourth , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? After all , just as many Southern States as Northern signed the Declaration , " Lieutenant Evans observed in his soft Carolinian drawl . The question was resolved when Mr. Kell , as Senior Lieutenant ,  | ! lowing an honored tradition , approached Captain Semmes and incited him to dine in the wardroom . " Sir , we would be privileged if you ? " Semmes made an abrupt gesture . " Mr. Kell , today is not a national holiday in the Confederacy . " The big Georgian must have looked taken aback , for Semmes briskly twirled spike-like mustachios and gazed out over the emerald sea . " I feel , sir , that the Declaration of Independence has proved but a specious device by which our loving Northern brethren enticed us into a so-called partnership , the better that they might , in the end , devour us . " The crew also was disappointed that the customary extra-ration of grog was not issued in honor of the day ; several grumbled , said no good would come of such disrespect to the Founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south coast of Cuba five miles distant and half-veiled by heat haze , two sails hove into sight . Without showing any colors whatsoever , the C.S.S. Sumter headed straight towards them . They promised by their build to be of American origin . Since the wind held light , these strangers could only attempt to run , but soon the Sumter ranged up between them and showed her Stars and Bars , then fired a single blank charge which caused both vessels to run up the United States flag and back their topsails . Boats were called away presently to return with two luckless skippers and their ship 's papers . " Damned if we 're not like pigs in clover ! " chuckled Kell , fondling his bushy brown beard . Upon examination the new prizes both proved to be deep-laden with molasses and sugar destined for British ports . Cross-examination revealed that but a short time ago the Cuba and the Machias had cleared from the island  --  a fact attested by small boats loaded with oranges , bananas , fruits and all manner of livestock . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden Rocket . They raged , called Commander Semmes a buccaneer to his face and swore that they would see every man-jack aboard hanged and sun-dried for piracy . Quite unruffled , Semmes ordered the pair below decks under Marine guard .  | " These cargoes , sir , unfortunately are protected by Certificates of Neutrality , " Sam Seymour reported after a quick survey of manifests and bills of lading . " We ' can not lawfully seize them . " " Blast ! " Stribling scowled . " That means we ca n't sink these damned tubs , either . " " Quite correct , " Semmes observed impassively . " However , this circumstance , gentlemen , will afford us occasion to test the disposition of the Spanish Queen towards our Cause . " His straight , iron-gray brows seemed to bristle . " As we all are aware , the English and French Governments have denied our enemies and ourselves use of their ports for prize condemnation proceedings , but I am hopeful of a favorable reception in Cuba . The Spanish have little love for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent proclamation by Queen Victoria 's Foreign Minister had proved a mixed blessing . While it did concede to the Confederacy a belligerent 's rights , it at the same time closed her ports to prizes made by either Northern or Southern men-of-war . This measure , of course , favored the North since precious few Southern merchant ships roamed the seas and Northern sea-borne commerce was second only to Britain 's own . In short order , Seymour detailed prize crews aboard the Cuba and the Machias . To the former , a small and badly found vessel , he sent only a midshipman and four rather ill-favored seamen , a fact which later proved a grave miscalculation , especially since her skipper was returned aboard ; the Sumter was far too small to accommodate many prisoners in the degree of decency Semmes insisted upon . For a while the Sumter attempted to tow both prizes , but the drag so reduced her speed that , before long , the Cuba was cast off and directed to make sail and join the Sumter in Cienfuegos Bay . Around noon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those of the crew who had never before sailed the Caribbean hung over the bulwarks , peering down through the amazingly clear water off the shoals of Jardinillias . They found it difficult to credit that , although the lead line showed six fathoms of water , corals , shells and weed bank were distinctly visible . They also caught glimpses of huge and hideous yellow-green moray eels , big red Jewfish , groupers , and occasionally the deadly gray-white outline of a cruising shark . With canvas furled and still towing the Machias , the Sumter  | steamed leisurely for that slender white finger suggested by Cienfuegos Lighthouse . Hardly had she neared the approaches to Jardinillias channel when a lookout reported the presence of two ships about eight miles ' distant . Could these be avenging Federal men-of-war ? This was far from impossible , as Sam very well knew . Immediately Commander Semmes ordered the Machias to be cast loose and instructed her to continue on into the neutral waters of Cienfuegos Bay . Her collapsible funnel spouting dense clouds of smoke , the cruiser then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the three-mile limit . Once again , the Sumter 's luck was in . The strangers proved to be the Ben Dunning of Maine and the Albert Adams of Massachusetts , both fresh out of Cienfuegos but , alas , freighting Spanish property . Again Sam Seymour told off prize parties , sent them aboard the newest captures with orders to retrace their course into Cienfuegos Bay . " Keep this up a little longer , then by God we 'll be rich as old King Croesus , " predicted Engineer Officer Freeman . On deck to catch a breath of cool air but black as any Moor with coal dust , he made a grotesque figure because rivulets of sweat had sketched minute white streaks and channels down his face and torso . " Provided the Dons agree to condemn our prizes , " Sam qualified . ' " There 's the rub . " Freeman remained optimistic . " Old Beeswax ' swears the Spanish Governor will not dare to refuse us either belligerent rights or a prize court . Spain is weak , hates England and knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annex Cuba and Puerto Rico after we 've won . " From the starboard rail they could catch the glint of the Machias ' sails already working up that passage which leads into the capacious and truly magnificent Bay of Cienfuegos . " Before long we should sight the Cuba , " predicted Senior Lieutenant Kell , scanning the stern horizon with a heavy brass spy glass . " Wonder where she is ? Could n't sail so slow as all that . " To all hands it seemed incredible that , within the space of some twenty-four hours , the Sumter , without firing a single shot at her victims , should have made five prizes , five ships now no longer able to serve in the Northern interest . When a banjo started a jubilant twangling in the forecastle , the deck officer was about to halt this indeco- rous exhibition , when Lieutenant Chapman called , " Let the lads have their fun ; there 'll be work and worry to spare when we make port . " Hardly anyone realized how astute was this remark . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her quartet of prizes entrance into Jardinillias channel by daylight , so the Sumter lowered steam pressure and lay off and on , shepherding the sailing ships . With dawn , however , the Sumter 's screw commenced to revolve more rapidly and Mr. Evans sent up strings of butterfly-bright signal flags ordering the prize captains to form a column behind the triumphant man-of-war . Gradually the Cuban coast line commenced to show in greater and more fascinating detail , disclosing palms and luxuriant vegetation marching down to the water 's edge . Already the gilded tops of that grand central massif which forms the spine of Cuba were coming into view . Almost as if by agreement , the sea breeze died away and wind off the land commenced to blow . The quartermaster , standing beside Commander Semmes , who for once seemed pleased with the world , cried , " Look , sir , look yonder ! " From near the exit of the channel and floating over the emeraldgreen tops of jungle trees was rising a dense column of black smoke ; it looked heavy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished in an instant . Tugging at his little goatee , he deliberated only briefly , then murmured , " Can the Yankees have a cruiser in there ? " It seemed impossible that an alarm should have been spread so promptly , yet the urgency of yonder smoke column appeared decidedly ominous . He sent a midshipman aloft who reported , " Small steam tug with three vessels heading down-channel , sir ! " " Of what rig are her tows ? " " Two barks and a brig , sir , all Americans by their colors . " Sam pondered Semmes ' next move . Three more prizes lay within easy grasp , yet to seize them here the Sumter must violate Spain 's neutrality , since she now was steaming well within the three-mile limit . As usual , Commander Semmes acted promptly , wisely and imaginatively . " Mr. Chapman , show Spanish colors , then run up the pilot  | needed ' signal . Mr. Kell , send the topmen aloft , cockbill your yards a little and ease your stays . Mr. Evans , send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stribling , the lean , black-eyed South Carolinian , looked worried while directing the lowering of the gunports . " What about our prizes ? " he asked Seymour . " Wo n't they give us away ? They only cleared here yesterday . " The various acting prize masters also proved quick to think and act by re-hoisting the Stars and Stripes and tacking lazily back towards the open sea as if they were on their way after being becalmed all night . Presently the steam tug , a fussy little side-wheeler , rounded a bend opposite a stone fort guarding the entrance to Cienfuegos Bay and commenced to cast off her tows which immediately commenced to make canvas in obvious hope of catching the offshore breeze now blowing with increasing strength . With it the land wind brought odors of flowers , fruits and sun-baked earth . The tug whistled shrilly , dipped her red and yellow ensign in salute , then squattered back up the channel and out of sight . Sam could see spy glasses at work on the newcomers now standing smartly out to sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer awaiting a pilot and some familiar vessels getting under way . The Sumter 's company watched the sails of the three strangers fill ; saw them heel over one after another and stand offshore . Some time passed before a battered and ill-painted pilot boat came bumping alongside to discharge a mulatto pilot whose lean , hatchet face had been horribly marked by smallpox . He came clambering across the rail in a faded seersucker uniform and on rope-soled sandals . That the Spanish flag had deceived him quite completely became evident by his address to Commander Semmes in voluble Spanish . Sam Seymour 's expert knowledge of that language  --  all thanks to Mrs. Mallory 's patience  --  was called upon . " But  --  but ? " he sputtered , " how can those be your enemies ? You are all Americanos del Norte . " " No . We are Confederados Americanos . " " Confederados ! " The pilot displayed yellow broken teeth in a wide grin . " Valgame Dios ! That is good . Too much have we suffered from  | the rapacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get up steam and I , Armando Gutierrez , will guide you in pursuit . " " Remind this gentleman , " Semmes directed in high good humor , " that Her Gracious Majesty the Queen of Spain owns these shores . Only when yonder merchantmen have sailed a good marine league offshore will we give chase . " To remain quiescent , while these three Union ships went scudding off under snowy clouds of sail in the wake of the Sumter 's earlier victims , proved a distinct strain . Sam Seymour , as First Prize Master , wondered why Commander Semmes had not ordered him into one of the more valuable ships , until Chapman explained that his services were being reserved until the Sumter should capture a prize valuable enough to risk sending into a Confederate port . A shrill twitter from the boatswain 's pipe was the signal which released the topmen from sweltering confinement below decks and transformed that lazy curl of smoke rising from the Sumter 's funnel into a sable whirlwind . In diplomatic leisureliness the Spanish flag came down , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hound slipped of his leash , the Sumter went racing in pursuit . One after another , the unsuspecting merchantmen were overhauled and proved to be the bark Westwind of Rhode Island , the brigantine Naiad of New York and the bark Louisa Kilham from the Bay State . To the surprise of none of the cruiser 's afterguard these merchantmen also were found to be transporting neutral cargoes duly certified to Spanish and British owners . The ships , themselves , however , promised a rich haul in the prize courts . The garrison of the little fort commanding Cienfuegos Narrows shortly was treated to an most unusual sight . Por Dios ! Seven Americano ships , all of which had passed outward bound within forty-eight hours , were returning ! Following these closely steamed a low , rakish man-of-war , flying a completely unfamiliar flag ! Que pasa ? Sorely perplexed the teniente on duty found courage to rout el Senor Comandante from his hammock . " Ten thousand devils ! How dare you interrupt my siesta ? " roared the Commandant . " You disgrace of your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senor Comandante , this warship flies a flag never before  | beheld by any of us . She may be a pirata chasing the Yanqui ships . Six of them have just sailed by , ships we all recognize . " El Senor Comandante vented a purple oath but remained wakeful enough to shake out his sandals before donning them . Still yawning and blue-jowled , Major Don Ernesto de Jimenez y Sanchez pulled on . i wrinkled blue and white striped uniform , buckled on a huge sword , then sought the parapet of his castillo . Plowing up the narrow channel to Cienfuegos Bay was steaming a low , black-hulled barkentine characterized by raked-back masts and swift lines . The fact that her guns were run out , and of large calibre , persuaded el Comandante to countermand his original order to fire a shot across the bow of this sinister stranger . " Two of you misbegotten dogs fire your muskets in warning , but take care not to strike yonder vapor , else I 'll make your filthy backs into razor strops . " Once the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelicans , the strange vessel 's propeller slowed to a stop and thrice she dipped her unfamiliar ensign in salute . " Nombre de puta ! What is this but a corruption of the Yanqui flag ? " The worthy Major rubbed plump brown hands in satisfaction at having caused this uncomfortably powerful man-of-war to halt . Now she let go her starboard anchor and commenced to swing to it proudly , gracefully . In the stern of the captain 's gig Sam Seymour wearing his best gold and gray uniform experienced a thrill of pride at the expert way its crew tossed oars and rounded smoothly up alongside a small stone jetty . Commander Semmes cleared his throat and brushed an imagined speck from his triple-gold-ringed cuff . " Mr. Seymour , I need not warn you to be most considered in what you say . This moment is historic , for undoubtedly we are the first Confederate naval officers to land on foreign shores . " In the castillo 's guard room Commander Semmes and his lieutenant-interpreter were invited to wait briefly because Don Ernesto , having viewed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only politic to improve upon his appearance . He strode in and attempted to appear impressive but succeeded only in being pompous . Sam saluted briskly and performed intro- ductions . Undoubtedly His Excellency had learned of a war being fought between the Federales and the Confederados ? The Commandant nodded . " This vessel , then , is a Confederate ship-of-war ? " " Your Excellency 's astuteness is as apparent as it is to be admired , " murmured Seymour . Don Ernesto 's sweaty brown countenance relaxed . Would the so distinguished Capitan Semmes deign to drink the wine of friend-ship ? " Friendship ? Ha ! It 's as I thought , " smiled Semmes , once Sam had translated . " We 'll accept , Seymour , but please convey to this gentleman that we can linger but a short while . " While Sam was translating the first part , but not the last , of his captain 's message , Semmes glanced uneasily out of the glassless , barred window and was relieved at the sight of his seven prizes standing obediently up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semmes directed , when a black servant padded in bearing glasses and a decanter of Malaga , " please inform our host that I desire to drink the first glass in honor of his most illustrious Queen , and , " he added quickly , " see if he ca n't be induced to fire a national salute to our flag ? Such a gesture would constitute a most valuable precedent . " He spoke urgently for , thus far , no foreign Power had so honored the Stars and Bars . In a courtly gesture Captain Semmes elevated his glass . " Mr. Jefferson Davis , our President , " said he pointedly , " I am sure would wish me to drink long life and happiness for your most gracious Queen . " A similar response thus was deftly invited but Don Ernesto was not to be beguiled . Commander Semmes ' toast , he acknowledged by a bland , " To our honored guests in Cuban waters . " Sam could read disappointment and humiliation on Semmes ' powerfully chiseled and weather-beaten features , as he said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you had best not broach the matter of a salute but request this gentleman 's permission immediately to proceed to Cienfuegos . " The Comandante 's rotund , saddle-hued face brightened at once . " Your Honor may proceed at your pleasure . In Cienfuegos you are certain to receive warm welcome . "  | " Then the Confederacy is popular with the Cuban authorities ? " Seymour hazarded . ' Hie Cuban spread apologetic hands . " Alas , that we know so little Of your new nation , Senores , but los Americanos del Norte for generalions have displayed a lack of courtesy only exceeded by their deplorable greed . " After an exchange of florid compliments the Southerners departed and , presently , the audacious little Sumter dipped her colors in salute to the mildewed red and gold-yellow ensign hanging limp to a flagstaff above the ancient gray castillo and started slowly up the channel . XIX DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIONS CIENFUEGOS BAY , SO named by certain early Spanish adventurers because of the hundred fires they had observed burning along its shores , affords a magnificent landlocked anchorage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a rule its wide waters are clear , placid and the color of strong tea , and upon it innumerable flights of pelicans , murres , ducks , gulls and other seaf owl , preen themselves and fish for food . News of the inexplicably prompt return to port of no less than seven Yanqui merchantmen accompanied by a foreign ship-of-war caused a disorderly flotilla of yachts , piraguas , fishing canoes and humboats to come tumbling out of Cienfuegos harbor . Because the victors lacked enough Confederate flags to raise above their prizes , several prize masters either displayed no colors at all or ordered the Union flag reversed and flown to half mast . White topsails billowing gently , the prizes bore down on the city in the wake of that lean , black barkentine , much like obedient ducklings following their mother , until they dropped anchor along the harbor 's outer perimeter . Yellow quarantine flags flying on the new arrivals brought the port  | doctor pulling out to confer with Dr. Galt , the ship 's surgeon , on the subject of granting pratique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to witness a scene bordering on the quixotic . During the last four days Captain Snow had appeared so utterly glum and despondent that without exception the Sumter 's officers had become touched by the New Englander 's distress . Snow had already lost one ship , so his mate had reported in an aside , through no fault of his own . Now that the Golden Rocket had gone down in flames he faced ruin  --  no one would employ so unlucky a skipper , no matter how able he might be . Roly-poly Bob Chapman and good-natured John Kell were the first to suggest that a purse be made up for the unfortunate captain . Every member of the cruiser 's afterguard contributed , and right liberally for the most part . " God bless you all , gentlemen , " quavered Captain Snow , redrimmed blue eyes bright with tears . " I 'll never forget this . " Indeed he did not ; by way of gratitude he gave to the New York newspapers next month a lurid account of insult and maltreatment at the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her anchors , Commander Semmes repaired below to pen a letter ostensibly for the attention of the Governor of the Port , but actually designed to win favorable consideration from the Captain-General of Cuba . Selecting each word with infinite care the Sumter 's master pointed out , and emphasized , the legality of his position , especially that all of . his prizes had been captured well out of Spanish jurisdiction . Semmes wrote : Confederate States Steamer Sumter Island of Cuba July 6 , 1861 To His Excellency the Governor : I have the honor , sir , to inform Your Excellency of my arrival in the port of Cienfuegos , with seven prizes of war . The barkentines Cuba , Machias , Ben Dunning , Albert Adams and Naiad , the barks Westwind and Louisa Kilham , property of the citizens of the United States , which States as Your Excellency is aware , are waging an aggressive and unjust war upon the Confederate States , which I have the honor , with this ship under my command , to represent .  | I have sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Spain will extend , to the cruisers of the Confederate States , the same friendly reception that in similar circumstances she would extend to the cruisers of the enemy ; in other words , that you permit me to leave the captured vessels within your jurisdiction until they can be adjudicated by a Court of Admiralty of the Confederate States . As a people maintaining a government de facto , and not only holding the enemy in check but gaining advantages over him , we are entitled to all the rights of belligerents and I confidently rely upon the friendly disposition of Spain . . . . It is well known to Your Excellency that the United States are a manufacturing and commercial people . The consequences of this dissimilarity of our pursuits was that , at the breaking out of a war , the former had within their limits and control almost all the naval forces of the old Government . This naval force they had dishonestly seized , turned against the Confederate States regardless of a just claim of the latter to a large portion of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was created . . . . Supposing there would be no dispute about the title to the cargoes , how are they to be unladen and delivered to the neutral claimant unless the captive ship can make a port ? Indeed one of the motives which influenced me in making a Spanish port was the fact that the bulk of these cargoes are claimed to be Spanish property . Raphael Semmes smiled a little grimly as he drove his Spencerian pen further . It will be for Your Excellency to consider and act upon these grave questions touching the like interests of both our Governments . I have the honor to be Your Excellency 's most humble , obedient servant , RAPHAEL SEMnMEs , Commander , Confederate States Navy Making precise gestures , Semmes affixed a smear of new wax and used as a seal one of his new Confederate naval buttons . This depicted a full-rigged ship at sea , surrounded by a circlet of eleven stars within a circle of rope ; all in all a very pretty design . To his orderly , Semmes said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don his best uniform and prepare to carry this letter ashore within twenty minutes . "  | Semmes sighed , mopped his high and narrow forehead . Never robust , he felt strangely fatigued , nay , on the verge of exhaustion . Now that the ship lay motionless the heat was growing oppressive , for all that her crew had rigged a variety of wind sails . Head in hands , he slumped forward until Chief Engineer Freeman appeared . " Sir , may I remind you that our coal bunkers are all but empty , and we 've but the forty-eight hours permitted a belligerent in port ? " " Thank you , Mr. Freeman , you will have received an ample supply before our time limit expires . I intend to act legally to the minute . It is of first importance that our Confederacy shall become favorably known among our sister nations . " Public curiosity reached such a pitch that soon the Sumter became completely ringed in by boats and canoes bearing cheerfully noisy and colorfully clad natives , black , brown and white . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Frenchman and a Hollander  --  telescopes and binoculars could be noticed in use . Wearing his best gray uniform brave with a double row of glittering buttons , gold-trimmed shoulder straps and a broad , dark blue sash beneath his sword belt , Lieutenant Seymour made his way on deck . There the brilliant afternoon sunshine drew flashes from the single golden stars adorning his shoulder straps , from the rings and diamond-shaped loop decorating his cuffs . His brown hair he had permitted to grow longer than he ever had during service in the Old Navy  --  perhaps in deference to their commander 's example , he and most of his fellow officers were affecting regular manes . He wore his cap tilted just a trifle to one side , its ornament showing a chaplet of fat-looking laurel leaves surrounding a fouled anchor placed slantwise beneath the single star of his grade . Waiting below the ladder bobbed Commander Semmes ' own gig , flying a small Stars and Bars . Somehow a boat 's crew had been got together in the uniform prescribed by the captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; thus far no official garb for Confederate seamen had been announced . " Viva los Confederados ! " Shrill cheers arose when Lieutenant Seymour , stiff and serious , stepped into the gig . From a broad-beamed English brig , anchored hard by , came deep shouts of " Hurrah for  | Jeff Davis ! Go it , you Rebels ! Teach ' e bloody Yanks a sharp lesson . We 're for ye . Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " Hopefully , the Sumter 's officers kept an eye upon a flagstaff rising above the Governor 's Palace situated upon a rise above the red and yellow tile roofs of this disorderly little port . Would the water battery fire a salute ? Alas , nothing occurred to disturb those great black buzzards soaring patiently , gracefully , above Cienfuegos , but others , perched on warehouse roofs whitened by their droppings , craned hideous , scabby necks in suspicion of the unwonted activity on the Royal Government 's moss-grown stone pier . Several squads of infantry wearing uniforms of stained bedticking formed up upon the landing stage but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command when the gig 's crew tossed oars , made fast and discharged two officers onto the broad and well-worn watersteps . The Spanish noncommissioned officer , at a sharp glance from the larger of the two strangers , finally did draw himself up and managed to execute a lackadaisical salute . At the land end of the official jetty , however , a large group of white-clad individuals was seen to be waiting . " Sure wish I could speak this parrot talk , " piped little Midshipman Thomas , sent to accompany Lieutenant Seymour . " It 's just as well you do n't , " grinned Sam . " It would only get you into trouble . " The midshipman sniffed . " Good God ! What a four-cornered stink ! Do all Spanish towns smell like this ? " " When it does n't rain . " Sam squared shoulders and assumed an impassive expression at the approach of a tall individual distinguished by a very red face and enormous bags lurking beneath yellowish brown eyes . " Sir , " the stranger began , lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I am Walter Harris , a merchant of this town and honored , indeed , to welcome ashore officers of a brave nation fighting so valiantly against long odds . " At the genuineness of the Englishman 's welcome Seymour 's heart lifted . A Monsieur Moiroux then presented himself and declared himself no less charmed to welcome the officers and men of a Confederate warship .  | " You 'll both come for a dish of tea at our club ? " Harris urged presently . Seymour deliberated , chiefly because various well-dressed Cubans could be seen hovering in the background . Were invitations to be forthcoming from these dark-faced gentlemen and well-bejeweled persons , it stood to reason that these should have preference in matters social . " I regret , Mr. Harris , that Mr. Thomas and I can make no commitments until I have presented Commander Semmes ' respects to His Excellency the Governor . I would appreciate it , however , if you would show us a route to the Palace . " The Englishman turned to a tall , very thin individual who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be delighted , my dear fellow . This is Don Frederico Isnaga , a leading shipping agent of Cienfuegos . " Don Frederico declared himself immeasurably flattered , extended a long , pale brown hand , then turned to indicate an enormously fat Cuban wearing rat-tail mustaches and golden spectacles the lenses of which must have been a quarter-inch thick . " My cousin and partner , Don Mariano Dias . " " We will deem it an honor , Don Frederico and I , " the latter declared in mellifluous Spanish , " to extend to the officers of your noble vessel guest privileges at el Circulo Deportivo  --  our Sports Club , during your stay in port . " He bowed profoundly , at the same time sweeping off his panama and placing it over his heart . " We are eager to make welcome the valiant sailors of your glorious new republic . " " You 'll find better food at the Anglo-Cuban Club , " murmured Harris and then displayed insight by adding , " Come when you can , but by all means accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I quite understand your position . Shall we move on ? The crowd is increasing . " To Mr. Harris , Seymour again mentioned the matter of Commander Semmes ' communication , at the same time confessing a dilemma of which he had just become aware . Should he deliver the missive in person ? Suppose that Governor Roxas refused to receive it ? To receive a rebuff at this delicate moment would certainly seriously harm the Sumter 's and the Confederacy 's prestige . Harris was one of those Englishmen who , instead of tanning , always  | burns and peels . He cast a quick glance at Midshipman Thomas . " Why not dispatch this young gentleman to the Governor 's Palace ? " Ile looked Seymour in the eye a long instant . " I feel confident His Excellency will receive your Captain 's communication with all speed . " And so it came about that Mr. Midshipman Thomas , very straight and solemn in gray uniform and conscious of his brass-mounted dirk , went driving off in Mr. Harris ' own volante with Commander Semmes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came as a cheering revelation that the Southern Cause appeared to be wildly popular not only in Cuba , but in all the Spanish domains . Moreover , the French , Dutch and South American merchants of the town seemed to stop at nothing to demonstrate their affection for the Confederate States . Throughout the entire afternoon Seymour met with only one unpleasant incident . At the Circulo Deportivo , a large group of members , inescapably Americans , drew themselves up when the Confederate entered and with one exception , ostentatiously turned their backs . A lanky , black-bearded individual , whose white linens could have been more spotless , remained where he was , slowly fanning himself with a palm leaf . As the Confederate passed by , this lanky member stared as if wishing to memorize the least details of his appearance . Undiluted malice shone in the fellow 's steel-gray eyes . " And who might that be ? " Seymour inquired . " Jabez Sheppard , a former countryman of yours and United States Consul in Cienfuegos , " Harris chuckled . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing up the bay with all those prizes . You people should touch a pretty sum in prize money . He led the way to a wide window affording a magnificent view over the harbor lying glassily green beyond the white walls and red roofs of the town . At this distance the trim little Sumter suggested one of those wonderfully exact models made by Napoleonic prisoners in England . Clustered about her lay the Louisa Kilham , Naiad , Ben Dunning , Albert Adams , Westwind and Machias still flying their flags union downwards , or showing Confederate colors . In the street below arose the familiar shriek of ungreased axles preluding the appearance of a huge , two-wheeled cane cart drawn by three spans of great , wide-horned white oxen .  | " And now , Senores , " that soul of hospitality Don Mariano exclaimed , " let us drink champagne to the gallant Sumter and her officers ! May she bring many more prizes back to Cienfuegos ! " This was the first of plentiful toasts and just plain drinks . By the time the sun had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gold-sprinkled twilight , Seymour was clinging to sobriety thanks only to determination and previous experiences in foreign ports . Another sobering factor was that , thus far , no reply had been dispatched from the Governor 's Palace , although Mr. Midshipman Thomas had reported having duly delivered the all-important document to the Governor 's own secretary . " Glory day , Mr. Seymour , " that young Texan grinned . " Reckon the Confederacy 's mighty popular in these parts . Two of the prettiest gals Ah ever have seen kissed me on the way up heah . How long we stayin ' in port , suh ? " " Not longer than forty-eight hours , according to international law , " Seymour laughed . " You 'll have to work fast . Later , from below the veranda , sounded the lively music of guitars , violins and maracas , curiously shaped dried gourds , which , swung in intricate rhythms , made pleasing swishing noises because of the seeds within them . By ten o'clock Sam Seymour felt definitely apprehensive at a continued silence from the gubernatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plethora of chilled wines and rare liqueurs pressed upon him by almost the entire membership of el Circulo Deportivo . He was about to fear the worst when a squad of cavalry in white uniforms clattered to the club 's front door . A lieutenant , evidently an aide to the Governor , by his smart blue uniform , jingled spurs right up to the Confederate officer and saluted briskly . " El Teniente Seymour ? " " I am he . " Sam 's heart commenced to hammer wildly . " And at your service , Senor . " " His Excellency sends greetings , but regrets that he can make no reply to your Captain at present . He awaits the pleasure of instructions from His Illustrious Excellency , the Captain-General at Habana . Once they arrive you will immediately be informed . " From the aide 's manner and expression , Seymour was able to de- duce absolutely nothing concerning the Governor 's sympathies or Intentions . the Englishman , Harris , drew him aside . " Do n't feel downcast , old chap . That his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication to Havana is a step in the right direction . Meanwhile , I suggest that it will advance your chances of success to remain ashore and show your uniform . Besides , certain practical considerations con cerning possible condemnation proceedings need to be discussed with Don Frederico , Don Mariano and myself . " " Practical considerations ? " " I feel confident , my dear fellow , that Commander Semmes soon will find himself in need of reliable prize agents . " A few moments later Midshipman Thomas clicked his heels , regretfully said good night and departed for the official jetty with the understanding that , should the captain require Mr. Seymour 's immediate return , he need only order a green lantern to the foretop . XX AFFAIR IN A SIDE STREET SUNLIGHT SLANTING THROUGH green jalousies sketched across a yellow wall beyond Sam Seymour 's bed a vivid pattern of alternating black and red-gold bars . It required several minutes for him to recall where he found himself . He drew a deep breath , looked out through a snowy mosquito bar and found wonderfully pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard the Sumter certainly must have been designed to accommodate some half-grown midshipman ! Because his temples were throbbing like tom-toms , he grunted when , engulfed in one of Don Frederico 's massive and lace-trimmed nightgowns , he reached for his heavy German-silver watch . Gradually his head cleared until he recalled how , cheering loudly , dark-faced club members had unhitched horses to draw him in triumph to the handsome residence of Don Frederico Isnaga . His  | host , Sam estimated , must be extremely well off , for towering palmas reales shaded the lovely patio of this big , two-storied house . When he got up he glimpsed flower beds glowing with an infinite variety of blooms . The bedroom floor and furniture moreover , all were of rich , wine-red San Domingo mahogany and , through the glass-less but elaborately barred windows , the last of the sea breeze stirred curtains of yellow Sevillian damask . He hoped Commander Semmes would approve of the prize agents he 'd selected : Messers Harris , Isnaga and Dias ; also of the arrangements arrived at . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccurate estimates of sharp-dealing Yankee sea captains . If only it were possible immediately to convey homewards news that the Southern Cause was so wildly popular in these latitudes ! Lacking shaving water , Sam rang a bell and was horrified when the mestizo valet who appeared not only insisted upon shaving him but also on assisting him into his uniform . Breakfast was served at six o'clock but already Cienfuegos ' narrow streets were thronged ; Don Frederico had mentioned that many inhabitants of the interior were traveling considerable distances to view this strange man-of-war and her bevy of prizes . While awaiting the arrival of his host , Sam sat listening to the musical dripping of an olla and essaying further to clear his head through gulping deep breaths of this cool and faintly scented morning air . Don Frederico Isnaga apparently possessed no family beyond a very aged and nearly toothless wife ; at least there were no younger persons in evidence at an almuerzo served in the serene green patio where caged birds trilled and warbled . As he recalled , Louise Cottier kept some very similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her companions she would be devoting long hours to picking lint and rolling bandages at the Ladies Benevolent Society . On arrival at Mr. Harris ' office he found that beet-complexioned Englishman deeply perturbed . Offering some papers , he said , " Here are copies of certain telegrams dispatched to Havana by your friend Mr. Sheppard . " Seymour scanned them , a frown deepening on his features . Mr. Sheppard , it appeared , had urged his superior , the American ConsulGeneral at Havana , to demand of His Illustrious Excellency , the  | Captain-General of Cuba , the immediate arrest and imprisonment of the Sumter 's company on charges of piracy . Failing such action , Sheppard advised that every effort be exerted to purchase all coal available in Cienfuegos . Further , the fleetest screw sloops in the Union Navy should immediately be dispatched to hound down this gray wolf of the sea . " Of course , " Harris reminded him , " what our Yankee friend does n't know , and would give a mint to learn , is the Sumter 's intended course from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came by these ? " Seymour asked , returning the telegrams . Harris smiled , averted yellowish brown eyes . " You may ; and I 'll simply reply that we British in foreign parts find peculiar ways and means . The main point remains : thus far Mr. Sheppard has not been able to damage the Sumter or her purposes . " However " ? the raw features loomed suddenly closer and Harris ' voice dropped to a whisper ? " Sheppard 's a damn resourceful fellow , determined and , I suspect , patriotic to the point of discounting scruples  --  so watch out ! " On one score the United States Consul definitely had been thwarted , for shortly after sunup a pair of coal barges lumbered out to the Sumter as she lay with yards braced man-o ' - war style and the Stars and Bars curling gracefully from her mizzen gaff . Despite the cruiser 's desperate shortage of coal , Commander Semmes had not deemed it expedient either to order his fires drawn , or to grant any of his crew shore leave . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decision arrive ? Throughout the siesta hour of the cruiser 's second day in port Seymour fretted about Don Frederico 's office . Long since he had written letters home : to Irad and Duchesne in the hope that the latter might pass on certain data to his lovely cousin and to his friend Brunton . The little Scot certainly must be eager to learn how well the Sumter 's engines had performed . When he had done writing nothing remained save to watch lively little green and brown lizards dart about the ceiling gorging themselves on a plentiful supply of flies and mosquitoes . By five o'clock the Sumter lay fully coaled and provisioned but still lacking a reply from the Captain-General . Commander Semmes , openly apprehensive of
