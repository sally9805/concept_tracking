Are world 's fairs obsolescent ? The universe has shrunk since the first universal exposition , in 1851 , drew approximately 6,000,000 spectators to London 's glittering Crystal Palace . Men and ideas traveled slowly in those days , and seeing was believing . In our age of cheap and rapid travel , of radio , film and television , what is the point of mounting yet another global kermess where Man can gaze at the accomplishments of Man ? The people now preparing the Brussels Universal and International Exposition of 1958 have no illusions on this score . Their fair , they know , may well be the last of its kind . So much more reason , they will tell you , to make it an unparalleled success  --  a giant firecracker whose brilliant flash wo n't he forgotten for a long , long time .

Still , esen as the star performers of this show , we 'll be on our mettle like the rest of them . Our national pavilion . as it happens , is just across the way from the pavilion of the Soviet Union , Already . as he picks his way across the muddy grounds , the visitor is irresistibly attracted by the two looming risal structures which will , undoubtedly , become the fair 's prime objects of curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permitted ; to have your order books around would be obscene . True expositions , as distinguished from commercial fairs , are ruled by solemn international agreement . A charter signed in I92K by the governments of thirty-five nations  --  including Russia , but not the United States  --  lays down the ground rules . According to these rules , a " universal exposition " should be a stock-taking of our civilization . This ever-changing world , arrested in one quivering moment , should hold still for inspection , as it %sere. before proceeding on its headlong course . Hence , Belgium 's aim to make the Brussels fair " a balance sheet in the creation of a more human world . " There is much gossip here of transcendental matters : and nice , round words , like " humanism , " " progress " and " the pursuit of happiness . " 1 ; 11 the moist Belgian air . Unfortunately , Belgium has picked the atom for a mascot .

Raising itself to a height of 360 feet . this monstrous Christmas tree will represent the structure of a simple metal crystal , with nine enormous spheres acting as atoms , Escalators will move up and down inside the hollow branches , and there will be a restaurant in the top atom . Brussels seems a good place to stage this kind of competition . It certainly is nut for nothing that this us the fifth international exposition to be held here in seven decades  --  the last took place in 1935 . A crossroads in the flow of goods and people , the Belgian capital sits in the hub of a highly deseloped , thickly settled region . Within a 200-mile radius lie the coal mines and the cotton mills of Northern France , the busy factories of Western Germany , the crowded shores of England . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders , the inviting Belgians have no intention of suppressing their own commercial instincts for the duration of the fair . As for ourselves , we are going into Brussels , 1958 , with the diffidence of a party whose case is not yet proved . Most of the 200,000 visitors expected to throng our building on a busy day are likely 10 he total strangers whose mental image of America and our way of life . at best , is sketchy . They hase known us first as liberators , then as the generous dispensers of dollar aid and finally as wide-eyed tourists . They have also seen our movies , hey have read about McCarthy . about Little Rock , they have heard about " American materialism. " and they are wondering where fancy ends and truth begins . 76 1 ' 11 g SATURDAY EVEN IA ( : 1.4-1 5T Here , then , for the lirsa lime ; anti : World War II , is our chance to pot OW-whits across  --  lo tear down a whole web of misconceptions and show what we believe to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no simple , one-way prop:Is:arida lob ; the opposition plies its trade across the street . and most of our customers will be comparison shoppers . " We base divorced our thinking from a frontal conflict 0 , ith the Russians , " one of our planners said . All we want , frankly , is the best pas ilion and the most beautifully dcsigned eahibit . " But to begin at the beginning . Whcn our State Department . in the fall of 1954 , received the Belgian ins ' Litton , it did not look at Brussels  --  more than three sears off  --  as a matter of immediate concern . Handing the project , as a sideline. to one of its offieials , it let things ride . It was not until July 31 , I 95n , that Congress was in a position to sole empowering legislation . And in October of that year Howard S. Cullman was sworn in as our commissioner general . He seemed the right man for the job . A rich tobacco merchant who , for many years , had headed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cullman was probably best known as a successful Broadway angel . Among the 150 plays and musicals he had sponsored were hits like Life with Father , South Pacific . The King and I. and Teahouse of the Aueust Moon . His flair for show man-ship was bound to prose an asset . and his financial independence allowed him to turn down the S25,000-a-year remuneration pros ided for the job . But ( here were only eighteen months to go when he stepped in . Most other nations had their feet well on the ground by then , and some . like Germano had done a year 's constructive planning . To make things worse , Congress was in an economy mood . While holding out hope for eventual approval of the 515,000,000 Cullman and his small . hand-picked team considered necessary , the legislators were unwilling to put more than 512.345,000 into the enterprise . That . er en now , is all there is. and Cullman 's inability to lay his hands on more has caused some painful cuts , particularly in the entertainment program . Still , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no apologies . Like other major nations , we were assigned a six-and-a-half-acre site . It is roughly triangular , rising toward the rear to form a natural amphitheater . Leaving the narrow forward portion of the triangle free  --  part of it will be taken up by a reflecting pool  --  we are constructing in the rear a massive , circular pavilion . Though no less " modern " than most of the other national pavilions , the structure is far from extreme ; its restful and harmonious lines give it an almost classic air . The worst that can be said of it is that , with its flat , overhanging lid , and its Great Seal of the United States over the door , it looks like an American officer 's cap . its architect . Edward D. Stone  --  identified with such Manhattan landmarks as Radio City Music Hall and the Museum of Modern An  --  likes to make people shudder by picturing the kind of thing he could have built if he had wanted to appear audacious . " Terrific . is n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clambers all over the enormous steeland-plastic pile . No open-span round structure of this size has ever been attempted ; the floor , 340 feet across , would hold a couple of football fields . But the pavilion 's most conspicuous feature is the " bicycle-wheel " roof ; made of 2100 translucent plastic panels air-lifted an eight planeloads from New Hampshire , it is sus pended from the rim by thin steel cables  --  a system borrowed front Rome 's oval Colosseum , whose canvas top used to be strung in just this manner . A ii opening in the roof lets in sunshine and rain . And the illusion of the great outdoors is further heightened by a pool to the center of the floor , and elescn fine old willow trees is Inch our builders have been careful to preserve . The outer skin of the pavilion is a transparent mesh , lighted from the inside , the heats drum is ill be transformed into an airy apparition . There is little doubt that thc $5,000,000 edifice itself will be our No , I exhibit at the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A British Sunday paper has forewarned its readers that " the American pavilion will have the biggest dome in the world , housing a whole forest and a huge floating platform " and costing about 542,000,000 ! However , this is but a shell to hold our national presentation , and while admitting that it is stunning , one might well ask . " But is it functional ? " As almost all the impedimenta of our civilization are rectangular , a round pavilion may not be ideally suited for the display of this civilization  --  as anybody who has ever tried to fit rectangular furniture into round spaces will appreciate . But then , this is a Government project . Our designing team was hired when u was too late to change the structure and . being stubborn individualists , they went ahead and squared the circle , constructing a rectangular world within the drum , and leas ing foreign visitors with an impressive insight into our wonderfully democratic way of doing things . The actual producers of the show  --  Peter G. Hamden Associates , a private firm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cullman 's team had solicited opinions on what our exhibit should he like from thirty prominent Americans . A conference held under the auspices of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had further crystallized the issue . What almost everyone insisted on was modesty , " No bragging ! " was the keynote . We should present ourselves as a " dynamic , " " restless " people . saddled with problems just like everybody else , groping for the right answers and " committed to a constant search for an improved way of life . " The theme of our show would be the " continuous American revolution . " To translate this philosophy into 120,000 square feet of three-dimensional exhibits was no small order . The end result , as visitors will see it at the fair , 15 , in the main , the work of two creative mindsindustrial-design consultant James S. Plaut , our deputy commissioner general ; and andatect Bernard Rudoisky , associated with the Hamden workshop as top designer for the project . While it is impossible to say at this stage whether their presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is certain to create enough attention to make the exercise worth while . The general mood of the exhibit will be one of tranquillity  --  a welcome calm designed to give the visitor relief from the aggressiveness of the fair as a whole ; to grant him , after loud and garish miles , a respite , There will be a minimum of graphs , statistics , obtrusive photo murals and heroic slogans . Nor will we show off our wealth  --  no bronze , chrome , plate glass or rich marble . If we seduce , we shall seduce by understatement . " The visitor , " the working script predicts , " will recall the United States Pavilion as an experience rather than an exhibition . " Although 100 college students from back home will serve as guides during the fair , there is no prescribed itinerary . You arc on your own , and you may start and finish where you like . Here then  --  with the proviso that some items are still tentative  --  is your sneak preview of our main exhibits . Suneying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedlock between tradition and avow-garde . Side by side with such down-to-earth displays as twin exhibits on atomic energy and automation  --  the only hints of our industrial might  --  you will encounter abstract works of art and some engaging bits of whimsey ' . A surrealistic spread of objects , displayed under a giant ceiling map of the United States , delineates the " Face of America . " Among the wrinkles there will be a bale of tumbleweed from the Southwest , a California gold nugget , " Hollywoodiana , " cowboy accouterments , a row of rural mailboxes , American Indian artifacts . the model of a side-wheeler , a copy of the Declaration of Independence . an Idaho potato mounted like a jewel . strange butterflies and u live rattlesnake . " They 'll taste the continent in a few samples , " Rudnfsky says . " We will present the unexpected , the things the movies do n't show . Some of these objects will be seen for the first time in Europe . " Wherever possible , we shall imply rather than shout our message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complete with ticker tape and a Big Board , will get across the public ownership of our corporations . An electronic scale model of Philadelphia , with buildings that turn turtle and drop out of sight to be replaced by a new city , will document American urbanism . Voting machines  --  placed in our pavilion on President Eisenhower 's personal request  --  will illustrate thc everyday mechanics of our democracy . And a pictorial show of the opening up of the American West will remind Europeans that we , too , have a past . But it is on the balcony that the originality of the designers comes into its own , The stylized prototypes of some American houses  --  a Texas ranch , a Southern cabin , a New England cottage  --  lead up to " islands " showing , each in its own way , a facet of our domestic life . None of these units  --  an American kitchen , a sun deck , a living room , a children 's playpen , and so forth  --  will try to be the " real thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environment created by and for Americans . Appealing to the viewer 's sense of beauty and imagination , these items may he brilliantly successful or fall completely flat . At any rate , no one can say that they are " exhibition cliches . " The one display most apt to make Americans feel suddenly at home and give the stranger an authentic feet of our daily life is a characteristic street  --  a " Strectscapc " ? complete with signposts , manholes , traffic lines , street lamps , a billboard , show windows and a functioning corner drugstore  --  where Europeans may have their first soda at the fountain . So far , so good . The bombshell will be hidden in the leafy grounds where a small building will enshrine bits of Unfinished Business . Here , in a haunting black and white , we shall present such unsolved problems as Slum Clearance , the Dust Bowl , Civil Rights and Race Relations , along with progress made toward their ultimate solution . This , obviously , is the sector of the show most likely to blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves may not sec eye to eye on all the answers . But , the designers ask , is there a better way of making friends than taking all the skeletons out of their closets and airing them for international inspection ? Arad , quite conceivably , they 'll win their point . America will thus sink in . Whatever one may think of individual items , the freshness of the whole approach , the intellectual titillation provided by the show in its entirety , will keep the thing on a remarkably high level . And the sophisticated European audience is likely to appreciate the total absence of the direct sell . What else ? Short films , playing on scattered screens , and the first movie-inthe-round shown outside the United States will add a visual touch of American life and scenery . Several teams of pretty girls will model American fashions . A restaurant will try to serve American corned-beef hash and apple pie . And , in a spacious theater , adorned in simple white and gold , a program of American Plays-musicals , ballets and concerts  --  somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renown . Although the total impact of our Brussels effort ca n't be assessed until the gates are open , the contrast between our formula of calculated modesty and the big ( Continued on Page 78 ) Soviet noise grounds . The French , as if they did not hire enough problems at home . have had hard luck at Brussels . Having first run into burst sewers underneath their site , which made it difficult to sink foundations , they found that the design their architects came up with was so advanced that the building could not be constructed . fishy when the original idea of pivoting the entire roof upon a single strut was compromised by the addition of Iwo new supports would the pavilion stand up-a hcasy blow to every Frenchman 's lose of abstract logic . All of these handsome structures , the agreement says , must be razed when the fair is over , at the exhibitors ' expense , Sonic European countries , with this sad end in mind . use prefabricated materials for their buildings , and have foreseen their re-erection at home-the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall in Moscow . We , living all the way across the water , are less fortunate . Not only will our beautiful pavilion transform itself into a lumbering white elephant the day the show is over . but , having to depend largely on local labor and materials . we base to pay a Belgian tax on some of the transactions involved-an ugly 5430,000 surprise to our planners . Although the matter has led to some pointed questions in the United States Senate . where the tax was referred to as a " holdup , " there is little hope for Belgian leniency , What everyone would like to know , at this point , is whether Belgium will relax its rule against serving liquor , other than beer , in public places . Without a sampling of French and Italian wines , a dash of vodka . Scotch or rye , many a visitor , it IS feared , may drop dead from exhaustion prematurely . But w hat about the Belgians as exhibitors ? Reserving for themselves the spacious grounds of the annual Brussels trade fair-the foreign zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly one half of the 500-acre exposition grounds . There , at their ease . they will display their own civilization , with emphasis on its material and commercial aspects . However . the world 's hosts do not intend to play dog-in-them:over . In giving their own manufacturers J chance to show their wares , they arc walling to grant foreign firms asylum on their sovereign grounds , and half a dozen large American concerns , unable to exhibit in the United States pavilion , will have pavilions of their own across the line . The lofty purpose of the exposition , of course , prevents the sale of goods displayed . More of a blown-up country fair than a sophisticated exercise in self-portrayal , the Belgian show will have something for everyone , The sector given over to the country 's famous diamond industry , for example . is almost certain to rank with the main attractions of the fair . There will be the inevitable midway , to be sure , and a gay and capricious folklore land , taking you back to the year 1900 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the displays of Belgium 's African domain , especially the Belgian Congo . But it appears there will be no attempt-as in France 's Algerian exhibit-to refute charges of colonialism . By now , this country of 9,000.000 inhabitants is heavily committed lo the exposition . Although the transformation of traffic-locked and cluttered Brussels into a modern capital had long been on the books , the fair has turned the longterm project into a S-100,000,000 crash program . There seems to be no street here . at this writing , that is not being widened or at least torn up . New overpasses , underpasses , throughways arc gradually emerging from the chaos . The city 's shopkeepers anticipate fat profits , w Me the more sensitive look forward to the fair as one looks forward to an earthquake , and talk of going on a nice , long trip . The one question to which the Belgians , so far , have given little thought is where to billet the invading army . Hotel space in this city of 1.300,000 is woefully inadequate . and visitors may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nearby ports or use the Brussels-Paris helicopter service for commuting . Will it be worth the trouble ? It is one thing to talk about a rattlesnake. and quite another thing to hear it rattle . To judge a fair , you want the noise , the smells , the fireworks and , above all , the crowds . This much is sure : the Brussels Exposition , a peaceful contest among fifty nations , will give the jaded traveler a new sense of affinity with a bewildered , striving , basically inoffensive species : Man . As such , the first world 's fair since World War II will warrant the enormous effort made to give it diversity and punch . And , if it does turn out to be the last , it will at least be worthy of its famous predecessors .
