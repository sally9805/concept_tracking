The Dark at the Top of the Stairs ( by William Inge ) takes the author , and the audience , back to the small-town world of his 1920s childhood . In a rambling old house it portrays a middle-class family ; there is a slightly crude , life-speckled traveling salesman ( Pat Hingle ) who loves but forever collides with his gently exasperating wife ( Teresa Wright ) . There is their unconfident , boy-frightened teen-age daughter ; there is their small son , who can be hard and soft in the wrong places . Everybody , including the wife 's sister ( Eileen Heckart ) and her dentist husband , is so outwardly recognizable , so comfortably life-sized and so frequently good for a laugh that , regardless of bank balances or growing pains or matrimonial bumps , things somehow look rather cozy . <P> But Playwright Inge has taken no simple sentimental journey ; he has not so much traveled as tunneled back to the ' 20s . Despite the sister 's gabby gossiping , the kids ' shenanigans , the marital jawings and set-tos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party , there are bogeys at the stairhead and phantoms outside the window . There are everywhere fears , self-doubts , deep-hidden voids ; something gnaws at the chatterbox sister , drills against the dentist 's heart , suddenly blows up in an adolescent Jew . <P> With apt and expressive detail , Inge has set his scene and animated it . Helped by extremely good acting , Director Elia Kazan has given the play a full-bodied , full-businessed stage life . A moment is tense , a scene is touching , the author obviously cares , the general effect is thoroughly his own . Yet the general effect has a somewhat ploppy , India-rubberlike impact . Playwright Inge 's most definitive quality-his feeling for human lostness-becomes a little too insistent . It does not emerge from the characters ; it tends , instead , to shape them . In the circumstances , the play 's very title becomes too overt . <P> Yet all this does not so much precipitate a mood as prescribe a method . One by one , each character is led up to the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair shirt . And each character 's inner wound , however honestly representative , is dramatically a little commonplace . There is no enveloping mood to the play because there is recurrent parlor comedy and domestic vaudeville-things that instead of deepening the serious scenes emphasize them too much by contrast . Deeper chords never sound . The dark is there , truly enough ; but it is much less terrifying , and even much less dark , from being so studiously spotlighted . <P> " I never start writing with any ' theme ' in mind , " says Playwright Inge ( rhymes with hinge ) . " I find my themes only as the characters and the situation develop . " <P> As he poked into the lives of " characters that are dimly autobiographical , " Inge came upon the theme of " fear , the personal fear with which each man lives in a world that does not want to recognize fear .
