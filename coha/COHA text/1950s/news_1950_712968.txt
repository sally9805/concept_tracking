txt By the year 1952 , it is estimated by certain persons who deal with these problems , the Soviet Union will have the economic potential to wage a short war of Lhe conventional type with great initial ground and air power . By 1960 , it is believed , Moscow will have the economic potential to wage a protracted war on a large scale . By then it is possible the Soviet Union may aiso have a more rounded fleet and be in a position to launch , as well as defend itself against , amphibious operations . But in the interim  --  probably referring to the next two to ten years  --  the experts do not appear to fear that the Kremlin wishes to or intends to commence an aggressive war . A military " incident , " as in Indo-China , may be developed  --  but limited . Of all the persons with whom this correspondent has discussed this topic , Gen. Douglas is perhaps as well qualified as any man to analyze the problems , speaking not only as Supreme Commander of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Chief of Staff . He told me : " The basic reason I have for concluding that there will not be a war soon is because of the changed nature of war . The scientists of the world have developed to such an extraordinary degree the processes and ways of accomplishing mass killing that war is no longer rationally a means of settling in ' ternational problems . Its destructiveness has become so great that there can be no winner . Both sides lose . It is almost a form of muItual suicide . " The opinion of the masses of the world is against it . That is a relatively recent development , and it is true of all the masses in all countries of the world . During the last 150 years , if you look back , you find , that international wars were invariably preceded by a period b durinc , which one or the other side  --  and sometimes both sides ? became prepared and believed that if they were successful in war they would triumph thereby . " They looked upon war as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides were relatively prepared not only in the sense of military force but in a psychological sense . Public opinion approved ; and that was of great importance . " At the present time that is not the case . The public realizes all too well in terms of the last war that there can be no real victor in a future war . Therefore on neither side is there psychological preparation . The Russian masses are probably just as opposed to a shooting war as the Anglo-Saxon masses . Therefore , many incidents have taken place during the last few years which , in the past , would have led to war but which have been passed over . " I do n't believe that war is imminent because the people of the world neither desire it nor would they be willing to permit it . That goes for both sides . That is the basic reason for my belief that war is not upon the doorstep . Defense for Emergency " We know that we do not intend to start an aggressive war . We have no such thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of a tragic emergency . It is quite possible that the Russians are preparing in exactly the same way . Russian propaganda indicates their belief that we are preparing an aggressive action . " I think it is foolish to assume that the Russians wish to start an aggressive war now . The Russian is doing so well under the present no-shooting war that he would probably and logically wish to continue the existing successful system . It is a rare thing , in sports or in anything else , when a man changes a winning combination . " If one accepts this conclusion ? and it is difficult for a layman to muster sufficient facts to debate the point effectively  --  it is advisable to examine Soviet policy in terms of its long-range aspirations and seek to apply the analysis to the prevailing conditions of the " cold war , " Without such a sequential step , it is difficult to found the bases of United States policy or counter-policy upon reality . It is a truism that the Russians are extremely patient and plan in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like to " get things done " tomorrow . We know that we can run fast but we do not yet perhaps adjust this ability in comparison with the Russians ' ability to walk  --  for long distances . Not So Much of a Mystery Russian policy , in its over-all sense , is not perhaps as much a mystery as we sometimes permit ourselves to think . On May 18 , 1945 , this correspondent wrote in a dispatch from London ( and if this correspondent had such information , it was available to many people ) : " Some astute observers regard the great half-moon stretch of Asia starting at the Turkish Straits and running across Iran , India , Tibet , Sinkiang , Mongolia and Manchuria to the Khabarovsk and Maritime Provinces of the Soviet Union as perhaps the primary zone with which the Kremlin 's foreign policy is concerned . " There are vast population blocs in Asia to which Soviet influence , contrary to portions of Europe , would introduce a higher standard of living . * * * Since 1943 , the traditional Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries old . * * * There are many who think that basically Soviet foreign policy regards Europe as a back door , if an exceedingly important one , and Asia as a front door . It would seem from the facts that this back door would be slammed in a security sense along a line roughly from Trieste to Stettin. * * * The Soviet Ipolicy in Asia seems to be based on Soviet policy in Europe : probing the pressure area for weak spots . " An analysis of Russian ( rather than Soviet ) history demonstrates that both Czar and commissar have had similar territorial aspirations if differing acquisitive techniques . Furthermore , a strong maritime power ( in past years Britain ) was the only effective force in thwarting their complete realization . The Russians traditionally sought outlets on the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean in the South and to gain control in the East of the fringes of China . Reviewing these attempts briefly , one finds : TO THE SOUTH In 1800 Russia obtained the Caucasus passes . In 1829 Britain prevented Russian expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort . In 1840 Britain stymied Russian efforts to establish a protectorate over Turkey . In 1855 Britain formed a coalition and fought the Crimean War against Russia . In 1877 a British fleet entered the Dardenelles when the Russians were seven miles from Constantinople and saved that city . Where the British fleet was not able to operate , Russian advances continued . In 1868 the Russians took Bokhara . In 1874 they captured Khiva . In 1884 they entered Merv . In 1893 they reached the Pamir Plateau and extended a military railway to within seventy-six miles of Herat . The British then checked the eastward and southward progression by establishing a flank diversion through negotiation of a treaty with Japan . TO THE EAST In 1860 Russia obtained the right bank of the Amur River and the Maritime Provinces east of the Ussuri River . In 1884 Russia received port facilities in Korea . Britain countered with an anchorage off the southern Korean coast . In 1896 Russia obtained the right to extend the Trans-Siberian Railway across north Manchuria and a lease to Port Arthur . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russian effort to gain construction rights on the Peiping-Hankow railway . In 1900 Russia occupied a large part of Manchuria . In 1902 Britain signed an alliance with Japan to block Russian expansion . In 1907 , only after Russia had been weakened by a Japanese defeat , did Britain alter her policy and negotiate an accord with St. Petersburg . The United States has inherited Britain 's role as the great sea power ( now abetted by air power ) . This is plainly seen all over Asia , from Turkey  --  with her participation in the Truman Doctrine  --  to Japan , which the United States is fundamentally trying to employ in a role parallel to that manipulated by Britain in the nineteenth century . In fact , the British have generally extricated themselves from physical contact with Russia in the historic area of conflict and are building up a new imperial base in Africa while the United States has inherited the " protecting " position . Having noted Russian tendencies and accomplishments , it is easier to comprehend what Moscow is now attempting to do . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the Soviet Union in Asia since V-J Day has been made without war . Nor do many experts appear to believe war is imminent . In these circumstances , it is necessary to analyze how the Kremlin has managed to accelerate its expansionist progress  --  along purely traditional lines  --  before deciding where this advance must be checked , from the viewpoint of United States national interest , and how .
