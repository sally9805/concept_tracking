On the grey , early morning of June 2 , a truck was found smashed and burning in a ravine at El Nmero , on the coastal highway south of Ciudad Trujillo . Twisted in the gasoline-soaked wreckage were the bodies of six people . The wreck was listed as an accident by the Dominican government , and no details concerning an investigation were ever released . <P> Missing after the " accident " was the truck 's owner , Porfirio Ramirez , commission merchant and member of a prominent Dominican family . Although the wreck and Ramirez ' disappearance caused a stir in the Dominican Republic , the outside world heard little about it until last week , when a committee of Dominican exiles delivered a petition to the United Nations office at Lake Success . The petition charged that Ramirez and his companions were murdered , asked the U.N . to investigate the case as a violation of human rights . <P> The exiles ' complaint was based chiefly on the story of a 21-year-old passenger who survived the wreck , escaped and talked with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . The youth declared that Ramirez ' truck had been stopped by Dominican soldiers at a road junction south of Ciudad Trujillo , on the night of June 1 . When Ramirez jumped out , he was attacked with clubs , the witness said , but grabbed one away from a soldier and knocked down three men before he was riddled with bullets . Then soldiers took the seven passengers to El Numero . There they were beaten to a pulp , drenched with gasoline , thrown in the truck and dumped in the ravine . <P> Porfirio Ramirez , inactive in politics himself , was the brother of Caribbean Legion General Miguel Angel Ramirez , onetime Dominican diplomat and leader of two abortive expeditions to invade the Dominican Republic . Last spring , after Dominican Dictator Rafael Trujillo 's knuckles were rapped by the Organization of American States in a report on Caribbean plotting ( TIME , March 27 ) , the dictator invited all exiles to come home . Ramirez refused , and the exile committee said that Trujillo took his revenge on Porfirio Ramirez . <P> El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened at El Nmero . That in itself was odd . He once told an intimate : " Whenever anything happens here that I do n't know about , or whenever anyone takes it upon himself to act without my authority , my days are numbered .
