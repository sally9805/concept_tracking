The Election &; After <P> Sir : <P> Was n't it amazing how the pollsters , observers and interpreters thought exactly like the marvelous mechanical brain ? A rather pertinent reminder that juggling statistics is not necessarily logical reasoning . Just feed the same statistics , trends and facts into any number of minds and all will rearrange them into the same pattern , and though there may not be a single real thought or reasonable observation in the lot , the pattern is accepted as profound logic . . . <P> <P> MRS .

BROCKWAY Bakersfield , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The election would seem to prove that the majority of voters prefer a wartime economy ( with their sons driving tanks instead of trucks or plows ) and higher taxes rather than an era of peace which has brought greatly reduced taxes , the abolishment of war , and has added 10 million citizens to the Social Security rolls . What the Eisenhower Administration has accomplished is a marvel of efficiency . . . Are we to see the plans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another Democratic regime in 1956 ? And to another war , as we have had in every Democratic Administration in this century ? Only in that way can we have their kind of " fulltime employment . " <P> <P> MAUDE G. PALMER Springfield , Ill . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Last year Mr. Adlai Stevenson said : " He who throws mud usually loses ground . " . . . In the last month of recent campaigning , Mr. Stevenson seemed to throw a good deal of mud towards the opposition . As a result , perhaps he will not have as secure a toehold as he might like to in 1956 . <P> <P> DAVID FENTRESS OTT Providence , R.I. <P> <P> Sir : <P> " Republicans can argue that Democratic gains were held down to a point well below the normal off-year loss of the party in power " TIME , Nov. 15 . This Democrat hopes that the Republicans enjoy such " victories " every year . . . <P> <P> ALLEN KLEIN <P> Mount Vernon , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater margin in the Senate than he or anyone else found reasonable as the night wore on , his basic forecast that the Democrats would control both Houses of Congress stood up . UNIVAC stuck to his guns on this , while newspaper editions and human analysts switched back and forth with every new return . . . We learn something each time , and hope that by 1956 UNIVAC 's performance will be even more accurate . <P> <P> CHARLES COLLINGWOOD <P> CBS Television New York City <P> The Crytic 's Tale <P> Sir : <P> Forsooth , if I never read another , that film review of The Black Knight by your Camelot correspondent TIME , Nov. 8 is the finest piece of nonsense I have ever laid eyes on .
