I Lead a Goofy Life One morning a while back when I was hard at work trying to earn my weekly pay check , I looked up from my desk and there was Harry S. Truman with his nose pressed against the windowpane , staring at me . I 'll tell you right now that it 's not easy to do your best work when a former President of the United States is looking over your shoulder , but it made me pause for a minute to think about the kind of life I lead , Just for example : when almost everybody else is in bed and happily asleep , I have to get up about four A.M. and go to the office  --  full of pep and enthusiasm , naturally . I work only about nineteen hours a week on the air , but most of that time is spent in a show window on a busy street in the middle of New York City , talking to a large hunk of steel and glass that is known as a television camera and is no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have to spend something like three hours getting ready . There are twenty clocks on the walls of my office , all of them showing different time . I have a chimpanzee for an office mate , and Miss America of 1955 ? that 's Lee Metiwether ? for an assistant . Frequently , when I 'm working , a dozen small children dressed in the newest fashions ride bicycles and fire trucks through my office . I meet a number of beautiful girls almost every day , it 's true , but what 's the point of meeting beautiful girls at seven o'clock in the morning ! Anyway , there arc always 4,000,000 persons watching and listening . And hundreds more standing on the sidewalk , staring through the big window , occasionally holding up signs on which they 've written wisecracks , and frequently , I suspect , making critical comments about the necktie I 'm wearing . It 's a crazy life ? and I love it ! The reason for my unorthodox regime , of course , is the National Broadcasting Company 's television production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five mornings a week from seven until ten o'clock on a staggered schedule that , according to the statisticians , attracts about 7,000,000 viewers in all . The show runs for only two hours in any given area , but , to add to the confusion , I have to be on the air for three hours , due to the time differential between New York and Chicago and points west . My statisticians also tell me that my three hours a day , plus my other regular shows , make me the busiest man in television ? a claim that I sometimes feel must be an understatement . Up to January of 1956 , I had been on television for a total of 12760 hours in six years and bad long since ceased to be surprised by anything that happens between the hours of seven and ten on weekdays . Just one show , for instance , brought into my studio a dozen kids in bizarre costumes , a bearded press agent with an ostrich , a former Russian prime minister , a kiwi bird ( stuffed ) borne by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower 's Cabinet , Yogi Berra , and the world 's greatest French-horn player  --  to say nothing of me and my chimpanzee companion , J. Fred Muggs . Or take the time that Mr. Truman was out for his usual early-morning walk during a visit to New York , accompanied by comedian George jessel . Mr. Truman saw the crowd outside our window in Exhibition Hall on 49th Street and paused to see what was going on inside . One of our crew spotted him and turned a camera on him , which prompted the former President to move on to the next window , where the camera followed him as he stopped for another look . By that time one of the boys had stepped out to the street and asked him to come into the studio , but Mr. occasion . Trumanet jcssel act as his spokesman on this c " He ca n't , " the actor explained . " He 's too 1 , msrk.y , and , anyway , I work for another net-%o Although Mr. Truman did n't stick around , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the big Today window every morntog  --  come rain , snow or sleet . For a while , one of them was a young girl from Kansas City named Norma Chaderton . She had come to the big city on her own and had a job , but her mother back home was inclined to worry about her . So , every morning Norma stopped in front of our window on her way to work , stood there long enough for the camera to pick her up and permit her mother , watching in Kansas City , to see that she was safe and well . Another frequent visitor was a deaf mute , who always said something in sign language to , his wife , who was watching at home . He never would tell us what he said . We have also had some unusual one-appearance guests . There was the time the camera was trained on the crowd and a man suddenly lifted high a sign reading : WATCH HERB SHELDON ON TV RICHT NOW  --  CHANNEL 7 . He was the star of a rival show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today . Still another one-timer was a fellow in a wide-brimmed Texas hat and wearing a badge that made it clear he was attending a convention in the big town . He looked as if he had spent the night painting Broadway red , but there was a big grin on his face as he held up a sign for his wife back home : " Look , honey , no hang-over ! " Anybody watching Today is likely to get the impression that it is all pretty easy . We try to keep things informal . We read the news , report on the weather , new books , sports results , and we chat with distinguished or unusual visitors . We bring in live or filmed special events of current interest . We let J. Fred Muggs play the piano , and we play jokes on each other . One day writer Mary Kelly interrupted one of my commercials by grabbing the sponsor 's products off my desk and throwing them at a couple of assistant directors , who threw them right back at Mary . Fortunately , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of bricks or bottles of perfume . It 's crazy things like that that make our work look easy , but the truth is that almost 100 men and women have to put in many hours of hard work to get each program on the air . In addition to such studio regulars as myself , Lee Meriwether , commentator Frank Blair and commentator Jack Lescoulie , the staff directed by producer Gerald Green includes twenty-three news and feature writers , sixteen engineers , three directors and a score of others . Perhaps a dozen other men and women in all parts of the world give us a helping hand on any one program as we range from New York to Denver to Singapore and back again at a moment 's notice . Although the program seems informal , it really requires intensive and detailed planning in advance by staff members , including eleven news experts who work throughout the night . And , of course , occasionally something goes wrong . There was the morning , for example , when we had a camera crew stationed in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a special-feature picture of the heavy automobile traffic coming into New York City . Len Safir was in charge ? or rather he was supposed to be in charge , but he overslept . When he awakened he had only a few minutes to get to the bridge . Pulling on an overcoat over his pajamas , he ran out to the street and wildly hailed a taxicab . " The George Washington Bridge , " he shouted as he leaped in , " and drive like mad ! " Or something of the sort . The cab driver looked at the pajamas , the unshaven face and the tousled hair and asked , " Which side of the bridge , bud , New York or New Jersey ? " " Let me off in the middle ! " Len screamed . " And hurry ! " The driver pulled on his brake , got out and opened the door . " Not in my cab , you do n't , " he said . " I do n't want no jumpers . Get out !

They were  --  honestly ! ? Miss Exposure Meter , Miss Concrete Life Preserver and Miss Pastafazool . But , as I started to say , my life has n't always been this way . To start at the beginning , 1 and 11,000 chicks were born at Edgewater Farm , near Schenectady , New York , in 1913 , when my father and grandfather  --  they came from Scotland ? were working for General Electric by day and running a poultry farm by night . My mother 's family , English and Welsh , had been here since 1683 . Father was a kind of trouble shooter for General Electric , and later we were moved from town to town so often that l attended twenty-one ( Continued on Page 62 ) The author and his transparent roommate , " Mr. Modern Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; V stliao ruST different public schools , including half a dozen around Boston and others in Philadelphia , Albany , Providence , Pittsburgh and St. Louis , where I finished high school , fell in hive and went to Washington University . The love affair I remember painfully because I did n't get the girl , who preferred a boy with a beautiful , big , blue foreign-make automobile . I think that made me determine subconsciously that one day I would own a similar car , but I 'll get to that later . When I was graduated from the university in 1995 we moved to Watertown , Massachusetts , and I became an assistant laboratory instructor at the Harvard Observatory . Much later this led some radio colwainists to describe me as a former astronomy professor , although my main duties were unlocking the door and pulling back the shutter for the telescope . In the next year or so I became the New England representative of a company making piston rings . Unable to sell a single piston ring , I switched to selling a textbook on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5100 a week . Even then 1 did n't like it and , after tramping the streets of New York City for a few weeks , I decided one night that I 'd look for another job . I was living at a mid-Manhattan Y.M.C.A. , and when I got back there that evening I happened to meet in the lobby the boy from St. Louis who had owned the beautiful , big , blue foreign car and had been my rival in love . He , too , had lost the girl and , at the moment , was looking around for a fourth at bridge . Since I no longer had any reason for jealousy , I became the fourth , and during the evening met a young woman who was in charge of guides at the National Broadcasting Company . She said she had just fired ten guides  --  one of them was discovered conducting tours in his stocking feet  --  and was looking for recruits at S15.75 for a six-day week . I promptly signed up . This was not quite so crazy as it might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new employees to be guides for a few weeks as training for more promising duties . When I went to work , six guides held the degree of master of arts and three were doctors of philosophy . There were , however , still some screwballs around . My firm intention at N.B.C . was to become an announcer . I attended a special class , practiced for hours and often arrived early at work so I could stand in the hall and say " good morning " in a deep , well-modulated voice to Pat Kelly , the chief announcer . He never paid any attention , and in the first examination to fill a job , I ranked twenty-third in a class of twenty-four . Soon afterward , program manager Derby Sproul , of KDKA , in Pittsburgh , hired me for thirty-three dollars a week . In 1938 there was heavy emphasis on special events and stunt broadcasts from odd places and about odd people , and when Sproul found out I had played tournament golf , he promptly hung a thirty-pound portable radio transmitter on my broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later I played in several tournaments and broadcast at the same time , describing my opponent 's play and then handing the microphone to my caddie while I made my own shot . In addition to golf matches , I broadcast from a new bridge being built near Pittsburgh , from the sewers of the city , from a covered wagon pulled by a twenty-mule team through the streets to advertise a movie , from a little naval-training submarine in the Ohio River , from a blimp , from a hunk of steel being lifted by a crane to the top of a 750-foot radio tower and from a hollow-log boat , or pirogue , that tipped over and dumped me and my equipment into the river . Listeners heard my most remarkable bit of ad lib  --  glugl  --  and nothing more . That sort of thing went on at what I considered a grave risk to my neck until one day , safe in my own apartment , I leaned over a basin to wash my hands , and permanently injured my back . So far as 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I felt as if I had been stabbed and lay on the floor for two hours before I could crawl to the telephone . The doctors never found anything wrong , but a year later the same thing happened when I picked up a bowling ball . Now I wear a brace all the time , but it still happens about once a year without explanation . Anyway , it ended my stunt broadcasts . In 1959 1 was transferred to the N.B.C . studios in Chicago , where I later married Adele Dwyer , a girl I had known at Washington University . We have a daughter , Paris , now in the fifth grade . The marriage was n't successful and we were divorced in 1946 . A long chain of events that proved to be the turning point in my radio career began in a crazy way in 1911 , when 1 broadcast the war maneuvers in Louisiana and received a lot of favorable comment . As a result , N.B.C . asked me if I wanted to go to Europe as a war correspondent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying it , so I said nu . The words were hardly out of my mouth before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor , and I was I-A in the draft . I got a commission as ensign in the Navy , went to a communications training school in New England and eventually was handed " rush " orders to join the mine sweeper U. S. S. Devastator at San Francisco . I caught an airplane , but we were delayed by bad weather and I began to fret . At the San Francisco airport 1 took a taxicab to the docks . I could easily imagine the captain angrily pacing the bridge , growling at his executive officer : " Where 's that Garroway ? " Leaping out of my cab , I stopped a sailor and asked for directions to the Devastator . " She 's about the fifth way down , " he answered as I dashed on . I found the fifth way down and there was the handsome , skeletonlike keel of a ship . No fooling , it was the Devastator , and I was stalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a proud day when I finally went aboard a real warship for the first time . I was standing at the rail in the harbor when a battleship passed near by , setting up a series of small waves that rocked our new mine sweeper . For a moment , it was pleasing as I rolled with the ship  --  and then I suffered a horrible sensation . I was seasick ? From then on I became a kind of guinea pig for the Navy 's experiments in prevention of seasickness . I took literally hundreds of pills . None of them worked for me . En route to Honolulu I was unable to get out of my bunk , and in Pearl Harbor the captain put me ashore and told me to stay there . It was in Honolulu that I reached the turning point in radio . The Navy gave me a job , but it left my nights free and I became an after-hours disk jockey  --  a phrase that had n't yet been invented  --  at Station KGU . One night a record I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about that city and what I liked about it and the good times I had had there . Most talk on the radio in those days was formal and usually a little stiff . But I just rambled along , saying whatever came into my mind . I was introspective . I tried to pretend that I was chatting with a friend over a highball late in the evening . And before I had finished , the telephone calls were coming in from a lot of boys who were a long way from their Chicago homes and were n't sure they would ever get hack there . They liked what I had said . So the next night I played some records and talked in the same fashion about San Francisco . Again the telephone calls poured in . So , naturally , I began to get an idea . I had stumbled onto a style that seemed to please a great many people . Maybe I should try to make something of it while I was stranded in Honolulu . Just what I made of it in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later  --  I consciously tried to talk to the listener as an individual , to make each listener feel that he knew me and I knew him . It seemed to work pretty well then and later . I know that strangers often stop me on the street today , call me Dave and seem to feel that we are old friends who know all about each other . After the war , when I got back to Chicago , I continued to develop the idea on a program called the 11:60 Club. talked about almost anything from the home life of the amoeba to bop music to the Federal Reserve System . We did n't know whether the show was getting over until one night when I talked about a party that was being given that evening by Peter Lucas , an N.B.C . announcer . Lucas ' apartment house was soon to be torn down . He had moved out his furniture , except for a record player , and invited his friends to a " wrecking party " at which they could do anything they pleased  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . Talking to the radio audience as " you , " I added , " You come along too . Bring your own liquor and something to drink from . " The program ended at one A.H . and I went directly to Lucas ' apartment  --  well , not directly , because by that time several hundred persons were blocking the street outside . A lot of them , including a man drinking his liquor out of a flowerpot , with his finger over the hole in the bottom , got inside and stayed until nine am . It was all right with me  --  I knew then that the 11:60 Club was a success . It ran for four years , until I left Chicago . Meantime , I started The Dave Garroway Show on weekday afternoons and a half hour on Sunday evening , when we had singers and an orchestra . I was still experimenting , trying to create a mood for listeners . It was all in a very casual manner and , at times , perhaps a little esoteric . I talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing " or " an incandescent woman , " and I addressed the listener as " Old Tiger . " Not everybody appreciated this approach , but , as one radio columnist pointed out , we had " a great many devout admirers . " Some of them , I might add , were a bit too devout . I get many letters saying , " I have the funny feeling that you are talking to me alone . " One letter from a woman said , " I know you were talking to me and I want you to know that I feel the same way about you . I 'll telephone you . " And get a lot of long , very personal letters  --  some of them twenty pages  --  from women who are under the misconception that we are affianced . A surprising number of them say something like this , " You promised faithfully to meet me in Atlantic City last weekend , but you failed to show up . How can you treat me this way ? " Still more difficult are some women listeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up in person . One from a Western state arrived in Chicago , registered at a big hotel as Mrs. Dave Garroway , opened several charge accounts in my name and established a joint bank account in which she deposited a large sum of money . Some months later she took a taxi to my hotel and informed the desk clerk she was moving in . He called a detective agency that we had engaged to check up on her , and they persuaded her to return home . Since then there have been others , but none so persistent . In 19+8 television was forging ahead . Charley Andrews , a writer , Ted Mills , head of production , and I talked over a great many ideas with program manager Jules Herbuveaux and finally decided on a show called Garroway at Large , which was largely an extension of my " low-pressure " radio technique . Director Bill Hobin and our engineers devoted a lot of time to working out new camera techniques , and we hired singers Connie Russell , Betty Chapel and Jack Haskell , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs did n't go on the air until ten or eleven AM , and they closed down eady in the evening . But the big boom was starting and , just as our plans were completed , we got an emergency call from New York asking if we could whip U ? some me kind of a show for a Sunday-evening spot on the network . We said we 'd be happy to lend a helping hand , and bang I we were on the air . The big TV programs in the late 1940 's were nothing more than vaudeville or theater or time movies shifted over to the screen never your been ( Continuedroom . But our group had ev ( Continued on Page 64 ) ( Continued from Page 62 ) in show business , on Broadway or in Hollywood . We had no theatrical experience . We had no rules to guide us . And we had no inhibitions . We were free to look at television as a completely new and different medium , to use our imaginations and to try anything once . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply making the camera be the eyes of the audience . In one scene the camera  --  that 's you , the viewer  --  approached the door of a dentist 's office , saw a sign that the dentist was out to lunch , sat down nervously in the waiting room . The dentist returned and beckoned to the camera , which went in and sat in the big chair . " Open wide , " the dentist said , poking a huge , wicked-looking drill at the camera . There was a roar as the drill was turned on , sparks flew and the camera vibrated and the viewers got a magnified version of sitting in the dentist 's chair  --  except that it did n't hurt . At other times we used a mirror to make it scent that the camera was in the ceiling , shooting downward at u nusual floor patterns created by dancers . Or we held a ribbed glass brick in front of the camera lens and thus got sixty-four reflections of Betty Chapel on the screen . We developed the " match dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded slowly into a shot of me eating back and forth  --  in the same tempo  --  on an ear of corn . Such innovations and a relaxed approach as I meandered around the studio or sat on top of a stepladder attracted a lot of attention as a contrast to the usual big vaudeville-type TV programs . Some radio critics began to identify us as " the Chicago school . " I never was sure just what that meant . But we were able to introduce new ideas especially suited to television , some of which were discarded and some of which have become standard operating procedure . While all this was going on , I had achieved my high-school dream of owning a foreign-make car and , in fact , had helped found the Chicago chapter of the Sports Car Club of America . My car was a I.Ct29 model that I bought for seventy-five dollars and on which I spent 5 ( 600 to get it in shape . By that time I had become an enthusiast and spent much of my spare time getting myself covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ovenq a number , including a Model T Ford , a Lincoln Continental and a Jaguar SSloo , which is a prewar sports car that would do better than 100 tiiik-s an hour . Iworked the Jaguar over , upholstered it in alligator-grain calf leather and entered the ? Vatkins Glen Grand Prix , a I rill-mile race over country roads in New York . I finished sixth among thirty can . Mine was the only racing car that was also entered in a beauty contest , the Concours d'Elt-gance , at that same meet , and it failed to win first prize , according to the judges , only because it was upholstered in imitation alligator . So , of course , I drove home and reupholstered it in genuine alligator and went back the next year . But they must have had different judges . I did n't even get an honorable men-lion . Recently , I 've got rid of all the can except the Jaguar , and I 'm putting a new X.K.14oNIC engine with 9.621 compression in it , so that it ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fenders . Not that I 'll ever drive it that fast , except on the proving grounds . In fact , I have to drive more slowly on the road than if I owned an ordinary sedan because police keep a close watch on sports cars like the Jaguar , which gives the impression of doing twenty milea an hour even when standing still , In the summer of 1961 we arranged for a new sponsor for Garroway at Large on the N.B.C . network , starting in the autumn and , being assured of the next year 's salary , Charley Andrews and I went to Europe for a long vacation . We were taking . it easy in the Swiss Alps when a telegram from New York arrived one morning before Charley was awake . After reading it , I awakened him . " Get up , " I said , " and look at the sunrise over the Alps . You 're missing the most beautiful sight in the world . " He muttered indignantly , but got up and gazed at the wonderful scene . " Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a job . " Charley became wide-awake in a second . I showed him the telegram , which said that for complicated reasons the network time for our show was not available . We took the next plane home . Things were n't so bad as they might have been , as N.B.C . agreed to pay my salary for the scheduled run of the contract  --  about 560,000 in all  --  but I did n't like the idea of doing nothing . It was about that time that I read that N.B.C . executive Pat Weaver was planning a new television program called Today , which would be a mixture of news and entertainment , informative but amusing . He was then looking for a " communicator " to run the show and hold it together ? " Old Tiger , " I muttered to myself , " it 's about time you became a communicator . " It was n't so easy as that , but I did go to New York and I did get the job , with the support of Mort Werner , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were times when I began to wonder whether it was all a big mistake . Today was Weaver 's brain child , and it was a radical departure in television . We went on the air at seven A.M. weekdays in January of 1962 , but at that time nobody ever thought of turning on a television set so early in the morning . We presented the news at regular intervals . Our critics were virtually unanimous that while people would listen to radio news before breakfast , nobody was going to " look " at news at that hour . We worked up special news features , interviews with celebrities and fashion shows . The advertising-agency experts assured us that nobody was going to have time for that kind of stuff before the children were fed and headed for school . Thumbs down ! For the first two-hour program we had just one one-minute commercial . Later , there were days when we did n't have even one . I wo n't bore you with the details of our troubles except to say that the newspaper radio columnists looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were running in the red at the rate of about 81,500,000 a year after being on the air eight months . During that period there was only one favorable development  --  the growing mass of American television viewers liked us . Our mail and our surveys showed that , in spite of the experts , more and more of them were turning on their television ( Condoned 041 Page 661 ( Continued from Page 64 ) sets before breakfast or even before they were out of bed . We had opened up a whole ncw segment of television time and , as they slowly became accustomed to the innovation , the people approved of it . Some of them even began changing the habits of a lifetime in order to watch in the early morning . We began an intensive campaign to capitalize on this audience after Matthew J. Culligan , now sales manager of N.B.C . ' s TV network , took over our advertising problems . Culligan says that I 'm an " honest confidence man " ? by which I think he means I am able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their product . Anyway , I spent a great deal of time explaining to advertisers how we conducted a relaxed , low-pressure , personalized program and how it had proved that most people like to " have a friend around the house " in the morning . In tOaa we began to pick up sponsors , and in 195,1-Today broke all one-year records for any kind of show business or entertainment  --  circuses , motion pictures or whatever  --  with gross revenue of 511,000,000 . Since we started we have done well over 10,000 commercials on the program , which is now carried on ninety-odd stations . One of the things that please me most about Today is that a lot of people will go to some trouble in order to have Garroway as " a friend around the house " for a couple of hours . One man wrote me that he cut a hole in the wall between his kitchen and living room so he could see the television set while eating breakfast . A woman hung a large mirror over her sink and angled it so that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to the next room . Another advanced her hour of rising by thirty minutes so she could have breakfast cooked by seven a.m. , and still another had the legs of her television set lengthened by four inches so she could see the screen over the foot of the bed in which she lay . A man who regularly watches the program reflected in his mirror while shaving wrote in to ask me occasionally to " do something backwards " for his benefit . People seem to get a lot of chuckles out of our program , and SO do we . We even got a laugh out of the time j . Fred Muggs , the chimpanzee , shook hands with Miss America and then , deceitfully , snatched a diamond ring from her finger and plopped it into his mouth . It took two strong men to pry his jaws open . Arid almost everybody enjoyed the day when the staff decided it would be a good gag if I pretended to get my necktie caught in an electric mixer we were demonstrating . So I really got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to have a pair of scissors handy and I almost choked to death before they could get it turned off . There was also the occasion when we were in Florida and needed an alligator as a stage prop . Not a live alligator , but a flexible dead alligator or a reasonable facsimile thereof . We could n't find one in all of Florida . But finally producer Gerry Green thought of telephoning Macy 's department store in New York and borrowing one of the small inflated alligators they use in their annual Thanksgiving Day parade . They shipped it by air express , and assistant producer Lou Ames went out late at night and collected it . On his way back , however , he was held up by two gunmen . " Take my money , " he exclaimed . " Take my car . But please spare that alligator in the back seat . He 's the only flexible dead alligator in Florida I " Unhappily , the holdup men threw Lou out and drove off with the alligator in the car . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of the past . Most of the people we encounter , however , are more co-operative than the Florida gunmen . I recall another time when we left typewritten instructions for the overnight crew concerning preparations for the program , including this notation : " 7:25 A.m. ? Cleveland Armory . " This was a kind of challenge to the man in charge , but he was equal to it . He telephoned our man in Cleveland , explained that a feature from the local armory was scheduled for 7:9.5 A.M. and expressed hope that everything was set . The Cleveland man was ignorant of our plans , but he , also , was equal to the occasion . He got on the telephone and awakened the local official in charge of the armory and persuaded him to get up in the middle of the night and unlock the place . Asa result of a lot or telephoning , the armory was open at the appointed hour at which time it was discovered that a slight typographical error had been made in New York and that the program really called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just published a new book .

" You got a very early show to take care of , boy , and you had n't ought to stay out so late at night . " Like 1 said before , it 's a crazy life and I love it .
