THE AURORAS OF AUTUMN-Wallace Stevens-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> Is a poet trying to tell you something ? Or is he just muttering to himself ? On the muddy banks between the clear running stream of communication and the swamp of self-expression squats a swarm of modern poets , patting mud-pies into shape for the admiration of themselves and their playmates . The much larger crowd of regular guys in the swimming hole jeer at these patty-cakers as sissies , but stand a little in awe of them too , seeing how cleverly they mold their incomprehensible mud images . <P> By definition ( he is a business success , therefore he is normal ) , Wallace Stevens can not comfortably be classified as just a mud-dauber . As a vice president , presumably he can make perfectly good , understandable sense any time he feels like it . When he writes poetry , however-as he has been doing , after hours , for some 45 years-apparently he feels no compulsion to be lucid ; or else he feels that what he wants to say can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . <P> From 8:15 to 4:30 each working day Wallace Stevens sits at a big , uncluttered desk in a comfortable office with a thick russet carpet . As vice president of the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. , he spends his business hours dealing with fidelity and surety claims . Nobody would take 70-year-old Insuranceman Stevens for a poet , let alone the hard-to-read kind . But , after hours , Stevens is just that . <P> His reputation in avant-garde literary circles is just as solid as his reputation in business . His latest bouquet from U.S. poetry pundits was this year 's Bollingen Prize. * Stevens makes no excuses for his double life . " Poetry , " says he , " is my way of making the world palatable . It 's a way of making one 's experience , almost wholly inexplicable , acceptable . " Nor does he make any excuses for his poems ' obscurity : <P> The poem must resist the intelligence Almost successfully . <P> <P> But an alert or sympathetic reader can see , at times , what he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insoluble , kaleidoscopic riddle : " reality " v.

Am I not , <P> Myself , only half of a figure of a sort , A figure half seen , or seen for a moment , a man Of the mind , an apparition apparelled in Apparels of such lightest look that a turn Of my shoulder and quickly , too quickly , I am gone ? <P> The same question might be asked of Stevens ' poems , most of which begin to fade as soon as they are read . But though they resist the memory as well as the intelligence , their delicate , twangy music-as full of surprises as a zither-sometimes delights the ear . Few living poets can be as vivid and as vague , both at once . <P> <P> * His predecessor : Ezra Pound , now ( as then ) a mental patient in St. Elizabeth 's Hospital , Washington , B.C.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
