txt It 's disappointing that all the budget-whacking of recent months resulted only in a smaller rise in Federal spending than there otherwise might have been . It 's alarming that the spending increases arc what they me . For they foreshadow still further rises despite any increased efficiency in the Government machinery itself . Through , careful paring of the budget , a reduction of a little under $2 billion was accomplished , according to the new spending estimate . But unforeseen increases raised spending by nearly $2.2 billion , Result : The Administration 's current estimate of total spending rose to $72 billion from the $71.8 billion originally requested by President Eisenhower . Two big cuts accounted for almost half of the $2 billion reduction . Military aid under the mutual security program was reduced by S500 million , and the soil bank was slashed $490 million . Fairly conscientious whittling all along the line accomplished the remainder . For example , $200 million was chopped from the general contingency fund and $127 million was cut from the Department of Commerce appropriation . But nit these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun years ago , when economy was a nasty word . A close look at the figures behind the $2.2 billion increase tells the painful story . The biggest addition  --  bigger than any of the reductions by far  --  was $738 million for the Commodity Credit Corp . to finance farm price supports . Next came $599 million more than expected for the Post Office , becauserates were not increased . Interest on the debt mounted by $301 million , due to higher market rates for money . Previous contracts for stockpiling required an additional $105 million . The Export-Import Bank required an additional $157 million as Britain drew down on a loan made earlier . Each of these items represents subsidy of sonic sort . A subsidy to farmers , a subsidy to everyone via the Post Office , a subsidy to producers for the stockpile , it subsidy to the British ? of these subsidies are wrapped up in the huge national debt . There is little indication that the three items accounting for the largest spending increases will decline . The situation in which crop surpluses keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar enough one by now . It is difficult to see how the Post Office can keep from spending more unless it curtails services . As for interest on the public debt , the trend in the money market still seems to be upward for interest rates ; and with spending mounting ever higher it is doubtful that the debt on which the interest is paid will go any other way than higher . So what has happened is that all the careful paring of this year has been lost in a tide of unforeseen contingencies arising out of programs both out-of-date and out-of-hancl . Ever really to cut Government spending the people must through their legislators make a major decision . They must decide to call a halt to the senseless business of subsidizing all and sundry .
