Glory in Bridgeville A Story by William Wise Drawings by Charles Geer I T WAS a tall , silver-haired man who drove into town , parked carefully by one of the meters on the main street , and then locked up his car . As he put a nickel into the meter he looked at the two boys in front of the drugstore and saw they were staring at him . Inside the drugstore he sat at the counter and ordered a cream cheese sandwich and a cup of coffee . While he ate , he could see in the mirror hanging over the Silex jars that the crowd on the corner had grown to six or seven , and they were all staring inside . " Would you give me some water ? " he asked the man behind the counter , and when the man did , he took out a tin of Bisodols and swallowed one . " I guess you 're back out here to sign up Billy Slater , " the counterman said . " Somebody told us who you were  --  Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pirates . I must have seen you once in Pittsburgh , the time I was there for my Uncle 's funeral . " " Yes , that 's right , I guess you did . " " Well , we think our Billy 's quite a ball player , " the counterman told him . " Yes sir , around here we certainly do . The town 's gone crazy about it , more excitement than I 've seen since the firehouse burned down ; let 's see , twelve years was it , no , must have been thirteen years ago . Thirteen years , come September . " " Sure , Billy 's quite a ball player , " Shane said . " And I 'll tell you counterman went on . life gets a chance to go up and play in the majors . It 's really something . " " Sure , it 's one in a thousand , " Shane said . " Here , will you let me have some change ? " Once inside the phone booth he placed a long-distance call and reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Hello , Harry , this is Shane . I 'm in a booth out here in Bridgeville . " " Hello , Ted , what 's going on ? You got the boy there signed yet ? " " No . No , I have n't even been out to the house , Harry . I just had a hunch ... I think something might go wrong . " " You think it will ? " " I do n't know , there 's something about the old man I just do n't like . He 's a shifty little devil . I do n't know , I ca n't put my finger on it . " " Well there 's nothing I can do about that , " Harry said . " I know . What I called about was the price . I want to go higher . I saw the kid pitch yesterday . . . and I think Graves made him a better deal . " " Graves was there ? " " Sure . He was there at the game with a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end , which meant that Harry Welkin was thinking about money  --  what else ever kept Harry quiet for as long as that ? " How high do you want to go ? " ' he said at " I think Graves must have gone to forty . We 'd better be ready to go to forty-five ourselves , maybe even fifty . " There was another pause . A longer one . Finally Harry said , " God that 's steep . Now listen , Ted , are you sure the kid 's as good as that ? Is he really worth it ? " " He 's a beauty , " Shane told him . " He 's a real beauty . When he gets a better curve to go with his fast one , he 's going to be something to see . Harry , he 's got control already , yesterday he struck out eighteen and only walked two . That 's what really got me , every pitch around the corners , and the other day ... " " All right , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're paying you for , so what the hell . As long as you say he 's worth it , he 's worth it . Only try to keep it down . Make sure Graves offered forty , otherwise try to close it out for thirty-five . Okay ? " " Okay , " Shane said . " I 'll keep it as low as I can . " " So long , " the other said and hung up . T ED SHANE came out of the drugstore a moment afterward , through the circle of boys on the sidewalk , and drove his car around the block to the house on Willow Street . It was a small frame house where Billy Slater and his mother and his stepfather , Mr. Corwin , lived , the paint a flaking gray , the wooden porch steps beginning to warp and crack , but the curtains inside a brisk white , and the windows themselves shining . Still , he took a moment before leaving his car to go up the steps . This was the unpleasant part , this signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little to smooth a corner and close the sale ; and when you had an ugly pair to handle , when you had to slip in something extra for the old man and the old lady , slip a little into their own pockets to hurry them up . . . tricks of the trade , that 's what you called them . And yet , in the old days , nobody ever used to practice them . In the old clays you stopped at the outskirts of a town like Bridgeville , on a warm afternoon in early summer , exactly where you never knew for sure , you 'd see a boy take his cut at the ball , you 'd watch him turn first and head around the bases , see the way he carried himself along , and right there , without any warning . There was never any publicity with it , nobody else to outbid , and whatever it was you saw , it was something that only you could see . So you talked to the boy a little , found out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket if you liked his way of talking , you gave him a ticket to your nearest . camp ... and two or three years later you had a Pie Traynor or a Jimmy Dykes , and that was what you were paid for . That was all , the only reward you ever really wanted for doing it . . . . Well , now for Billy Slater , he thought at last , and taking out his briefcase , left the car and went up the porch steps to ring the bell . A Livos-r at once Mrs. Corwin came to the door . She was a thin , dark-haired woman with a sallow face , and he had never seen her smile when he had been there before to talk with her husband , nor was she smiling now . " I 'm Mr. Shane , " he said ; " it 's nice to see you again , nice to see you , Mrs. Corwin . " " Yes , I remember , " she said . ' ' Wo n't you please come in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door , noting again the old lamps , the rug With its worn fringes , the picture of Billy Slater in his Sunday suit . . . not in his baseball uniform , that was important to remember . It always made a difference if the boy 's father was a fan , then you went at him one way ; but if the father was against it , then you had to take another . " Is Mr. Corwin in ? " he said , when she came back to the parlor . " Yes , he 's in the kitchen with Billy . I think they 're waiting for you there . " " The graduation went all right ? " " Oh yes . Yes , Billy 's got his diploma now . Here , let me take your hat . " He waited while she hung his hat away , and thought , well , Billy was out of high school now , and now it was legal to talk to him about the facts of life , instead of talking about them alone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next room , pretending he did n't know they were talking about . him . " I 'll take you to the kitchen , " Mrs. Corwin finally said , and he followed her into the back of the house . Both of them were there , sitting around the kitchen table which stood in the center of the room . They both stood up , and he shook hands , first with Mr. Corwin and then with Billy . " Nice to see you again , " he said to the father . " Mr. Shane , please sit down . " Billy had brought him over one of the wooden chairs and he said to the boy , " Well , it 's nice to be able to talk with both of you now . How does it feel to get out of school ? " " It feels pretty good , " Billy said , " it feels pretty good . " He was a blond , square boy , about six feet tall , with a good pair of shoulders and arms that were long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and thought of what those fingers would be doing in a year or two , how they would make a ball jump past your eyes or curl right off beyond the swing of your bat . . . " Would you like some coffee ? " Mrs. Corwin asked him . " No , no thanks . I just had a bite . " " Well I know you 're a busy man , " Mr. Corwin said , " so I guess . . . we 'd better get this settled ... as soon as we can . " He spoke in this hesitant , anxious way , the little thin-faced man across the table . " We do n't want to hold you up . . any more than we have to . " Billy said nothing , and Mrs. Corwin , wordless too , sat at the fourth side of the table and made herself a partner to the conference , a bowl on the table and a bag of fresh peas in her lap . She began to shell them without looking up . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not when it comes to a hoy like yours . After all , that 's my business . " He turned to Billy . " I saw you pitch yesterday , that was some game . " The boy smiled and said , " They were n't much . You should have seen ' em last year when they had some hitters . " " Well , " Shane continued after a moment , " how do things stand now , what do you think of our offer ? You know we want Billy , and you know what we 're willing to go to have him . We think he 's good , and someday we think he 's going to he more than that . I have the contract with me , unless of course . . . . " Something made Shane pause , while he looked over at Billy 's father , something about the nervous little man on the other side of the table told him that their last meeting , their last , unwritten agreement , was not to be the final one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Corwin said . " I know you 've been fair with Billy , Mr. Shane . . . and we want to be fair with you . Now the truth is .. .. " " You 've had another offer , " Shane stepped in . " This morning , Graves made you another offer , is n't that right ? " " Forty thousand dollars , " Mr. Corwin said . " Yes , he offered Billy that much this morn-ing . " Shane looked at Billy 's father  --  and would have sworn that the whole thing was lost there and then . " You did n't sign ? " " Oh no , of course we did n't . I explained to Mr. Graves that we were dealing with you , we liked everything you said , and Billy 's . . . always wanted to play with the team you represent . But I 've told you all that before . Now what I 'd like to say is . . . . " " Look , " Shane interrupted , " you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a better offer , hold off and give us a chance to match it , that 's what I said . Well , I had a hunch that Graves would go to forty , so I called the office , and we 're not only going to match it , we 're going to do better than that , I 'll tell you exactly the best we can do . We 're willing to go to fifty thousand dollars , and that , I think , is a very fair price . " N ow according to what Shane knew , this should have settled the matter on the spot . A boy like Billy usually opened his eyes a little wider , the father smiled a glittering little smile , a mother like Mrs. Corwin suddenly found her feelings too unsettling and began to snuffle and reach for a handkerchief . But not now . Not the three of them around this kitchen table . Mrs. Corwin went on shelling her peas , Billy looked at his father , and Mr. Corwin rubbed and twisted his hands together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine offer , " he said at last . " But what I want to say is . . . I 've been thinking . . . and Billy here . . . . " Shane said , " You 've seen somebody else , is that it ? " " Oh no . " Mr. Corwin shook his head . " Well , what is it then ? " He looked at Mrs. Corwin and then back at her husband . " Is it about Billy , the way he 'll be taken care of ? As I said the other day . . . . " Mr. Corwin shook his head again . " It 's got nothing to do with that . It 's . . . the money , that 's all . " " Well now , " Shane said , " I think we 've been pretty fair all around . I could have told you forty-five , first , but I did n't , I wanted you to see exactly how things stood . " " It 's a very fair offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been talking it over , since you were here the last time .. . and what I mean is .. . . " " Why do n't you let me do the talking ? " Billy said , s IIANE looked around at the boy . He thought a moment , and then he said , " Sure , I wish you would . Tell me what 's on your mind . " " I do n't think it 's much of an offer , " Billy said . " That 's all . " " But listen , " Mr. Corwin told him , " listen , Billy . Fifty thousand 's a lot of money , and Mr. Shane 's being as fair as he can . They 're willing to give you that , just for signing .... " " Sure it 's just for signing , " Billy said . " But maybe I want a little more . And if they wo n't give me what I want , then maybe . there 's someone else who will . " " Well , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think I 'm worth sixty . Anyway sixty . " Shane looked at the boy , and for all the times he 'd watched him on the field , it seemed that he had never caught a picture of him before . He stared at Billy 's flat blue eyes , and then he shook his head . " I ca n't give you that . Fifty 's as high as we can go . " " Okay , then maybe I 'd better talk to someone else . " " But listen , " Mr. Corwin told him , " only listen now . Fifty thousand dollars is a mighty generous offer . That 's an awful lot of money , is n't it , Mr. Shane ? " " Why ask him ? " Billy said . " Do you think he 'd say . it was n't ? " " Yotir father 's right . It is a lot of money . " " My stepfather does n't know everything . He told me thirty-five was pretty good , till someone said forty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corwin said . " I only wish .. . just once . .. you 'd listen to what I 'm saying . " Billy shook his head . " First I want to know how much they 'll really give me . " And then he turned to Shane . " You think I do n't know what it 's all about , do n't you ? Listen , I see the papers , I know how much you gave some of them last year for signing up . I just want what 's coming to me , that 's all . I want every cent . . . . " " But Billy " Mr. Corwin said . The boy did n't look at his father . " Do you think I want to live like this , in a rotten house like this , spend the rest of my life in a little one-tank town where all they got 's a movie and a couple of lousy diners ? Oh no , I know what I want , and I 'm going to get it . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Billy ... you should n't talk . . . . " Shane looked at the boy 's father , and then he looked at Mrs. Corwin ; she was sitting at the end of the table , still shelling her peas , and whatever she was thinking found no expression on her face . " That 's my best offer , " Shane said at last . " Fifty thousand , you can take it or leave it . " " Mr. Graves might go to fifty-five , " Billy said . " He wo n't . You 're not worth it . You 're worth exactly fifty thousand dollars , and not a single penny more , " Shane said . " Youcl better take it , " Mr. Corwin said . " Honest , Billy , you 'd better take it . " Billy clenched his hands and looked at Shane , and then he looked down at the table . " All right , " he said at last . " Where 's the papers ? I guess I 'll sign with you . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts and gave them to Billy , who signed them first , and then lie handed them to Mr. Corwin , who signed them too , as Billy 's legal guardian . When it was over , Shane shook hands with Billy , and then followed his mother and Mr. Corwin out to the porch . " I want to thank you , " Mr. Corwin said . " You 've been very fair ... and his mother and 1 . . . . " " He 'll be all right , " Shane said . " I do n't want you to think . . . Billy was only excited , that 's all . He did n't mean half those things , it 's only the excitement . " " Sure , I know , " Shane said , and shook the other 's hand . But when he turned to Billy 's mother , he was startled to see a new expression on her face . His hand slowly dropped to his side . " I wo n't apologize for Billy , " she said . " Apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Corwin 45 said . " The things he said in there , do you think I like to hear my own son talk like that ? Do you think I like to listen to him talk like a common hoodlum ? " " I 'm sorry , " Shane said . " That does n't make it any better . You 're sorry . After you turn him into something like that , you 're sorry . Where do you think he learned such things ... not in my house , he did n't learn such things from me . " It 's men like you , Mr. Shane , men who come around with all that money , giving it to boys like Billy , bribing them with it , turning their heads . It 's men like you , Mr. Shane . . , " but she could n't go on . " I only do my job , " Shane said . " I 'm paid to get players . . . it is n't my money , Mrs. Corwin . " " We 're all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how it is . . . nothing like this has ever happened to us before . " S HANE nodded , and then , because there was n't any more to say , he left the couple on the porch and drove his car to the end of Willow Street . Then he turned and came back to the drugstore . Once inside , he went to the counter and ordered a cup of coffee . " Have you been around to see Billy ? " the counterman said . " I guess you 've got him all signed up by now . " " Yes , he 's signed , " Shane told him . " Well , he 's really quite a boy , " the counterman went on . " Yes sir , we think our Billy 's quite a boy . " " I guess he is . " " Listen , he 's got the stuff , that 's what I 've always said . And the kids , the kids around here are crazy about him . " " Glad to hear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counterman brought him a glass , Shane took out a Bisodol arid swallowed it . Then he looked at the counterman , and the counterman looked back at hint . " You know , I 've been thinking , Mr. Shane , I 've been thinking ever since you came in here this afternoon . " And he cocked his head and leaned on the counter , with his other hand on his hip . " You must lead a pretty good life , that 's what I 've been thinking . " " How do you figure ? " said Shane . " Well , traveling around the country , finding these kids , giving them a boost like that . When you find them they 're just kids , and a couple of years later they 're big-league ball players . You sort of come along and tap ' em on the shoulder , and the next thing you know they 're famous . I should think that sort of thing would give you a lot of satisfaction . " And the counterman nodded his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Shane told him . " Sometimes it does n't  --  and sometimes it does . " And without mentioning any names , he wiped the taste of coffee from his lips , picked up his hat from the counter , and went outside . He started the coupe and drove away without looking down at the house on Willow Street , and he was out of Bridgeville that afternoon before it was dark .
