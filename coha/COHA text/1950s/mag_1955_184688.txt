When the bosses of the Soviet Union change their tune , their wholly controlled press is never far behind . Even if a foreign-policy change is only smile-deep , Communist newspapers fall in line as fast as they are told where to fall . The new smile on the face of the Russian bear has already started to show through Communist journalism . <P> During the Geneva Conference , Pravda and Izvestia ran pictures of the Big Four , along with factual accounts of what Western leaders had said at the conference , including such strong language as President Eisenhower 's remark that " international Communism . . . seeks ... to subvert lawful governments . " Eisenhower 's proposal for aerial inspection of defense installations , as well as his report to the U.S. people after he returned from Geneva , was printed in full in Russian papers . <P> Although there is still much criticism of the West in Russian newspapers , it has been toned down , e.g. , " certain circles " instead of " Wall Streeters " are engaged in " capitalist warmongering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have taken to lunching and socializing with reporters from the West . <P> Last week the Russians also permitted CBS Radio 's correspondent Bill Worthy to begin broadcasting directly to the U.S. , the first regular short-wave news broadcasts from Moscow since 1947. * From the official Russian news agency , Tass , have come stories about the possibilities of increased cultural and sports exchanges with the West . Tass also has carried glowing accounts of the touring Russian agricultural delegation in the U.S. ( TIME , August 1 ) , but has not published dollars and cents figures on the income and wages of U.S. farmers and farmhands . In an article on the tour , Pravda said : " There is need to further strengthen the friendship , cooperation and mutual understanding in all fields between the two great countries . " Russian papers have also been printing daily stories about the U.S. farm delegation touring Russia . mechanization is far ahead of Russia 's and that U.S. farmers have a higher standard of living than Soviet peasants . <P> But the old , deep frown is visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been granted temporary visas to Moscow in the last two months ( TIME , July 4 ) , at least half a dozen recent requests for visas have not been acted upon . Last week Pravda slipped into its familiar theme song that the " common people " of the West want peace , but their wishes are often frustrated by the " ruling circles . " And London 's Communist Daily Worker made a shocking revelation : " Children on farms in the U.S. customarily work very hard , and some boys and girls of 12 and 13 get up at 4 a.m. to do the milking before going to school . " <P> Obviously the Soviet press could jump back to the old line it has been following for years a split second after the Kremlin snapped the whip . <P>
