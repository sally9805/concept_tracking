txt We 'll agree with Mr. Michael DiSalle that the four factors he says stand in the way of " effective " price control are at least four factors to furrow the brow of a price controller . But the factor that really puts the kibosh on controls is an unmentioned fifth . Mr. DiSalle , feeling a bit sorry for himself on his first anniversary as price controller , listed the major stumbling blocks in his path as : Lack of power to control farm prices , the fact that world prices are higher than domestic prices , the necessity to make price adjuntments caused by " unusual weather , " and certain recent amendments to the law requiring him to make price ceiling adjustments for added costs of production . Whatever one thinks of the efficacy of price controls , it is a bit absurd to think that the government can slit the economy in half , control one-half and leave the other half free , which is what is attempted by exempting farm commodities . Anyone will admit , too , that it 's tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. prices ; what he really needs to be is a global price controller . How can he control the price of a rubber tire in Akron with no control over the rubber farmer in Malaya ? There just is n't any convenient stopping place for power . As for the weather , it is tough to get your plans all made and have them upset by an unexpected rain squall . Maybe Mr. DiSalle , a determined man , will be the first one to stop complaining about the weather and do something about it . A nice , tight , weather control law without any loopholes . We can even sympathize with his complaints about the recent amendments to the Defense Act . However necessary they be , they do cause trouble for the controller . Here again he gets an orderly price control schedule all set ? up , and somebody tinkers with the wage rate somewhere to boost production costs . Then he 's got to readjust the price of , say , steel ; and of course that means a readjustment in the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and pretty soon the poor controller finds he 's got to re-do his whole schedule ; and he no more gets that done than he has to start all over again . With four things like that to plague him , it 's no wonder Mr. DiSalle felt many a morning " I could not go on another day . " When he really runs up against the fifth factor , maybe he wo n't . For while Mr. DiSalle is busily sweating with all these problems , trying to " adjust " the inflation we 've already got , his colleagues in government are just as busily pumping out more inflation . And they can pump many times faster than he can shore his frail . little dike . The . four factors are fretsome ; the fifth , if it ever acts at full speed , can sweep away the whole house that Mike built . We do not know whether inflation will become a tidal wave . But we would feel far more comforted if the men  --  designing the levee could count higher than four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
