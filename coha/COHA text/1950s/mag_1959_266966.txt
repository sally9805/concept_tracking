NUCLEAR TEST DEBATE <P> AFTER long and thoughtful deliberation , the five members of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission last week dissented from President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles on a critical point of U.S. foreign policy . The point : the President 's decision , effective since midnight Oct. 31 , to suspend all U.S. nuclear tests for one year , and to continue suspension if there was a prospect of reaching a workable stop-test agreement with the Russians at Geneva . The AEC 's great concern : test stoppage without foolproof safeguards might undermine the U.S. nuclear power that had kept the world 's peace since 1945 . <P> The AEC 's longstanding doubts about the Eisenhower-Dulles disarmament policy came to a boil last month when a panel of U.S. scientists who had found that detection of nuclear tests was dependable - the scientific underpinning of the Eisenhower-Dulles policy - reversed themselves and admitted that underground blasts even up to Hiroshima size were not detectable ( TIME , Jan. 12 ) . Thus the Russians could presumably cheat on any agreement at will . AEC Chairman John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decided to submit to Secretary Dulles , through proper channels , an interim plan based on the principle that the U.S. should agree to stop only those tests that could be policed , resume those that could not . Key points : Stop atmospheric tests - detectable - which spread fallout and stir up world opinion ; police this stoppage by overflights of Russia and the U.S. Continue experiments with underground shots to see whether a foolproof detection system can be worked out . Meanwhile resume undetectable tests underground - no fallout - of weapons vital to U.S. defense . <P> Majority Rule . The AEC 's dissent punctuated one of the strangest chapters in modern U.S. diplomacy , a chapter that brought important modifications of longstanding U.S. nuclear policy with hardly a word of public debate . It began in 1957-58 , when the Russians whipped up a new storm of propaganda against nuclear tests as a hazard to health and wholesome genetics . The Communists got special plaudits from neutralists in Asia and Africa , from U.S. pacifists and idealists , when the U.S.S.R. announced in March 1958 that it was suspending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry Cabot Lodge warned Secretary Dulles that the U.S. was in danger of losing its majority at the U.N . unless it heeded world fears on the nuclear-test issue .
