Bombs Away The " Mad Bomber " who has been busily planting homemade bombs around New York ( TIME , Jan. 7 ) has given the city 's newspapers one of the best homemade stories in years . No paper has matched the space or the big , black headlines that Hearst 's Journal-American has given the case . But last week , after the Journal received a surprisingly frank letter from the bomber and had the chance to score the most sensational beat on the story to date , Scripps-Howard 's World-Telegram and Sun snatched the story away . <P> When the Journal received the crudely printed letter ( signature : F.P. ) , it decided to withhold the story from police and aim for the jackpot : the bomber 's surrender . Instead of printing the letter , the Journal ran a wily item in its Personals column intimating that it would " help " the bomber if he gave himself up . The ad caught the eye of World-Telegram Managing Editor Richard Starnes , who guessed immediately that the Journal had received a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Page One story on the bomber 's " new letter to a New York newspaper , hinting that he may declare at least a temporary truce . " Three days later , when most other New York papers had printed the story , the Journal-American 's account finally appeared under an eight-column banner . <P> The Mad Bomber 's letter contained more clues to his identity than police had unearthed in years . Among the disclosures : he had spent " most of my adult life in bed " ; two of the bombs he had deposited last year had not yet been found ; he named three former New York <P> State officials who , he said , would " know all . " The Journal gave the bomber 's letter to police , who were able to eliminate hundreds of questioned signatures and narrow the search-as the press noted proudly-down to " 42 suspects who are being followed night and day . " But at week 's end the bomber was still at large-or in bed .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
