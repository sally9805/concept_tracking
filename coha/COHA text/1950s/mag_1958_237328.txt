Faubus Rides Again <P> Sir : <P> What do you think of Arkansas and Governor Faubus now ? Your previous attacks on a man who struggled to make something of himself in the American way were abominable . You even ridiculed his speech ( which I greatly prefer to Brooklynese ) . <P> C. E. WATTS Avenue , Md . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Your Aug. 11 Faubus story is extremely insulting . Violence Southward , try as you will to magnify it , is a mere sniff of the ugly physical revulsion , anarchy and race violence exploding in your own backyard ( Philadelphia , Washington , D.C. , New York City , Detroit , etc . ) . <P> You may be sure the South will not passively submit to a callous scheme to deprive the whites of their civil rights . Massive resistance is the ever-growing answer as evidenced by the Arkansas vote . <P> WILLIAM TEMPLE STEVENS Charlottesville , Va . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The vote for Faubus was a vote against military occupation of a sovereign state . <P> W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great victory at the polls justify him ? Could n't the Devil carry his state by a still larger vote ? <P> W. T. DAVIS Lincoln , Neb . <P> <P> Pause for Paar <P> Sir : <P> I was shocked to see a picture of Jack Paar glaring at me from your Aug. 18 cover . I think his show is repulsive . <P> NANCY ANN ZEBRASKEY arnegie , Pa . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I 'm happy to say that I 'm a dangling Paarticiple . <P> ANN KRAVETZ Walnutport , Pa . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I would like to see him on a competitive 8 p.m. or 9 p.m . TV spot , when the majority of viewers are still awake , aware , and demanding . <P> M. W. ARMSTRONG Wilmington , Del . <P> <P> Sir : <P> An excellent article on the inimitable Mr. Paar . <P> SALLY ANN SAUNDERS San Diego <P> Sir : <P> I have finished reading your Jack Paar story and regard it as the best printed article of 1958 . Of course , you had one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest section-Show Business-has also won my heartiest approval . Keep up the good work . <P> ALEXANDER G. KAPOCIUS Chicago <P> Charley Horse in Defense <P> Sir : <P> I find it inconceivable , bordering on pigheadedness , that ex-Defense Secretary Charles Wilson , when making decisions affecting the national security of the U.S. , " never had much to do with " Tactician and Strategist Lieut . General James Gavin . <P> ERNEST T. POOL Springfield . Va . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Re your Aug. 11 review of Gavin 's War and Peace in the Space Age : seems the " brains " entrusted to America 's defense never listen to the truth . <P> It was that way with Billy Mitchell , Lindbergh and MacArthur . <P> PAUL LYONS The Bronx , N.Y . <P> <P> Union Bosses <P> Sir : <P> Why do we spend billions of dollars fighting Khrushchev &; Co. when the nation will soon be taken over by Hoffa &; Co. ? I do n't know which of the two is worse . They both use the same methods . <P> IVAN TRABAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Cheers for the courageous action of Mrs. Marcella Norman in driving the automobile through the showcase window-the only bright spot in an otherwise troubled world . Mrs. Norman 's only oversight was her failure to run down half a dozen automobile salesmen and perhaps a real estate man or two .
