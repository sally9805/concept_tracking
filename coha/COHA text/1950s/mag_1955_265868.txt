Between world wars , when Douglas Bader was a cocky , teen-age R.A.F. cadet , the planes he flew were as perky as their pilot . Light wood , fabric and singing wire , they could bounce to a landing on some farmer 's field as handily as they touched down on military runways . Flat-hatting across the countryside with his face in the slipstream , a man could navigate by eye and the nearest railroad track and fly by the seat of his pants . <P> Just for the fun of it one bright December morning in 1931 , Pilot Officer Bader decided to buzz the officers ' club at Woodley Aerodrome near Reading , rolled into the turf , and lost both legs as a result of the crash . But after eight difficult years spent learning to move skillfully on a pair of artificial legs , he was back in the R.A.F. as a fighter pilot , and during World War II Squadron Leader Bader personally accounted for 22-German planes . His career became a British legend , faithfully recorded in Paul Brickhill 's biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Today , at 45 , as adviser for flight operations for Shell Petroleum Co. , Ltd. , Group Captain Bader must do some of his traveling in commercial airliners-and for all their comfort , he does not like them . <P> Gay Abandon . Last week Bader was in the midst of a U.S.-Canada inspection tour . While in Ottawa , he met some of his Battle-of-Britain buddies at the Royal Canadian Flying Clubs ' Association . As old flyers will , he got to reminiscing about the old days when aviation was still a sport . <P> What he missed most , said Bader , was " the gay abandon of the prewar days , with a little clubhouse and a field with light airplanes on it , people having tea under sunshades , and all that pleasant peaceful scene . " Flying then was " something exciting and different , and we all wanted to go up in an airplane . It was of course a two-seater , open-cockpit.job . . . Our ardor might have been damped if our first experience of flying was sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 40 other people . . . There is far more exhilaration , fun and impression of speed in the open cockpit of a Tiger Moth doing 80 m.p.h. in and out of the valleys and hills made by cumulus clouds on a summer day . " <P> Buttons Marked Moscow . " It is , I think , essential that the fun of flying be kept alive , and it is only through flying clubs that this can be done . The cheap , light airplane in which the youngster can fly around the field , and when he gets a bit better take his girl friend up too , must remain with us . . . We must keep the airplane for pleasure , for an afternoon 's fun which does not need two or three thousand yards of runway , control towers and controls , and all the paper work that makes life so intolerable these days for the private aviator . Give me a field with a circle in the middle , and let us still enjoy those things which have almost disappeared with the biplane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a human pilot , Bader concluded , there ought to be planes around that are small enough to teach those pilots what it really is to fly . " In the jet age of the future , we may get planes without humans . " Then , said the old fighter pilot sadly , no one will need to fly . " We can all sit in the basement pressing buttons marked Moscow . "
