The personable young prince seemed to have everything in the world that a prince could desire : a beautiful domain , happy subjects , a private zoo , a 200-room palace , a world-famed gambling casino , a 140-ft. yacht , lots of money . If Monaco , his principality , was one of the smallest independent states in the world ( it would fit neatly in the middle of New York 's La Guardia Airport ) , there were other compensations . For example , the prince had plenty of titles ( 16 ) and a Croix de guerre for his wartime service in the French army . Still , something was lacking : the prince had no wife . Last week , in true storybook style , His Serene Highness Prince Rainier III of Monaco , 32 , arrived in the U.S. , looking for his princess . <P> Floating Hair . Of course , the princely quest was strictly unofficial , and on his arrival in New York , Rainier smilingly denied that he was seeking an American bride . Officially , the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Baltimore , but since Prince Rainier is in royally robust health , that was obviously just an excuse to justify the expense account . Before he left Paris last week , the Prince gave reporters an idea of what he had on his mind : " The ideal woman , I see her with long hair floating in the wind , the color of autumn leaves . Her eyes are blue or violet , with flecks of gold . Furthermore , she should be practiced in all sports without being champion in any one . I want her to be intelligent but not an intellectual . I want an ordinary woman who will give me an extraordinary feeling . I want her to give me the feeling that she is mine , only mine . " <P> Nothing could please the Prince 's 5,000 subjects more than to have him find the girl of his dreams-not merely for Rainier 's happiness , but for their own as well . If Prince Rainier dies without issue , Monaco , under the terms of a 1918 treaty with France , will automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Mongasque , for it will inevitably bring French taxes and military conscription to a land of no taxes and no army , except for the picturesque 68-man Palace Guard . Every Mongasque wants to see his Prince safely married , and a princeling or two around the principality . <P> Until Rainier finds his bride , every loyal Mongasque wishes he were not quite so dashing . He is an accomplished yachtsman , horseman and fisherman , and is fond of wrestling with the lion in the royal zoo . He loves to skin dive , once descended 100 ft. off the coast of Corsica . In the 1953 Tour de France , Rainier wrapped his Panhard around a tree , escaped with a cut knee . Whenever he steps into one of his flashy racing cars , all Monaco breathes a prayer for his safety . <P> At the Prince 's side last week was his good friend and royal chaplain , the Very Rev. J. Francis Tucker ( " Father Tuck " ) , 66 , a Delaware-born Roman Catholic priest who went to Monaco five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said recently . That was putting it mildly . Prince Rainier was often in the company of Gisele Pascal , a French actress . A mayor of Monte Carlo had married a former Sister of Charity who had nursed him in the hospital . The clergy were quarreling among themselves . The bishop of Monaco , a Frenchman , did not get along with his Italian priests .
