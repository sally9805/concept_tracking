MY FAMILY AND OTHER ANIMALS ( 273 pp. ) - Gerald Durrell-Viking ( $3.95 ) . <P> THE TOWERS OF TREBIZOND ( 277 pp. ) - Rose Macaulay-Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> When an irresistible force called a tourist meets an immovable object called a country , the result is sometimes a travel book . The tourists who consistently write the best travel books are those literate and indefatigable nomads , the British . Two lively new British travelogues , one thinly disguised as a novel , cover such comparatively avant-garde areas of modern tourism as Turkey and the isles of Greece . <P> Hellion in Paradise . Zoologist Gerald Durrell was ten years old in 1934 when his family settled on the Ionian resort island of Corfu for what proved to be a five-year stay . Fending off a swarm of taxi drivers , the Durrells met their own personal " Zorba the Greek " when a swarthy islander named Spiro shouted to the beleaguered family , " Hoy ! Whys donts you have someones who can talks your own language ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain Anglo-Saxon eccentricities ( " But Madame , what for you want a bathroom ? Have you not got the sea ? " ) . The Durrells were soon ensconced in a strawberry-pink hillside villa ( the first of three ) , and after they began breakfasting under tangerine trees , bathing from crescent-shaped beaches that looked " like fallen moons " and exchanging the beautiful Greek greeting chairete ( be happy ) with their neighbors , the Durrells realized that they had fallen under the spell of the wine-dark sea . <P> Young Gerry , already a budding zoologist , was a bit of a hellion in this demi-paradise , but only because of his avid scientific urge to bring all the island fauna home . There was the day brother Leslie I went upstairs to bathe and found two snakes in the tub , and the day brother Larry started to light a cigarette from a matchboxful of scorpions . Gerry had been studying the scorpions ' mating dance . The rest of the family had their own little idiosyncrasies to which , as his title suggests . Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is at his best in describing the island 's magic which " each day had a tranquillity , a timelessness , about it , so that you wished it would never end . " It is Author Durrell 's special gift to evoke that sense of timelessness through vivid still lifes of nature and the natives : " Across the mouth of the bay a sun-bleached boat would pass , rowed by a brown fisherman in tattered trousers , standing in the stern and twisting an oar in the water like a fish 's tail . He would raise one hand in lazy salute , and across the still , blue water you could hear the plaintive squeak of the oar as it twisted , and the soft clop as it dug into the sea .
