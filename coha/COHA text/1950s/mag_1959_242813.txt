The Boss <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on your excellent , impartial article about Despot Hoffa Aug. 31 . You did it expertly and pointedly . <P> <P> PAUL CANTALUPO Holliston , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Jimmy Hoffa &; Co. ( the racket-infested , predatory hierarchy of the Teamsters ) , the arrogance of Labor Boss James Carey in threatening political retaliation to House members who voted for the Landrum-Griffin bill , and the steelworkers ' ability to push wages up at twice the rate of productivity gains are the most explicit reasons why there is so-called " antiunion " sentiment ( in reality , " antilabor boss " sentiment ) in the nation-in and out of Congress . <P> Unions have done much good for the country , and will be needed in the future ; but when a " nod of the head " can close down entire industries , it is time to enact restraints on big labor similar to those on big business and big government . <P> <P> A. D. FITE Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> You acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his major virtues ? He is a good , thoughtful , considerate , kind , devoted husband and family man , and that is enough to make him a hero in my eyes . The American home could be a firmer foundation for a healthy America if husbands and fathers would follow his example . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) JENNIE BRATLEY Gainesville , Fla . <P> <P> Sir : <P> It seems James Hoffa is interested in the rehabilitation of ex-convicts . If this is so , then I think he is doing a great job . <P> <P> BRUCE KELLY Ellwood City , Pa . <P> <P> Sir : <P> In all the hullabaloo over labor-reform legislation , it appears that someone has been overlooked . I refer to the rank-and-file unionist . Without his support , no union boss could afford the elaborate retinue of thugs , lobbyists , and shysters that Hoffa commands . Yet the union members never question Jimmy 's methods , so long as he gets results . <P> It seems to me that union members should be held individually responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a substantial fine might arouse a keener interest in how the votes are counted and how the money is spent . <P> <P> JOHN P. TAYLOR San Diego <P> The Guest <P> Sir : <P> The Aga Khan kept a chateauful of guests , and one was Tracy Pelissier , but the girl in the Sept. 7 picture is n't . Correct identification : Marina Doria , Swiss international water skiing champion , who was giving His Highness pointers . <P> <P> ISRAEL SHENKER <P> Paris <P> How to Govern <P> Sir :
