In the tiny Bohemian village of Cihost , in the hills southeast of Prague , flax farmers and woodcutters last week were whispering excitedly . They were discussing the new " miracles " and the trouble which had followed them . <P> The first miracle , villagers told reporters , took place on Sunday , Dec. 11 . During his sermon , the village priest , Father Josef Toufar , had said : " He Who is in our tabernacle and Who is among us , He will help us . . . " At that moment , the lindenwood crucifix leaned first to the left , then to the right , and then to the west . Cihost 's pious peasants said the crucifix went through the same motion on Christmas day and on Sunday , Jan. 8 . <P> As the story spread , new versions of the Cihost " miracles " cropped up . A report circulated in Prague was that a local Communist had approached Father Toufar as if to strike him . As the Communist raised his arm , the crucifix began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe . <P> Soon pilgrims began to stream into Cihost . From Prague , the Czech Communist government sent commissions to investigate . Policemen turned the pilgrims away . Father Toufar and his churchwarden were arrested . The Communists closed the church two days later ; villagers are allowed to enter it only for Sunday Mass . <P> The Communist organ Rude Pravo last week indignantly attacked the " reactionary " miracle of Cihost . The Catholic hierarchy and the rich peasants , the paper charged , were spreading false stories to divert the small peasants ' attention from the blessings of cooperative farming .
