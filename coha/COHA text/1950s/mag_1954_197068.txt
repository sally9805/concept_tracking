Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens returned to the Mundt committee 's witness stand this week , slightly windburned from a brief Montana vacation . It was his 14th day of testimony . He was called for only one purpose , carefully specified by Committee Counsel Ray Jenkins : was Stevens responsible for the Administration 's actions in the case of Private G. David Schine ? Or did the responsibility lie higher , perhaps in the White House ? <P> To questioning by Jenkins , Stevens affirmed that Army Counsel John Adams received suggestions , but not orders , from Justice Department and White House officials when he conferred with them . If McCarthy 's charges against the Army are true , Senator John McClellan asked Stevens , " Are you the one who is responsible ? " Said Bob Stevens , " Yes " <P> But this did not satisfy McCarthy , who had charged Stevens with " blackmail , " but now seemed to wish that the accused would assert his innocence by passing the buck up the chain of command . <P> McCarthy asked again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon . Stevens answered again and again that he . Stevens , was responsible . Said he : " Certainly there was consultation and advice , but the responsibility is mine . " <P> McCarthy : Did you order the preparation of the formal charges against McCarthy &; Co . ? <P> Stevens : I think it would be a fair assumption that I did . <P> McCarthy : We ca n't assume things . <P> Stevens : I 'm responsible . <P> McCarthy : Did you order these smear charges prepared , strike the word smear ? Secretary Stevens laughed . <P> McCarthy : This is no laughing matter . <P> I want to find out whether you are telling the truth , and you grin and smirk and laugh . <P> Stevens : I think that 's a bit uncalled for , if I may say so , Senator . <P> A moment later Jenkins was telling Stevens , " It may be that your failure to give a direct answer to a direct question accounts for the fact that you 've been on the stand so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was evading . But this impression arose from McCarthy 's assumption that " orders " were given or taken by Stevens in this case . Stevens and his aides had probably consulted with scores of officials during the development of the Cohn-Schine affair . One made this suggestion , another wrote that sentence . To unscramble all that would be clearly impossible-and irrelevant . An official often tries to dodge responsibility by retreating into the bureaucratic maze . Stevens did the opposite . He took the responsibility and sought no refuge in " orders . " Finally , Stevens succeeded in making this point . <P> " You do n't seem to be able to understand , " he told McCarthy , " that often people have to get together to exchange views , and there is no written order . " What Joe McCarthy understood quite well was that the more high Administration officials he could involve , the longer he could avoid taking the witness stand himself .
