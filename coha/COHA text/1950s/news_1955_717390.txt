txt Ten years ago few people had ever heard of Kuwait and those who had knew it mostly as a dirty little Arab harbor from which little boats set out with divers seeking pearls from the hot Persian gulf waters . Today Kuwait , an independent sheikdom under the protection of Britain , I% known to oil men all over the world . Sits on Treasure It has an area of only 5,800 square miles , situated on the northwestern coast of the Persian gulf , and a total population estimated at only 200,000 . But it is only a matter of AGFIDAD /00 ckti/es ? - ? IRAtl AHWAZ L. 1 BASRA KUWAIT NEUTRAL TERRITORY SAUDI ARABIA . ime until it becomes a household word thruout the United States . Why ? Because the little , sun dried city of Kuwait sits atop the biggest treasure ever discovered by man . The treasure is amounts unequaled. than 200 wells have been sunk but the known deposits are estimated at more than half of those underlying the entire United States . Oil in Neutral Zone Oil in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would quickly enter any war once the fighting began . The Kuwait Oil company , a joint British-United States company , already has de , veloped a rich oil field within the state . The sheik shares equally in the profits . In 1948 , a concession was granted by the sheik to the American Independent 0 i I company to exploit oil in the neutral zone which is shared with Saudi Arabia . Oil men yet realize how important . Kuwait and its Arab neighbors have become to the world . The outlook is staggering . Consider first of all how important oil is to the world . Thirty-five years ago oil and natural gas provided only 15 per cent of the world 's power . As late as 1938 oil and gas were only half as important as coal . But today oil and gas have replaced coal as the basic fuel thruout the world . Since 1945 the world 's consumption of oil has doubled and it is going up 10 per cent a year . Need to Double Despite talk of atomic power , oil demands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly where oil comes from . Until now , the United States has produced more oil than the rest of the world . We think we are therefore richest in oil . For years we were the world 's biggest exporters of oil because we produced more than we used . But now , suddenly , all that has changed . The United States has become the world 's biggest importer of oil and from now on oilmen expect America to become more and more dependent on foreign oil . Our European allies run almost entirely on Arab oil . Source of U. S. Oil Where is America going to get its foreign oil ? Up to now , Venezuela has been our main foreign source . Venezuela produces about a third as much as the United States , or about a sixth Of the world 's total . Until now . America need not look further . But in oil , the past is not a good guide to the future . The important figures to consider are not how much oil is coming out of the ground in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is where Kuwait and its neighbors along the Persian gulf suddenly grab the spotlight . Area Only Touched Altho the area has only been poked here and there , oilmen already know of more oil in Arab lands than in all the rest of the world put together . Oil was discovered in the middle east before World War I. The early fields were in the desert hills then called Persia , now known as Iran . Britons found the fields , developed them to supply the British fleet , and lost them thru selfish exploitation . For four years the fields were closed down . Now the Persian wells are flowing again . But meanwhile the emphasis has shifted away from Iran down along the Persian gulf . So far Russia has shown no obvious interest in Arab oil . Until now , Russia has been able to produce more oil than it needs . But the communist world runs on only about one-tenth Of the world'g oil . As the Red lands become modern , their demands will increase . Day for Showdown If Russia runs short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men shake their heads sadly . That , they say , will be the day for a showdown . In such a showdown the Arab word of Kuwait , which means " little fort , " may become more familiar to American tongues than was Pearl Harbor 14 years ago . Meanwhile the task is to keep the oil flowing . The task is being left to the oilmen who have done a remarkable job . To the oilmen , however , there is a big obstacle  --  the state of Israel . The Arabs more and more say the American people and gOvernment will have to choose between ! Israel and oil  --  that we ca n't continue to support the one and hope to keep the other.1 The state department is trying hard to make liars of the Arabs altho sometimes the diplomats already have to do some mighty fast juggling.
