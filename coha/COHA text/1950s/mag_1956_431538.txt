157 Life Without Father ? @# MRS . Emmimarie Jones is a good-looking brunette who lives in England and has an 11-year-old daughter named Monica . Dr. Marlow W. Olsen is a big , graying embryologist with the AgriculResearch Center at Beltsville , Md . Leh has been telling quite a story . rs. ( ones , as you may have read inthe papers , claims that Monica never had a father ? that , in other words , she is a living example of the phenomenon known scientifically as parthenogenesis . That unwieldy word means reproduction of one 's kind without the normal sexual preliminaries . Laymen call it virgin birth . Dr. Olsen declares that some of the turkeys hatched at the federal research station never had a father , either . They came from eggs laid by virgin females . Reproduction without benefit of males @# @#  | is common among such lower forms of life as bees and aphids .

While doctors are skeptical that parthenogenesis really took place in the strange case of Monica Jones , Dr. Olsen 's investigations prove for the first time that it does occur naturally in a creature as high up the scale of life as a turkey . FOUR years ago , Olsen and a fellow worker segregated 30 hen turkeys for a study , not of parthenogenesis but of fertility . Olsen had a hunch that a drop in the fertility of the Beltsville flock , amounting to about 50 percent between January and July , might somehow be related to a loss of feathers by the males . The idea was to mate some of the toms , when they started moulting , with the segregated hens . A close record would 158 POPULAR SCIENCE male X and female X chromosomes unite , a girl is born .

Marsden , one of the developers of the Beltsville Small White turkey , " let 's make sure the eggs now being laid are infertile . " So they incubated eggs laid by the nonmated hens and then , one by one , Olsen broke them open and looked for evidence of embryonic development . " Infertile , " Olsen called out , and Marsden wrote it down . " Infertile ... Infertile . . . Infertile ... " It was just what they had expected . But then came an egg that was different . As the scientist broke it and sieved the contents through his fingers . he discovered a bit of membrane . " Put this one down as fertile , " he called out . " It ca n't be , " Marsden called back . But out of a batch of several dozen of the selected eggs , several others showed the same kind of growth . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The question is : -. here is it coming from ? " He began to look for the answer . - FO SOME people , this is a humorous 11 subject ? life without a father . They snicker . They say the toms must have gotten in somehow . Or some joker must have switched eggs in the incubator . Dr. Olsen foresaw this , so he kept the experimental birds under lock and key nd cared for them himself . He put a lock m the incubator . He marked each egg with the date it was laid and the number f the hen that laid it . He even added a secret symbol , in invisible ink , which showed up only in ultraviolet light . As a scientist , he gave himself harder problems . For example , was it possible that a hen known never to have mated could have received sperm some other way ? Also , could it be that among a flock of supposedly virgin hens , one was a hermaphrodite ? To rule out all such possibilities , Olsen separated hens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a time when turke ' ; have not begun to mature sexually . The hens he kept in individual cages . Ye : . just like the other unmated hens unde experiment , when they grew up the ' laid some eggs that developed at leas a little way toward turkeys . JUMP now to Saturday , March 10 , 1956 . At 10:30 in the morning , Dr. Olsen gently cracked the shell of a turkey egg lying on a table in the Beltsville hatchery and picked off bits of it with a pair of tweezers until a bird 's head appeared . Afterwards , off and on for eight hours , he picked away other bits . That night he kept the bird in the hatchery and the next day took him home in a portable brooder , which he plugged in next to his bed . Thereafter , every four hours , ' round the clock , Dr. Olsen fed his tiny charge . He got out of bed at midnight and at four to poke a mixture of crumbled egg and cottage cheese down the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his office . This was unusual care for a turkey , but the turkey was unusual , too ? the first fatherless poult to hatch and keep on living . The Beltsville staff named him Olie . Dr. Olsen 's score card for 1956 reads as follows : One hundred and twenty-eight virgin turkey hens laid about 6,000 eggs . Of these , about 1,800 showed parthenogenetic development , and of these 247 developed into embryos . Seven of these fatherless turkeys came out of the shell alive , but five died during the first 24 hours . The others were Olie and a bird , born in April , named Popeye . What causes parthenogenesis ? Could it be that the egg cells are damaged ? " No , " reports Olsen . " They are not interfered with in any way . " He knows that heredity plays a big part , because he has been selecting for breeding stock those birds in which the parthenogenetic trait is strongest , and  | the proportion of " fertile " eggs from virgin hens went from 15 to 30 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be embryos all over the place . " THE hens now being used in the investigation are the descendants of a remarkable torn known as Chris . Born in 1953 , Chris was originally on the records as a female but , very late for a turkey , began developing big feet and other male characteristics . He let out his first gobble at the age of 32 weeks ? 20 weeks past schedule . Olsen suspects that Chris himself never had a father . That 's because Olie . Popeye and the rest of them were also very slow in developing . Not a sign of life appears until the fifth day of incubation , four days later than usual , and the birds are n't ready to hatch until the thirtieth day , which is three or four clays beyond normal time . If Chris actually came from an unfertilized egg , that would explain his retarded development and the mistaken identification . In any event , this laggard gobbler now is as big and vigorous as other three-year-old toms , and his offspring carry more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environment also seems to have a part , though a small one . Anyway , some of the unmated hens are raised where they can see toms ; others are n't . The first group ? probably as the result of hormonal stimulation ? lays a higher proportion of " fertile " eggs . Of what practical value is all this ? May we some day be able to eliminate sex in the turkey business ? 160 POPULAR SCIENCE Not a chance . The sex chromosomes in turkeys are such that an unfertilized egg can develop into nothing but a male . In other words , all parthenogenetic turkeys have to be toms ? and hens will always be needed to lay the eggs from which they hatch . The opposite would be true in human beings . There the egg , if it developed parthenogenetically , could give rise only to a female , according to genetic theory . BUT Olsen 's work does throw new light on an old problem in the turkey industry , which each year incubates 100 million eggs ? worth 30 cents apiece ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Beltsville research suggests that many of these eggs , even if they contain an embryo , may never have been fertilized . Meanwhile , what about Olie and Popeve ? Well , they died ? Olie on Easter Sunday , at the age of 22 days , from an inability to digest turkey mash ; Popeye a few weeks later , aged 18 days , cause unknown . As for the Englishwoman 's daughter , at last reports she was thriving but had flunked the skin-grafting test . Ordinarily , skin taken from one person can not be successfully grafted on anyone else because the recipient 's body sets up a reaction to it as foreign matter . Identical twins , since they developed from the same egg and have the same inheritance , are exceptions . Presumably a parthenogenetic child and her mother should be exceptions , too . But grafts from Monica to Mrs. Jones and from her to Monica did not hold permanently . So the doctors remain skeptical.                  @ @ @
