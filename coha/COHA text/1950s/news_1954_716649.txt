txt EISEND ER BACKS DIXON-YATES PACT ; DELAY MOVE FAILS 10.8 Vote in Atom Committee Balks Foes ' of Contract ? President Again 1- ) holds It Text of the Eisenhower letter is printed om Page 25 . By WILLIAM M. BLAIR . Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , Nov. 10 ? PresiH dent Eisenhower stood his ground today for the Dixon-Yates private power contract . Furthermore , he declared that the idea of " fastening on the , Federal Government a continuous and never-ending responsibility " far constructing public power plants was illogical and , in the long run , against the best interests of the country . He backed up n-s views by calling on , the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy to waive a thirty-day waiting period , required by law , so that construction might begin as soon as possible on the Dixon-Yates plant , which would feed power into the Tennessee Valley Authority . This , he said , also will enable persons in the T. V , A. area to " make their plans for the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joint committee blocked another Democratic move to put off signing of the proposed contract . The strict party-line vote was 10 to 8 against a resolution by Senator John 0 . Pastore , Democrat of Rhode Island . The resolution would have urged the Atomic Energy Commission , which would execute the contract for the Federa1 Government , to hold off signing until the incoming Democratic-controlled Congress had a chance to review the proposal . Democrats Continue Fight There was no let-up in the Democratic efforts to kill the project . The A. E. C. is scheduled to report to the committee tomorrow on final negotiations to complete the contract .. The public hearings were recessed subject to the call of the committee chairman , Representative W. Sterling Cole , Republican of upstate New York , who said he expected the signed contract to be ready tomorrow or Friday , 0 . ' According to The United Press , Mr. Cole said the committee vote gave " every indication " that the group eventually would approve the Administration request for waiver of the waiting period . The Dixon-Yates proposal calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company to construct a steam plant at West Memphis , , Ark . The cost is estimated at $107,250,000 . This plant would transmit power across the Mississippi River into the T. V. A. system as " replacement " for some 600,000 kilowatts that T. V. A. now supplies to the atomic installation at Paducah , Ky , Edgar H. Dixon is president of Middle South and Eugene A. Yates is chairman of the Southern Company . The President 's letter outlining his philosophy on the role of the Federal Government in power development was sent to Mr. Cole . The New Yorker and Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper , // Iowa Republican and joint committee vice chairman , talked with the President at the White House this morning . Before dispatching the letter the President told his news gon= ference that he deploredthe Political quarrel over the DixonYates contract . He said he failed to see any politics in it and , if there Was , it was . not of his choosing . He said " he would stick to the Dixon-Yates proposal until a better contract was offered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint committee that the President 's letter " makes it plain ? as has been charged  --  that the whole purpose of Dixon-Yates is to alter the T. V. A. program . " , Senator Gore became a member of the committee this week . Notes Length of Contract Noting that the President had said the Dixon-Yates proposal was designed to permit time for a study of the Government 's role in the power field , he asserted that " this is a strange procedure , " The signing of a twentyfive-year contract is " hardly temporary , " he said . Senator Clinton P. Anderson , New Mexico Democrat who is slated to become chairman of the joint committee , said that major changes had been made in the contract since the public hearings began . These changes , he said , show how " desperate " the Administration is to strengthen its hand arid put the contract across . President Eisenhower reiterated in his letter and at the news conference his position that the Dixon-Yates proposal was to relieve T. V. A. of part of its obligation to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. V : A. , without additional steam plants built at taxpayers ' expense , may have an adequate supply of electric power for itt customers through 1957 . " The construction of new plants at Federal expense , he said , " implying a purpose of - continuing this , process indefinitely in the future " was " wholly indefensible unless it should become a part of a vast national plan . " ' Under such a condition , he continued , " it is most certainly a project that demands earnest and prayerful study . " ? Meanwhile , he said , the T. V. A. region " will not be deprived of the additional power they need for the next several years . " He reiterated that " no one in this Administration has any intention of destroying or damaging T. V. A. or of diminishing its effectiveness in any way . " ' Queried at the press conference on why competitive bids were not called for , he replied that he had been informed a number of private utilities had been asked and only two offers received . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no company risk involved . The ? President said he had rejected contracts made on a cost plus fixed fee basis , such as the A. E. C. had used in the past , beacuse he felt some risk should be shared by the building companies . Lists Contract Changes Senator Anderson said the changes made in the proposed Dixon-Yates contract provide : ( The recapture of the steam plant by the - Govrernment during the first two years if that is desired . lEbasco Services , Inc. , will not be used as the contractor for the steam plant but may be used as the designer or engineer . Ebasco was replaced in what the Democrats charged was the " Ebasco Fiasco " in the construction of a plant by a group of private utilities at Joppa , Ill. , to provide power for the Paducah , Ky. , atomic plant . Testimony before Congressional committees show that the cost of the Joppa plant ran more than $0,000,000 over estimates . Ilan option under which the Government would be able to extend the contract to forty-five years instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of thirty-five years . ( Mixon-Yates will supply an additional 100,000 kilowatts from other sources if it fails to have a second generator operating within thirty-four months . There has been talk in Administration circles that the recapture clause was unacceptable to Dixon-Yates and could form a basis for Dixon-Yates refusing to consummate the contract .
