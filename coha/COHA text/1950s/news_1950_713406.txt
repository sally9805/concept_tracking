txt At 215 E. 31st st. there is a decrepit old building . In it about 250 tenants live in eight apartments under conditions which Can be described only as abominable . The two top floors sixth and ( seventh have been ordered alumcloned by the city building department as unfit to live in . Yet on these floors live about 25 human being who pay for quarters with no water , no heat , no toilets . But they do get for their money rickety floors , broken plaster , boarded up windows , rats , vermin , dangerous makeshift wiring , cavedark cold hallways , no exits to fire escapes , and long stair climbs to their " apartments . " Get Eviction Notices For such dismal , repulsive quarters on the seventh floor , two women ? mot her and daughter ? have been paying $61 a month . For that suns they get for themselves and three children two small rooms and two which are the size of large closets . They finally have refused to pay and they have received five day eviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the strlicture . Altho it seems unbelievable until you see it , there are still more deplorable accommodations on the sixth floor . On the landing , you will see no sign of life in the pitch blackness of the corridors . But , some-1 where in the darkness there , a child is heard crying . Picking your way by the light of a match , you find a door which leads to the wails . It opens on four rooms of squalor ; less fitted for human habitation than the quarters provided for the midH west 's farts ) animals . Windows Boarded Up The " apartment " is cold . On the floor , a tiny baby crouches in an orange crate filled with rags . The windows  --  glass smashed long ago  --  are hoarded up . The one dim bulb burning illumines a father and a mother and six other youngsters , most of them in the preschool bracket . The children 's eyes are dull , lack luster . There 's none of the spotstaneity of childhood about them . They sit and shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a visitor . These folks  --  with no furniture , no heat , no daylight , no water , no bathroom  --  do n't like to talk about what they pay . They 're afraid of being evicted . The sixth and seventh floor tenants carry their water in buckets from any lower floor where they can find others willing to let them have it . If they want to use a toilet , they hike downstairs to one of the filthy , seatless , water closets in the shambles of the community bathrooms on the lower floors . Carry Fuel 13p Stairs To get what heat they can , the occupants  --  usually the youngsters ? carry coal or kerosene or fuel oil up from the street level . And the winter winds , sweeping thru corridors that are open to the street , dissipate the warmth as fast as it 's created . This building brings in rents which total approximately $1,800 a month , nearly $22,000 a year , . not counting rents from the ground floor stores . For a good fraction of the tenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  city aid , aid to dependent children , old age pensions . That income is possible because what were once , long ago , decent and t i-room family living units have been cut up , as most buildings in the Negro area have been , into tiny units called , ironically , " kitchenette apartments . " Others Even Worse This building is not one of the worst in the city . Surprisingly , it is one on which a major rehabilitation effort has been made . It is only two years since aroused public officials made extraordinary efforts to bring it up to minimum habitable standards . Today , for the most part , it has reverted to a slum . Trying to ascribe blame for such conditions is difficult , according to Herman 0 . NVinnegge , supervisor of compliance for the city building department . He is credit . ed by his boss , Building Commissioner Roy T. Christiansen , with streamlining the department 's procedures and striking hard blows for adequate housing , putting it long hours of his own time . Winnegge 's point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . ciologist , psychologist. or reform . 1 TRIBUNE : Photos I Exterior of building at 215 E. 31st at. , where Negro families live in filth and squalor . Rear of same building showing dropoff , without steps ( right ) and some of the garbage left standing in cans . er  --  is that the immediate blame must be distributed between tenants and owners . The record from his files bears him out . Worse Two Years Ago Ignoring such complex human and other factors as why so many Negroes arc concentrated in a small area , the impersonal files show that the building two years ago was even worse than it is now . Pictures taken then show huge piles of garbage at the foot of the rear outside stairway , similar piles in the alley behind the building , rusted and unsafe fire escapes , an unusable outside stabway on the west , an open elevator shaft , old wooden doors thruout , reams of temporary wiring . In addition , wooden stairs had been chopped up for fuel , rats ran rampant , dirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse than now . Tracing ownership of this and ' other such buildings is difficult . Often taxes have not been paid for years . And finding who collects the rents and taking that person to court is an unsatisfactory procedure . Under present law , the largest penalty that can be assessed for the violations involved is one or more $200 fines . Pay $1,000 In Fines In the six years preceding 1948 various persons connected with the rathole paid $1,000 in fines , a sum which easily could be ascribed to the cost of dqlng business . So Commissioner Christiansen persuaded the state 's attorney 's office , the county judge , and t h e county treasurer to cooperate in a setup which placed the building into receivership so that rents could lie used to pay for repairs . Amid myriad difficulties about insurance and other matters a building construction employers group put up $10,000 ? repaid from rents  --  and the building was worked on until it met minimum habitable standards .

" Thimbles , " devices to take stovepipes safely thru walls , have been stolen . Plumbing fixtures have been taken by thieves .
