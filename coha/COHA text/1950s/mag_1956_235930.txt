We continue to oppose the seating of Communist China in the United Nations , thus upholding international morality and keeping faith with the thousands of Amer ican youths who gave their lives fighting Communist aggression in Korea . <P> These words may become part of both the Republican and Democratic platforms if a bipartisan appeal from " The Commit tee of One Million Against the Admission of Communist China to the United Nations " is successful . A letter sent to the organiza tion 's members explains the drive : " If our allies are permitted to miscalculate , and vote admission of Red China to the U.N. , such action could lead to the gravest con sequences . . . The conventions can prove to the world the universality and solid ity of the American people 's opposition through the inclusion of identical planks in the platforms of both parties . " Signers of the appeal came from oppo site political poles . Among them : Illinois ' Democratic Senator Paul Douglas and New Jersey 's Republican Senator H. Alex ander Smith , Minnesota 's Republican Rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter . One reason why the Committee of One Million may achieve its goal : when the U.S. Senate last week adopted , 86 to 0 , a House-approved ( 391-0 ) resolution against the admittance of Red China to the U.N. , it was only reflecting over whelming U.S. opinion . Thus , the twin planks proposed by the Committee of One Million would be the best and wisest sort of politics for both parties .
