California rain slanted down on Santa Anita 's water-logged racing strip ; a light earthquake shook the track between the second and third races . It hardly seemed an ideal day for a comeback . Nonetheless , Calumet Farm sent Citation , the wonder horse , wading to the post for his first race in 13 months . Lest anybody accuse him of taking unnecessary risks with the great horse , Trainer Horace A. ( " Jimmy " ) Jones explained that his decision had been based on careful calculations . Said Jimmy : " I decided the horse was mentally ready as well as physically . When a horse is ready , he should go . " <P> Visibility was so poor that Citation and his three rivals could barely be seen across the mist-shrouded infield . Trainer Jones , a thickset little man with a perpetually worried look , had a twinge of conscience as the field entered the starting gate : " It 's a little like putting Joe DiMaggio back in the game in midseason and letting him bat against good , seasoned pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad moment when Citation broke slowly and wallowed down the backstretch eating mud from other horses ' heels . <P> On the turn , Citation was cutting down the gap with an easy , amphibious stride when one horse drifted wide , carrying Citation out with him . For a while it looked like a repetition of the race two years ago at Havre de Grace , when an unknown named Saggy handed Citation one of his two defeats in 30 starts . But one lick of Jockey Steve Brooks 's whip shot Citation into the lead . He coasted down the stretch like a champion , ears pricked forward , and won by a length and a half . His time for the six furlongs : a creditable 1:11 2/5 . <P> In Calumet 's campaign to make Citation the first " million-dollar horse " in history ( $867,750 so far ) , his $2,600 share of the purse was hardly worth picking up . But Citation was back in form again : and that was racing news . Trainer Jones bustled down to the winner 's circle to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splotched with mud and lather . Jimmy crouched , stared anxiously at the foreleg that had long kept Citation idle , and announced with relief : " He 's sound . . . When he tells me-as he did a couple of days ago-that he wants to run , I 'll run him again . " <P> The odds were that Citation would be running in at least one or two more warm-ups before he kept a Feb. 11 date in the $50,000-added San Antonio Handicap . His main objective : the Santa Anita Handicap , Feb. 25 , with $100,000 guaranteed to the winner . Citation had a chance to be a millionaire before he left California .
