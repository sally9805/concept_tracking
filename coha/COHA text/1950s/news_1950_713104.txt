txt A " rollback " of prices of key commodities to June 25 levels was urged upon President Truman today by toplevel Government advisers . They based their arguments on the contention that , with markets at present levels , rearmament would cost the Government close to 10 per cent more than would have been the case when hostilities first broke out in Korea . The President , according to advices here , is not expected to mention rollbacks in his message to Congress tomorrow , but the powers he will ask will include that authority . In a talk with industrialists today W. Stuart Symington , chairman of the National Security Resources Board , is understood to have said that the Government is inclined toward partial mobilization rather than an all-out effort at this time . He is supposed to have added that the Government has little faith in the efficacy of voluntary controls and will make what regulations it finds necessary mandatory on the industries affected . To operate a price rollback program successfully , officials said , a vast amount of preparation is necessary but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out . Preparations require a complete study of key commodity markets , decisions on fair prices at several levels and an order to make the rollback effective . Such a program , it was conceded , could well bring a broader price-control regulation as officials found it necessary to extend their authority in order to make the original controls work . The Bureau of Labor Statistics , which keeps track of price movements , has recorded price advances of almost 10 per cent in its index of twenty-eight key commodities since June .25 . Included in the list of sensitive items are such goods as rubber , tin , wool , copper , zinc , lead and cotton . Industrialists today also- were given a hint that the Government has in mind the creation of an Office of Defense Mobilization which under the National Security Resources Board would carry out civilian and military mobilization . Sources close to the White House said the President , in his message ? tomorrow , would call for tighter controls over commodity markets . Just what direction the controls would follow was not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // business men here said it probably would be a demand for higher margins ? on futures dealings . Senator Burnet R. Maybank , Democrat of South Carolina , chairman ' of the Senate 's Banking and Currency Coinmittee , announced today his committee will open inquiries into recent advances in commodity and ' other . prices . Yesterday , Senator Maybank said his committee if it is convinced that price controls are necessary will demand that a " freeze " level be fixed that would remove the profits made as a result of the present crisis . It has . been suggested here that the Eoconomic Cooperation Administration , which has been buying goods of all types for the . European Recovery Program and which recently expanded its activities into the handling of arms purchases for the Atlantic Pact nations , . might provide the nuclgus for an Office of Defense Mobilization . . Also under intense study at the moment is a widespread program on preclusive buying of vital raw materials available In world . markets . This means buying materials to . keep the enemy from getting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was not as effective as it was expected to be , and large quantities . of goods of - use to the enemy found ' their way through third countries into the hands , of the Axis powers . ? The " program to . be initiated shortly , it was said , will plug loppholes through which third countries friendly- to Soviet Russia could acquire such items as natural rubber , tin and non-ferrous metals such as , copper , lead and zinc . In prospect also is a general tightening of all export controls . An expansion of the so-called " positive " list of materials that might be of assistance to Russia or her satellites is now being prepared by the Department of - Commerce . That agency reported today that under its present control system it had managed to block the export of upwards of $150,000,000 worth of useful materials to Russia and her friends in the last two years . A subcommittee of the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee will begin closed hearings tomorrow on a Government proposal to require wartime searches of foreign vessels entering United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren G. Magnuson , . Democrat of Washington , is . understood to have been advised by the Coast Guard that it considers such a precaution necessary . The search , it was added would be insurance against the entrance of an innocent-seeming foreign vessel with an atomic bomb or other explosive in its hold . In line with defense mobilization , there were reports here today that manufacturers of television sets have in process a code under which producers would all allocate the same proportion of their production to radar manufacture and to the output of television sets for consumers . Such a code would be the first of what are expected . to be many similar arrangements in industry over the coming months . . To make the codes completely ? effective would require some relaxation of the anti-trust laws . Proposals for modifications of the anti-trust statutes are all ready at the National Security Resources Board , it was said , and should reach Congress by the middle of next week .                 @ @ @ @
