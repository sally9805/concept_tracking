THE top leaders of the Labor Party had planned a quiet little dinner for B. &; K. in a private dining room in the Houses of Parliament , and looked forward to the kind of pleasantly informal discussion they had had with Georgy Malenkov . They knew there would be differences , but hoped these might be cordially discussed . So they planned . But they expected too much of their No. 1 guest . Churlish Nikita Khrushchev made it a night to remember . <P> The chill of the British crowds had begun to get under the skin of the burly Khrushchev , and he was obviously feeling edgy . So , for different reasons , was George Brown , a tough , belligerent trade unionist who is slated to become a minister if Labor gets back into office . <P> After the toasts , Brown began picking on Khrushchev 's studious young ( 22 ) son , seated near by . " You do n't always agree with your father on everything , do you ? " Brown demanded . Young Khrushchev replied that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university , " bellowed Brown . " She disagrees with me all the time . That 's the difference between your country and ours . " <P> Khrushchev noticed something going on , asked the interpreter to tell him what Brown had said to his son . When he understood , Khrushchev flushed and said : " Interference in family affairs is even worse than interference in another country 's internal affairs . " Abruptly , the pleasant little dinner became taut with strain . <P> Menacing Pause . Bulganin tried to retrieve the situation with an urbane , jolly-fellow speech regretting that they had not seen all they wanted because he and Khrushchev were " slaves of protocol . " But when Bulganin sat down , Khrushchev lumbered to his feet and , flushed with anger and alcohol , launched into an hour 's tirade . <P> He accused Britain and France of turning Hitler eastward against Russia , of betraying Russia at Munich-leaving the Soviet Union no choice but to conclude the Hitler-Stalin pact in self-defense . As he blustered on into a discussion of World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown muttered : " God forgive you ! " Khrushchev stopped abruptly . <P> " What did you say ? " he demanded . There was a menacing pause . Khrushchev roared : " Do n't be afraid . Say it again ! " Brown blurted : " God forgive you . " Khrushchev and Brown broke into an angry exchange . Khrushchev reiterated his story of how the war was won ; Brown retorted as angrily that thousands of British men were killed in the period when Russia and Hitler were allies . <P> Khrushchev plunged on , ignoring the traditional cry from a policeman in the corridors ( " Who goes home ? " ) announcing that the House of Commons had adjourned for the night . Khrushchev sneered at NATO ; he threatened to deal with West Germany alone if the West persisted in rearming it ; he brushed aside Eisenhower 's proposed aerial inspection plan as " a fantasy , " and added : " We do n't want people walking into our bedroom .
