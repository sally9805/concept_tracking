The traditional onslaught of New Year 's Day bowl games left television viewers slightly myopic , more than a little dubious about the true merits of some of the top-ranked U.S. college teams . <P> Louisiana State hardly justified its No. 1 ranking , had trouble getting through and around Clemson 's beefy line , blew repeated scoring chances , scratched out a 7-0 victory in the Sugar Bowl only after a botched fourth-down center snap gave L.S.U. an easy scoring chance from Clemson 's 11-yd. line . <P> Texas Christian fumbled eight times , drew key penalties to stop other drives , muddled to a scoreless tie in the Cotton Bowl with the Air Force Academy . <P> Oklahoma showed real authority in striking for quick touchdowns on plays covering 40 , 42 and 79 yds. , polished off slow-moving , slow-thinking Syracuse in the Orange Bowl , 21-6 , in a game that was no contest after the first period . <P> Most impressive New Year 's performance was provided by Iowa , which displayed the poise and shattering power of a true champion , broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the field in a 38-12 drubbing of game , but outmanned , California in Pasadena 's Rose Bowl .
