ORDINARILY the young novelist begins his work as the art of the novel itself begins , with tales and sketches , photographic in effect , without the composition of the finished picture . His mind is filled with impressions of life , scenes , characters , faces , bits of action , fragments of dialogue  --  an endless procession flickering across his screen of consciousness . These he feels with impelling force as material for art . With an instinct like that of a child for dramatic imitation he registers these impressions , at first almost or wholly without significance , or seemingly as an afterthought giving them such significance as he can . With the maturity that comes with years comes also the sense of their meaning , the sense which gives power to organize them into coherent wholes . So the art of the modern novel begins with the flow of London life through the pages of The Tatler and The Spectator . So the art of Thackeray begins with sketches and generalized narratives of type characters , that of Dickens with " Sketches by Boz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scenes from Clerical Life , " and so through the list . But too often it is the case that with the growth of the power of organization , which is in large part the intellectual sense of form , the strength of imagination fades . The novelist 's task is to express the meaning of life in terms of life itself , but unless he keeps his imagination young , he may find by the time life has meaning for him that he has let slip the terms for its expression . To De Morgan 's eye the stream of life never lost its brilliance of color , its vivacity , its freshness of interest . As if he were twenty-one , scenes , impressions , characters , bits of action , crowd his mind and clamor for expression . At times , they tax the power of his maturity to organize them ; he turns in his own person to the reader to apologize for their jostling demand for attention , tags them with labels of explanation showing what he conceives to be their significance , their relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into his working mind ; we see him adjusting the subsequent pattern to the material that thrusts itself into the weaving ; a figure he throws in at first for hardly more than good measure has an effect on the design that at the moment he does not foresee . We do not need Mrs. De Morgan 's note on his way of working to tell us that he created his characters first and arrived at his plot by waiting to see what they would do next . Sometimes the reader waits with him , usually without impatience , for he finds himself in good company ; life continues to pass in review even if the plot pauses . It is pleasant to sit for an hour in the bow window of the club with a shrewd observer and a seasoned and genial commentator . It is an ideal club window where there is no danger of acrid gossip nor of platitudes of proverbial philosophy ; for our commentator bears a young head on old shoulders . Such is the fact which turns the easy comparison of De Morgan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in the mind because De Morgan will have it so . He gives us constant reminders of Dickens in matter , method , mannerism , in character , scene , turn of colloquial speech , unfolding of plot  --  instances would make a long list , ending with the two unfinished stories of mysterious disappearance  --  and if for a moment we miss any of these , De Morgan reminds us again by direct quotation or reference . But all these are surface glints that deceive us as to the nature of the material only so long as we keep at a distance . Little Dave Wardle 's name , for example , may remind us incongruously of Dingley Dell , but Dave himself , and Joey Vance , and Alice-for-Short , and Lizarann , only remind us that Dickens never was a child , that however few of days he may once have been he was always full of trouble . There are no children in his novels , only wistful little figures such as he once was , yearning for childhood but not experiencing it . Of boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit the sins of the world and the Oliver Twists who bear the burden thereof ; it never occurs to him that these are two sides of the same boy . De Morgan knows the ways of the world , but they do not burden his spirit nor darken his mind nor shadow his heart . He runs to no extremes ; he is pure without being Puritan ; his art is unspoiled either by incessant consciousness of evil and responsibility for it , or pretended unconsciousness and elaborate irresponsibility . He saw many of the things Dickens saw , but he saw them from a totally different point of view . Dickens had most of his experience early in life ; it was hard and disillusioning , and he drew on it before it lost its acid . De Morgan 's came to him in more even flow , and he ripened it well before he tapped it . He has no grudge to work off , no scores to settle . He can look upon wealth , title , lineage without rancor , upon pride and oppression without scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a genial companion for a chat between chapters . " The detestable Early-Victorian practice of gossiping with one 's reader , " so De Morgan describes the manner while blandly adding its weight to the heavy charge of Early Victorianism which he says is already at his door . The reviewers who laid it there , most of them born since the Jubilee year , and knowing little of Victorianism save what they may have read in their Chesterton , could hardly command the respectful attention of a man who had experienced all of it except its , and his , unconscious infancy . Victorianism in the original is much like a good many other poisons : it is in no way noxious till it is extracted and boiled down ; almost anything will poison you if you take it in a high enough concentration . When Arnold Bennett sets out to be Victorian , the result is a piece of synthetic reconstruction ; it is like George Arliss playing Disraeli : every effect is carefully considered , and the result is all that it should be , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You comment on it in terms of its component parts , dialogue , acting , costume , scenery . De Morgan 's Victorianism is not a synthetic product , neither is it a contemporary record like Trollope 's ; rather it is Victorianism recollected in tranquillity . He does not exhibit it like a museum piece , but wears it as an accustomed garment , though kindly alive to our interest in it . " When Ghost Meets Ghost " prolongs for us throughout its pages the moment when in looking at a daguerrotype you see youth and life in the eyes , in the light of which the costume fades into the insignificant vesture of a human being , and your grandfather becomes the boy you once were , or your grandmother a child like your own daughter . Lossie Thorpe , herself in crinolines , quotes her sister Violet on the earlier generation : She says it really can not matter now what girls did who had their waists under their chins and no crinolines , and ringlets , nor men whose trousers were as tight as stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shirts , and shaved close everymorning . You should see her crinolines  --  every new one larger than the last . Substitute the terms of the costume Lossie herself was wearing at the time , and the passage expresses our own feeling about twentieth century excursions into Victorianism . But with De Morgan we are not making an excursion , a round trip at sixty miles an hour on a cut-rate ticket . We can not see his land at all unless we enter in and dwell with him in leisure and quiet , walk his ways with him afoot with no nervous impatience of long sittings in the sun , with good will to enjoy the place we are in unspoiled with desire to be in some other . In this spirit we may meet his friends with no barrier of costume between us . We are not inclined to say of them , " after all , they are human in spite of the hideous things they wear , " for the costumes are not the staple of his art ; they are there , and subconsciously keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobtrusive signs you could hardly name keep you aware of the season of the year . Here is no parade of the " Victorian compromise , " but whatever was of the period in thought , manners , morals , is in these pages also , less apt to make us wonder that our grandfathers knew so little , than to make us aware how little we know more than they . To say that the central strength of De Morgan 's work lies in human character means that his characters are human , not types , not specimens , not variants and " sports " in the biologic sense . Unless they were well-rounded human beings he did not entrust them with speaking parts . The type character , named for the one quality it is supposed to exhibit , he recognizes as a cardboard figure fit for nothing but to slide across the stage-in a groove . The economy of material that saws character into strips for veneering is not a part of his practice . Type names occur in his pages ? Lady Horse , Mrs. Diamonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some merely passing mention . Burlesque names he has too , that tickle the ear as lightly as any in the " Bab Ballads , " but he does not limit the scope of his figures with them as Dickens does ; they occur chiefly as nicknames from the ready tongue of Christopher Vance , or in the perversions of children 's speech . He will chuckle with us over our foibles ; he will follow humors so long as they are humorous ; but he does not show us crippled souls limping through distorted lives as matter for mirth . Rather he shows us people whom we think of first as very much like ourselves , living such lives as we know , and if before long we begin to find them lovable on the whole , and if the feeling that kindles for them and him warms ourselves who are in their image , it does us no harm . In an age when fiction must move at airplane speed or we will have none of it , when stories are reduced to storiettes and brevity is become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer persuasion of his personality to live with people as commonplace as ourselves through chapters of every-day doings till we know them as well as we know our families and neighbors . After that we are interested in trivial things they do which would not catch our eyes if anyone else did them , and when they begin to do the real things of the tale , De Morgan has our interest doubly secure . He repeatedly disclaims any assurance of it , often advises us to " skip , " but we do not do it . He carefully explains the plausibility of sundry bits of action  --  then if ever we are inclined to skip , for why try to assure us that a mortal might have done thus and so under such and such circumstances when we have just seen with our own eyes a mortal do that very thing ? In " Alice-for-Short " the ghosts are seen by very practical people who do not believe in ghosts . You know them very well ; you know that they did see the ghosts , for you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be a good artist ( to be sure he writes fiction , but it must be poor stuff from what we hear of it ) ; he could n't imagine a ghost that was n't there if he wanted to , much less against his will . Thus you find yourself leagued with the author to convince a sceptical character . Again , like Richardson but with more discretion , De Morgan gains credence by building in the reader 's mind an impression like a barrier reef , atom by atom till at last it is solid enough to wreck a battleship . It is not an easy method to use today ; we have had training in novel-reading since Richardson 's time ; we are quite ready to accept lath and canvas and are impatient of his too careful building . Neither Richardson nor Trollope ever created a more tiresome character than Mrs. Eldridge in " It Never Can Happen Again , " but if you attend patiently all her dreary interviews with her victim you will never challenge the result on grounds of plausibility , nor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget Christopher Vance , nor any of the group of children who take their being from so obvious a sympathy on De Morgan 's part . Old people are there , too , because he loves them , and we can do no less ? Mrs. Verrinder , and the old twin sisters Phoebe and Maisie , souls riding tranquilly on the ground swell of storms long past , tragedy from which time has filtered the bitterness . It is autumn tragedy with pale colors and wan sunshine ; twilight tragedy with the sunset smoldering through the ashes of the mist ; on the whole a rather " cheerful Thanatopsis . " For age it is better so , but where the tragedy is that of youth it is too carefully filtered ; in removing the last taint of bitterness De Morgan has taken out the poignance too . We miss the " bright , troubled period " of youth . Charles Heath in the hands of the adventuress and failing in his art is no such picture as Pendennis fallen at the feet of the Fotheringay or plucked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality and beauty , but we scarcely see below the surface of their emotional life , and when one of them , Lucy Mauleverer , is cast for a part that is woven of tragedy , we feel as if we were kept outside the real story , peering at it through a pane of glass which baffles us with reflections of outward things . Nancy Fraser , in spite of too much stage business with the bicycle , is perhaps the most real of them , though she is not the heroine of her drama . Lossie Thorpe , Gwendolen Rivers , and their kind are human enough to be satisfying ; you feel sure that they must have faults though you might be unable to name one ; they are successfully made for love , but not for worship . There are secondary figures with memorable individuality . There are those who do not make themselves too conspicuous , but they are faithful in the minds of those of us who love their kind  --  a lesser artist if he could have drawn them at all would have peopled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters is not large and it is not crowded , but it shows us figures that were not born for death . Of an author whose first creative act is character we do not expect much in the way of plot ; characters as real as De Morgan 's are not easily shaped to organized structure of action . De Morgan tries to do his duty by his plots , and succeeds as often as not . " Joseph Vance " has all the organization one could ask of the novel in autobiographic form , and the device of the blameless hero atoning in tragic silence a sin not his own here comes off with more success than itdeserves , for it is lightly touched and is not the mainstay of the plot . For a comment on " It Never Can Happen Again " one may paraphrase Dr. Johnson on Richardson : Sir , if you were to read it for the story , your impatience would be so much fretted that you would hang yourself . You must read it for Lizarann and Jim , who have unsatisfactorily few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " An Affair of Dishonor " is the exception , the " Henry Esmond , " of De Morgan 's list , for it takes its rise as it were in the mind of Stevenson himself , scene calling for incidents ; the morning ride to the duel is a companion picture to the inn at Burford and the horseman who rattles at its green shutters with the handle of his whip . Character takes shape , to be sure , as the story goes on , but it takes the shape of the plot , and does not outgrow its bounds . When De Morgan calls on the supernatural to take us beyond the commonplace , he does not try to thrill us , he ostentatiously disconnects every wire that could give us a shock , then he handles it safely so long as he keeps to the established canon of the supernatural , the body of known lore that we may embroider with circumstance , but may not alter . " Alice-for-Short " is-as orthodox as " Hamlet " ; a disputed inheritance is as regular a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A ghost is on a legitimate errand when it comes to reveal circumstances of death or the hiding-place of the body , but no acceptable ghost will lie about either as does the apparition of Dr. Cartaret when it gives his sister-in-law to understand that he was murdered . Nor will it , if it condescends to interfere in a love affair , deal with an intermediary , as Dr. Cartaret 's ghost does with Charles Snaith . But little Lizarann 's last call of " Pi-lot ! " is quite within the canon ; we accept it instantly and it has its effect . De Morgan 's ghosts are very much like his other characters : so long as he lets them alone and watches to see what they will do next they serve him well , but if he tries to contrive for them they play him tricks . Of De Morgan 's style one is hardly conscious , and it is never conscious of itself . In this it is the best of style , as it is in the sense that it bears strongly the personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else could have written it . So seldom is there anything of formality that it is rarely one feels any sense of form , but it is there in the closeness with which the word clothes the thought and moves with it in freedom . De Morgan is never any more at a loss for a word than a terrier is for a place to go through a hedge . He has a sense for the value of words like an artist 's for color , and a fancy , like that of a child to whom all words are new , for turning up a familiar word as if it were new-minted and showing us a pattern on a surface to our senses rubbed smooth by use . Scrupulous sincerity , no less than humor , keeps him off formality ; he says of Peggy Heath : " She felt that she had rather been making a speech and was n't sure she was n't a humbug . Perhaps we all feel like that when we say anything consecutive . " Sincerity and freshness of imagination  --  in style as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always on the qualities of the man . The years took no toll of him , but gave him their gifts . To keep one 's ideals after the loss of the illusions , to keep one 's imagination pacing evenly with the growth of the mind , to see life in long perspective , not in the vertical , shadowless brilliance of noon , but in the level revealing rays of declining day in the last decade of a life as long as De Morgan 's , this is to " die beloved and young " and at the same time " blest and wise .
