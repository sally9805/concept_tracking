At the end of World War II , Japan 's Ohmi Silk Spinning Co. was a down-at-heel outfit whose seven ramshackle wooden factories , taken all together , were worth less than $30,000 . Today , after seven years of operating under Japan 's newly liberalized labor laws , Ohmi has grown into a $3,000,000 corporation , whose 13,000 employees and half a million humming spindles have helped push it up to sixth place in Japan 's vital yarn industry . The formula by which Ohmi 's boss , fat , arrogant Kakuji Natsukawa , has achieved this success is simple : he has paid little attention to the labor laws . <P> Ohmi 's workers are for the most part teen-age girls from the country who work long hours for half the prevailing wage scale , often as little as $10 a month . Yet , on the many occasions when Natsukawa 's company has been haled into court , the girls have steadfastly refused to testify against him . Boss Natsukawa , a Buddhist who drives a Cadillac and gives the fanciest geisha parties in Tokyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calls " K.S.E. " ( Kindness , Special Quality , Efficiency ) . " After all , " he boasted , spreading his fat hands wide , " Ohmi has never had a strike . " <P> Special Kindness . Last week Ohmi was having its strike , and Japan was learning more about K.S.E. In a published complaint , Natsukawa 's workers explained how , before each of the day 's three work shifts in their clockless factories , they were marched into the factory yard and forced , rain or shine , to sing company songs and recite such uplifting Buddhist promises as , " Today I will make no immoderate demands " or " Today I will not grumble or complain . " Once a week every worker , regardless of religion , is forced to attend a Buddhist religious service . At one rally in the plant several years ago , fire broke out and 23 Ohmi girls were trampled to death . Huddled together in small , crowded dormitories on the factory grounds , girl workers are forbidden to wear lipstick , must be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without special permits approved by at least seven company officials . <P> Marriage Penalty . All workers ' mail is censored , and love letters are frequently destroyed . If , by any chance , a romance should flower under these adverse conditions , company officials usually do not allow the newlyweds to live together , may even transfer one spouse to a distant factory . The pay of both is often reduced " because of decrease in efficiency . " <P> Last week as strikebreakers ( hired for $1.25 a day ) patrolled Kakuji Natsukawa 's mills and drumbeat a continuous tattoo to drown out the shouts of strikers , Natsukawa calmly fired some 760 striking workers for what he called " poor achievement , " and threatened to confine other strikers to their dormitories for a month . Government officials swarmed over his mills , and the Labor Ministry appointed a committee to negotiate a settlement , but Boss Natsukawa 's faith remained firm . " Almighty Buddha will protect me , " he said . " I am not an ordinary capitalist . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
