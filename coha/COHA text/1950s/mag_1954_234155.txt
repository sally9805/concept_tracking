Japanese school teachers were liberated by the U.S. occupation from a militarist thought-control system , only to be gulled by the exponents of a worse tyranny . The 500,000-strong Japanese Teachers Union , representing two-thirds of the country 's teachers , is noisy , well knit-and dominated by Communists . This week Diet members from Premier Shigeru Yoshida 's government party produced two bills designed to curb the union 's new Communist-line politicking . Unfortunately , the bills seemed to approach the old thought-control methods . <P> Twisted Idealism . The Communist-lining in the Teachers Union was plain to see . Japanese teachers are overworked ( average work week : 60 hours ) and underpaid ( average salary : about $50 a month ) . A small group of Reds and fellow travelers has played on their grievances and twisted their idealism to work up a propaganda war against the U.S. and " capitalist war plans , " and for " peace " and " neutrality . " Japan 's unruly student population , in turn , has proved to be fertile soil for the smooth-sounding " peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered a case in point . There parents of children attending high school complained to the board of education that teachers were reading the Communist party newspaper Akahata ( Red Flag ) in their classrooms and forcing students to sing the Internationale . Children were urged to see a current crop of anti-U.S . movies , notably Hiroshima , a lurid hate movie about the atom bombing , which the Teachers Union itself produced and sponsored . <P> To get at such pro-Communist activities , the government 's two new bills offered drastic alternatives . One of them would rule out almost all political activity by teachers , public and private . The other proposes to put all teachers into the formal status of government civil servants . <P> <P> Police Control ? The bills worried a great many anti-Communist Japanese , including the editors of Asahi and Mainichi , the country 's leading newspapers . The bulk of the Teachers Union membership , it was agreed , is not Communist ; newspapers aptly call the union tancho-zuru , after a native crane with a white body and a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would strengthen the Communists ' hand . Also , warned Mainichi : " Twisted interpretation of the laws could place the nation 's education system under police control . " <P> While editorialists debated and the Teachers Union held loud , anti-government rallies in protest , ordinary citizens were puzzled , but generally more disturbed by the pro-Communist teachers than by the prospect of a revived thought control . Said a Tokyo housewife after her two children had brought anti-government pamphlets home from school : " I have my misgivings about the government 's bills , but if the teachers are sending such leaflets to our homes through our children , I hope the laws will be passed immediately .
