Horseplayers not only had the usual range of choices at pari-mutuel windows last week , they were also watching an unscheduled race between a couple of jockeys , Willie Shoemaker and Joe Culmone . At California 's Hollywood Park the money was on Willie ; at Maryland tracks it was on Culmone . At week 's end both jockeys had broken or tied Johnny Longden 's modern ( 1948 ) record of riding 319 winners in one year , -* and Willie , with 326 , was seven ahead of Joe . <P> With six weeks of 1950 racing to go , 20-year-old Jockey Culmone had one factor in his favor : at Hollywood Park , where most of the top stables and jockeys are now located , Willie has a lot tougher competition to beat than Joe . Nothing seems to worry 19-year-old Willie Shoemaker less . Says he with a shrug : " If I win at the end of the year , swell . If I do n't , O.K. " <P> Such remarks ( and that was a long speech for Willie ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; off the tracks . Little ( 4 ft. 9 in. , 102 Ibs . ) Willie early learned to handle himself in his own league , at 15 won the 90-lb. boxing and wrestling championships of San Gabriel Valley High Schools . Because of his size , wiry Willie determined to be a jockey , got his first job as an exercise boy on a California ranch three years ago . From the day he brought home his first winner , in April 1949 , Willie has made a habit of being either the leading rider or the leading apprentice at every track he has raced on . <P> Willie has no explanation for his success . But Will Molter , last season 's leading West Coast trainer who uses Willie 's services whenever they are available , explains it with exhaustive fervor : " Willie 's great . He does n't try to knock the spirit out of a horse ; any horse he rides can be raced again in a couple of days-and that 's unusual . Willie 's a great judge of pace . He does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but gets the feel of the horse in the first few strides , then knows instinctively how to race that horse to win . He 's the kind of jock who ' rates ' horses ... He has good hands , and horses instinctively like him-because he 's kind to them , I guess . " <P> By being kind to horses , sad-faced Willie will earn about $75,000 this year . Some 70% of those earnings ( after taxes ) go into a trust fund , to be held there until Willie comes of age . Meanwhile , he is sending his 18-year-old brother to college , supporting his bride of four months in a Los Angeles motel , playing a few rounds of golf ( low gos ) in the mornings , and driving a new Buick . Records were all right , Willie figured , but nothing to lose sleep over .
