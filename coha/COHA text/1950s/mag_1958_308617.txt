NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE : <P> <P> ALL Americans , of whatever party , will wish to honor the unflinching courage both the Nixons displayed in very grave danger . We urge Congress to strike a special medal in their honor . <P> Americans always put politics aside when the nation 's honor is involved . <P> The flag that was dragged in the dirt at Caracas was the flag of all of us . The spittle that struck Nixon and his wife was meant for all of us . And the perils which the Nixons braved were braved for all of us . <P> <P> NEW YORK POST : VICE President Nixon 's Latin American journey has ended in a total debacle for the U.S. No one can question the concern for Nixon 's safety voiced by President Eisenhower . But the flamboyant flight of American troops to the scene will surely be recorded as one of the most monstrous blunders of our ill-fated Latin American diplomacy . The President , whose capacity for indecision has become historic , chose exactly the wrong moment and the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The President acted like the Communist caricature of the Yankee imperialist . As for Nixon , he has greatly diminished sympathy for his behavior by a vulgar attempt to convert this dismal tour into a presidential campaign trip . He had established his valor in Peru ; his insistence on a repeat performance in Venezuela indicates that he was utterly seduced by his press notices , and incapable of recognizing his own limitations . <P> <P> Columnist ELEANOR ROOSEVELT : EVERYONE in this country must have been concerned at the demonstration in Peru against the U.S. and Vice President Nixon , who is our good will ambassador . But it certainly was not wise for the Vice President to go against the advice of the people who knew the area and begged him not to try and keep his appointment at the university . Like all young men . however , he wanted to prove his courage . This is understandable but sometimes leads to unfortunate results . <P> Our policy of giving military aid to foreign nations instead of actually raising the living standards in those countries has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the official regrets and apologies have been received and accepted , the immediate question before us is how it happened that the Nixons were exposed to these outrages . It is manifest that the whole South American tour was misconceived , that it was planned by men who did not know what was the state of mind in the cities the Vice President was to visit . For what has happened should never have been allowed to happen and those who are responsible for the management of our relations with South America must answer to the charge of gross incompetence . We must fix and we must correct the causes that led our officials into this fiasco - into what it would not be exaggeration to call a diplomatic Pearl Harbor . <P> <P> Columnist DAVID LAWRENCE : WHAT a cowardly thing it would be for the United States Government to refuse to go ahead with trip previously announced and to give as the reason that it could n't expect - from friendly governments - protection or security for a visiting delegation ! Not only would the governments of Latin America have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could n't protect the distinguished visitors they themselves had invited .
