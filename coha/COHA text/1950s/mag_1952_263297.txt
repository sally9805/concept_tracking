Radio listeners in Russia can thrill to the sudsy sentiment of soap opera like anyone else . Last week Radio Moscow fed their dreams with a tender play about a collective farm boy and a girl tractor-driver whom fate had chanced to place on the same ( moonlit ) night shift . <P> Girl ( letting her tractor stand idle for a moment ) : How wonderful it is to work on such a beautiful night under the full moon and do one 's utmost to save petrol . <P> Boy ( suddenly lost in her eyes ) : The night inspired me to overfulfill my quota by a higher and still higher percentage . <P> ( In a matter of seconds the two are locked in each other 's arms . ) <P> Boy ( huskily ) : I fell in love with your working achievements from the very first moment .
