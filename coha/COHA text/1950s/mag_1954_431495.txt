I F YOU stroll into the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D. C. , this summer and ask to see the acting head curator of history , or the curator of military and naval history , you will be told that the 35-year-old scholar who holds those titles is engaged in research . But you will not find him among the  | historians delving into the books in the nearby Library of Congress . To consult him , you will need a boat and a diving suit , because he will be strolling among the fish at the bottom of the seas , poking his nose into the wreckage of ships that sank long ago . Dives for History Off the Florida Keys Mendel L. Peterson is a diving historian who has brought back many treasures from previous research trips into the water along the Florida keys . Last summer , amid the wreckage of a Spanish ship that went down in 1738 , he found a small ax of a type used by boarding parties in the warfare between Spanish , British . colonial and pirate ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaped like dumbbells . Fired from a cannon , the bar shot revolved in flight and had a devastating effect on the rigging of a sailing ship . And in timbers of the vessel , there were many pieces of eight . These are silver coins of dollar size that for centuries have figured in pirate tales . There were also chunks of silver ore and two silver fruit forks , probably from the captain 's table . Peterson says the Florida keys are " one of the richest areas in the world " for wrecks . Vessels of the 1700s had tall masts . were therefore top-heavy , and had to be heavily weighted in the hold to remain upright . Sometimes merchant ships clumped their stone ballast on the beach when they took on silver , gold or other cargoes , and this is why today the Gulf of Mexico and the Car- ibbean are ringed with port towns that have cobblestone streets . For 300 years , until about 1820 , Spanish galleons and other vessels took gold , silver and other cargoes from Mexico and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these ships sailed past the long crescent of the Florida keys on the swift Gulf Stream through the Florida Straits into the Atlantic . As the route of the treasure ships grew in importance , so did the Spaniards ' enemies . Warships and privateers invaded the keys ? either to protect the ships or to fight them . In three centuries of treasure shipping , the Spaniards carried gold and silver valued at about eight billion dollars away from the New World . Because of the almost continuous sea warfare , and  | the hurricanes which dashed ships against the reefs and shores , many treasure ships were lost . So . too . were merchantmen and warships and pirate vessels . Only 20 miles wide in places . the Florida Straits were , says Peterson , " a death trap " in a hurricane . To find a sunken wreck , however . is not always easy . One way is to spot it as you cruise among the keys . Fishermen , says Peterson . often look down and see anchors or cannon on the sea floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peterson is likely to sail for it aboard the Sea Dicer , a 68-ton converted shrimp trawler owned by Ed Link , the man who invented the Link flight trainer , and who skippers the treasure-hunting ship himself . The party tries to anchor as directly over the wreck as possible . This is because they use surface-supplied shallowwater diving equipment ( not ( living lungs ) , and they prefer to use only 100 or 150 feet of hose to convey air to a diver . Their complete diving outfits include sneakers for protection against black sea urchins , the " porcupines " of the sea that love wrecks and whose spines inflict injury ; flippers on their feet , for more powerful underwater swimming ; a belt with 30 pounds of lead to keep them down ; trunks ; a jersey or T-shirt that keeps them warm under water ; and a face mask to which the air hose is attached . They find face masks more satisfactory than diving helmets . Crowbars Aid Their Search " With a helmet on , " Peterson says , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in any position . " They sometimes carry crowbars to pry objects from the coral . When they use them to smash sea urchins , white meat comes out and little fish come round and gobble it . Those same fish , two to three inches long , are continually nibbling on Link and Peterson , who feel their bites even less than they feel mosquito bites .  | They seem to be the bravest of all fish , " Peterson says . " Even if you wriggle your fingers at them , they 'll stand their ground and attack . " Octopuses have never bothered them . The biggest one they have seen was 30 inches long from its body to the tip of a tentacle , and weighed only about oneand-one-half pounds . Link and Peterson have seen barracuda , the up-to-five-feetlong " tigers of the sea , " that are more feared than sharks in Florida waters . Peterson has seen small moray eels ? " vicious-looking , " he calls them . And he once saw a big sting ray . " Though water magnifies. this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comments . Rot neither man has ever been attacked by big fish . Peterson and his friends however , take precautions . They always enter the water carefully . No splashes . " Fish may not be aware of it , " he says . " but we feel that we are in danger only when we are breaking the water . " They also avoid wearing anything shiny . It might attract attention . And if they scrape themselves and start to bleed they come up and let the water clear , because blood attracts fishes . Underwater Work Is Tiring " We can stay down , at 40 feet , as much as four hours at a time , though we usually stay only an hour or so , " he says , and points out " you get the bends even from a depth of 40 feet if you remain there seven or eight hours . " Although the water supports you , and you have a feeling of lightness on . the bottom , Peterson explains , you tire more quickly under water . You move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physical exertion , as when carrying SO pounds of cast iron along the bottom , will wear you out rapidly . You can also get tired blasting sand " and coral ? to uncover buried items ? with a jet of salt water pumped through a hose . Buttons off uniforms , weapons , ammunition , ballast , pottery , silver figurinesthese are a few of the things , besides coins , that Peterson finds on his dives .  | He has never found human remains ? probably because they have decayed long since . But once he collects a number of objects from a ship , and identifies it , he can usually learn when it sank . There was , for example , a wreck off Looe Key , about 60 miles above Key West , which yielded such things as clay pipes , cannon balls , jars and bottles of glass , a hammer , lead ( used for ballast on warships ) and cannons . One cannon , when the coral was pounded off , turned out to bear the insigne of the British crown . Peterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down on them . A check of the name Looe at the Admiralty in London uncovered the story of a British frigate , the Looe , that had crashed on the key the night of February 5 , 1744 . A court-martial in England that knew the reputation of the Florida keys acquitted the Looe 's captain of negligence . Doubt That Real Treasure Still Exists Link and Peterson are inclined to doubt their chances of recovering treasure of great value partly because so many men before them have recovered so much , Most wrecks along the keys were in shallow water , they point out . Survivors were the first to attempt salvage ; the Spaniards , they say , had native divers . Next , Indians of the keys , for generations , made a big sideline of recovering loot . Eventually , the Americans took over the business . But even though many wrecks were fished out long ago , there is evidence that the Spanish survivors , the Indians and the early Americans could only go ? as Peterson has up to now ? down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way to dive deeper , starting at about 60 feet .  |
