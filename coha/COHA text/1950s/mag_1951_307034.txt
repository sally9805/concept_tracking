THE ENCLOSURE ( 280 pp. ) - Ethan Ayer - Little , Brown ( $3 ) . <P> " The very rich , " wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in one of his short stories , " are different from you and me . " " Yes , " was the sardonic comment of Ernest Hemingway , " they have more money . " <P> Just how " different " the rich are has long been a fascinating problem for U.S. novelists , but few have been able to do much with it . Like Fitzgerald and Hemingway , most U.S. writers have been too middle class . Ethan Ayer , 31 , the Brooks School , Trinity College , and ( says his dust jacket ) of " a well-known riding and hunting family , " should presumably be able to write about wealth with the fullness of first-hand knowledge . In The Enclosure , a first novel , he has tried hard , but he has not quite turned the trick . <P> Farewell to the Grand Style . The Enclosure is an exclusive suburb obviously set on Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten driveways , houses ranging in style from Jacobean to classical revival , a very private beach , old families not merely rich but entirely accustomed to it-this is the special world about which Ethan Ayer writes . His book is a portfolio of vignettes : the well-bred old snobs , the new , vulgar rich , the wealthy young weaklings and , behind all these , the pompous and romantic servants . <P> Characters wander in &; out of The Enclosure as if it were a transient hotel . Its reigning matriarch , Mrs. Halstead , dies , and with her goes the grand style of life . She had been , as one of the Enclosure stalwarts put it , " the only one around here worth the powder to blow her to hell . " Those who survive are a sad lot : her son Christopher , a bilious minister devoted to the comforts of the flesh ; her grandson Christopher Jr. , a well-read neurotic who fritters himself away in hypochondria ; her neighbor Moylan Stacy , an undertaker new to the Enclosure and representing the crudity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars for the sake of art and , sometimes , for the sake of his puny passions . <P> Enter the Psychiatrist . As these creatures go through the motions of life , the Enclosure gradually changes character . The undertaker 's daughter marries neurotic young Christopher when her true love , a handsome servant boy , is killed . The marriage is a wretched failure . Undertaker Stacy becomes a doddering old invalid , still at odds with the Enclosure . The walls of the Enclosure itself begin to tumble down : one of the best houses , it is rumored , will soon be taken over by a psychiatrist for a rest home . <P> Though he is clearly talented , Novelist Ayer has written a book that is long on artiness and short on life , full of mincing chatter and burdened with too complex a structure . His final approach to his people is as simple and inadequate as a cliche : the rich , he feels , stink . This may or may not be true , but his novel never gets close enough to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever portrait of social decay pretty much ends as a mannered exercise in claustrophobia .
