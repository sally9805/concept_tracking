When Flair magazine came out last winter , it inspired a host of wisecracks and a clutch of New Yorker cartoons about the hole in its cover , the chopped-up pages and accordion inserts that unfold for a foot or more . But Flair 's stories on such things as Americans in Paris , fox hunting , and how the Duchess of Windsor decorates her house failed to Stir up the same interest among readers or advertisers . Publisher Gardner ( Look , Quick ) Cowles and his wife , Flair Editor Fleur Cowles , who had dreamed two months ago of boosting their circulation guarantee from 200,000 to 250,000 , got the realities of the situation as the real figures came in . In October and November , said Cowles , 30% of the magazines sent to newsstands were returned . <P> This week Flair 's 100 staffers got the bad news : with its next ( January ) issue , Flair will fold . Twenty-four of the employees ( including Editor Fleur ) will be absorbed into other Cowles publications ; the rest will be discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowles , was that paper was too expensive and hard to get . And if Flair tried to expand , he said , it might have been hit all the harder by possible paper rationing next year . <P> But journalists ( no doubt including Mike Cowles ) knew the real trouble : in striving valiantly for the unusual , Flair had had too little old-fashioned journalistic flair itself . In the trade the gossip was that Flair had lost upwards of $1,000,000.
