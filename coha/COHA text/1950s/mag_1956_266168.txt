Few Frenchmen wept when they read in their newspapers one October morning in 1944 that Louis Renault had died in a Paris nursing home . He had been rich , powerful and famous , cantankerous , brilliant , often brutal , the little Napoleon of an automaking empire . But France 's only eulogy for him was a grimace and an ugly word : " collaborator . " Last week , in the cooler atmosphere of eleven years later , Louis Renault 's widow sought a court decision to establish that Renault had not died of uremia , but had been " deliberately murdered after torture . " The widow 's story made big headlines , but it did not really startle Frenchmen ; they sensed that it was probably true . <P> The Ogre . With $15,000 and a genius for things mechanical , Louis Renault and two brothers started building racing cars in 1899 in a shop in his mother 's backyard . By 1908 the shop was a 50,000-sq.yd. factory in Billancourt , near Paris . Its 3,000 workers were soon building 5,000 Renault automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vulgar , loud , domineering , impatient , he was a terror to associates , a friend to practically none . To the French working man , Renault became " the ogre of Billancourt . " He instituted piecework , maintained an internal intelligence and security system similar to that of Henry Ford ( whom he knew and admired ) , ordered searches of workers ' clothing in locker rooms , fired any worker caught with union propaganda . <P> By the ' 20s he had princely wealth , a vast palace near the Bois de Boulogne , a handsome wife and a son . He also had mistresses : the first , an opera singer , had refused to marry him ( " As long as I 'm only his mistress , I 'm still free . His authority is incomplete " ) . He despised Automaker Andre Citroen , but enjoyed competing with him , was even a little regretful when Citroen went broke in 1934 trying to build a plant as modern as Renault 's . " It was a dirty trick , showing him my place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without political passion , " wrote Renault one day in 1936 . " Whatever its government or opinion , I have always served my country with the same vigor ... to orient the country toward work . " He visited Hitler in 1938 , returned with a case of Fhrerism . When the Wehrmacht swept across France , Renault was in the U.S. as a member of an Allied purchasing mission . He returned home to put his factories at the service of Vichy and the Nazis , in four years made 34,232 vehicles for the Nazis . When a friend chided him for making money in the process , Renault snapped : " Well , do you want me to lose ? " And he liked to argue that by staying in operation he had saved thousands of workers from being transported to Germany . <P> The Vengeance . Paris had been liberated only two days when underground newspapers were shouting for Louis Renault 's head , and three weeks later he surrendered on condition that he would not be jailed until indicted . He was taken to a prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In four weeks he was dead .
