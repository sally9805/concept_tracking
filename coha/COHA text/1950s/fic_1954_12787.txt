I take the privilege of inviting him on the grounds that you would like to meet such a specimen , chief . He does sing ballad around Green Corner . ROBERT What , is he blind ?

( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time Sir ? ROBERT From his own calculations I have a year to live . I pay the fool three guineas worth of canvas To learn what 's natural , that my heart must stop . That 's what the news is on my cardiograph . COBO What part of you is that , chief ? p. 11 ROBERT It 's a machine for the condition of my heart . It shows everything , except how sick I am of life . CORPORAL Well sir , we all has to go sometime . So Cobo , I gone . COBO ( Yelling ) Sit down , and give the man some consolation . CORPORAL Okay COBO And take off the glasses , you favour a graveyard . CORPORAL Okay ( Martin goes into the bedroom ) COBO You see ? I tell you it was alright .

I calls him the early Duke as he was one of the primest calypsonians of the old brigade , but half of them dead now . COBO He mean half still living , sir . CORPORAL Let we change the talk . So what you playing for carnival , chief ? ROBERT I like your little friend , Henderson . CORPORAL Well , you know sir , if I could fill the cup again , as the Bible say , but if you hear how I abandon the force . You know why I resign from the constabulary ? Through the writ of habeas corpus . COBO Do n't tell the man that , do n't tell the man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpus ? One day you might find it useful , when it come to tangling with the fine points of the law . Habeas , meaning do you have , and corpus , a body ? But in the full legal meaning this signify , not do you have a body , for that all of we have , but do you have a body in your possession , and if so let me see it , which is what one lawyer does ask the court should in case a man be killed . You follow ? COBO Shift the subject , Sir Swallow ? p. 13 ROBERT ( Pouring drinks ) No , let him go on . Habeas corpus . CORPORAL Is habeas corpus that save Cobo life and is habeas corpus that make me abandon the police . ( Pacing ) By habeas corpus then the law imply that if you dead but they ca n't find you , then , in fact , you ai n't dead , as the corpus is the evidence . Well , case ! This same Henderson Josephs here , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might easily be in jail for murder , right ? Case ! ROBERT I 'll get some ice , gentlemen . COBO Liquor could loosen your tongue , friend . CORPORAL Is you ask me to shift the subject . COBO So the first thing you come out with is . . . . ROBERT Murder ? You never told me , Henderson . ( Cobo shrugs ) CORPORAL Sir , he too modest . One time old Cobo here , when he had cash gone to the Savannah and decide to levy all on a horse called Smoke . The fact that that selfsame horse collapse in a puff was n't the case , for old Cobo here bet with a man that it would come last . This man was a well known hanger round the tracks , a short head feller with dark glasses , his manner very English , and a real crook . Well , he would take any kind of bet and Cobo bet Smoke would burn out . But when it come time for the man to pay Cobs , he nowhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as you telling it I going blind with vexation . I hang round that track all week , and be Jesu I see him one evening . I block him by the stands . The man look at me cool and tell me he afraid he do n't recognise me , if I have any evidence we take any bet , and he was not the kind of man who bet on a horse backways . Well , I ai n't even bother argue , I only let him pass , lift up a sizeable stone , drop it on his head , and was pelting out of there , when I knock down the Corporal . . . . p. 14 CORPORAL I ask him where the hell he going , and how he so pale . He says he think he kill a white feller behind the stand . I say , take it easy , maybe he ai n't dead , so we gone round and look behind the bleachers and when we get there , . . . habeas corpus , the body evaporate . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my friends . Cobo was certain he kill the man . He ai n't reappear since then . . . ( The buzzer sounds ) COBO A short , round man with a head as bald as a bubble , Panama hat , and dark glasses , and he lying there , I tell you it was . . . ( The bell buzzes again ) ROBERT Now who in hell is that ? COBO Wait , sir . Is three buzzes for you . ( The bell buzzes again ) ( The Corporal opens the door . A bald man with dark glasses and Panama hat stands at the door ) THEODORE Good evening ! Mr. Martin in ? The name is Doctor Holley . COBO Lord , deliver me , amen . ( He turns ) Mr. Martin , is him sir ! Is the man ! THEODORE ( Brushing past the Corporal ) Good evening , sir . Are you Mr. Martin ? I gather from the papers that this flat is for rent . There 's notice to that effect in the window outside , Flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , sir . I know Mr. Elics to be a pretty punctual landlord , But I do n't expect him to publish my departure , I only mentioned my condition in passing . THEODORE In passing ? Oh , no mistake . You can see for yourself . It 's a rather small notice , It 's even in the paper . I read it on the dock . ROBERT ( Not bothering to look ) Well , we can settle this easily . THEODORE Oh , please do n't trouble him any further , will you ? I 'm worn out with haggling about accommodations , The hotels are crowded to the closets with tourists . May I presume on the privilege of a glass of cold water ? And you , stop staring . Could you ask one of your men to bring my bags ? COBO Is the same man I kill , sir . Lord strike me dead ! Make him show you his head . ROBERT Would you like something stronger ? Some whiskey , perhaps ? Before I throw you all out ? THEODORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . p. 16 COBO Sir , everybody in Trinidad ten years ago know this man . His name is Holley or something so , he 's a fraud man , sir . Low class Englishman always up to some scheme , save yourself , save yourself , sir . He going rob you of every cent you have . THEODORE My dear chap , let me warn you . I have every intention of reviving my murder with the local police . But all in its own time . CORPORAL Sir , shall I make an arrest , immediately ? THEODORE You have some remarkable house-boys , Martin . COBO You forget who it is break your damned head open . ROBERT Gentlemen , I am not well . THEODORE You know Martin , I 've been twenty five years in the tropics And I ca n't tell one coloured face from another . ROBERT I 'm not buying except it 's a new heart . Oh , ticker feeble , eh ? Well , cheer up , lad . Always wished I 'd popped off a little earlier sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spent the insurance rather foolishly . p. 17 COBO Mr. Rob . . . . ROBERT Cobo , you 're drunk , so shut up . You 're damned unreliable . First you murder a man Then you are not sure you do , then ten years after you see What you 're not too certain might be his ghost . THEODORE Dr. Holley is the name sir . Travelling chiropractor , and reputable masseur . Arrived this morning direct from Martinique , Only Caucasian at a conference of astrologers Most of them black , but astute scientists , Have decided to resume practice in England this year . You there , the luggage , please ! CORPORAL ( Startled ) I going , sir . ROBERT Just a minute , Corpie . The squatter 's technique , is it ? THEODORE Well , that 's what made the empire , Gentlemanly invasion . ( Holley sits down . ) ROBERT What are you doing ? COBO Just what you see me doing , circling his head For landmarks like where a brick could make a seam . p. 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years now , Left somewhat precipitately , matter with the clergy , And impatient creditors of one sort or another , Perhaps you could help me refreshen old acquaintance , I promise on my honour as a reprobate Englishman To someone who must be at least sixty percent English , I sha n't stay any longer , but I have a few addresses , Ah yes , here we are , Do you happen to know a Lady Named Clarissa Upshot ? She married a brigadier , Brigadier Upshot ? THEODORE She does social work , oh you know the kind of thing , Arranging performances in leper asylums , Crooning over creches full of native children , I know her well once . ROBERT Yes , I know the character . THEODORE Character has nothing to do with it , She was my first wife , I came home from the office and she was n't there . Ran away with an army widower . COBO I see a mark here for true , yes . ROBERT As a matter of fact , I 'm engaged to her step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . A step daughter ! Well , I 'll meet her soon enough , I understand That the brigadier , I mean Sir John Upshot , is practically On the point of dying , do you know if that 's correct ? ROBERT He was the pillar of colonial society for years , But I suppose he 's grown tired , I heard he 'd collapsed . COBO Sure as Satan , is the same head I open . ROBERT Now , if you 'll excuse me , Dr. Holley . . . THEODORE To be sure , to be sure , Have you any idea how moribund Upshot . . . . ROBERT Mr. Holley , it would hardly interest me , I am preoccupied At the moment myself with the certainty of my death , That 's cause enough to warrant a good night 's sleep . THEODORE I ask this because Mrs. Upshot wrote me in desperation . It seems that the doctors are helpless with the old boy And she thought that perhaps , a touch of my practice . . . ROBERT Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEODORE ( Walking around ) A dash of self-science would bejust the right solution Since she 's tried the best doctor in the island , Reputedly the best heart specialist , a Dr. Voltore ? ROBERT Voltore ? He 's my doctor too . THEODORE Yes , one of those immigrants . Apparently has a magnificent reputation Especially heart disease . A quack , my boy , a quack . ROBERT What ? COBO Hear who talking . CORPORAL ( At the door ) Sir , a young lady here want to talk to she father . ROBERT What young lady , blast it ? ( Andrea enters ) ANDREA Daddy ! I 've been down on the sidewalk shivering , We 've never had so much trouble with anyone before . Good evening , gentlemen , which one is the landlord ? ROBERT Just one second , who is this vertebrate ? THEODORE That 's enough , young man , you 're talking to my daughter . I 'll trouble you gentlemen to remove your hats . Andrea , this is Mr. Martin . p. 21 ANDREA Oh dammit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child . We 're hardly in any position to pick and choose . You 're soaked through with the drizzle . Run in and change . ANDREA I 'll be right out . ( She goes off ) THEODORE You 'll get used to her , son . CORPORAL I think I 'll have a drink . COBO Pour one for me . ROBERT Holley , before I throw you and your chattel out . . . Would you care to make things a trifle clearer ? Just what do you expect to do ? THEODORE I know what you are feeling , You 're suddenly bewildered by the turn of events , To coin a phrase , you think me fraudulent , arrogant , But I am none of those really . I 'm temporarily unhoused , A bit short of cash for a hotel in mid season , But I 'm sure I can be of positive service to you . ROBERT And you live in this manner , by your five wits . How long , may I inquire , do you propose to stay . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may take me some time . I assure you we need not get in each other 's way . Now , if you do n't mind , I 'll just go in and lie down . ROBERT ( Shouting ) Listen here , Holley ! LANDLORD ( Below ) Please if you making noise anymore , I tell you is past too late to be making any more disturbance please ( In a corner Cobo and the Corporal are singing ) ROBERT Listen , tell me something you mentioned before . This Dr. Voltore . How do you know he 's a trickster ? THEODORE My dear boy , he has this habit of changing reports , On heart conditions or other fatal diseases There 're never enough fatal diseases to go round In small communities for a decent practice , So perhaps you 're suffering from a dead man 's heart ? Self-cure is the cure , chappie . Self-knowledge , self-science . But since you want your misery , old hawk-beak prescribed it . Now who 's honest , and who are n't ? Got to get some rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last time , who the devil are you ? THEODORE ( singing ) Of course my real name is n't Holley , It 's just an obvious nom-de-plume , Goes with the Panama and buttoned brolly . ROBERT Oh rahlly ? THEODORE And the poise I have of entering a room , An attitude of unimpending doom . ROBERT One of those jolly types that bursts into song , eh ? COBO ( Singing to Corpie 's guitar ) Well , whatever your name is , do n't pretend You ai n't going pay me money in the end . I tired of impecuniosity , You slack-face , fast-talking curiosity , Just pay me the cash which you has for me ! THEODORE ( Sings ) I hope I have n't lost my natural graces Of being an Englishman , wherever I may roam , Though I 'm cast down among such savage faces , I 'll act as if I simply were at home , at home , I 'll simply act as if I were at home . p. 24 ROBERT ( Spoken ) And you damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here like you own the place , You send downstaires for ten suitcase , You daughter inside there washin she face , You ai n't ask nobody what is the case , For an Englishman , or even a member of the human race , I consider you nothing but a damned diagrace . ROBERT ( Shouting ) Cut it out will you ? You 're not in the tents ! O my God ! I 'm dying of strangers . ( Andrea comes out ) ANDREA Now , for he ven 's sake , what 's gotten into him ? CORPORAL What 's the matter , chief , you alright ? ROBERT ( Weakly ) Pills , my pills , pass me my pills COBO Pills , right away , chief . ( He fetches them ) ANDREA Daddy , what 's wrong ? Did n't you explain to him ? THEODORE I think the gentleman is slightly annoyed , dear . p. 25 ANDREA Is something annoying you , Muster Martin ? ROBERT Me ? Oh no , no . Go on , I wo n't spoil anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does seem peevish . Now there 's no reason to hebave in this fashion . It is n't every day this sort of thing happens . I 'm sure life has been pretty dull before this . How many times have strangers unexpectedly Solved your loneliness ? Get up from the sofa . What 's he taking medicine for ? COBO The man close to death , mistress . ANDREA Well , so are we all . No need to fuss over it . ROBERT My dear Miss Holley , perhaps you do n't follow . When I 'm involved in creating I do n't like interruption . I came here directly from Doctor Voltore , In the expection th t I 'd get some rest . Instead I find two gentlemen guzzling my liquour , A fraud whose face I 've never seen before Comes into my place with odd bits of baggage , Have n't I a right to be somewhat upset ? THEODORE Do n't provoke her , son , she 's in a terrible temper . And when she gets vexed , she bursts into tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't expect him to . He 's too conceited . ROBERT Miss you do n't like it here ? ANDREA I would n't stay a second , if we did n't have to . But do n't expect us to go out in this rain . THEODORE I 've perfectly sound credit , I. . . ROBERT Do n't give me that rigmarole , either of you . You 're broke , are n't you ? You have n't got a cent . ANDREA Well there 's no need to trample us because we 're poor . You 're a snob as well . And when I came into this room , I said to my heart , what a modest young man . Why , I was almost prepared to let you fall in love with me . ROBERT Without consulting me of course ? Listen young woman , Let 's not evade the issue of cash and receipts By falsifying this predicament with love . I know a trickster when I see one . ANDREA Alright then father , that crowns it , Show him ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you p. 27 THEODORE Are you quite certain you want me to , dear ? You know what happened last time you changed your mind . ANDREA Oh I 'm perjectly certain , he 's so damned invincible . ROBERT What 's supposed to happen ? Are you going to tour the room Perched on a broomstick ? THEODORE I do n't think we should dear . ( Withdrawing a packa e of sulphur ) ANDREA Oh yes , teach him a lesson . Sulphur ! THEODORE Well , he may have a weak stomach , And he may act quite differently to what he appears . Such decent types can go berserk you know ? ROBERT Listen , cut out this mystery and yet out of here . I 'm not going to harbour two wayside magicians . ANDREA Oh , let him have it . THEODORE Do me a favour . Just stare at my daughter . Andrea , for safety 's sake , get behind some furniture . ANDREA The works . p. 28 THEODORE ( Scattering sulphur powder ) Bon Dieu , jetez l'amour en choeur couillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dambella , naboya ! ANDREA Nothing happened . Oh daddy , you told me it could work If I ever wanted . Now . . . ( She leaps back as Martin rushes her ) ROBERT Love , love . Your eyes , your hair , your , your . . . ANDREA Help , Daddy ! Somebody restrain him ! ( Martin pursues her ) COBO Chief , chief , lie down , you ai n't got the strength . THEODORE My God in heaven , I 've used the wrong potion . Pin him down there , steady ! Corporal , arrest him ! ROBERT No bonds can hold me ! Who can restrain love ? I 've lived too long by denying the body , While primitive lusts were lurking within me , Withering my affections . I 'll change , I 'll change . ( Stops suddenly ) COBO What happen , chief ? p. 29 ROBERT Jesu , do you know how I feel ? CORPORAL You look sick , boss . You best call the doctor ! THEODORE It did n't hurt you , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits out of my daughter . I ca n't understand it , I followed the prescription . CORPORAL Excuse me a minute chief , you mean to say this red flour here , Suppose to possess miraculous qualities ? THEODORE Well , I 've seen it work myself . If it did n't , it 's my fault . CORPORAL Well , just what it supposed to do ? THEODORE Grant you reciprocal love . You scatter if subtly on the object you desire , and the effect is successful , but you have to move fast . But , it did n't seem to work . You 're welcome to it . ( Hands powder bag to Corporal ) CORPORAL Well , the Corporal in business . COBO I hope you could support all the children it give you . ROBERT Good God , why do these things happen to me , First you and then Voltore .

THEODORE Oh , you know it dear , the one that failed At the last three boarding houses . The RENT SONG . THEODORE ( Sings ) I notice people have a certain phobia About a Britisher 's efficiency In practising the ancient art of obeah , And more so , when the obeah-man is me . That should be I , but . . . I was a clerk , now I 'm in chiropractice , Both priests and doctors profit from your sins , I may appear a quack , but still the fact is , I know where medicine ends and faith begins . Usually I never get pass that verse . Well ! The map of man still needs more exploration , He 's a dark continent of fears and and doubt , I am the Livingstone of this black generation , And know the art of driving terrors out .

CORPORAL Who you does invoke when you want crapaud to smoke your worst enemy pipe . It ai n't I believe that , as I is an absentee Anglican , but since you so bold . Who is the god of vengence ? Tell him Cobs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a note of that . Thank you Corporal . CORPORAL That ai n't nothing . Is my grandmother who teach me . THEODORE Corporal , I 've never used my powers for evil purpose . Very well , you do n't believe in the potency of the sulphur , Scatter it blindly , and see what will happen , I could make a ballad of it , but I wo n't bother . I only grant people whatever they wish strongest , And believe me thereare some people on whom the powder Could n't take effect , because they do n't want it . They prefer other things , well that is their choice . Some people prefer making money to making love , All that would do is increase their passion . That 's why the powder had such a sorry effect On young Mister Martin . He 's s morbid subject , With a misanthropic turn , who does n't need love , After all , do n't expect any miracles from me , Unless you 're perfectly willing to be part of them . It 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You pass me , reverend . I ai n't following you . p. 34 THEODORE What I mean is , if there exists the root of affection In the heart of the subject , the sulphur nurtures it Into full flower . On the other hand , it can wither The heart of the subject . You 're welcome to try it . CORPORAL Cobo . . . COBO Boy , do n't t'row no powder on me , nuh ! ANDREA Daddy , Mister Martin is staring into nothingness . THEODORE He He 's fighting his better nature , just give him time . Mister Martin ? Can you hear me ? CORPORAL May be he dead sitting up . COBO Jesus , you must be turn him into a zombie . ROBERT ( Rising in trance ) Excuse me , I must get to the bathroom . ( Exit ) ANDREA Daddy . . . . THEODORE Leave him alone , dear . It 's a natural reaction . Is there a phone there ? Maybe he 's just faking ? How do we know he is n't phonin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police have an interest in you ? ( A scream from withinWhat is that ? THEODORE I 'm outnumbered by skeptics , what 's the matter with you people ? You think I 'm insane , eh ? What 's happening to this country , Where 's the faith that you had in the devil and miracles ? Good Heavens , just now God would be unfashionable . I 'll tell you something , when her mother died , We were just about to stumble on the secret of life , Then she swallowed something . It was the wrong fornula , But she nearly made it ! That 's what I call trust . But people do n't believe in a thing nowadays . You know what her last words were to me , sir ? Do n't give up Theodore . Do n't let facts get you down . Yes , women are prepared to go to such lenghts . COBO So is for that you leave the country ? Man , you 's a menace . THEODORE All over the world the same decentralization , The individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inches of the noble eccentric , Gas-stations like chapels , and the chapels empty , Prostitution of identity for the tourist industry , Till we 're going through a process of annihilation That 's so subtle we ca n't distinguish ourselves . I mean twelve , eighteen years ago , before you were born , Believe me Andrea , these islands had a juture , Their roots were in something simple , and vital , Primitive , if you want , what was easy for the obeah-man Was easy for the priest . A man could be prepared To wage his own battle against materialism , But I 'm afraid there 's no corner of the world , untouched , And all the cities will wear the same blank faces . May I die , before that happens . p. 36 CORPORAL Is true , chief , is true , The standard of everything going down these days . For instance you take the old time calypso . Now when Cobo and me here was in the real times , When they had that time , Atilla , the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ANDREA ( At door ) Mister Martin , can you hear me ? Daddy what 's wrong ? I ca n't hear a thing going on through that door . THEODORE Well open it and see . You see my point , Corporal ? CORPORAL Miss , just give me the word and I charging the door ! ROBERT ( Opens the door , wearing a raincoat , and a suitcase in his hand ) Inasmuch as I 'm a wet blanket , by common consent , Inasmuch as I 've been given six months to live , A theory I have no intention of proving By undue exertion , and inasmuch as if I stay longer , I shall burst several vessels , earthware or blood , I 've decided it 's best to let things take their course , For blessed is the man who comes home to die , And finds there 's a fete going on in his house . And the more I attempt an affection for mankind , The more he provokes me to live by myself . p. 37 THEODORE Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tonight . COBO Chief , you going dead if you go out in the rain ? CORPORAL Where you going sleep , boss ? The savannah soaking . ROBERT I. . . ANDREA Wo n't you sleep here with us ? THEODORE Andrea ! What ? ROBERT Miss Holley , I 'm not used to the company of witches . THEODORE Now , just a minute . . . ROBERT Here 's a few instructions . The couch is quite comfortable , who ever sleeps there , But be careful of occasional thumbtacks and pins , You know where the liquor is I believe , Henderson , Next time ask more of your friends , I 'll put myself out To see there 's enogh noise and drink to amuse them . Corporal . I suggest you re-enlist in the police To refreshen your mind about respecting property , As for you , Doctor Holley , you seem quite capable Of floundering in clinches , make my home your castle .

I 'll call before I drop by , there 's a phone downstairs . What 's the pass word ? Moko ? ANDREA Come as early as you like ( Exit Martin ) COBO Goodnight , Mister Martin , take care of yourself . ( Elias enters , an accordion in his hand ) MR . ELIAS Oh , is a party , such a lot of people . Is Carnival season , And I hear singing and dancing , I bring the accordion Is somebody wanting to play some music perhaps ?

THEODORE What could a country be without its thinkers ? Who is content to lead a weary life ? Thank God , I say , for charlatans and drinkers , Thank heaven even , for a second wife . Give people what they need is what I 'm saying , And in that way the world will be content , And do n't be dumb if they insist on paying , The truth is one thing people most resent . . . .

We have something more important than filthy lucre . ANDREA Yes , we have ( Opening her arms behind his back ) . . . Light . . and Power . THEODORE ( Turning to her ) I suppose that sometimes I 'm an object for your pity . Now that you 're grown up , I suppose you want other things .

ROBERT Well , if you remember , I left here pretty angry and walked through the rain , A suicidal business for my present condition . I found myself walking round and round the block looking up at my own window , hoping that maybe you would have lighted a candle or some such thing . I stayed under a balcony , dressed in a raincoat like one of those characters in a second-rate movie , watching your shadow against the orange square . Then I started sneezing and I had to get to bed . But , I feel fine this morning . Positively fine . I had a slight fever , and in a state of delirium I apparently kept on murmuring your name . I have n't felt like this since I last had malaria . I 've decided to live for you and for Art . p. 49 ANDREA Murmuring my name , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet . At a poet 's house . ANDREA Real mysognist , are n't you ? ROBERT But I 've come back . Changed . I walked around the Savannah one and a half times Before I plucked up courage , rehearsing what to say .

ANDREA ( Facing him angrily ) Well , my father does , and let me tell you about him . He 's a failure at everything but enjoying every second of breath he draws , and that 's the only religion I 've ever learnt from him , you miserable , myopic , morose , old man . Cause it 's you that 's the old man with your whining about death and the sorry , sarcastic pictures you paint against life . So do n't you sit there smugly and laugh at his pictures . He 's an artist at living ! ROBERT Has n't he got a drawing of the end of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not one of destruction , it 's all angels and lions , the colour of honey , and green places , and all the races of the world singing together , not the sort of bloody muck a chap like you would paint .

And are you satisfied with your life , Dragged from island to island , hounded by creditors , Using bohbol and guile to get sucker 's evictions ? ANDREA Eviction ? Why waste time talking to a fool that 's going to die ? ROBERT Yes , dammit , eviction , that 's what you both did . I did n't come here to quarrel , but I can hardly talk Before you and I start yelling insults at each other .

Since my mother 's death , I alone have looked after him , When he wishes to relieve me of my filial duties , I shall be prepared to consider the possibility . Now I 'm going to fetch the tea ! Want a cup ? ( Wheels off ) THEODORE Hurry up , dear , let 's see if these things work . You 're in the way there , Robert , why not rest on the couch ? Come , come dear , bustle , bustle .

Listen to some facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British West Indies , At least thirty percent believe in the supernatural , And another thirty percent sway in either direction . There are seasonal rites celebrating these beliefs , Shango , Kele , Vodun , even Carnival is Pagan , I have had ministers of government come to my office To predict their elections , to cure bunions and goitres , I charge a reasonable fee . If their ailments fail , I am a better scapegoat for blame than bad luck or the Church . Or Blaming the Almighty . What work the Church refuses , Like afflicting enemies with boils and desires I humbly accept . The Church ca n't do everything . You elect someone to government , knowing full well That he ca n't keep his promises , yet when you elect him You both believe them . Is the politician a fraud ? The public a fraud ?
