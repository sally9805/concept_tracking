Two days after Abraham Lincoln 's assassination , a customer in a Detroit sa loon pointed at a slender , mustached young stranger and shouted : " That 's John Wilkes Booth ! " The stranger promptly drew a revolver , clouted the first man at hand and drove his boot into the belly of another . Then he backed out the door and dashed to the ferry . By putting his revolver to the ferry captain 's head , he persuaded him to get started at once . Once on the Canadian side , he apologized for the " inconvenience , " gave the captain $5 and walked off . <P> The revolver-toting stranger was not John Wilkes Booth , but a look-alike named Thomas Mines . Like Booth , he had a price on his head , but the resemblance ended there . Hines was a former Confederate cavalryman from Kentucky who had made a reputation with Morgan 's Raiders . Cool , intelligent and apparently without fear , he had been assigned to espionage work by the Confederacy 's Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Captain Hines was the mastermind of a gigantic plot to defeat the North from within . Hines 's chief weapon : a vast , fifth-column army of Copperheads whose leaders Hines was to inspire and direct . That the plot did not work , says Horan , was no fault of Hines . <P> Fire &; Rebellion . Author Horan is , a somewhat heavy-handed writer whose researches almost always lead him to fascinating material . Previous books ( on Jesse James , the Pinkerton detective agency ) dealt with surefire subjects ; but Tom Hines remains a shadowy figure right to the end of Confederate Agent . Nonetheless , it becomes apparent that he must have been a devil of a fellow , always hunted , sometimes caught , never held for keeps . He was only 23 when the Confederate government sent him to Canada with apparently unlimited funds . There he met with the top U.S. Copperheads , formed a " squadron " of Confederate saboteurs , and went to work . If he was really responsible for what happened after that , as Author Horan suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Civil War history . <P> From across the Canadian border a Confederate band rode into St. Albans , Vt. , robbed the bank and made its president swear " loyalty " to the Confederacy . In St. Louis , Federal boats were burned at the levee . In New York City , 15 hotels and Barnum 's Museum were set afire in a vain effort to burn the whole city to the ground . In Louisville there was an unsuccessful attempt to kidnap Vice Presidentelect Andrew Johnson , and in Chicago , Hines himself arrived to direct " an armed rebellion of thousands of Copperheads . " What happened there was to happen many times to Hines in his efforts to start rebellions in Illinois . Ohio and Indiana : the news leaked out . Federal troops arrived , and the leaders got cold feet . <P> Law &; Justice . During that year , Hines seemed to be everywhere at once , even stepped back to his native Kentucky to marry his childhood sweetheart , Nancy . But with Grant and Sherman battering the rebels in the field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sent for his wife , began to study law in Canada while he waited until it was safe to go home . Later , in Bowling Green , he hung out his shingle and did so well that in 1875 he became chief justice of Kentucky 's Court of Appeals . Hines died in 1898 , Author Horan says , of a broken heart . His Nancy had died three weeks before .
