Giuseppe Verdi called the opera his " best beloved child , " but audiences have consistently agreed with George Bernard Shaw , who sneered that Verdi tried to turn Shakespeare 's tragedy into another Trovatore . Last week , when Manhattan 's Metropolitan staged Macbeth for the first time in its 76-year history , the opera kept moving from the sublime toward the ridiculous . The score contains much hauntingly beautiful music , * prefiguring the emotional insights of Otello , but it is also marred by trivia , such as a kind of witches ' cancan in the first scene . The libretto ( by Verdi , put into verse by Francesco Piave ) dimly reflects some of the original 's greatness , but it is far behind Librettist Arrigo Boito 's Otello and Falstaff , and is essentially a choppy , ill-balanced synopsis . The Met 's production , while brilliant in most respects , was faulted by some ludicrous details and a kind of Teutonic touch that is alien both to Verdi 's Italian music and to Shakespeare 's Scottish setting . <P> German Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera , superbly handled his cast and particularly the Met 's often heavy-footed chorus , achieved some stunning , stylized patterns reminiscent of Bayreuth . Highly effective were the glowingly expressionistic sets by German Designer Caspar Neher , but his costumes were merely foolish : mauve , mustard , rose and lavender , suitable for a Todd A-O musical version of the Wars of the Roses . If Designer Neher tried to follow the romantic music by being deliberately unrealistic , he spoiled his effect with just enough realistic touches , as when platoons of soldiers in what looked like pink pajamas appeared alongside authentically ragged refugees . <P> The part of Lady Macbeth , which was to have been sung by Maria Callas before Rudolf Bing fired her ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) , went to radiant Viennese Soprano Leonie Rysanek , who in her Met debut showed off an unusually pure and beautifully rounded voice and considerable acting talent . Her only fault was that she scarcely fitted Verdi 's bill ( " I would have Lady Macbeth ugly and wicked ... her voice should be that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soprano Rysanek seemed more like an ambitious Org Man 's tender helpmate than a driven woman goading her weak husband to murder . But in the sleepwalking scene she rendered Verdi 's compassionate music with memorable grace . As Macbeth , Baritone Leonard Warren walked through his part woodenly but sang as well as ever , while as Macduff , Tenor Carlo Bergonzi delivered one of the evening 's real stunners . <P> All in all , as British Critic Francis Toye wrote of Macbeth , it is " a splendid and uncommonly interesting failure " - very much worth reviving and seeing . <P> <P> * Verdi first wrote Macbeth when he was 33 , but 18 years later ( 1865 ) revised it , adding some of its best music .
