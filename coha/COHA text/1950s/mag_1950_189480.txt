In the U.S. Constitution , the founding fathers summed up Harry Truman 's job in four brief paragraphs and summed it up well . But time made its own additions . By accident , default , assumption of powers and slow accretion , the presidency had become a lot more . <P> Last week Harry Truman , by right of office , was the presiding panjandrum at the nation 's annual rite of spring , the Washington Senators ' opening ball game . Showing off his ambidexterity , he looped out one ball with his right and another with his left hand and the game was on . He had predicted beforehand that the Senators would beat the Philadelphia Athletics , 5-3 , sat with Bess and Margaret - drinking soda pop and munching popcorn-until they did win , 8-7 . <P> Greater . Only the day before , at the White House , Harry Truman had been the diplomatically correct Chief of State , cordially receiving the new credentials of India 's distinguished ambassador , Madame Pandit . And by midweek he was the bountiful Great White Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten-year , $88 million relief program for poverty-ridden Navajos and Hopis . <P> Then , without even a change of business suit , the President became the harassed top executive of the world 's largest business , on a hunt for new talent at low salaries . To help ferret it out , he set up a high-powered special committee to list qualified prospects for some 200 key Government vacancies each year . When Democratic National Chairman Bill Boyle popped in , Harry Truman-as head chieftain of his party , a position not even dreamed of by the founding fathers-talked over the 65 speeches he would make on his ten-day " nonpolitical " tour beginning May 7 . He rounded out the day as the unofficial symbol of U.S. conscience , bought the first buddy poppy from little Nancy Jo Nolan . <P> Inspector . As he rose before the American Society of Newspaper Editors at lunch next day in Washington 's Statler Hotel , he was the spokesman for the free world . " Our task , " said he , " is to present the truth to the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . We must make ourselves known as we really are-not as Communist propaganda pictures us . . . " <P> Harry Truman , ex-artilleryman and now Commander in Chief of the Army , Navy and Air Force , flew down a day later to inspect the 3rd Infantry at Fort Benning , Ga . ( where he fired a 105-mm. howitzer battery ) . Then he went on to watch Air Force bombing and rocket firing at Florida 's Eglin Air Force Base . <P> He begged off lunch with the airmen on the excuse that he had to go flying again-back to Blair House . The President was also a family man , and he had a date to keep with the First Lady .
