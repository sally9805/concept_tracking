The people of tiny Laos received in 1957 some $48 million in U.S. aid-about $9,000,000 more than the U.S. Government disbursed to the three states of Nevada , New Hampshire and Vermont together . For a time last year , it looked seriously as though the Communists were going to get it all . <P> Rickety Structure . The Reds were everywhere . Two potent Communist powers , Red China and North Viet Nam , pressed against Laos ' borders . Native Communists , led by Prince Souphanouvong , a member of the royal family , controlled the provinces of Samneua and Phongsaly . The two provinces were regained , but at a price : two Cabinet posts for the Communists and the incorporation of two Communist battalions in the small royal Laotian army . As a legal party , the Reds and their allies made further gains in the May elections , emerged with 21 of 59 seats in the National Assembly . Governmental graft , corruption and inefficiency were doing much of the Reds ' work for them . In November , Communist North Viet Nam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it of border violations , then occupied a stretch of Laotian territory with 3,000 troops . <P> The capital city of Vientiane rang with rumors of a military coup ; the Communists under Prince Souphanouvong called for a meeting of the National Assembly , hoping to capitalize on the growing chaos . But Premier Phoui ( pronounced Pwee ) Sananikone , 55 ( TIME , Sept. 1 ) , a muscular and quick-witted six-footer , was ready for them . Last August he had formed a government shorn of the two Communist ministers . He instituted a currency reform that allowed the Laotian kip to find its normal level of 80 to the dollar , and he brought a halt to the scandalous abuse of U.S. aid . <P> Political Drift . Last week Premier Phoui gave the Communists the Assembly meeting they had been clamoring for . He strode to the podium in the yellow-walled National Assembly building , denounced the " subversive elements " in the country and derided the tactics of North Viet Nam which , " while accusing us , provokes us . " Insisting that Laos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the free world . ' ' Phoui boldly asked the National Assembly to vote itself out of existence . Like many another Asian leader in recent months . Phoui was demanding the right to rule alone for a full year to arrest the nation 's political drift and shore up its economy . <P> Clearly taken by surprise , Prince Souphanouvong was able to muster only 16 of the 47 Assemblymen present to oppose the Premier . Armed with his new mandate , Phoui Sananikone promised Laotians a new constitution , pledged that the royal government would build dams and roads , improve communications , seek foreign investments . He would rule , said the Premier , through the " two essential motors " of an independent state : the army and the civil service . <P> Prince Souphanouvong cried that Phoui 's taking of power was " illegal , " and some panicky Communist leaders lit out for the protection of North Viet Nam . Souphanouvong could not even count on the two Communist battalions that had been incorporated into the royal army , presumably with the intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interned in separate camps , each under the custody of a heavily armed and loyal battalion of the royal Laotian army .
