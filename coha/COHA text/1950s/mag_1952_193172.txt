Viva Zapafa ! ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a delayed cinematic footnote to MGM 's slambang Viva Villa ( 1934 ) , in which Wallace Beery sweatily portrayed Mexico 's bandit patriot . Villa 's revolutionary ally to the south in the bloody 1911-19 uprisings was fiery Emiliano Zapata , nicknamed " the Tiger . " <P> Viva Zapata ! makes the Tiger out to be a pretty tame cat . According to history , Zapata was not only a great folk hero and agrarian emancipator , but also a cruel , cunning Guerrero Indian whose notorious Death Legion made human torches of the enemy and staked living men to anthills . <P> The picture shows Zapata ( Marlon Brando ) as a somewhat crude but noble fellow with a nice regard for the social amenities . He is also characterized as a thinker and talker , as well as a brawler . According to the movie , he is a sort of middle-of-the-road democrat who repudiates both dictators and rabid revolutionists . When the real-life Zapata was n't busy killing his enemies , he found time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of whom he wed legally . The film Tiger is permitted only one beauteous seorita ( Jean Peters ) . <P> When John Steinbeck 's screenplay is not dishing up primer politics and flabby moralizing ( the unlettered bandit is made to mouth such sentiments as : " I do n't want to be the conscience of the world " ) , Viva Zapata ! is good , muscular horse opera . Director Elia Kazan has filled it with vigorous action-horsemen charging , ammunition trains being dynamited and peons fighting . Striking sequence : President Francisco Madero being shot down by the military in the glare of automobile headlights while a siren drowns out his cries . <P> The cast includes such acceptable Latin types as Anthony Quinn and Margo , and such less acceptable Latin types as Jean Peters . In the title role , Marlon Brando , wearing a spitcurl hairdo , drooping mustachios and cartwheel sombrero , slouches and mumbles his way through the excitement in a deadpan Brando voice . <P> The Las Vegas Story ( RKO Radio must have been easy for Jane Russell because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time , Jane arrives in Las Vegas as the discontented wife of Vincent Price , a near-bankrupt broker who hopes to remake his fortune at the dice tables . To Jane , the visit is one long remembrance of things past , for it was in Las Vegas that she loved and left Victor Mature , a local policeman . In their big confrontation scene , Jane delicately dilates her nostrils and Victor clenches his jaw so hard that his ears wiggle , thus making it clear to the dullest moviegoer that this is an incendiary passion . <P> Behind these two protagonists lies a shadowy plot dealing with a diamond necklace ( for which Cartier , Inc. gets a screen credit ) , a murder , and the inevitable chase sequence : villainous Brad Dexter , absconding in a stolen car with both Jane Russell and the jewels , as pursued and overtaken by Mature in a helicopter . Besides petulantly tossing her head at both Mature and Vincent Price , Jane sings three songs by Hoagy Carmichael , and is thoroughly photographed in bed , in a glass-walled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep-plunging evening dresses .
