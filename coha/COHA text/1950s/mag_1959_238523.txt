Pal Kosa seemed a model young Communist . He lived and worked in Ujpest , an industrial suburb of Budapest , was a member of the workers ' committee and a party leader . But when the Russian tank columns moved to crush the revolution of October 1956 , Pal Kosa opposed them . He led a crowd of fellow workers in overthrowing the Soviet war memorial in Ujpest , helped keep resistance going in his suburb long after the fighting had ceased throughout most of the country . On Nov. 12 , Pal Kosa was captured by the vengeful puppet government of Janos Kadar . <P> Early this month Pal Kosa and seven others were lined against a wall in Budapest 's Fo Utca prison and shot dead by a firing squad . At the secret trial of Pal Kosa and his friends , 182 witnesses were called for the prosecution , none for the defense . Some Ujpest Communists offered to testify for the defendants but were refused a hearing by Hungary 's hanging judge , Janos Borbaly . Not a word about the trial or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Manchester Guardian 's Victor Zorza , a Polish exile with excellent contacts behind the Iron Curtain . Why such secrecy , asks Zorza , why this great fear of obscure Pal Kosa even when dead and buried in an unmarked grave ? " Could it be because to many in Hungary he is a national hero ?
