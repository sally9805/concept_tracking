Governor Herman Talmadge 's press conference last week was merely routine - until some one asked the big question : What will Georgia do if the U.S. Supreme Court outlaws segregation in the schools ? At that , the governor began to fume . Georgia , said he , might well turn " the public schools over to a private system . It is the only thing we can do ... If we do n't do this . I have not got enough national guardsmen and the Federal Government enough troops to prevent strife . Blood will flow in rivers . " <P> Governor Talmadge is not the only Southerner to hold such views . There are now five cases before the Supreme Court on which the court may finally decide whether separate but equal schools for Negroes are constitutional . If the court says they are not , thus ending segregation , the South will face one of the greatest social readjustments since Reconstruction . But last week , in communities and on campuses all over the U.S .. there was ample evidence to prove one thing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The change got its first major boost in 1938 , when Negro Lloyd Gaines , backed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , won a Supreme Court decision forcing the University of Missouri to admit him to its law school on the ground that he could not find equal facilities anywhere else in the state . Since then . Negroes have found themselves on scores of once forbidden campuses . In almost every case , their experiences have fallen into a sort of pattern . There have been dire predictions of trouble and periods of tension . But the trouble has rarely materialized , and the tension has soon melted away . <P> George Washington Jr . of Dallas was among the first group of Negroes to enter the University of Texas law school as a result of the Sweatt Case+ At first , says Washington , the atmosphere was " icy and uncomfortable . " and one night a K.K.K.-type cross was set ablaze in front of the law building . But next morning , as he walked to class , groups of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Washington had only one unpleasant experience-the time when a fellow student used the word nigger in class . Washington felt that the student had acted only out of habit , but , says he , " there were a few liberals in the room who I knew would resent it if I showed no offense . So I turned around and looked at the fellow with as stern a look as I could muster . " Washington never heard " that word " again . <P> When ex-Schoolteacher George McLaurin entered the University of Oklahoma law school , he was subjected to a number of indignities . He was forced to sit alone outside his classrooms ; there was a special place for him in the library , a special table in the cafeteria , a special toilet he was supposed to use . But since then , other Negroes have gone to Oklahoma , and all such clumsy attempts at segregation have gradually disappeared . Says O.U . ' s Vice President Roscoe Gate : " This success has depended largely on the student body . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
