Pan American 's southbound Stratocruiser , just off from Rio en route to Montevideo , had reached 12,000 feet . In the morning sunlight , the clouds sparkled brilliantly . One of the 28 passengers , U.S.-born Mrs. Marie Westbrook Capellaro , wife of a Roman banker , pressed her camera against a window , eagerly taking pictures . Suddenly the cabin door popped open and the plane yawed . When Mrs. Capellaro 's husband turned to look at his wife , she was gone-sucked from the pressurized cabin through the open hatch and , after a fall of approximately one minute and 25 seconds , dropped without a trace into the ocean .
