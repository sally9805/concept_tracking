txt // are tiny round faces in the wagon , peering from behind blankets and missing nothing . There are deeply grooved faces of old parchment , and square , young amiable faces . There are straight and dignified leaders of dance groups , completely absorbed in the symbolism of their yei-bei-chei medicine , followed by pudgy young bucks trying unsuccessfully to concentrate on yei-bei-chei . And there are the mischievous little Zuni " black crows , " who cavort down the street unrestrained , looking happy enough to pinch each other , but who never seem to do anything so crude . After the parade you will barely have time to snatch something to eat before the afternoon rodeo . If you know nothing about rodeos , this is a good place to begin , for the announcer chants chummily over the speaker system about the technique of steer-riding , or about the next calf-roping team who are from the Blue Water tribe , who live in the bottom of the Grand Canyon . And he almost apologizes for the bulldogging event , explaining that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right mind would try such a trick . You may see more expert roping in other places , but nowhere , except at an Indian rodeo and race track , will you see such cute and worried little tenyear-old jockeys warming up with their leather-faced trainers , no such bashful , black-eyed winners of thirty-six-dollar purses . The ceremonial dances in the evening are the emotional highlight for the Indians , and the picturesque highlight for the white visitor . The arena in front of the grandstand ? but seemingly worlds away from it ? is apparently illuminated only by three huge cedar council fires . In the shadowy background stand a few of the little covered wagons that have brought the Indians from their homes . And around the ceremonial circle stand several thousand Indians who , as the hypnotism of the dancing grips them , sing out , or shout , or wail with the dancers . They pay little or no attention to the voice of the governor of Arizona as he explains in a strange and difficult language over the loudspeaker the meaning of the dances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war dancers and drummers , or comments on the dignified sincerity of rendition of another // group . He will ask you to close your eyes and feel the stark , primeval wail of the Navaho 's yei-bei-chei , part of a very strongmedicine nine-day healing ceremony . Then he will be telling the story of why little Zuni children , blackened and feathered like crows , are lovingly allowed to scamper off with quantities of corn and watermelon . And still the program turns from facet to facet : a soloist who invokes the Sun Father in a key and scale and rhythm like nothing you have ever heard , yet who sets your heart to thumping with the universal reaching of the human heart ; the stately water maidens , in thanksgiving for the cool water they carry on their heads ; and of course , the cerise feather bustles and pulsebeating rhythm of the war dance . It is all such a vivid piece out of another world that even the next morning , in broad daylight , you may view with a less startled mind than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around such a place . The idea , for instance , that the Indian , being a patient person , still hopes to finish Americanizing the white man . I first bumped into that reversal in the 1952 Pow-Wow magazine . The article was written by one Felix Cohen , a New York lawyer , and originally published in the American Scholar , which is just the kind of magazine you would expect to be the organ of national Phi Beta Kappa . Those who know the Hopi seem to find it quite natural that a copy of the American Scholar should find its way into a Hopi home . And those who know Platt Cline find it equally natural that he should find it there and put it into the Pow-Wow magazine . Mr. Cline is a lean and obliging person who edits the Arizona Daily Sun . He will tell you with reverence and affection in his voice that the Hopi tribe are " a wonderful people , " that they are " much more civilized than we , " and " so sophisticated . " He uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forced by problems into unsound action , because they have such a sound understanding of life . They consider us , for instance , children , quite lacking in creative thinking , when we can work out nothing more suitable to do with a miscreant than // toss him into a jail . The Hopi , he will tell you , have a minimum of government , no " laws " as such , no jails . There is no one who can tell a Hopi what to do . He does n't need telling ; he knows , because his heart and his head were both educated while he was a child . If you ask Mr. Cline what the Hopi do with their members who get drunk , he will look at you sadly and ask , " Why should a Hopi drink the bahanga 's crazy water ' ? He is a well-integrated person who does not need to run away from life . They look on their very rare drinkers ( and on our not so rare ones ) as people who are seriously ill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , what sense is there in drinking ? " I came back from wrestling with that one to hear Mr. Cline saying , " It 's as I said ; the Hopi hands out to no one the inherent right to tell him what to do . We like to think of that as an American idea , but usually we do n't realize how very American it is . " Cline shoved a Pow-Wow magazine toward me . " Mr. Cohen , here , has dug up what must be one of the first of that long line of explanations that has bounced between Britain and America ? trying to explain one to the other . This is from an article published in England in 1776 , and it carefully points out , The darling passion of the American is liberty , and that in its fullest extent ; nor is it the original native only to whom this passion is confined ; our colonists sent hither seem to have imbibed the same principles . ' " " Mr. Cline chuckled quietly . " Must have annoyed the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbibing native passions ' like liberty . Those Englishmen knew where these same principles ' came from , because they could look at the old country , even freedom-loving England , and what did they see ? The peasant was bowing to the landowner , and the landowner was apple-polishing with the prince . And the prince was soft-soaping the king . And the king thought he came straight from God . While in America men like Thomas Jefferson were writing for the first time in the documents of human government that kings and any other government come straight from // the people and can very quickly return from whence they came , since Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . " ' Mr. Cline straightened his back and shook a long finger at me . " Old Jefferson knew where he got the ideas that started him to thinking . He often sat down and discussed the philosophy of government with his Indian chief neighbors , and he wrote his white friends things like , Crimes are very rare among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question whether no law that is , " no law " of the kind Europeans knew , as among the savage Americans , or too much law , as among civilized Europeans , submits man to the greatest evil , one who has seen both conditions of existence would pronounce it to be the last ; and that the sheep are happier of themselves than under the care of the wolves. ? Mr. Cline leaned back again and grinned . " And have n't we been getting along pretty well ever since on that idea that self-government is better even than expert government ? " These ideas that make us different from other peoples ? they are the ones we found working when we landed in America . We struggled for years to fit some of them into our more complicated lives , and some of them we do n't have a very good grip on yet : universal suffrage , including women ; the pattern of states within a state that we call federalism ? or United States , or United Nations ? the idea that chiefs are servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another man 's vision . " Mr. Cline nodded thoughtfully . " Could be . Could be we might get really Americanized yet . " Mr. Cline pulled in his long legs and asked abruptly , " Have you been to the museum yet ? Every year they have an exhibit of Hopi handcrafts . It 's worth seeing . " And indeed it was worth seeing , as was the whole museum . A plaque beside the door of the adobe-type building offered the challenge : " This museum exhibits ideas , not objects . " And under it a temporary sign : " No cameras allowed . The Hopi people prefer not to be photographed . " As you step onto the cool porches of the museum patio you // find yourself responding with every physical sense . The fresh odor of the fine yucca-leaf baskets , as dreamy as summer-mown hay , pervades every corner of the patio . At one side is the maker of pici , tissue-thin corn cakes , dyed with the most amazing colors . Across the patio glows the copper and silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft blankets at upright looms , while they laugh together over a weird , conversational chant that stops and starts and dissolves again into chuckles . Inside the museum , old Jimmy Kewanweytewa presided with dignity . Jimmy is a maker of kachina dolls , colorful and symbolic figures used in the Hopi ceremonials . His kachina dolls stirred wide comment when they were pictured in Holiday magazine . Evidently jimmy thought that the white visitors were not being properly entertained ; with the air of a benevolent father asking permission of his small son to build with the boy 's blocks , Jimmie piloted the museum curator to a large drum among the exhibits . The drum was made from an irregular hollow log nearly two feet in diameter and looked as though it might be priceless . As Jimmy later assured his audience , it was " very old ? many years . " The curator nodded with equal benevolence , and Jimmy , settling himself on the stairs in the museum lobby , began an informal concert . His agile hands ran a curious accompaniment to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thought you had discovered a simple 4:4 rhythm , it would break in mid air , pause , pirouette , and settle again into something that was admittedly a rhythm but that baffled analysis . The song was conversational rather than emotional in tone , and I was vastly curious about the narrative that it was obviously telling . At the end I asked , " Does the song tell a story ? " " Yes , " he said , with an air that closed the conversation . Quickly , before he could start again , I asked , " Would you tell us what story ? " He turned on me sober black eyes under wise and wrinkled lids . " It tells , " he said , " the story that it means .

At Williams , fifty miles away , something might be available within two weeks of the powwow , but do n't roll in the day before and expect to do anything but camp on the open range . VU . SEAF O S FESTIVAL Rockland , Maine ( First week end in August ) Until you get as far north as Rockland , you have n't seen Maine ! That seems to be the general opinion of good " down-Easters , " whether they are natives of Rockland or not . Below Rockland , they contend , is " just " a continuation of Massachusetts . And , of course , you have n't really seen Rockland till you have been to Rockland 's Seafoods Festival . It is another example of that fascinating fact that , during three days of a festival , you can get more of the " feel of a place " than in months of living in the same spot . It is also one of those delightful miniatures of America where everybody turns out for the festival ? in this case not only everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Everybody eats ! And when a down-Easter starts talking about good cooks and seafoods and eating , do n't interrupt him ! Because sooner or later , he will have to see that you , sample some of the facts , for the other commodity that Maine offers the visitor is , believe it or not , a genuine friendliness , wrapped up , maybe , in the quiet reserve that makes the difference between back-slapping and the real thing . If you have a picture of dour and taciturn Maine fishermen , that may surprise you . Perhaps it is just part of the " Maine-above-Rockland " theory . On second thought , is n't friendliness just what you would expect from men who claim that their wives are the best cooks in the world ? " Not that we do n't have our characters , " as one State-ofMainer observed with a chuckle . " I 'd even admit that we have // a few who can sit and spit with uncanny skill . " However , my personal observation is that Maine 's individualism lays less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . Consequently , if a man has it in him to be taciturn , or dour , or a character , that is what he will be , with no corners rubbed off . But that may not keep him from making a good balance wheel on the village Board of Selectmen . Be that as it may , during the Seafoods Festival you will eat . You will stroll about over Rockland 's " Public Landing , " sniffing the tar-and-salt combination guaranteed to start both the gastric juices and the imagination . Under the colorful awnings you can step up and select golden-brown fried clams or ditto fillets of perch , Penobscot Bay steamed clams , lobster rolls or sandwiches , all piping hot . Or you can wrestle with the anatomy of a lobster at your leisure and then drown the critter in melted Maine butter . After that , you stroll about a little , perhaps chat with one of the visitors from any of the forty-eight states or several foreign countries that will be around sniffing and eating . Sooner or later , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shedding seaweed and barnacles right and left . By that time , you are ready to start eating all over again . After a few preliminary lobsters Friday afternoon , gruff old Neptune officially opens the festival Friday evening at the Annual Coronation Ball , amid colorful pageantry that comes out of the hearts of people who can love the sea because they fear it . And out of American fear , whether it be G.T. or Maine whaler , seems to come humor . So that ageless folk character Davy Jones appears as court jester for King Neptune , clad in his striped seaman 's shirt and most probably waving a lobster-pot buoy . The most urgent business of this first session of royal court is to choose the Sea Goddess who will share the throne of Neptune for the next year . Towns all up and down the coast have sent a bevy of lovely candidates , but His Royal Highness seems to be quite equal to the task , in spite of help from his jester . // And certainly no lonely old monarch could resist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , every morning at Public Landing he will be breaking water again , shedding his barnacles and coming ashore to greet the newcomers . Saturday moves across Public Landing and Fishermen 's Memorial Pier ( as our Maine hosts express it in the program ) " at a smooth , enjoyable pace . " Colorful parade in the morning . In the afternoon and evening , something doing every minute : kiddies ' contests , drum and bugle contests , and concerts . Perhaps folk dancing by the brightly costumed colony of Finnish-Americans and any other Americans who step up and ask to be taught , as well as a noisy American hoedown with a down-East fiddler and caller . If you begin to wonder how all these lobsters are caught and what kind of scenery and friends they enjoyed beforehand , there are exhibits . You see a lobster trap and its buoy . You learn that sardines are herrings that have been squeezed into a can , which possibly accounts for that phrase " sardine factory , " which sounds almost as strange to a landlubber as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that you meet up with in the orient . You will learn , also , that schools of fish are now located by radar instead of the old squint-and-hunch method . Sunday afternoon the Royal Court of the Sea convenes again , with appropriate splendor and entertainment . But the highlight of Sunday afternoon is the simple memorial service for the men who have lost their lives at sea over the years . These people who love the sea because they fear it gather quietly before a huge anchor on the Maine Fishermen 's Memorial Pier . Clergymen of each faith offer a simple prayer for those who went to sea and did not return , and for those who stayed behind . Then a sober tot , usually a child or a grandchild of a man lost in the year past , places a wreath on the anchor , and the meeting closes in the simple dignity of seafolk . The man standing next to me was staring at the knobby knuckles of an old fisherman whose sea days were obviously finished . Turning , he said , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a seagoing man here who is n't thinking , But for the grace of God , that tot might be mine . ' " By this time you will be getting the feel of this quiet Maine casualness and will know where to get more of it . Even if you have never dropped a line before , there is nothing to keep you from hopping over to the picturesque little harbor on Vinaihaven ? one of Penobscot 's **32;597;TOOLONG collection  - -  and fishing for pollock from the bridge that spans the millstream on Maine Street . Or just sitting on the wharf and watching the fish swim up nonchalantly to your bait , look it over and casually down it ( or swim away again ! ) . Hardier souls may want to " sign up " with the crew of a windjammer ? well , anyway , you have a nice clean bunk and if you feel like it you can " help " the regular crew furl the sails and swab the deck . In case of a real blow the crew would probably suggest that you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt equal to it . Captain Dayton O. Newton 's two-masted schooner Maggie , sailing out of Rockland , is one of the last of those bustling little New England coasting vessels that carried lime and granite ? and ice ? out of Maine . Other ships sailing from near-by ports offer similar " working cruises . " About seven-tenths of the American population must be frustrated seamen . At least , a ship-launching seems to fill most of us with a breath-taking burst of imagination . If you are one of the seven-tenths , and if any of the shipyards that advertise in your festival program has a ship ready for the ways , you will be there . The naming ? a dedication to an unknown future ? the slow , accelerating glide that should be as awkward as " a fish out of water " and is n't , the swish and dip and breath-taking lurch ? and there is a new miracle , riding proudly in waters that wash the farthest lands we know and the farthest time we know . The artists with adz and chisel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often bear the same name as their ancestors who , in 1776 , went right on building clipper ships in the Newcastle-on-Tyne tradition without too much attention to a mere war , bitter though it was . And the craftsmen of the New70 The American Festival Guide castle-on-Tyne carried in their veins some of the same blood as did Gudrid the Viking , whose little son Snorre was , if legend be true , the first European baby born this side of the Atlantic Ocean . And behind little Snorre and his parents were others who chiseled out log canoes , in the long line of human continuity . If you are lucky enough to find a ship ready to go down the ways , you will know that they are all there , the Britishers and the Vikings and the canoeists ? you will hear them sigh happily as the tip of the rudder touches salt water . Something of the solidness of this continuity you will find also if you talk to the men who build the ships and take them out and bring them back . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the last century , performed the unthinkable feat of sailing directly from Cape Anne to Monehegan , without regard to fog or visibility , relying entirely on his revolutionary " time and course " method of navigation ( a bit of fancy that only partially modified the down-East sea captain 's by-ear-and-by-instinct navigation ) . Then probably your friend will shrug and mention the Phoenicians , who figured out the same method of dead reckoning a couple of thousand years ago . To these men , ships are a part of the line of humanity . They will tell you about " crank ships " and " bad actors . " They will speak caressingly of the Katandin as the " fair-haired child " of the Boston-Bangor line , and will tell you of the public mourning when she was dismantled . They will speak with simple gravity about the destructive " blow " of November , 1898 , or of the six ships that , a few years later , were sunk by a German submarine off the Maine coast , or the stubborn heroism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown fishermen who rescued all but four of the huge passenger list when the Castine struck the bay ledges ? that was June 8 , 1935 . By this time you are hopelessly enthralled for the afternoon . These " taciturn " down-Easters may not sound like Walter Winchell , but once they get started , most of them will talk an arm off of you . And at festival time , of course , everybody except a // few committees seems to have more than the usual time and inclination to talk . VIII . PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH FOLK FESTIVAL Kutztown , Pennsylvania ( 5 days of the July 4 week end ) The air is full of odors as you walk through the gate of the Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Festival at Kutztown : the smell of coffee , baking dough , the Christmasy smell of hot wax ( that 's the candlemaker ) , wood fires of all kinds , vinegar and cinnamon , and , if you come at the right time ( or the wrong time ) , the smell of a hog being butchered and scalded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow your nose ; it will lead you somewhere interesting . Perhaps the richest and spiciest trail of all leads to the apple-butter tent , where three huge round copper kettles are bubbling away , one on a tripod over an open fire and two on shiny black stoves stoked with wood . By " huge kettles , " I mean three feet across . You may have seen their black iron counterpart on front lawns , filled with bright petunias , but you wo n't so readily see the many that are still in use for making soap and heating water for hog-scalding , or the copper ones like these used for making apple butter . At the nearest kettle a plump , pleasant woman sits placidly under the most modern of lawn umbrellas and turns a long handle that , by a series of cogs and ingenuities , keeps a pair of blades rotating in the kettle five feet away . As she appears to be prepared to stir for a good many hours yet , you inquire , by way of starting your five days of asking questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apple butter is done ? " She will give you a wise and friendly smile , because she is // young enough to know that when you say " apple butter " you really mean lotwarrick , and then she adds to your fund of human knowledge with the information , " Until it is done it will not be sick . " That may put a temporary crimp in your question asking , but you will have no trouble in finding someone that will be glad to explain everything . " Ven the apple snitzes first cook up , it is sin ? like soup . You cook and stir for ten hours , zen , until it is sick , you take it off . " Just how thick it must be , and just what spices and cider have gone in meanwhile , and just how it is kept from burning when it is not quite thick enough ? that is all part of the art of good lotwarrick . It 's like having a " green thumb " or the sixth sense of the old ironmasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start casting . You " just know . " By now you will probably have had to make several stops among the gay tents along the commons , where church and grange groups each dispense a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty . You can have your choice of a couple of kinds of the rib-sticking soups that warm up hungry farmers : rivvel soup ( rivvels are like little dumplings ) or brown-flour potato soup . Of rich bakery there is no end . You will be grateful to learn that the Pennsylvania Dutch claim to be the soil in which our typical American fruit pie originated . At any rate , pie , for a Dutch family that has n't gone soft , is a three-times-a-day staple . There are meat pies , too , including pot pie which is , of course , pie made in a pot and sounds like " bot-boi " when you hear it pronounced . Some group is almost sure to have schnitz un gnepp , which literally means only dried apples cooked with dumplings , but it is usually cooked with ham , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoofly pie and Snavely sticks . Ask a " Dutchman " about the latter and he will tell you they are plowlines . Eat one , and you will decide they are a sort of noodle ( made with sour cream ) fried in deep fat . Take time to enjoy that half-moon pie , but do n't loiter , either , because there is a game of nipsi starting over in the demonstration area . That is a rather complicated game , involving // batting a nipsi ( a piece of wood about five inches long and sharpened at both ends ) and then " bidding " the number of hops that the opposing team will require to hop from where the ball landed back to home base . One hopes that the bid will be high enough to lure the other team into trying it , but low enough that they ca n't make it . It all requires a lot of jabbering in dialect , and stupendous hopping , with a certain amount of batting . The boys will probably still be enjoying their game when you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seventy-two-year-old Ansom Stump , the wheelwright . If pressed , Ansom will admit to " walking away " occasionally to go fishing , and to spending a week in the Allentown hospital . Apart from that , his seventy-two years have been spent at Kempton , always ready to answer an emergency call from a farmer with a broken wheel or wagon tongue . And do n't think that is n't an emergency , especially if it happens on the only sunny day during harvest time . The Folk Festival had been going for several years before he could be persuaded to leave the farmers unattended and travel all the way to Kutztown to make a couple of wheels for the folks to see . Wheels , whether for heavy farm wagons or for wheelbarrows , have to be well-built affairs , and Anson 's strong , deft hands shave and fit and polish till he has a wheel as sturdy and as neat as a Pennsylvania Dutchman himself . With the slenderer hands of a scholar , William Shoemaker does Fraktur work , that illumination of birth and baptismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrolls that you do not find in the illumination done by sedentary monks . Since the Pennsylvania Dutch , coming out of the Reformation , were about the only literate group with a peasant background , this Fraktur work combines intricate delicacy with a virility that makes it a unique art . Not so long ago , Fraktur painting was the craft that schoolteachers learned to supplement their regular work , as the farmer added blacksmithing or barn painting . Since the teacher taught only four or five weeks a year , the rest of the time he spent traveling from farm to farm , // painting the lovely family records that many families still cherish . The better the food and the more congenial his hosts , the more complicated the work he did , and hence the longer his stay . And you must not miss Charles Wagonhorst , the tinsmith . Cookie-cutters are his specialty , though by no means his only product . This immediate area of Berks County , for reasons that are still an anthropological mystery , seems to be cookie country even more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start early in December and continue unabated till Christmas time . Nowhere does the Dutch practical imagination show itself with more awareness than among its cookie-cutters . Among collections of cookie-cutters over a hundred years old , the figures show surprising and often amusing personality and motion and a wide observation of the world . You may find , for instance , such an exotic animal as a whale . And the rooster is n't just a rooster ; he is puffing out his chest in fine style . The pony and his Indian rider are going somewhere , and the dog ( hound ) is apparently baying at the moon . If you wish , you can order a set of cookie-cutters made from the patterns of Mr. Wagonhorst 's great-grandfather , cutters that made cookies to be stolen from cookie crocks a hundred years ago . You will roam in fascination from the tinsmith to the deft pretzel-maker and the candleinaker , from the cigar-maker to the Pennsylvania Dutch bees improving each shining moment ( for the Dutch say that they brought the first honeybees to this country ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potter . The churner , backed by a handy Holstein cow , churns butter and shows how it is molded in carved butter molds , impressed with tulips or interesting heart designs . Two quilting frames are surrounded by busy women , one group in the little white caps of the Mennonites and the other a Reformed group . Quiltmaking is , in part , one of the thrifty Dutch " salvage arts . " In the form of the crazy quilt , at least , it is a colorful and sturdy way to avoid throwing away a single scrap . // The Pennsylvania Dutch seem to have a natural eye for pattern and color ? especially color . A Dutchman will laugh and tell you , Ya , any color we like , chust so it is bright . " But an artist with a color wheel can show you how unerringly an instinct chooses a simple complementary or a triad color scheme . He may also point out how often you find the more sophisticated , mixed shades , in addition to the simple bold reds and yellows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green from lime yellow to turquoise , and each shade used unerringly with its equally complicated complement . In painted decorations , the whole is held together and emphasized with a generous use of rich black . The pattern of the quilts you see will be traditional , and probably symbolic . But the colors and their use in the pattern will be different from any other quilt . As you wander among the craftsmen , you may possibly find Harry Stauffer , with his Conestoga hand printing press . He prints beautiful copies of Fraktur work , some of the originals done before the Revolution , or translations of Himmelsbriefs ( letters from Heaven ) , or he may be printing his own announcements : " Printer and Tinker ? Printing as the spirit moves , Tinkering as the occasion requires . Commercial work not executed . " And do n't miss 011ie , the basketmaker . He works with willow withes and , if you ask him , will tell you about his willow patch and how and when to " soak " and " peel . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you on his harmonica . Perhaps the New York man had been talking to 011ie when he shook his head sadly and remarked , " We have forgotten how to live . If we have an hour when nothing is going on we are bored stiff . We have forgotten how to work with our hands . " Or perhaps Milton Hill , the barn painter , will be there , painting complicated barn stars on large weatherproof squares that you can fasten to your garage doors . The biggest crowd will be around the glass-blower . There is something akin to the thrill of actual creation in watching the glass puff and sway into tiny dancing pitchers , or spin out and bend into flowing folds , at the will ? seemingly almost at the // glance ? of the pleasant , round-faced woman with the magic hands . If some enthralled visitor asks how one learns glassblowing , Grace Howell will explain the process exactly without stopping the bending glass for a second . You are born into a glass-blowing family , and then you begin at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and much more you can see without ever going into either of the program tents . And when you do break away for a little sit down , you have to choose between two simultaneous programs . You may watch a funeral feast , enacted in exact detail , or a birthday party with " play-party games , " or sturdyhearted and kindly Aunt Sophia explaining how she " powwows " for " wild feier " ( erysipelas ) . You may hear some of the folk tales , or the German variety of tall tales . Apparently any human beings of European ancestry , if left alone for any time on American soil , will turn up with tall tales , whether it be Paul Bunyan , letting a wide swathe of sunlight into the swamps , or the long-rifle wondermen of Kentucky and the Rockies , or Pecos Bill of the cow country ? or just the weather . And Pennsylvania Dutchmen are no exception to the great American phenomenon . In the evening , square dancing and jigging contests will turn up some very odd words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ; you will have a chance to swing your own partner after the evening 's winners have been decided . ) The square dances and jigs come straight from England and Ireland , yet they are as much a traditional part of Pennsylvania Dutch social life as snitzing parties . It is all a part of that bewildering question that may seem to get more bewildering with each program you see . What is a Pennsylvania Dutchman ? He is not just a bearded Amishman , for here are a lot who go to college and do not wear beards . He is not a transplanted German any more than other " Americans " are transplanted Englishmen or other Europeans . He is not a German-speaking Swiss , although he brought from Switzerland his now famous two-story , job-engineered bank barns . He is certainly not Holland Dutch , in spite of the name , which is // only the Yankee pronunciation of Deutsch . Furthermore , he has not stayed in Pennsylvania , although his tribe was bred here . Then you begin remembering in Oley Valley , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a mill whose millstones came from France as ship ballast , and whose owner bears an unmistakably French name , yet who spoke with a hint of " Dutch " accent . You remember , too , stumbling onto an English halftimbered type of house , and onto words and customs that vaguely reminded you of Sweden . All this , besides much that came from nowhere else but grew right here on American soil ? all this is Pennsylvania Dutch , a folk culture that is , quite literally , " as American as apple pie . " Religiously , they are almost as varied . There are the " plain " groups , that include the Mennonite and the even more conservative Amish ( pronounced " Ahmish " ) . In view of St. Paul 's admonition to " be not conformed to this world , " the Amishman views the questionable advantages of telephones and tractors and education beyond the sixth grade with a very critical eye . We think of them as ultra conservative , yet in the break from religious formalism the Amishmen took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to the little prayer caps and simple dresses for the women , and sometimes to coats without collars for the men . Much the largest number comprise the Lutheran and Reformed groups . Until recently they held at least some services in " sermon German . " They bake shoo-fly pie , piece quilts in the traditional motifs , found colleges and cherish heirlooms of grandfather clocks and chests painted with gay tulips and distelfinks and plump , lush hearts . They also speak English in their own way , ranging from the heaviest of accents and rearranged sentences to the merest suggestion of a tongue-tied consonant and a little question mark at the upturned end of a sentence . After the Revolution , a third religious group grew out of the fringe of the Methodist revivals in the South . These are the Church of God , Evangelical , and United Brethren groups that hold camp meetings ( or bush meetings ) and added Dutch // adaptations of Negro spirituals as the latest ingredient of this colorful " Dutch " patchwork . No one , least of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mere two hundred years we have produced a complete folk culture ; it is difficult to get an over-all and unbiased picture . But such a picture is the goal of this festival , sponsored by Franklin and Marshall College ( which was founded 1787 by the " Dutch " Lutheran and the Reformed churches ) and sparked by Drs . Frey , Yoder , and Shoemaker . The latter you will recognize on sight as the pleasant , twinkly person with the precise goatee and a patient and understanding attitude toward all your misconceptions about the Pennsylvania Dutch . You will agree with Dr. Yoder , in the readable collection In the Dutch Country , that " Pennsylvania is a miniature version of the great American melting pot . " You will continue to agree with his next statement , that " the pot is still bubbling away , " when you see in the handcraft tent abstractions of distelfinks and Dutch barns by very modern artists , all done with the true Dutch feeling of forthrightness , orderliness , and sturdy but rounded , flowing lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to her explain , " No , we ca n't make satisfactory reproductions of the seventeenthand eighteenth-century potter , because we can not recreate his mood in different surroundings . Nor is there any reason for going back to his limited materials . He would jump at the chance to use the wonderful colors we have now . " Yet Olive Zehner 's graffito and slip-trace ware are as Dutch as shoo-fly pie . The pot continues to boil when you see the decorated box of " Early American Chocolates . . . made in the heart of the Pennsylvania Dutch country by Mark Early and Wife . " The Pennsylvania Dutch pot has melted down to a person who is quite as complicated as any other slice of Americans . In fact , since his blood flows in the veins of so many people whose ancestors paused hereabouts sometime within the last nine or ten generations , he may have added no small part to some of the national characteristics that so bewilder our good friends abroad , // Our friends profess to find us entirely taken up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and plenty of it ? while we take only a good-natured interest in matters of minor importance , such as our national safety . Then , suddenly , our well-intentioned allies stumble on something that we think really important , like the right of a man , whether a citizen of America or a prisoner from an " enemy country " to choose three things , his religion , his country , and his kind of government . All at once , we are very stable ? conservative or ? shall we just say ? ? stubborn . In five days , you can not possibly follow two simultaneous programs as well as get acquainted with the artisans and demonstrators and fully enjoy the exhibits ? the traditional kitchen setting for the lovely carved butter molds that furnished the motif for one year , or the many colorful collections and modern adaptations . Perhaps you will determine , therefore , to come back another year and enroll in the seminar and cooking school which holds forth in still another building . Not only will you actually learn Pennsylvania Dutch cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art ? painted tolewear , woodenware , architecture , ceramics ? and the folk songs , storytellers and folk tales , and the Hexerei , and their place in any folk culture . You will learn , for instance , to " eat yourselves full oncet , " as any good Dutch hostess will admonish you , but you will view with a jaundiced eye the story about the Dutch secretary who came back to work with the sad plaint , " My off is all . " That , you will discover , could only have been dreamed up by the kind of person who would translate it , " My vacation is over . " Come to think of it , what kind of " over " does a vacation get ? Thrown over as a ball ? Or run over as a pedestrian ? And over what ? Over the moon , as a cow ? Ei , yei , people talk wonderful funny , ai n't ? Inquire about location . The festival may move to a proposed Pennsylvania Dutch village near the Reading interchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas ( Early October ) Most colleges and many small towns have homecomings . But from that point on , the Svensk Hyllnings Fest of Lindsborg , Kansas , and Bethany College ceases to be like anything you are apt to see anywhere else . For one thing , few colleges and towns have grown up together as closely as have Bethany College and Lindsborg . In fact , it could probably be accurately stated that very few communities organize a college only twelve years after their mass arrival from Europe , and while many of the " founders " were still living in mud dugouts on the middle of a windswept prairie . Still fewer towns and colleges combined can dig out of their tradition a homecoming feast on the proportions of a Viking hall 's welcome to its owner 's return from over the far seaways . Lindsborg 's smorgasbord is something to remember . And they share it , for a very modest sum , with several thousand visitors whose numbers are increasing each year . Nor does one expect to find , squarely in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmopolitan interest that swirls about Lindsborg in early October , after all the crops are in . There is no telegraphic interpretation of Svensk Hyllnings Fest , but it means " Annual Festival in honor of the Swedish Pioneers . " So all the Olssons , as well as the few Smiths , turn out in the colorful costumes that the homesick pioneers brought to this vast land of harsh extremes . They are bold , honest colors , reds and yellows and greens ? colors that smile . Then , about the time that you get used to eating tokt // skinka and chatting with girls in little red bodices , you are suddenly confronted with a band of Indian braves in full war paint from near-by Haskell Institute , descendants of the Americans who more or less welcomed the Rev. Mr. Olsson and his flock back in 1868 . Or perhaps it is a real Indian from India , complete with turban and beard . He just happens to be at the festival , because he is visiting first-class farms in order to learn American farming methods . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Or perhaps it is an African from Tanganyika , graduate of a mission school and now a student at Bethany College . One way or another , you wo n't be in Lindsborg long without having your attention turned backward or upward , in gratitude ? or outward , in responsibility . The big Friday parade with floats and bands and the crownning of the queen usually starts things off . But do n't expect the Hyllnings Fest queen to appear in a bathing suit , or yet in an evening gown . Nor will she be chosen by a landslide of penny votes . Lindsborg has discovered a very straightforward way to choose her festival queen , who usually turns out to be the " most popular " after all : she will be the twinkly-eyed , apple-cheeked old lady who has lived longest in Lindsborg or on one of the adjoining farms . If you can make your way through the throng of her loyal subjects and the body guard of her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren , you may hear her telling of Sweden , a land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this vast land of hot winds and cold winds . Or perhaps she is telling of a little girl 's Christmas on the plains ? of getting up at four o'clock on Christmas morning to put a homemade candle in each tiny window of the dugout ; of watching Mother and Father walking in the dark across the plains to the festive Julotta service so that the horses would not have to stand in sub-zero weather through the long service ; of watching the tiny lights dotting themselves across the plain as the stars dotted the sky ; // then of the goodies that smelled so luscious , and of the little bare Christmas tree carefully wrapped in paper and decorated with candles , since no pine or spruce was available . The parade itself encompasses the whole range of these zestful people . " Coffee Time " rides next to the float " Vision of a New World . " And you catch intriguing snapshots of what this New World was like , and what these people brought to it , in their hands and in their hearts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in one of the huge hollow sycamore trees , as did many hunters and even families until they could construct the first dugout . The dugouts and the log cabins that followed all roll by in the parade . There are " Vikings Landing in Canada , " and a rollicking college float announcing " One of Bethany 's Terrible Swedes . " There is a patient little donkey pulling a covered wagon that declares , " Lindsborg or Bust , " and a stagecoach . Then a nobby little steam engine , carriages and surreys , and a 1916 Mogul . There are old-time farming and lumbering devices that make your muscles ache just to look at . There is an old-time general store and a Swedish Christmas scene . And some very modern scenes , too . One float carries a family group in Swedish costume at one end and a very American little girl at the other . And between the two ? What else but the Lindsborg Post Office and a sign announcing , " Stockholm to Lindsborg in four days by air mail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . And , though no mention is made of it , you are sure to give a flying thought to the matterof-fact young Viking from the Midwest who quietly wrestled Uncle Sam 's mail through thunder and fog and then as quietly hopped his little single-motor plane from New York to Paris , announcing to the excited gendarmes there , " Lindberg 's my name ; I just remembered I do n't have a visa . " Friday afternoon everybody gathers in the wide , immaculate town square , gay with flags and blue and yellow bunting . Every school child in town , from first grade to adult , as well as the 4H clubs , neighboring Swedish clubs , a few stray " cowboys , " and // real Indians , all have a part in the twinkle and color of Swedish folk games , maypole dances , Indian dances , and , of course , the casual pause for " coffee hour . " From five o'clock to eight you enjoy Lindsborg 's famous Smorgasbord . There is no record that any of her guests has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that long to do justice to the bord . It is served in the modern educational plant of the church whose congregation originally worshiped under a grass roof , within the sandstone walls that they had cut from the near-by cliffs . Today the church hall , together with a lot of hard-working housewives , has no trouble in serving nearly two thousand people in two shifts . ( You are expected to eat only an hour and a half ! ) Your colorful little program booklet will tell you that " It took the Swedes five hundred years , five wars , and five inspirations to create the smorgasbord . It brings you the salt of the sea , the fat of the land , the wings of the sky . " The booklet adds thoughtfully , " But now this custom is observed in Scandinavian homes only on unusual holiday celebrations . . . or on dark days that need brightening . " Perhaps that is it . Perhaps that is the spirit that took a whole generation through the grinding hardships of plains pioneering without loss of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and share wherever they go . You will enjoy your smorgasbord twice ? once when you read : Knackebrod , Rokt sill ( and several other kinds of sill ) , Potatissalad ( aha ! I fooled ' em and read it ) , and also Grongakers sallad and , at the head of the endless list , Smor ? what else would be on a bord ? And you will enjoy it again when you eat it , mostly without reference to names . Friday evening the festival comes indoors to Bethany College , where you will have , among other things , music . Scandinavians were probably singing before Beowulf 's ancestors discovered England ; and Lindsborg was singing even before Pastor Olsson first heard the Messiah in England and brought back those stirring choruses that have drawn visitors from all // over the world to Lindsborg 's Easter Week . Tonight the men 's chorus may not be singing the marching songs of the soldiers that followed the " King of the Goths and Wends , " but what does it matter , so long as that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the male quartet closes in on Orpheus sjong vid lutans toner , you wo n't need a translation to follow the music . Saturday morning is another big parade , the college homecoming . Then smorgasbord again . And the college 's biggest football game of the year . Unless you are completely allergic to football , you should see that game , if only to hear Bethany 's famous fighting yell : " Rockar ! Stocker ! Thor och Hans Bockar ! Kor Igenom. ! Kor Igenom ! Tju ! Tju ! Tju ! Bethania ! " The allusions , although a bit abbreviated , are to two characters of Swedish mythology : an adventurous jarl ( who wore a jacket , or rockar , for alliterative purposes ) and who sailed on a log raft into the Baltic till he touched the peninsula , where he founded Stockholm , and to Thor , whose chariot , pulled by stubborn and sure-footed goats , leaps from pinnacle to pinnacle and drives irresistibly through all opposition . You must find time , sometime during your stay , to visit the Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moderate-priced handcrafts , in the traditional Swedish good taste ? and time also to enjoy the store window displays . Here you will find many of Lindsborg 's large stock of artists , both professional and amateur ? paintings and woodcarvings and hand looming . There will also be some lovely antiques and modern Swedish items : a bride 's crown of solid gold and pearls , brought to this country by a doting grandmother for her granddaughters ; a three-hundred-year-old bonnet and a two-hundred-year-old coffee mill ; old wooden and leather shoes and a faded sign reading SVEADAHL that hung from the first post office in the valley . The festival swings into Sunday without a pause as Lindsborg gathers in a community church service and sings the majestic , " Lead on , 0 King Eternal , the day of march has come . " You sit and think . You think : I would n't give two screws for // the success of any dictator , imported or homegrown , who came up against a people whose festival queen was born in a dugout , whose ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the harp " and " rich in victory , " whose only fences were around the windows of their cabins ( to keep the longhorned cattle from pushing through the glass ) , and who sing this way , We follow not with fears , For gladness breaks like morning , Where'er Thy face appears ; Lead on , 0 God of might ! X. FESTIVAL OF ART Laguna Beach , California ( Mid July through early August ) For generations , Europe has been looking down its collective nose at its uncouth offspring across the Atlantic , and taunting us , " Where are your cathedrals ? Where are your operas and poets ; where are any signs of civilization ? " We have paid only enough attention to call back over our collective shoulder , " Wait a minute , cancha ! Till we get some of these forests chopped down and a few mines started and find out what this country is like and where it ends . Give us a little time and we will show you what art is really like ! " Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to revive them . We have started our mines and oil wells , and we have tramped clean across a continent to the indigo Pacific and its playful cliffs . And we find that the two of them , the Pacific and its cliffs , are enough to stop anybody , especially anybody that is going to show the world about art . So what has happened ? cathedrals ? Nary a cathedral ! Just a Walt Whitman or a Norman Rockwell here and there ? and at the end of the continental hike , the Laguna Beach Festival of Art . All three of them , Whitman and Rockwell and the Laguna festival , are in the American tradition . Art , like most things American , means , principally , people . And at Laguna , it means people in a very special way . Up crooked little Laguna Canyon , against a backdrop of evening-purpled hills , on a simple stage of textured volcanic stone , the Pageant of the Masters poses bakers and garagemen and teachers as the people that Rubens and Millet and Rockwell // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gilt frame , his hair just a little more ragged than the original , and something like the eyes of a Boy Scout looking out from under it . A Laguna mother , dignified and happy , stands behind her own two children in the simple robes of Van Dyke 's " The Lomallini Family . " Even the " Venus de Milo " is there , her arms amputated by some fancy Hollywood makeup and lighting , and all the little chippedmarble places showing on her drapery . About the time you think this one must surely be cold stone , you begin to feel that there is something familiar about the lassie . . . ah , that 's it , the little pug nose . You 've seen that button a dozen times , hopping off almost any big yellow school bus . After an evening of this , an art gallery can never be the same again . The people who peer out at you from their frames are real people . They must have argued with the boss ( I 'd hate to tangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and they nursed their babies through the whooping cough ( that one could stand a little more nursing ) , and they gossiped . Then , one day , a friend put them down as he saw them , or as they wished to be seen , and here they are , people . All of that begins to happen as the pageant of the masters moves before you . The voice of a one-time radio announcer chats with you about each " picture " as it appears on the stage . He helps you to feel the weary reverence of the peasants in Millet 's " The Angelus , " and to notice the delicate detail of " Chinese Ivories . " He may give you a little inside information about " Louis XIV " or explain the symbolism of an Etruscan bas-relief . Even without the pictures , the resulting two-hour narration is a masterpiece in itself . It has been described by hearers as " both inspiring and amusing . " A transcription of it is being used in several universities in both speech and art-appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows the music , strings , choir , or , when necessary , a recording . Without realizing it , the audience is moved into the mood of " Death and the Warrior , " or thrown high , wide , and handsome into " High Yaller . " Most of the score is written for the individual picture , // since , as the music director points out , " If the music is familiar , the audience is thinking about it instead of the picture . " Then , when you least expect it , one of the pictures " comes alive . " A rich , soft note flows almost imperceptibly out of the cello of " Madame Suggia . " And since Laguna collects personalities like Lysbeth Le Fevre Evans , the music is every bit as fine as Madame Suggia would have made it . Or " The Concert Singer " suddenly breaks forth with a fine lyric soprano solo . If you hunt up this concert singer during the day , you will likely find her helping her husband make their hardware shop a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly at Laguna Beach , is people . And the best art , as has been often said , is people linked with God ? as true an observation here as anywhere . No matter what program you attend , the climax is always Leonardo da Vinci 's masterpiece , " The Last Supper . " The disciples , who include a gardener , an oculist , and a tax assessor , study and live their parts as carefully as if they were playing in a passion play throughout the entire evening . A fine baritone sings " The Lord 's Prayer , " and as the last note dies away , even the backstage after-the-show bustle is hushed . You approach the bowl through Irvine Park , where you wander through several acres of art-and-craft displays . Paintings , art in metal , wood , and fabric , and displays of art ceramics in everything from delicate jewelry to huge urns . The range of artists is as American as cornbread . The exhibitors include disabled war veterans , six-year-old primitives from the county schools , and , until her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the czar of Russia . The subjects specialize , as one would expect , in elusive eucalyptus trees , old missions , and truly magnificent marine scenes , as well as unusual portraits and still life . With the white California sunlight tossing about such blinding colors in sky and sea and clouds , with such dissonant but pleasant contrasts in tile roofs and cerise shades of bougainvillaea and ice plant , there seems to be a minimum urge toward the more bizarre forms of art . The ceramics displays are Laguna 's particular specialty . They // lure buyers from the better depai twenty stores and gift shops throughout the country . And at any time of year , the pottery studios , large and small , have been termed one of the leading tourist attractions of southern California . Laguna became a pottery center when many of the canyons along the coast were found to yield clays suitable for firing , although many of the finer clays are now imported . You will see displays from one studio that specializes in unusual glazes that look like silver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another produces jewelry in luscious out-of-this-world colors ; another , winsome or striking figurines . Laguna 's carefree , fun-for-everybody attitude toward art is expressed happily in the " free-for-all " class on the festival grounds . Here any youngster can don a smock , settle down in front of an easel , and free-wheel all over a large paper , under the direction of artist and illustrator Russel Iredell , or pause long enough to watch , pop-eyed , as a visiting cartoonist or artist performs and tells exactly how it is done . Evening " free-for-all " classes are for adults , and both reflect the type of art classes throughout the year that have set half of Laguna 's businessmen and mothers to splattering paint around , or to just enjoying pictures . Free lectures are apt to lure real-estate dealers and plumbers with such subjects as " How to Look at a Picture . " No cathedrals . Just a lot of people enjoying a lot of beauty . And having a lot of fun with it . The kiddies ' afternoon freefor-all class breaks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clown chats gayly with Jessie the Elephant . Jessie was fashioned from a wastepaper basket , while her two daughters are made from oatmeal and salt boxes . Opera star Helen Traubel has as much fun helping the puppeteers pull the strings as the kiddies do the watching . The evening puppet show , with the emphasis on ballet and opera , draws an adult audience . Like many smaller southern-California towns , Laguna Beach rolls along in the be-yourself tradition that is self-consciously copied in " arty " communities elsewhere . If you walk down the main street sniffing the ocean spices and wearing a red hibiscus // in your hair , people do not stare ; they only smile in response to your mood . While the old Spanish motif has largely been molded into its American counterpart , you can easily find the roots in near-by old missions , some of the most aristocratic old Spanish families in California , and the casual architecture and color all around you . Several of the huge Spanish land grants back in the hills still round up the calves fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen little branding fires . You can soak up sunshine sitting on the cliffs of Dana Point while you read Richard Henry himself describing this point as one of the most romantic spots in the days of the old ranchos . According to your mood you can dine at El Adobe , built in 1778 , Victor Hugo Inn , or cafes Holland or Jolly Roger . Laguna 's Festival of Arts is a fine example of a festival that can be the basis of a whole vacation . A season ticket admits you to each of three different " Pageant of the Masters " programs on consecutive evenings for three weeks . It also opens the door to the festival grounds at any time , with their art classes and puppet shows and exhibits . For the rest of the time you can never get through meeting interesting people , swimming , duding at near-by ranches , reading about the people who discovered and pioneered this coast , or about the masters , old and modern , that have come to life for you in the Irvine Bowl , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you confine your sightseeing to interesting art , old , new , and natural . The festival is one small part of our answer to older Europe 's challenge of our " civilization . " Cathedrals ? No . Art ? Certainly . Who can read the pages of history as the generations will write them ? Perhaps future students of the history of art will point out that America took the age-old folk festival and made of it a new means of art expression , recording our ideals and our outlook on life as succinctly as Shakespeare recorded England or Sibelius spoke for Finland . Of course , one never knows about history , but the festivals are here ? and lots of fun . PART TWO Introduction Festivals are alive ! That is , they die and are born ; they grow and they move around . This section of the book will therefore be out of date before it is off the press , and the reader is urgently advised , if a festival is to be an integral part of his vacation , to write to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , to get the latest news . ( Where some other address is advisable , it has been indicated . ) A word about those numbers at the end of each festival description . They are a very practical " investor 's portfolio " for families who want the highest possible " interest rate " on their vacation investment . Consequently , they refer as much to vacations as they do to festivals : ( 1 ) You could plan a two-week vacation around this festival , including a lot of family conversation and reading for the rest of the year . Obviously , not many are marked 1 . Many " first-class " festivals do not come in this class , either because their theme would not interest enough ordinary Americans , or because they happen to be situated in country that would not keep a family busy and interested in the same general theme for a week or ten days . ( 2 ) This festival is worth traveling to , and the reference 2 covers by far the largest number of festivals . Just how far you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal interest ; I have tried to pass on " the feeling " of each festival , so that you can come to your own decision . They are all interesting and worth some effort . // ( 3 ) This is fun if you happen to be in the neighborhood . There are not too many of these . Usually , if a festival fell in this class it had to be left out entirely . Those that are included , I thought , had something extra that took them out of the purely local class . The " Interesting Reading " lists at the end of most sections were culled out of mountains of material by two criteria : each had to be interesting , and it had to be accurate . After discarding a good deal on the first count , I took to the high-school section of the library and discovered some very interesting books . They are not always complete ( though some of them do an amazing job ) , but we are on vacation , are n't we ? And who wants to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Lest I frighten away some he-man with the word " juvenile " and because not all libraries classify quite the same way , I have made no distinction . But if you do not find a book in one place , try the other . This is a family vacation , and all the members are supposed to have enough background to enjoy it . Some of the most fascinating reading you will find in the booklets and tiny local magazines that you would not ordinarily discover without actually traveling to the spot , and perhaps not then unless you knew where to look . Where you will be dealing directly with a publisher or local dealer , rather than the library or bookstore , I have also indicated the price . Some of these are gems , and make your trip a year-round pleasure . As I suggest later , if you are tired of collecting souvenirs that nobody looks at after you get home , why not shift to a collection of these local , often very readable booklets ? Even the folders , which can be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps ? and often information that you will not find in libraries or history books . I have tried to make these " shorties " something more than just a catalogue of festivals . I hope you have as much fun reading them as I did writing them . Happy landings . I. HISTORIC FESTIVALS NATCHEZ PILGRIMAGE Natchez , Mississippi ( Through March ) The lovely homes filled with priceless antiques that one may visit on these tours include both the familiar plantation homes , with their Greek columns , and the earlier homes of Spanish influence , with long double balconies and slenderer columns . Properly speaking , Natchez , and a few other festivals on the Mississippi , do not fall into the class of historical festivals used in this book . The history of Natchez began long before there was any " Western Homesteading , " and at the time of the Revolution it was not part of the British colonies . The first building in the country of the Natchez Indians was a fort , and the town that grew up around was called Natchez . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in 1797 when the U.S. envoy sent to determine a very vague boundary declared it U.S. territory . By the time American planters began building up cotton plantations , trade down the Mississippi made it a " civilized " center , as lovely mansions testify . Transportation adds a dollar to the cost of the tours , but for visitors with their own cars the tours are well marked . The pageant , The Confederate , has become almost as well known as the Natchez tours . Scenes from the gracious South are climaxed as the King and Queen of the Pilgrimage are entertained by the royal ballet . ( 2 ) // SPRING FIESTA New Orleans , Louisiana ( Last 2 weeks in April ) If you prefer to see New Orleans in less hysterical mood than at Mardi Gras , you will find her normal and gracious self at the Spring Fiesta . It has been remarked that New Orleans is a city whose notable architecture is her private homes rather than her public buildings . Many of these homes are open during the Fiesta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are tours of plantation homes , American-section homes , and old patio homes of what is called the French quarter but is actually more Spanish than French . These are open only to holders of tours tickets , or by special invitation . A few events are open to the public , including a parade and the Gala Spectacle . For further information and prices , write to New Orleans Spring Fiesta Association , Upper Pontalba Building , 546 St. Peter Street , New Orleans , 16 , La. ( 2 ) VILLA LOUIS OPENING CELEBRATION Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin ( Friday ? Sunday in late May ) With all the talk about log cabins and pioneer hardships , one gets a picture of another segment of our westward expansion at the Villa Louis . The villa is built on a mound commanding a fine view of the Mississippi . The mound , we are told , was built by some prehistoric peoples about whom we know very little . Later the Fox Indians used it as a burying ground . Here Father Marquette discovered the Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi rivers join , the French built a fort . A hundred and twenty-nine years later , the Americans erected Fort Shelby on the old Indian mound . Through cemeteries and furs , through cannon and friendships , the long line of human continuity threads from unknown builder to Wisconsin 's first millionaire , Colonel Hercules Dousman , a personal agent of John Jacob Astor 's fur company . Colonel Dousman seems to have been the kind of man we could have used more of . The Indians looked to him for help in personal troubles and in group disputes , and the financiers of St. Louis and New York moved promptly when he called their attention to overdue payments for furs . The gracious villa , as it is seen today , entertained many people , famous for many things . Guests include both Jefferson Davis and the half-breed on whom Dr. William Beaumont performed his famous operation , allowing him to watch digestion in a man 's stomach . The villa museum contains among other things several dioramas depicting this experiment , the old English fort , a trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion includes some well-waxed beards , a silver tea , a parade of historic floats , carriages , and high-wheeled bicycles and bands , ceremonial dances by the Stand Rock Indians , and a pageant on some phase of the early days . One is free to wander in the lovely homes , enjoying a 109-year-old Brussels carpeting , carved rosewood and mahogany pieces , and some original plates by the dean of naturalists and artists , J. J. Audubon . And why , do you suppose , those prehistoric folks wanted to build a mound here ? ( 3 ) 1(X) The American Festival Guide FIESTA DE SAN JACINTO San Antonio , Texas ( Week of April 21 ) Texas is a state in the pre-United-States sense ? a nation , complete with Independence Day . April 21 is that Independence Day , " the birth of the state of Texas , " when her own armies without help from anyone freed her from Mexico . They fought for independence against the same grievances that goaded the thirteen colonies to independence , gross misgovernment . Consequently , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . " Texas " joined her strength and substance with the United States of America , " two sovereign states arranging a mutually helpful agreement . So Texas will probably be just Texas as long as anyone can say " Alamo . " And , being Texas , she will probably celebrate April 21 on a grand scale , and for a week at a time . Twilight on Monday in San Antonio begins the solemn Pilgrimage to the Alamo . A long line of old-trail drivers , patriotic societies , cowboys , and dignitaries , both military and civil , bank masses of flowers against the heavy walls of the Alamo , while choir music floats out from the chapel within . Later Monday evening , on the San Antonio River , which winds through the heart of the city , " King Antonio " arrives , surrounded by a royal fleet of brilliant and spectacular barges and gondolas that make the city appear as Venice as Texans would have arranged it . A river pageant follows , showing the people who have walked through the years in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . All week long there is gaiety and solemnity ( Texas is as quick to remember Heartbreak Hill as she is to remember the Alamo ) , Old World and New , guitars and symphony . Winding up the week is the Battle of the Flowers Parade , which adequately takes the place of the former actual flower-throwing // battle , and the final fling of the Fiesta Flambeau ( illuminated night parade ) . As American as freedom itself , they say . Maybe they are right . ( 2 ) OUTDOOR HISTORICAL DRAMAS THUNDERLAND : A drama about the life of Daniel Boone .

Colonial and After OLD HOMESTEAD PLAY Potash Bowl , Swanzey , New Hampshire ( Week end nearest July full moon ) Back before the Gay Nineties , Denman Thompson , aspiring to the stage , put the home-town folks of Swanzey into a sketch , and then into a play that was a hit for years . Today , in Swanzey 's // Potash Bowl , with some of the original backdrops and costumes , the heartwarming philosophy of Uncle Josh and the Yankee wit of Cy Prime seem to have lost none of their appeal . If you are wondering about that Potash Bowl , back in the days when good wood ashes could be traded at the store for tea or silk , potash ( ashes that have been boiled in a pot , to be sure ! ) for the making of soap was an export of Swanzey . The natural depression where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rediscovered and used as a natural amphitheater for the play that was practically a page out of the story of Swanzey . Today you can pass by a little log ticket office and wander down the old road , through a delightful pine and oak woods , to an amphitheater and rough wooden stage nestled among the trees . You get acquainted with Rickety Ann and the Hoboken Terror and One of the Finest , and you are in the mood to enjoy thoroughly the fine double quartette that slowly follow the yoke of oxen and their load of hay . You chuckle as Uncle Josh sums up the tramp : " I guess you are a good deal like a singed cat ? you feel better than you look . " And you know without being told that " Rickety Ann et so much puddin' ' en ' milk she could n't eat no pie . " And , of course , you know also that Josh will find his erring son on the sidewalks of wicked New York , but somehow that does n't make it any the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ticket Office , Swanzey , N.

( 2 ) // COLONIAL DAY Castleton , Vermont ( First Wednesday in August ) Castleton 's Colonial Day combines a serious showing of a dozen finer-than-usual colonial homes with tally-ho rides and a morning parade showing anything from " Discovery of Artificial Lure " ( his mother 's silver spoon with the handle chopped off ! ) to " A Country Auction " or the Boy Scout 's " Indians and Green Mountain Boys . " ( Anything can happen , your program soberly warns you . ) Castleton is the home of the famous " house-joiner " Thomas B. Drake , and he has used his trade-mark , graceful arches , to lovely effect in several homes . Many of the houses also offer exhibits of pewter , early fashions , and other interesting details of early Connecticut 's gracious and sturdy way of life . The library often brings in some fine temporary exhibits ; one year it was a famous collection of Currier and Ives prints . Your admission fee forwards the work of the local historical society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) THANKSGIVING DAY Plymouth , Massachusetts Thanksgiving Day at Plymouth is a matter of simple dignity . Quietly the " Pilgrims " gather at Plymouth Rock , the women , down to the tiniest daughter , in white kerchief and cap , the men with their steeple-crowned hats , wide belts , and long rifles . There are fifty of them ? just half the number that stepped ashore on Plymouth Rock , and many of those bear the same names as their forefathers who survived that first terrible winter . At the long roll of the drum , each takes his own place in // line as an old account describes their armed procession to worship . At the head of the line stands " Governor Bradford , " in his Iong robe of office ; on his right , the preacher , " Elder Brewster , " and on his left , the captain of the sidearms , " Miles Standish . " Behind the rolling drum the little procession moves up Leyden Street ( the first street in Plymouth ) and across Town Square to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple service , very much as the Pilgrim Fathers worshiped . You sing , as they did , from Psalm 86 , " Bow down Thine ear , Jehovah , answer me . " And with others who have remembered these fifty people , you sing , " The breaking waves dashed high On a stern and rockbound coast . . . . They have left unstained what there they found , Freedom to Worship God . " This " Pilgrim 's progress " is also enacted each Friday afternoon at 5 o'clock during August . During Thanksgiving Day , many of the old houses are open , with costumed hostesses who serve cider and doughnuts to all visitors . There is a pageant showing events taken from Governor Bradford 's own Chronicle , and many places to visit , including a replica of the first steep-gabled , thatched-roofed house . Costumed hostesses at the tourist-information booth will find you a room and start you on the Historic Trail . And , of course , all of the hotels and restaurants serve bountiful New England Thanksgiving dinners . Along the historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see Governor Bradford 's own records of this independent Pilgrim republic . In the Mayflower Compact they had highlighted with remarkable clarity the three essentials of a government by the consent of the governed : ( 1 ) a working citizenship ? " we covenant to convene and combine ourselves into a body politic " ? ( 2 ) constantly changing laws without partiality , " to frame such just and equal laws . . . from time to time as shall be thought most convenient for the general good of the Colony , " and , lastly , ( 3 ) " we promise all due submission and obedience . " Under this pact they instituted the town meeting , established // trial by jury as the right of every citizen , and passed the first building code , voting that all thatched roofs should be replaced by board ones . Before they had time or inclination to build a jail , they dealt briefly and potently with disturbers of the peace by fine and the stocks . Most interesting of all , under this one pact they tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had enjoyed one year of the latter that they proclaimed a day of thanksgiving to God . The year 1621 is usually given as the date of the first Thanksgiving , and there probably was a more or less spontaneous feast , prompted by their return to health after the sickness of the first winter , which was spent largely aboard the Mayflower , and by the arrival of Chief Massasoit and some of his people in a festive mood . But it was known , even then , that their supplies " would not hold out above 6 months at half allowance , and hardly that , " as Governor Bradford records . After still another year of communal work and famine , early in 1623 " they begane to thinke how they might raise as much corne as they could , and obtain a better crope than they had done , that they might not still thus languish in miserie . " At length , " after much debate of things , the governor , with the advise of the cheefest amongst them , gave way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . " The effect , the governor records , was amazing . " The women went willingly into the field and took their little-ons with them to set corn , which before would alege weakness , and disabilitie , whom to have compelled would have been thought great tiranie and oppression . " After some sage observations concerning the two systems , Bradford concludes that men , dependent on their own labors only and not on the community , " had need that God would give them their dayly tirade above all people in the world . " It was that autumn , 1623 , that they proclaimed a general day of thanksgiving , as their practical governor records , " so as any general want or famine hath not been amongst them since this day . " ( 2 ) // OLD STURBRIDGE VILLAGE Sturbridge , Massachusetts ( Continuous ; week ends in winter ) See Part One , Chapter III , 1 , pp. 16-24 . PATRIOTS ' DAY Lexington , Massachusetts ( April 19 ) See Part One , Chapter III , 2 , pp. 24-34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut ( Any patriotic occasion ) Connecticut is the old fife-and-drum state from ' way back , so if you are in those parts on Memorial Day , or other patriotic celebration , try to locate one or the other of the two oldest fife-and-drum corps , at either Waterbury or Chester . Each will be in its own town on Memorial Day , and probably on Armistice Day , but are likely to be almost anywhere else on other occasions . The Mattuck Drum Band , of Waterbury , played at the 175th anniversary celebration of the signing of the Declaration of Independence , at Philadelphia , and was reviewed by General Wainwright when the battle flags were returned to the state capitol in 1947 . It makes twenty to thirty appearances every year . The Chester corps marched at the World 's Fair in New York , // and was the only nonservice band to have played on the Tarawa when that aircraft carrier spent the Fourth in New Haven . In a Hartford parade of eight thousand marchers they took first prize for reasons that the judges found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about that music that gets you . " Both play at the annual Revolutionary Pageant at Lebanon ( mentioned elsewhere in this section ) . The Mattuck Drum Band boasts an unbroken history from its founding in 1767 . Its oldest member carries eighty winters , but with the youngest member not much more than eight , it has no idea of dying out yet for awhile . Their uniform is an authentic copy of the Connecticut colonial soldier 's uniform ? a blue coat trimmed with red facing and brass buttons , buff pants and vest , and , of course , a tricorn hat with pompom on the left denoting rank . Black shoes and leggings with a brown band top off their jaunty marching with a natty turned-downboot effect . The Chester corps has to lop a straight hundred years off the Mattuck record , but is , nevertheless , the second-oldest active corps in the country . It plays the same old-time tunes and , what is more important , the same " ancient drumming " that brought the Minute Men to Lexington and became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apprenticeship for " ancient drumming " means three years ' practice on a barrel head . Revolutionary drums , made for taking the place of a whole band and for sounding alarums over hills and through woods , are about twice as deep as modern snare drums , give a slower , more stately cadence , and produce , according to the spectacular understatement of James B. Williams of the Mattatuck Drum Band , " considerably more volume . " The Chester corps had to move its winter indoor practices from the low-ceilinged firehouse because the concussion of the drums kept bursting the light bulbs . It is reluctantly admitted that it was also hard on the ears of the corps . The repertoire includes such battle-honored tunes as " Frog // in the Well , " " Roving Sailor , " " Brice 's Address , " " Kitchen Door , " and , of course , " Yankee Doodle . " George Sessions Perry , writing in the Saturday Evening Post about the Chester corps , gives a succinct summary of this old martial music : " Like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help being struck by its healthy , tangy veracity .

" ( 2 ) LEBANON PILGRIMAGE AND CAMPOREE Lebanon , Connecticut ( Probably last Friday and Saturday in June , but inquire ) This is one of New England 's rare pageants , and a very colorful one , too . To make up for that aberration from the norm , it is a pageant and celebration in honor of hard work and comparative anonymity . Not that Connecticut 's Governor Jonathan Trumbull , the only one of the thirteen governors not appointed by the king , and the man referred to by later admirers as the builder , owner , and " commander-in-chief of the largest part of what there was of an American navy , " could be called anonymous . But still and all , compared to General Washington , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Americans appreciate this business executive and patriot . Worse yet , according to Lebanon folk , too few young Americans appreciate the principles of hard work and the pride of ownership in America that produced men like Governor Trumbull and his four famous sons . Odd , nostalgic phrases run through // the program booklet of this Boy and Girl Scout Pilgrimage and Camporee , and through the other descriptions of the festivities . They crop up in the most unlikely places , including the display ads of business firms that are the pillars of Connecticut industry : " individual energy , " " impoverishment for those who gave us our country , " " pride of ownership of the heritage , " " hard work , and hard work alone , " " much cause for gratitude , " " by word , deed and suggestion to the youth of today , " and General MacArthur 's famous dedication , " I shall dedicate all of my energies to restoring to American Life those immutable principles and ideas which your forebears and mine handed down to us in sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting . On a greensward stage at the end of the long Lebanon commons , four thousand visitors and Scouts share , first , a scene in the general store that , in 1732 , belonged to Governor Trumbull 's father . Even then there were Tories , and one of them finds his way into the store . Rumblings of the storm increase , and then a dispatch rider hands the governor and his four sons news of the Lexington " butchery . " The call of the town crier quickly brings out a swirling mass of ox-drivers , the governor 's horse guards , three fife-and-drum corps , soldiers , and citizens . The Trumbull store becomes the Connecticut war office . Here the Connecticut Council of Safety held 1,145 official meetings . Here they read and promptly acted upon hundreds of pleas from General Washington for his destitute army . You see the start of a herd of three hundred head of donated cattle , and the hard wintry journey to Valley Forge ? a journey that undoubtedly prevented the almost inevitable collapse of the Continental Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let all that are able , show themselves ready in behalf of their country and come forth and help .... " It is said that over in the little meetinghouse the governor 's wife responded by laying on the table before the altar her red cape , a gift from La Fayette ( or was it Count Rochambeau ? ) . There followed jewelery , blankets , and clothing , including a pair // of very large boots brought by a very small boy . Madam Trumbull 's cape , it is said , was torn into strips and used for facings of officer 's uniforms . To the meetinghouse , also , were brought the tons of supplies captured by the three hundred " privateers " owned and operated by businessman Trumbull . " Privateers , " in this case , is a brave designation for a thirty-foot rowboat , manned by four to eight men , and carrying ( usually ) a tiny swivel gun in the prow , whose recoil must have nearly swamped the craft . It is not adequately explained how such craft overhauled and overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors , but do it they did , and the captured supplies were sent by ox train to the meetinghouse at Lebanon , sorted , repacked , and sent on to Washington . In the stirring finale of the pageant , a torchlight procession of horse guard , Continental Army , and citizens parades through the amphitheater to the stage , and the entire cast of four hundred appears in torchlight and shadow . There are , of course , other parades , too , but no celebration of the end of the war or horses for spangly dignitaries to ride . Governors and generals lead out on their own two feet , and right smartly , too . Probably there will always be the " Connecticut , Foundation of Liberty , " float , just as it appeared in the Washington inaugural parade . There are church suppers with baked beans and ham ; and over the years , the voice of General Washington , in what were , for that harassed gentleman , very unaccustomed words , " You of Connecticut have never let us down , Brother Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Street , New London , Conn. ( 2 ) // DOGWOOD Valley Forge , Pennsylvania ( April ) There are dogwoods to be seen elsewhere , but few in as varied and pleasant setting and none that bring as poignant memories as those at Valley Forge . The blunt end of a valley that Washington chose to fortify as winter quarters , with hills protecting his rear and a commanding view of the valley route to Philadelphia , makes a lovely park for the same reasons that it made a commanding military post . Wide lawns sweep over valleys and hills , with fringes and hills of woods . And at every turn and over every hill are dogwood , pink and white , a tall , statuesque tree at a branch of the road , or low , angular hushes scattered casually back of a wide grassy slope . Crowning the highest hill , without interruption of tree or building , is the great memorial arch bearing the now well-known words that Washington wrote to Congress in his many attempts to get food and shoes for his heroic soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not enough admire the incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiery . " If you go on the Sunday designated as Dogwood Day , you will drive bumper to bumper for miles . You will see the lovely dogwood and the memorial arch , and probably hear the carillion playing , and little else . But there is much to see and much to remember in these hills . There is the tent in which General Washington lived for several weeks in late December and early January . Although the farmhouse that became his headquarters was always open to him , the general would not sleep in comfort while his men were still sleeping in the open . We have his specifications for the huts that were to be built , just long enough for triple bunks on each side , and wide enough for a fireplace between the bunks at one end and a door at the opposite end ? twelve men to a hut . These are gradually being // rebuilt here and there where different companies were stationed . There is the chapel , with some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the museum there are interesting old maps showing the forge that the British had earlier destroyed , down by the stream , and there is a most complete collection of portraits of Washington , from early manhood to his last days , some of which must show more of the imagination of the artist than the features of the future president . The fine stone farmhouse that was the general 's headquarters has been refurnished , including the interesting downstairs kitchen . It is here in these hills that men endured cold and hunger seldom equaled till the advent of total war and concentration camps . There is this distinction between Valley Forge and modern war or camps : these men were here of their own choice . Many of them deserted , and any of them could have . It is here that Baron von Steuben , fresh from the spit-andpolish of his Prussians , came , also of his own choice , to help create an army out of a rabble of stubborn farmers . It is from here that he wrote back in astonishment to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , Do this , ' and he does it . Here I must say , Do this because  --  ' and then he does it . " It is here that the fortunes of the infant republic were built , by discipline , disease and starvation ? here where no battle was ever fought . ( 2 ) ROSE RENT CEREMONY Manheim , Pennsylvania ( First Sunday in June ) For the consideration of " five shillings and ... in the month of June yearly , forever hereafter , the rent of One Red Rose if the same shall be lawfully demanded , " Henry William Stiegel // and Elisabeth his wife yielded and paid lot number 220 to the German Lutheran congregation at Manheim , Pennsylvania . So reads the yellowed deed that you can see if you visit the Manheim Lutheran Church on the first Sunday in June when they pay the yearly quitrent to an heir of " Baron " Stiegel . The pompous diction of the deed is unmistakably Stiegel . So is the deep need to be loved and remembered that seems to have driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . We are not sure what part of Germany he came from ; we do not know where he is buried , and much of what we know about his life between those two events comes from cold legal records of his many and stupendous business dealings . He and his mother appear on the dock at Philadelphia as penniless immigrants . Nevertheless , young Stiegel seems to have been rather well educated . Perhaps if we knew what frustrations may have brought them to this wilderness it would shed some light on his driving , restless soul . Starting at the bottom , he soon became owner and operator of one of the " furnaces " that smelted the high-grade surface ores of Penn 's wilderness and that made the six-and-ten plate stoves in defiance of British regulations . When relations with Britain began to get strained , Stiegel took a good look at the importedglass market and then built a " glass house , " where he installed glassblowers from Venice and England and produced what was America 's first flint glass and what has remained some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome-shaped ? a hundred feet to the top of the cupola and , like everything else the baron did , stupendous . His second mansion contained a tapestry of a hawking scene with lifesized figures , and a famous fireplace framed in blue tile imported from Delft . And the peak of the roof was squared off to form a platform from which musicians gathered to pipe him in whenever the lookout , posted for that purpose , espied his flying equipage and set off the signal cannon . His carriage was not difficult to distinguish , for he traveled with outriders before // and ranging half a mile on each flank and a pack of hounds loping in the rear . At the sound of the cannon and the music , the whole town , of course , turned out to welcome home their picturesque " baron . " He entertained stupendously , as would be expected , and , apparently for that purpose , built " towers " on hills ? pyramidal structures of heavy timber , often seventy feet high , painted red and topped with a signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his music , which he loved , and with his religion , which he expounded to his humble villagers in the chapel which occupied the second floor of his mansion . At the height of his success , he was considered the richest man in Pennsylvania , and his varied businesses were given constant vitamins in the form of the first advertising in the American tradition ? surprising and lots of it . But in spite of the fabulous scenes he set , he died in poverty and was forgotten for a hundred years . In the late nineteenth century , when America began to discover that we , too , have a history and antiques , the rich colors and lovely shapes of Stiegel glass began to bring back the memory of the name that he had sought so picturesquely to enshrine . A little later , when the odd deed came to light and the Manheim church began a nationwide search for an heir of Stiegel , he again broke into the news . At the Manheim church there is on display , along with the deed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the recently renewed rose payment is a picture showing pensive little girls with sailor hats on the hacks of their heads , willowy ladies with bustles , and pompous and whiskered gentlemen ; underneath is the inscription , " They form in slow procession and drop their roses , one by one , within the chancel rail . " Today the ceremony is very simple ? not at all what the " baron " would have planned . The baron is remembered only partly for his eccentricities , but also because he produced beauty , was openhandedly generous , and had tremendous faith in himself and in America ? or , perhaps , because he was so American . ( 3 ) // FLAG WEEK Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ( Week of June 14 ) The narrow little Betsy Ross House , with its sidewalks of large worn stones , its clasped-hand symbol of one of the earliest mutual fire companies , and its kitchen in the basement , is , of course , the logical place to visit on Flag Day . You can see the house any day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to your visit a stirring parade down Philadelphia 's Parkway , which will probably include the famous Fairmount Park Mounted Guard , bands and sparkling service units , and veterans of all kinds , including men whose parents came to America from such fighting countries as Ireland and Greece . On Sunday you can attend services in the Chapel of the Four Chaplains , and on School Day in pleasant Independence Square the school children will tell " What the Flag Means to Me . " There will also be colorful folk dances that Americans from all over the world have brought to us from their homelands . While you are there , of course , you wo n't miss taking some time for Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell . ( 2 ) WILLIAMSBURG RESTORATION Williamsburg , Virginia ( Common Glory , July I to Labor Day , daily except Monday ; also Christmas ) Virginia is the home of Patrick Henry , the first statement of the Bill of Rights , the Bill of Rights itself , and the first formal resolution to independence . On May 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , Virginians unanimously passed a resolution that the General Congress of the colonies declare the // United Colonies free and independent and absolved from any allegiance to the Crown of Britain . They further instructed their delegates to give consent ( presumably at their judgment ) to whatever measures may be thought proper and necessary by the Congress for forming a confederation of the colonies . Then the Virginia Convention recessed and hauled down the British flag and ran up the " Grand Union , " which had already been used by Washington 's army . After that , they adopted a state constitution that has become a model for many other states , improved George Mason 's Bill of Rights , took it with them to Congress , and elected Patrick Henry first governor of the state . These men were the landowners , the princes , the same breed that in England had been hacking away at the royal powers for generations . They understood government ; they knew how to manage their own affairs , and , as has been remarked by various historians , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American independence was simply " in the cards . " Britain here self had bred it . The Prelude to Independence is usually celebrated at Williamsburg in different ways each year . One year 's commemoration included the gathering of exiled leaders of Iron Curtain countries to sign the Williamsburg Declaration of 1952 , looking toward the liberation of their countries . During the summer , The Common Glory , a drama hailed by some critics as " uncommonly glorious , " is presented each evening with lovely Lake Matoaka for a backdrop . It gives the warm and dramatic story of these years of beginning for our country . Fall brings Saturday candlelight tours of the old capital and lovely candlelight concerts . Christmas is everything that you would expect . Carolers strolling the streets , candles in every window , music and pageants in the churches , and feasting from old recipes in the grand style in all the inns .

It was one of the earliest practical moves toward what later became known as " the Good-Neighbor Policy , " and it has increased in social brilliance through the years . The school exhibits , the parade , the brilliant Colonial Ball , and the famous Noche Mexicana , sponsored by the League of United Latin-American Citizens , all draw heavily from both sides of the border .

Barbourville , only recently becoming conscious of the history // and inspiration for this day that lie in its mountains , captures some of this in its autumn Boone Festival . A trip to the dramatic Gap in flaming fall dress would be worth while just for picturetaking enjoyment . Barbourville adds a two-day festival of Indians , parade , muzzle-loading shooting match , hog-calling and square dancing . Chief Standing Deer , who shepherds his tribe from Cherokee , North Carolina , looks every inch a chief , even without his feathers . His is a wrinkled face , wise and humorous . After an Indian dinner on Friday evening one year , Cherokee high school students gave a play honoring Daniel Boone , the man who led in the settlers that chopped down the trees and spoiled the hunting grounds of their ancestors . Saturday morning usually keeps you busy , with demonstrations by Chief Standing Deer and Vice-Chief McKindley Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hornblowing , hog-calling , wood-chopping , and a band concert on the square . Perhaps the biggest event of the morning is a shooting match of muzzle-loading rifles . " Furriners " and city folk , including at times women ( who may even carry off first honors ) compete with ancestral sharpshooters from Stinking Creek and Knox County . The records , by the way , make some of those yarns about shooting the fleas off a squirrel sound true . You 're likely to have to do 1/64 of an inch from dead center , or better , to beat the champion ! Some time you must wander about town and see the priceless antiques that are displayed in many of the store windows . The parade is the last big event , with bands , Indians , men with rifles and beards marching beside their families in covered wagons , and everybody and his cousin costumed in memory of some part of our first westward pioneering .
