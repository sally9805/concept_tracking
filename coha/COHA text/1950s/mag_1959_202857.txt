Toward the tag end of winter , when the Oxford or Cambridge undergraduate has been sewn into the hair shirt of academic strictures for dismal months , he begins to itch . As Geoffrey Chaucer ( Oxford or Cambridge , circa 1360 , according to tradition ) wrote about the approach of spring , " thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages . " Last week at both universities , students were dreamily reviewing intricate plans for a modern form of the pilgrimage - the scholarly expedition . Some 20 such safaris-a record-breaking number-will set out from Oxbridge this June . They range from a one-undergraduate orchid hunt in Venezuela ( the hunter got the idea while stalking frogs last summer in the same area ) to a nine-man botanical , oceanographic and archaeological assault by Cambridge on British Honduras . <P> There are two categories of undergraduate expedition : 1 ) scholarly , and 2 ) really scholarly . Presumably of the first sort is the trip planned by one Cantabrigian , who advertised for an " attractive young lady for Norwegian tour . Must be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both kinds cost money , and for purposes of wheedling cash and supplies an impressively academic purpose is a requirement . Said one expedition veteran : " The trick is to decide which place in the world you most want to visit , then find some compelling scientific or historical reason for going there . " <P> Daisy of Maldon . Even if a proposed expedition is irreproachably scientific , wheedling is not easy . Every set of outward-bound scholars wants free cameras , sleeping bags , Aqua-Lungs and cars . One persuasive undergraduate was able to separate two Land Rovers some years ago from the firm that makes the rugged , cross-country cars , but lesser gifts are more common . Toilet paper , for some reason , is showered on expeditions , and not long ago a Cambridge expedition received several cases of highly negotiable whisky . <P> Sometimes the scholarly alms-asking goes wildly awry ; one outfit mailed out letters advising businessmen that " we shall be happy to carry any product which , due to its distinctive shape or color , would be easy to publicize in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Addresses got shuffled , and the letter was sent to a venerable trust fund whose officers were considering ( but immediately ceased to consider ) a request to support the group 's lofty scientific aims . <P> Some scholarly junkets operate on the principle that lofty aims are more effective if all the aiming is not in the same direction . Eight Cantabrigians who will set out in June for Arguin Island , off the Atlantic coast of French West Africa , in a 15-ton ketch called Daisy of Maldon , plan to do hydrographic surveys for the Admiralty , poke archaeologically at a 18th century Portuguese fort , skindive for wrecks , and test the effects of a four-man jazz combo on African ears . " Also , " says Expedition Leader Anthony Churchill ( no kin ) , " we may try distilling gin from seaweed . " Oxford 's Exploration Club is sending out a group which will exhaustively classify the flora and fauna in a mountain-locked Tanganyika valley .                  @ @ @
