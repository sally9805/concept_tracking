It was only four days before curtain time , but the Metropolitan Opera 's brave new production of Mozart 's Cos Fan Tutte was trembling and acold . At rehearsal , the singers were tired and downcast . Stage Director Alfred Lunt was slumped in a front-row seat , clasping his head . From the pit came the low , gruff voice of Veteran Conductor Fritz Stiedry : " Alfred ! Be very angry . Make a big scene . " <P> Lunt began working himself into a scene . He uncoiled from his seat , strode onstage and eyed the silent singers . " You 've forgotten everything I 've told you , " he said , with cold distinctness . " Even being opera singers is no excuse for your acting . . . You look like bowls of cold , rancid oatmeal . " <P> It worked like a tonic . Last week first-nighters saw a production of Mozart 's comedy of 18th century manners that made Met history . <P> Six Easy Lessons . When General Manager Rudolf Bing first asked Actor Lunt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was to make it " light , gay and elegant . " Protested Lunt : " You can not get those opera singers up on their points with six lessons from Madame LaZonga. " * But once he had listened to Mozart 's elegantly subtle score ( unheard at the Met since 1928 ) , Lunt accepted the challenge . <P> The story , titled in English , Women Are Like That , is pure meringue . An old cynic named Don Alfonso bets two naive young friends that their fiances , " the firmest of characters , " can be cozened into being untrue . Sure enough , the young blades disguise themselves and , ably abetted by the old cynic and the masquerading ladies ' maid , Despina , win each other 's sweethearts . The gentlemen 's bittersweet despair lasts just long enough to round out an opera , and everybody ends up in the right arms . <P> The problem , as Lunt 's practiced eye saw it , was " taking the affectations of our ancestors and making them endearing . " He laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway actors . When he finally got a chance to drill the singers , he had most of their movements plotted like a minuet ( " If you beat your breast , I 'll kill you ! " ) . All told , he had the cast onstage for 17 hours of instructions , cajolings and threats . <P> That was only part of his job , as he saw it . He also rushed around in the Christmas crush , getting exactly the right kind of wine glasses ; he set his famed actress wife Lynn Fontanne to sewing lace hankies for " my girls , " later , sent her backstage to perk up one discouraged singer with a little flattery . He huddled for hours with Designer Rolf Gerard on how to frame chamber-sized Cos in the yawning spaces of the Met 's big stage . Gerard 's solution : a chamber-sized stage contrived by drapes and latticed arches , brilliantly simple sets in handsome pastels and white . <P> A New Regular . When the curtain went up , Stage Director Lunt himself pranced out in maroon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waved a couple of latecomers to their seats , then went through the stage business of lighting a row of electric footlights with a taper , all to great applause .
