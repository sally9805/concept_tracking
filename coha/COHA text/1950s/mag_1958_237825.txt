SIVA , the Creator-Destroyer of Hinduism 's trinity , once stood on a demon and with one of his four arms began to shake a little hand drum . To the beat of this rhythm Siva moved his body , and with his movement the world took shape ; he danced on and on until creation was completed . <P> Always and almost everywhere , dancing has accompanied religion . The Egyptians danced for their sacred bull , and the Babylonians danced in their temples and processions . King David " danced before the Lord with all his might " ( 11 Samuel 6:14 ) , and the Old Testament Hebrews danced in their vineyards on the Day of Atonement . The Greeks danced in honor of Apollo , of Pan , of Artemis , and in the ecstatic mysteries of Dionysus . In Islam , the Mevlevi dervishes still dance in patterns designed to expound cosmic laws as well as to achieve a state of inner peace . <P> Religious dancing has all but died out in the Christian West-probably the last to use it regularly are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages , among the peoples of Asia dancing is still an organic and important part of religion ; each step and gesture , even a finger 's tilt , may be loaded with metaphysical meaning . Costumes are designed according to ancient and elaborate convention : in a classic Indian dance drama called Kathakali , the makeup alone often takes from early morning until late in the afternoon . The music accompanying dancers in the East ranges from the Kathakali 's ceaseless thunder of drums ( the drummers work in relays ) to the Burmese Zat Pw orchestra of a dozen varied instruments-teakwood xylophones , ivory horns , cymbals , Whether the dances tell stories of the gods , as do the Kathakali , seek to divine answers , like Burma 's spirit dancers , or combat evil , like Ceylon 's Devil dancers , the worshipers of the East continue Siva 's sacred swaying.
