General Marcos Perez Jimenez , 44 , the plump , well-manicured ex-dictator of Venezuela , got a rude order last week from the U.S. Immigration Service : get out of the country by April 15 . Perez Jimenez has been living in a $300,000 mansion in Florida on a temporary visa and a diplomatic passport given him , in a show of chivalry , by the revolutionary junta that bounced him from office 15 months ago . <P> The fallen dictator is a source of embarrassment for the U.S. in its relations with the new , democratically elected Venezuelan government , which accuses him of looting and terrorizing the country . The State Department said that it had " conferred " with the Immigration Service on the expulsion order and agreed that it " is in accord with the best interests of the U.S. " Perez Jimenez ' Miami lawyer predicted that he could keep his client in the U.S. " for at least two or three years " before all legal devices are exhausted .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
