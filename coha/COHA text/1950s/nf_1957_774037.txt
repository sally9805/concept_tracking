txt The Arabian Horse In America Gen.

The Georgia certificate for True Whig which supplies that name is borne out by the fact that in four successive generations of the immediate descendants of Apollo 's dam there were fillies called Diana ASB , i , 340 . " When it comes to naming the importer of Apollo 's dam the primary evidence is silent . The Kentucky tradition , above referred to , that the importer was Gen. Spotswood of Virginia ' ; i.e. , Alexander Spotswood 1746-1818 , is contradicted by the date 1763 of the importation of the mare ; for in that year Alexander Spotswood was a boy at Eton William &; Mary Quarterly , ii , 13 .

The tradition which has related Apollo 's dam to the Spotswood stud can not , however , be ignored and it is , happily , possible to give it a reasonable explanation . The evidence being that the mare came out of the Duke of Kingston 's stud , whence John Spotswood , in partnership with his brother-in-law later also his executor Bernard Moore 1720-1772 of Chelsea ' in King William , had drawn Jolly Roger in 1750 , Bernard Moore is indicated as the importer of the mare and the breeder of Apollo foaled 1767 ; and the deduction follows that it was from that uncle that Alexander Spotswood acquired Apollo and perhaps Apollo 's dam also , after his return to Virginia from his education in England . " The earliest primary evidence of ownership of Apollo 's dam in Virginia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Chatham ' , when he mated her with his Regulus son of Fearnought 61 The Arabian Horse In America to produce True Whig . As Col. Fitzhugh is proven also to have been the owner of Apollo 's full sister Diana II , by Fearnought , to which the tentative date 1770 is here assigned , it may be further deduced finally that William Fitzhugh acquired both that filly and her dam either from the Moore estate after Bernard Moore 's death in 1772 , or from A.

In the development of the light horse breeds , the Barb horse , after an influential beginning , gradually became less and less of a factor in the American and English breeding picture . The Oriental , or Arabian is now , of course , recognized as the source of all the foundation animals from which the American and English Thoroughbreds have sprung and , as we know , all such stock ? plus other light breeds in the United States ? is directly descended from the Byerly Turk , the Darley Arabian and the Godolphin Arabian .

It is an attachment of a truly rational nature , and to a most worthy object .

Time and the improving faculties of man , gradually developed the various uses and qualifications of the horse . Endowed by nature with a portion of intellect , with a generous pliability of disposition and fortitude of heart , with vast and energetic bodily powers , he was found capable of bearing a sort of social part in all the pleasures and labours of man . He was associated with his master in the pleasures of the journey and the chase ; he shares willingly and with ardour in the dangers of the martial field ; and with a steady prowess partook in the humble labours of cultivating the soil for mutual subsistence .

This was the second printed book in America purporting to be a general stud book , and while much of the information in it needed clarification , it is regrettable that the second volume was never finished .

Keene Richards , A Kentucky Thoroughbred Breeder , Imports Arabian Horses A BOUT 1850 , one of the leading Thoroughbred breeders in the United States was a Mr. A. Keene Richards of Georgetown , Kentucky near Lexington , the Thoroughbred horse-breeding center of the world . He was considered a very thorough student of horse-breeding and pedigrees , and from his studies , he became convinced that the Thoroughbred of that day would be improved by an outcross with Arabian stallions . His belief was probably influenced by his knowledge of the breeding history of the Byerly Turk , the Darley Arabian and the Godolphin Arabian . Mr. Richards decided to try using Arabian stallions in his own breeding operations . At the time , one of the leading racing associations was the New Orleans Jockey Club of which Mr. Richards was probably a member , since he raced his horses at their meetings . He convinced this organization that it would be to the interest of Thoroughbred breeders to procure pure-bred Arab stallions , and the Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips to the Arabian desert countries . 102 A. Keene Richards , A Kentucky Thoroughbred Breeder , Imports Arabian Horses Mr. Richards ' first trip was made in 1851 to 1853 and the second in 1855 to 1856 . He is reported to have been the first American to go directly to the source to import pure-bred Arab stallions to the United States . On his second trip , he was accompanied by Mr. E. Troye , the noted animal painter , by his cousin , M. H. Keene and by a Syrian who was an interpreter and an Arabian horse expert . Soon after their arrival , the Syrian died and Mr. Richards had to spend the next seven months learning Arabic in order to deal with the Bedouins . His first importation consisted of two stallions and one mare , and the second consisted of three stallions and one mare . The horses were : Sacklowie , a bay stallion bred by the Anayza Bedouin ; Sadah , a gray mare ; Lulie , an Arab mare in foal to Ahzees Pasha 's chestnut Arabian , Bagdad ; Fysaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stallion ; Massoud , a chestnut stallion ; and Mokladi , a gray stallion . All are recorded in early American stud books . The first offspring from the mating of these five stallions with Thoroughbred mares was so impressive that , by 1857 , Mr. Richards had decided to offer their services to other owners of Thoroughbred mares . Within a couple of years after this the Civil War threatened and naturally , interest in horse-breeding was greatly curtailed , and Mr. Richards ' five stallions never had the great influence they might have had under different circumstances . Mr. Richards first bred five Thoroughbred mares to the best of his Arab stallions and from the first group of colts came the great race horse , Limestone . Another one became the dam of the famous Dorsey 's Golddust . Two or three mares in the highly successful stud of General W. T. Withers of Kentucky were sired by one of Keene Richards ' Arabs and Withers considered them to be his finest brood mares . Mr. Richards ' own comments on his experiences in importing these Arabian horses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be found in the East and cross them with our best mares . I made myself acquainted with the modern importations by going to England , France , and Spain , and examining the best Arabs belonging to these governments , visiting Morocco , and going through the interior of Algeria . I went to Tunis , thence to Egypt , and from Egypt through Arabian Perta and the desert east of Damascus as far as Palmyra . During this tour I selected Mokhladi , Massaoud and a grey mare , the first mentioned bred by the Tarabine tribe in Arabia Petra , and the latter by the Anayza tribe . " They arrived safely , and I immediately made arrangements to select some of our best mares to breed to them . The result was quite equal /0 ? The Arabian Horse In America to my expectations , and I commenced preparing to make another trip to the East , determining to spare no trouble or expense in procuring the best blood , as well as the finest formed horses in the desert . " For two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors as to where the purest blood was to be found , and comparing their views with my own experiences . I found that most authors who have written on the subject differ materially as to the facts ; and that those who have seen the Arab on his native soil know more about the idle legends of the country than about the fine points of a horse . " The first horse selected was a stallion from Beni-Zahr . This was a horse of superior form and blood , purchased from one of the Sheikhs of the tribe . Determined to have the best , this horse was afterwards exchanged for the bay horse Sacklowie ' Seglawi by giving considerable boot . This last importation consisted of the bay Sacklowie , a chestnut " Faysal , " ' supposed to be the best young horse in the Anayza tribe , a grey colt two years old , a mare and two dromedaries . " In making both of these importations I determined not to offer the services of any of the stallions to the public until they had shown some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them having borne off the prizes last fall 1856 over the best Thoroughbred stock in Kentucky , I was induced by some friends not to wait longer , but to give the breeders of Kentucky an opportunity to try the cross with some of our fine mares .

The Arabian horses and mares imported into the United States up to 1872 were registered in Volume I.

" Because Arabian horse owners in the United States formed the Arabian Horse Club in 1908 and registered as pure-bred Arabians those animals up to that time which had been imported or bred in the United States and which were accepted and listed as foundation animals , it hardly seems necessary to carry on and list any further Arabs registered in the American Jockey Club . The American Jockey Club continued to register pure-bred Arabs as Thoroughbred horses until November , 1943 , but the information so registered for the last twenty-five or thirty years is no more complete than that to be found in the registry of the Arabian Horse Club .

" 126 Chapter 10 Randolph Huntington Breeds Part-Bred Horses FOLLOWING the Civil War , Randolph Huntington was a partner in a drug house in New York City . He withdrew from this firm and moved to central New York where he engaged in the buying and selling of fine road and coach horses for the New York trade . His studies convinced him that the most desirable horses were descended from Standardbred horses rich in Arabian blood lines and for many years he devoted his attention to the breeding of horses particularly suitable for the carriage , coach and roadster trade . It was only natural then that he would have been interested in the stallions , Leopard and Linden Tree which General U. S. Grant received in 1877 as a present from the Sultan of Turkey . The following is a quotation from Jesse R. Grant 's book published by Harper &; Bros. in 1925 , under the title , " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning these two horses : " Constantinople in March is not the most delightful city in the world . . . . Upon the invitation of the Sultan , Abdul Hamid , father and I , accompanied by the American minister , visited the Royal stables . I saw 127 The Arabian Horse In America nothing in Constantinople that interested me more . Here were Arabian horses , scores of them , with pedigrees antedating Mohammed , if one is to credit the high Turkish official who acted as our escort . As for me , I am ready to believe that only centuries of selection and breeding could have produced such a number of horses so individually perfect and conforming so absolutely to type . " Father was particularly interested in the stallions , of which there were scores . The Turkish official asked father which pair of stallions he considered the best ? After careful examination , father indicated a pair of bays . The official made no comment , but asked father 's opinion as to the next best pair . This time father selected a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Grant , by order of the Sultan ' . " Astonished and embarrassed , father protested , but the official was firmly insistent . Father as firmly declined to accept the gift , but to temper his refusal he mentioned the fact that he had no way of getting them to America . " You have a man-of-war , General ' , smiled the Turk . Simply have the guns removed from one deck and there will be abundant space for stalls and exercising room ' . " With no more intention of accepting the gift than of transporting the animals as suggested , father was striving to express his appreciation and yet decline without giving offense , when the American minister intervened . He quickly explained that the gift must not be refused . To do so , no matter what the reason , could only give offense , and to the Sultan it would appear that father was dissatisfied with his gift . " Accept them , General ' , he urged , and then leave the matter to me . I will arrange it somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the responsibility , father accepted the Sultan 's gift , and left the rest to the minister . " About six months after my return home the pair of gray Arabian stallions arrived in New York . Father was still abroad , and I did not know what to do , but I accepted them and arranged for their shipment to the stock farm of General Beal , near Washington . I have no idea what became of the pair of bays , or who paid the shipping charges upon the pair I received . Neither do I recall that father ever mounted either of them , but I know there are many horses in this country with a strain of Arab blood that came from these grays . .. . Mr. Huntington immediately contacted General Grant , inspected the two horses and made arrangements to breed some high-class trotting mares of the Clay family to these two Arabian stallions . The mares were bred in 1879 and the first foals arrived in 1881. 128 Randolph Huntington Breeds Part-Bred Horses In 1884 , as a result , Randolph Huntington prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant 's Arabian Horses , Leopard and Linden Tree and Their Sons , Beale and Hegira . " Many well-known horsemen of the times were curious about the reasons for breeding these fine Standardbred mares to Arabian stallions , and since Mr. Huntington already had three stallions and two fillies , from one to three years old at the time , he outlined details concerning his breeding ideas and spoke of his decision to attempt to develop a national horse . A short description from Mr. Huntington 's book , of these five part-bred Arabs , later known as Clay Arabia horses , follows : " Beale is a golden sorrel , marked with a handsome straight white stripe in the face , gray at the root of the tail , a long white dash under the brisket , two white ankles forward , and nigh hind white sock . He was foaled June 25 , 1881 ; was got by Leopard from Mary Sheppard , a black-roan mare fifteen and one-quarter hands high , by Jack Sheppard by I lenry Clay , from his own daughter . Beale is fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint star and white on all four feet . Ile was got by Linden from Nell Pixley by Henry Clay ; was foaled Jmy 9 , 1882 , and stands fifteen and one-quarter hands high at three years old . Nell Pixley , his dam , was bred by Supervisor Pixley of Mon-roe County , New York . She is fifteen and one-half hands high , strong . " Islam is a dark chestnut , with two white ankles behind . He was got from Nell Andrews by Red Bird by Henry Clay ; was foaled May 12 , 1882 , and stands fifteen hands high at three years old . His dam is also a dark chestnut , with two white ankles behind and stripe in the face ; and her dam was also a dark chestnut mare inbred to Morgan blood . The dam of Islam is fifteen and one-quarter hands high . " Clayrabia is an iron-gray without white . She was by Linden from Miag Wadsworth by Colonel Wadsworth by Henry Clay , from Colonel 's own daughter . Clayrabia is fifteen hands and her dam fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1881 , and is much larger than her dam . " Claybeale Grant is a chestnut , with stripe in the face and three white legs , the nigh one forward and two behind . She was by General Beale , already mentioned and described ; she is also his first get . The dam of Claybeale Grant is Nell Andrews , who was also the dam of Islam by linden , and Islam was her virgin foal . Claybeale is the last of three foals I tom Nell , and is the largest at same age of the three ; and while all three were perfect and beautiful , this daughter of General Beals is the handsomest foal I have ever seen , except General Beals by Leopard , I i otn Mary Sheppard . /29 The Arabian Horse In America " It has been a challenging question to me since the spring of 1880 , why I bred to General Grant 's Arabians ? " My main reason for breeding to General Grant 's Arabs was the hope that something should grow into a national value from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves reflections covering a lifetime , hence my writings will be tiresome to uninterested persons . " Mr. Huntington devotes several pages of his discussion to explanations concerning the various part-bred Arabian horses and the results secured in France , Russia and elsewhere , in the production of a national horse through the use of Arab sires . While this is all very interesting reading , since it has no great value to present-day Arabian horse owners and breeders , this portion of his book is omitted . Mr. Huntington further states : " That others valued Arabian blood as I did was evident from occasional importations of it ; but in no case can I remember their use being credited . From 1840 to 1860 I knew of quite a number so imported , two standing at Boston , three in New Jersey , three in Maryland , two in Virginia , and four in Kentucky . " From the first , Arabian stallions worked into Kentucky , where they were used upon race-horse mares . Latterly , Mokhladi , Massaud , and Sacklowie , imported by the late A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon all kinds of darns , as well as thoroughbred running-breds . I am willing to believe the public did not know , in truth , the value of Arabian blood in the coach , road , and trotting-horse as well as race-horse . " When , however , credit is given to Kentucky for superior blood in her brood mares over any other State , and that superiority is credited to her thorough running-horse blood , which in an earlier day was the only type of horses she bred , we are inclined to look for a more direct cause . In doing so , we find that for forty years their dams have been under the influence of Arabian blood ; no less than five different Arabian stallions having been imported directly into Kentucky since 1850 . While these horses were obtained expressly to reinforce their running-horse blood , when they found it more important to breed general-purpose horses ( as coach , road , trotting-horses and workers ) , they had the allimportant Arabian blood to help them , whether to strengthen running or colder-bred mares . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one single instance ? of which I have many ? showing the direct and positive value of Arabian blood in the coach , and trotting-horse . In 1854 , Mr. L. L. Dorsey , of Kentucky , bred a ( laughter of the imported Arabian 130 Zilcaadie to a little inbred Morgan horse called Vermont Morgan . The get and produce was called Golddust , from his golden color . This colt , foaled in 1855 , was bred upon the principle of once out and thrice back to a primitive blood , for Justin Morgan was Arabian-bred . " The horse Vermont Morgan was but fourteen and three-quarters hands high , and was inbred to Justin Morgan 's blood . Now , when he is put to the daughter of imported Zilcaadie , one of the most beautiful stallion colts known in this country was the result ; I mean L. L. Dorsey 's stallion Golddust . He grew to be sixteen hands high , weighing very / ? / The Arabian Horse In America nearly thirteen hundred pounds , and for trotting speed was the peer of anything before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never being beaten ; one of them was a match race for ten thousand dollars , which he won by over a distance . ' " As a getter , Golddust was the most positive sire for beauty , size , and wonderful trotting speed in his colts , calling to mind Andrew Jackson , similarly bred , also imported Messenger of similar breeding . It makes me nearly wild as I write , that I can not induce men to put away prejudice and use reason . I do not wish the reader to obey my teachings , but would beg of every man interested in the breeding of horses to think deep , embracing every opportunity to enlighten himself . We have already too many writers who demand their readers to do as they say in print ; I simply urge men to be better informed of themselves . " Such a crop of colts as were the first get by Mr. Dorsey 's Arabianbred horse had no parallel in the breeding of beautiful coach , road , and 132 Randolph Huntington Breeds Part-Bred Horses trotting-horses , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his son Henry Clay , all three being similarly bred to Arabian blood influence . Moreover , these sons and daughters of Dorsey 's old Golddust had the same high nervous temperament possessed by the get of Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay , also credited to the get of imported Messenger . " In the matter of Golddust , the war broke out , and his possibilities for Kentucky and the country at large were cut short . I remember a lot of horses and mares by Golddust , which Mr. Dorsey sent on to Long Island at the beginning of the war . They were in a large barn near John I. Sneidicker 's place , near the old Union track . I examined them many times , and will say that to-day , such good horses are rare . After the war , attempts to establish Golddust were frustrated from two causes ; first was owing to the multitude of coarse horses , more fashionable in the name , and second was the mistaken idea of improving the blood of Golddust through infusion of the blood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In America its instinct . Had Mr. Dorsey selected inbred Morgan and high-type Clay mares for his horse he would by this time have created a national coach , road , and trotting-horse ' without equal in the world . The same could have been accomplished with Messenger , or with Young Bashaw , or Andrew Jackson , or Henry Clay . The opportunities for a national horse ' have presented themselves , but have not been embraced because of want of intelligent application to the object upon the part of gentlemen of means . General William T. Withers , of Kentucky , is now working towards such a base . I know him to be creating a superior maternal foundation , but whether he will introduce the right form of blood in the male , remains to be seen . " Naturally , he will feel pride in establishing his breed through his Almont ; and while Almont did possess largely of Arabian blood through Andrew Jackson and Pilot , and the maternal foundation will be solid through Clay ' and Keene Richards 's Arab mares , his results would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he to make the king of his haras a direct descendant of a high-type Arabian stallion , through a Morgan , Jackson , or a Clay mare ; but small mistakes by the individual have disappointed more than one Napoleonic attempt . The General remembers that by the male are the names given ; and that rich mother-earth grows poor seed into prominence . Such seed , however , must be sustained by always rich mother-earth , for renewed vitality . God 's laws are perfect ; man can not improve upon them . Atavism , or sporting back , is more apt to come through the blood influence of the dam than of the sire . I will soon speak particularly of that . " But why did I breed to General Grant 's Arabs , you ask ? " When I have asked a man why he bred a mustang , his reply was , For fun ! Was there any sense in the act or in the reply ? " To this time I have been placing the argument so that reason within the reader would answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1860 ( maw twentyfive years ago ) , I had quite a little information upon blood and breeding of horses , ? more , indeed , than some men ever will have ; but as it is very unprofitable information , I trust all young men will not be so foolish as I have been . However , I was in the boat , so had to keep paddling and stopping the leaks at the same time ; and here I am today , barely afloat : I know , however , there is a safe harbor for me at the end . " We learn of great facts through deep problems , slowly . It takes time . Thorough investigations are very difficult . " From 1820 to 1.860 I believed I had made a careful inquiry and investigation into such Arabian stallions , with results , as had been imported to America to the date of arrival of the late Mr. Seward 's horses ; but the war was under way , stopping , for the time , all else . Randolph Huntington Breeds Part-Bred Horses " Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of Secretary Seward 's Arabian horses came up , and my search for them proved like most others of the kind : they had been thrown away . What was left to show for them was being credited to ' time-standard bred horses ' ; thus , the two best colts to date by one celebrated ' time-standard ' bred horse , are from a granddaughter of the only son of one of Seward 's Arabian horses , out of a granddaughter of Old Henry Clay ; which facts are not known , so the time-standard bred horse gets all credit for the two mares got by him . " Up to the time of the arrival of General Grant 's Arabians I could find no record of the attempts by any man or men to create , with intent and purpose , any specialty from the Arabian horse , while my investigations warranted an effort , as my writings have shown . " Russia and America demand coach , stage , and road-horses to a greater extent than any other nation ; and they must be of a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established her national horse upon that base of trotting instinct , and I have shown she did it upon the same Arabian blood used by England and France for their separate , distinctive national horses . " ' Haste is waste ' . I was prepared for the arrival of General Grant 's Arabs . I believed , as will any American , that they must be of the highest possible type . No empire or nation would insult herself by presenting to so great a man , also the one representative man of so great a nation as ours , an inferior gift from its representative animal life . General Grant 's Arabs had to be the purest and best . " The best results obtained by any crosses are not through abrupt , but by affinity crosses , with the instinct bending in the way you want . The Arab being plastic , reinforces a high-type of man 's creation by its more vitalizing blood . To breed it to the race-horse , makes that blood hotter and stouter in its instinct established ; and so with any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , nor is flour wheat ; and yet except for the wheat there would be neither flour , bread , cake , nor pie . So in breeding ; there must be the wheat , the seed ; the life . In horses it is the Arabian seed , blood , and life from which man can create . " I have implied that extreme physical conformations and developments , with rigid instincts as created by man , are very difficult to change . " We wanted a national horse of a type which should conform itself to our greatest demands ; which were stage , coach , road , and for track uses as trotters . " We could not afford to mould over the running-horse to such purposes ; indeed , time and money have proven it too uncertain . " We had the trotting instinct already moulded to a type we wanted ; /7S The Arabian Horse In America what we needed was to build this type up to a degree of superiority ; and the only way was to reinforce it with fresh , pure blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this General Grant had been sent from abroad in his two Arabian stallions , and he offered it to his people . " Upon their arrival the only blood we had adapted for good , prompt results , was that of Henry Clay . Its physical and instinctive organs would assimilate more readily than that of any other type of horses we had , because of itself purer in the primitive blood . It came nearer to Sir Thomas Morton 's saying of three hundred years ago , Once out and thrice back to a primitive blood for best results ' . " When the General 's horses arrived , I had two daughters of Old Henry Clay : both were got by him when he was owned in Monroe County , near Rochester , New York . One was a brood mare , being bred to a son of Henry Clay , her half-brother . I wanted virgin mares to send to Gen eral Grant 's horses , if I could find them . " I secured two young mares , coming four and five , in Michigan , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sisters , by Jack Sheppard by Henry Clay , out of his ( Jack 's ) own daughter . The next best son of Henry Clay was Colonel Wadsworth , bred by the late William W. Wadsworth , who owned Henry Clay . This stallion , with one of his own daughters , went to Nashville , Tennessee . I went there , and , although the stallion was dead , found four of his daughters , aged at the time from two to seven ( coming three to eight ) ; the youngest being by him from his own daughter . I took this filly with the two best of the other three . The two Mr. Jewett had , but the little filly I put one side with the two Sheppard fillies and one daughter of Henry Clay . I next went to New York City and bought back a young mare I had sold there the fall before for seven hundred and fifty dollars , as a road mare , allowing fifteen hundred dollars for her . She was bred near Rochester , New York , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inbred Morgan mare . I now had five young , sound , healthy , virgin mares by Henry Clay , or by his sons , three being inbred , and all were choice ; four being very fast The Arabian Horse In America natural trotters , and the fifth one would be were she not mixed at times in her gait . " All this had been done in the fall , winter , and spring of 1879 and 1880 , Grant 's horses arriving in the summer of 1879 . " These mares I considered up to the English standard of blood and breeding . " As a latter-day comment on the great value of Mr. Huntington 's breeding experiments , the following statement from the New York Herald Tribune , made by Baron Heftier , a Russian nobleman , and a breeder and owner of fine horses , is quoted : " I have made a very important discovery since I came to America , " said the baron , " and it is that of a family of Arabian horses from which the Darley Arabian came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not extinct , for there are representatives within a few miles of this city Oyster Bay . The Arabian horse is the yeast by which all horse flesh is leavened . He is the basis of all horse flesh . He is the primitive horse , pure and not mongrelized . The European governments know this and have spent millions of dollars trying to procure them for the development of their native types . The English people were very fortunate in securing the Darley Arabian , the parent of the English thoroughbred . " This one horse has been worth untold millions to them . Had they at the same time procured Arab mares of the same type , they would have been of inestimable value ; but they could not do it . When it was too late , they attempted to procure them , and , after twenty years of effort in the Orient , purchased two or three stallions and mares at an enormous expense , which they were not fortunate enough to keep , owing to the enterprise of an enthusiastic American , who became possessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this family , and keeping the blood pure , and has practically sacrificed his life to this noble task . " He has kept the fact rather secret that they were the family from which came the Darley Arabians . Recently , on account of his age , he sold his stock to younger men , who agreed to go on in the philanthropic work of keeping this species alive . They have several stallions and several mares each of which , I unhesitatingly state , is worth a king 's ransom . You may better appreciate this when I state that in my country I have heard the expression of willingness to give 500,000 rubles for one or two Arabian mares of this family . I am in hopes that our government will take advantage of the fact that these mares are in existence , and will arrange for the purchase of some of the progeny . " At about the same time the following appeared in The Rider and Driver : 138 Randolph Huntington Breeds Part-Bred Horses " SIX CLAY ARABIAN STALLIONS , AND TWO PURE ARABIAN STALLIONS AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known specimens of Arabian horses in the civilized world . Its Arabian stallions and mares range from 15 to 15.3 hands . They are of the family from which the Darley Arabian came . All other Arabians are 14.2 , and thereabouts , and are known as pony Arabs . All created types of thoroughbreds ? the Orloff , the Percheron , the English and Kentucky thoroughbreds ? are of Arabian basis . " Their Clay Arabians are a cross between the pure Arab and Henry Clay daughters . All breeders of fine horses know that Henry Clay , the greatest horse of his time , was close to the Arabian blood , his greatgrandsire being the imported Arabian Grand Bashaw . He was never beaten , and holds a record for endurance ( his Arabian inheritance ) of 76 miles in less than five hours , drawing a heavy two-seated surrey . " Their venerable predecessor saved Henry Clay blood to the world by infusion of Arabian blood . He also obtained the Maneghi-Hedruj Arabians brought out of the desert by Major Upton , and propagated the family of Arabians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Huntington Stud will give all its energies to the preservation of the Arabian and Clay blood selling its progeny yearly , offering this season six Clay-Arabian and two pure Arabian stallions at private sale . Stud service of both the pure Arabian and Clay-Arabians at $50 , $75 , and $100 . " The pair of horses sold to President McKinley for $7,000 were Clay Arabians , bred from this stock . Fourteen descendants of Abdul Hamid II , bred to good saddle and road-mares , sold by auction May 21 , 1901 , at the American Horse Exchange , averaged $1,439 each . " Baron Heftler , after his visit to the Huntington Stud at Long Island , took a three-month option , in the amount of $150,000 on ten head of pure-bred Arabian horses owned by that stud . He was attempting to have the Russian government purchase these horses for the establishment of a government stud to breed pure Arabian horses . Evidently this deal did not go through , and later on , some of these same horses were sold at auction .
