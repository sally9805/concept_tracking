THE END OF THE ROAD ( 230 pp. ) - John Barfh-Doubleday ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> " Where the hell else but in America could you have a cheerful nihilism ? " asks a leading character in this highly diverting book , which is a comedy with a tragic ending and , occasionally , a farce with a philosophical meaning . The character who asks the question is Joe Morgan , a history teacher at Wicomico State Teachers College , who has taught himself to " say good-by to objective values . " He believes that energy is " what makes the difference between American pragmatism and French existentialism . " <P> Joe has energy all right ; he is writing a thesis , plays catch with his wife and sons , and runs a troop of Boy Scouts . But Author Barth matches him with a crushing tragedy in the face of which his pragmatism is meaningless and his nihilism a cheerless thing . The agent of his undoing is the narrator of the book , Jacob Horner , one of the most fascinatingly dreadful characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " owl . peacock , chameleon , donkey and popinjay , fugitive from a medieval bestiary . " In more modern terms , he is also a manic-depressive , and a fugitive from a psychotherapeutic institution called the Remobilization Farm . <P> Days Without Weather . Horner , just turned 28 , has suffered a paralyzing case of " birthday despondency . " A sinister Negro doctor brings him out of it . In describing the doctor 's manifold therapies , Novelist Barth shows a true satirist 's hatred for all the quackery visited by blind belief in the healing powers of science upon muddled , addled and wicked souls . <P> The doctor 's methods include the Nutritional , Dynamic , Informational , Sexual , Devotional , Preoccupational , Virtue and Vice Therapies , not to mention Theotherapy and Atheotherapy . This genius-quack , " a kind of super-pragmatist , " tells Patient Horner : " It would not be well in your case to believe in God . Religion will only make you despondent . But until we work out something for you it will be useful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sartre and become an existentialist ? . . . Study the World Almanac : it is to be your breviary for a while . . . " <P> Jacob Horner goes off to the sunlit campus of Wicomico State Teachers , where he has wangled an instructor 's job ( English ) . He tries the World Almanac cure , but boning up on statistics about air line distances between principal cities only demonstrates that facts can not minister to a diseased mind . He knows his bad days , when there is " no weather , " a haunting waking and sleeping dream in which he is deprived of contact with the natural world . When Horner re-establishes contact with people , it is through the " pretty dedicated bunch " at Wicomico . Here he discovers his true calling , of an absolute rather than a theoretical nihilism.
