" We are builders , growers and healers , " said Dag Hammarskjold , chief of the U.N . ' s staff of international men in white , touring tense Middle East capitals last week . It was a U.N . healer , Ralph Bunche , who last won peace in Palestine seven years ago , and many highly placed observers think that just such a skilled and universally trusted international hand is needed there now . Climbing first out of his white U.N . plane at Cairo , Hammarskjold sewed up Egyptian consent to his plan for healing Egypt 's worst Israeli border sore spot , the demilitarized desert crossroads at El Auja , where blood flowed freely last November . Each side agreed to pull back its forces and let the U.N . go ahead and fix the demarcation lines . As <P> Hammarskjold 's C-47 took off from Cairo 's International Airport , a sleek new fighter plane flashed aloft from Almaza military airfield just four miles away The plane : one of the first of Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser 's new Russian MIG jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N . ' s soft-spoken Secre-tary-General ran into a brief flurry of newspaper criticism when he declined to attend a reception given by Israel 's Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett , because it . was to be held in the Israeli-held part of Jerusalem , which Jews now make their capital in defiance of a 1947 U.N . resolution recommending that Jerusalem be internationalized . <P> But Premier David Ben-Gurion sized him up as a valuable person to be traveling about the Middle East , buttonholed him at once to press his pet plan for Palestine peace-bilateral negotiations with Egypt 's Nasser under U.N . chairmanship . Ben-Gurion is pushing this idea to avert mediation by Western powers , and particularly to keep out the British , whom the Israelis regard as pro-Arab . As in Cairo , Hammarskjold listened sympathetically , and would only say that he had now " got a fairly complete map " of the problems .
