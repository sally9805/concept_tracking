THE ENEMY The Pied Piper of Peking As the Dutch steamer Tjiluwah sailed from Singapore for China last week , 1,150 yelling , wild-eyed Chinese stood on her decks , pelting dock police with fruit and garbage . The rowdies were " Nanyang " ( South Sea ) Chinese students from Malaya and Indonesia . <P> More than 10 million Chinese are scattered through Southeast Asia . Their loyalties are mixed . Since 1949 , Peking agents have moved in , set up newspapers and front groups , grabbed control of most of the Chinese schools . Indonesian-born parents complain that the Red teachers teach their children that loyalty to country-meaning Red China-is higher than loyalty to family . Red teachers openly urge their students to go to China to join the fight against the " brutalized Americans . " Then other agents appear , offering students passports and steamship tickets . <P> A trickle of Chinese youth started moving northward in 1951 . Last year Peking offered 2,300 scholarships to Nanyang students , padded the offer with promises of high-salaried government jobs after graduation . The trickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 9,000 Malayan Chinese and several thousand Indonesian Chinese have gone . <P> Peking is wooing the students for two reasons : they are young enough to indoctrinate , and they represent a means of getting at the tremendous wealth of the Nanyang . Warn the British in Malaya : " The moment educated youngsters get into institutions in China , they will be writing ' home ' for more and more money . ' ' The British in Malaya are so suspicious of the return traffic from China that in the past year they have barred 2,103 Chinese , more than half the applicants , though many are wives or children of Chinese in Malaya .
