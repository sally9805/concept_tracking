ONE OF THE most ' interesting educational publications of 1959 is a ninety-nine-page pamphlet by Robert H. Reid entitled American Degree Mills . The study , sponsored by the American Council on Education , is interesting both for what it says and what it does not say . What it says is that for more than 120 years , a number of foreign nationals have been getting phony degrees by correspondence " study " from phony institutions of higher education in the United States . The dimensiOns of the diploma-mill problem today are not susceptible to precise delimitation . According to Reid , a trade association which represents a large number of diploma mills asserts that their enrollment in one recent year was 750,000 students and that they did a business of around $750,000,000 a year . These figures included both foreign and domestic enrollments . There appear to be over 200 diploma mills located in at least thirty-seven states . Their " diplomas " are sold in forty-two countries and in all continents . The situation has repeatedly embarrassed the federal government , which under existing laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons provide some interesting insights into American education . As in the case of many rackets , the chief victims are unwilling or unable to publicize their grievances . This is especially the case with foreign students , who ordinarily lack the resources to initiate an action in this country , against the institutions involved . Furthermore , the victims often have a stake in letting sleeping dogs lie . For example , in situations where possession of a degree is an asset or a prerequisite to a good job , the " degree " holder is not likely to take any action which publicizes its fraudulent character . This fact is one of the biggest barriers to MYRON LIEBERMAN , The Nation 's educational consultant , is with the Educational Research Council of Greater Cleveland . His most recent book is The Future of Public Education ( Chicago U. Press ) . December 26 , 1959 ' successful prosecution of diploma mills . And , of course , even bona fide students defrauded by diploma mills do not always make an issue of the fact . Despite the repeated embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills , the State Department does not even have a list of them available for overseas use . Furthermore , no agency of the federal government has heretofore been authorized to draw up such a list . The U.S. Office of Education is not now and never has been an accrediting agency . Tentative first steps to make it one during the Taft and Wilson administrations evoked a storm of criticism and have never been repeated . The Office of Education does publish annually a list of accredited institutions , but the list is composed of institutions accredited by other agencies and those whose credits are accepted by at least three accredited institutions . This listing , while it excludes the correspondence schools , does include a considerable number of extremely weak institutions which award degrees . Last October Secretary Arthur S. Flemming of the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , told a press conference that the Office of Education is planning to prepare and publicize a list of diploma mills . However , no date was set , and at the same conference , the Secretary said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with these institutions . AT PRESENT , neither the Office of Education nor any other federal or state agency has either the authority or the means to put fraudulent educational institutions out of business . Some attention has been given to the possibility of prosecuting diploma-mill operators for use of the mails to defraud . However , many diploma mills operate under state charters granted in an almost complete absence of state regulation , and the Post-Office can not easilyinitiate prosecutions for acts which are legal according to state charters . If the fraud consists of awarding a degree for no work , the student is usually as guilty as the institution . Furthermore , the , only promise sometimes made by the institution is that it will grant a degree . If it does this , no matter how little work is required of the student , how can there be intent to defraud ? One long-established diploma mill was put out of business by the Federal Trade Commission on the grounds of unfair competition with legitimate institutions . In upholding the FTC in this case , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States was not a relevant factor ; the only issue was the harm done to " petitioner 's competitors " in this country . Despite the FTC 's success in this particular case , however , the agency is in no position to clean up diploma mills ; its resources are limited and its activities in fields outside of education have a deservedly higher priority . WHAT ABOUT regulation by the states ? Only fourteen states have any legislation regulating correspondence schools , and seven of these apply to non-degree-granting institutions . In sum : the federal government is helpless to eliminate diploma mills because it does not control education , while the state can not regulate out-of-state schools or even those within their boundaries which enroll only out-of-state students ( the latter situation constitutes " interstate commerce " and is therefore not subject to state regulation ) . The absence ' of federal and state activity in curbing diploma mills raises the possibility of non-governmental action , especially by professional organizations . Surprisingly enough , American Degree Mills makes not a single reference to the American Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureaus have been more useful than the AAUP in efforts to eliminate fraudulent educational institutions . The existence of the fraudulent schools is really a symptom of a 483 much larger and more important problem , to wit , the absence of effective regulation over private education generally in the United States . To this day , no charter or license is required to establish a college in almost one-third of the states . A more serious problem is the existence of thousands of low-grade. educational institutions at all levels all over the country . These institutions , while not diploma mills , are bad enough to debase all levels of American education . This situation is due to factors which seldom receive the attention they deserve . MOST PRIVATE education in the United States is under religious auspices , which makes any and all attempts at regulation political dynamite . Legally , states can impose reasonable requirements on private schools concerning buildings , equipment , class size , teacher qualifications and similar factors . In practice , the states seldom hold private schools to the same minimum standards required of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all elementary and secondary public-school teachers must have teaching certificates , but only twelve states require them of private-school teachers at any level . ( One of the myths of American education is built upon the brilliant libel al-arts college graduates , thoroughly trained in their subjects but unable to teach in public schools because they do n't have , and wo n't take , the education courses necessary for a teaching certificate . These omnipresent creatures , so dear to the hearts of private-school spokesmen , are supposed to be teaching in private schools , where their intellectual brilliance is respected and rewarded . The truth is that most of them are not fit to teach . ) Catholic parochial schools constitute over SO per cent of the private schools in the United States . Although relatively free from public control , at least they are subject to the control of the Church , which makes it unlikely that any of them will sink to the level of a diploma mill . Of course , there are many weak parochial ( as well as public ) schools , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crucial point is that private non-parochial schools , which are equally free of state regulations , are practically free of any control at all . The correspondence-school diploma mills are only part of the unhappy consequences of this laissez-faire attitude toward private education . A SITUATION I encountered two years ago illustrates one aspect of the picture . While employed by a private university in New York City , I interviewed an applicant for admission who wanted to take a course in the teaching of reading . The applicant was already employed as a remedial reading instructor in a private " clinic " in New York City . He had absolutely no qualifications to teach anyone how to read . At the time , he was getting $2 an hour from his employer , who in turn received $4 an hour from each student . Customers were usually parents whose children were doing poorly in school and who thought that private instruction would help their children to read better . They were attracted to the " clinic " by newspaper advertisements . Business was excellent ? so good that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had come to us for help in preparing for his forthcoming entrepreneurial responsibilities . Had we accepted him , it would have been the first time in his life that he had ever studied reading or the teaching of it . And this happened in the state which exercises the most stringent controls over private education in the country . Probably the worst educational rackets are to be found in some of the private independent schools . Many of these operate in states which purport to regulate private as well as public schools . Quite often , the regulation is inadequate to prevent the worst abuses , while it serves as an excuse for the schools to claim that they meet state standards ? which they do . These institutions are not merely fraudulent from an academic viewpoint . The depths to which they can sink are illustrated by one Connecticut institution I know about . Although it had no psychological or psychiatric staff , this school special ized in-problem children from wealthy families . Many of its students had been expelled from other public or private institutions Mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thrown together in the same classrooms without the slightest regard for the consequences . Teachers were forbidden to fail any students ; the headmaster even changed grades submitted by teachers in order not to arouse the suspicions of parents . Because the teaching staff was so poorly paid , and underwent virtually complete turnover every year , there were always serious deficiencies in it . Frequently the same teacher would be teaching two subjects at the same time in the same room . Students and parents were charged exorbitant fees , for personal and educational services . Parents were asked to donate to an employees ' retirement fund which the employees had never heard about . Physical maltreatment and sexual irregularities among students were daily occurrences . OF COURSE , a school like this could not exist without wealthy parents indifferent to the welfare of their children . On the other hand , it can hardly be said that the state of Connecticut provides much protection for children unlucky enough to have such parents . Private schools in Connecticut need adhere only to the following regulations : 1 . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Education . 2 . Offer a course in the duties and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship , and file a copy thereof . with the State Department of Education . 3 . Use English as the medium of instruction and devote not more than one hour a day to any language other than English . 4 . Utilize buildings which conform to state laws governing safety and sanitation . These regulations leave private schools in Connecticut free to operate without qualified teachers , medical services , lab oratories , books , equipment and courses of study . That any do so should not surprise anyone The NATION who has outgrown , the - fiction that " educators " are above making a fast buck when the opportunity presents itself . And it must be emphasized that Connecticut is not alone or even unusual in its " look the other way " policy concerning private education . THE PRESENT situation for the country as a whole suggests this paradoxical conclusion : Public education is being seriously weakened by the absence of high standards for private education . The makeshift private schools hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools provide the most dramatic support for this conclusion . These schools lacked adequate buildings , supplies , trained teachers and other essentials , yet they were permitted to operate . If there had been reasonable minimum standards for private schools , enforced by state law , it would have been impossible to weaken or destroy public education by setting up quickie private schools . It is true that , in some states , any state laws standing in the way of private schools would be abolished at once if they were a serious obstacle to private schools set up to avoid integration . But there are other states in which this is not the case . In fact , the Negro migration to large Northern cities is undoubtedly contributing to the increase of private schools there also . The school situation is sometimes the decisive factor in the action taken by white families living on the edge of Negro ghettos . Some families move to the suburbs ; others stay and send their children to private schools . The latter alternative should be eliminated insofar as it rests upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education . In the past twenty years , private-school enrollments have increased from 2,660,000 to 6,450,000 . These figures represent an increase , rom 9.4 per cent of the total elementary and secondary school enrollments in 1939-40 to 15.1 per cent of the total in 1959-60 . Granted that there are many excellent private schools , still there is not a shred of evidence to December 26 , 1959 indicate that- private schools per se are better than public ones ? at least on the basis of - secular educational criteria . If the American - public-school system is not to suffer an irreversible blow from the growth of parochial schools , private schools set up to avoid integration , private schools catering to the children of the power and prestige elites , and private schools which are out-and-out rackets , there is no time to be lost in insisting that all schools , public or private , meet reasonable standards set up to protect the public interest as well as the interests of the children who attend them . 485           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
