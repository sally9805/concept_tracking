Ships steaming across the North Atlantic from west to east like to keep in the Gulf Stream , which increases their speed by a knot or so at no cost . Pan American 's Stratocruisers , flying from Tokyo to Honolulu , are taking the same advantage of the " jet stream , " which is the Gulf Stream of the upper air . Last week one of Pan Am 's clippers made the Tokyo-Honolulu run in a record 9 hr. 18 min . Its average , point-to-point speed was 422 rn.p.h. , and 123 m.p.h. was a gift of the friendly jet stream . <P> The North Pacific jet stream was discovered during World War II . It is formed when a cold air mass from the Arctic or Siberia meets warm air from the south , and it often moves faster than 250 m.p.h . To Pan Am , it looked like a pot of gold . Pan Am 's regular route from Tokyo to Honolulu required a fuel stop at Wake Island . The dog-legged course was 4,320 miles long and took more than 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan Am reasoned , the hop might be made nonstop , saving 450 miles and covering part of the distance free on the river of wind . <P> <P> Shaken Rope . The jet stream is not like a surface river , confined between solid banks . It whips around like a shaken rope , and to predict its position , speed and direction takes both knowledge and skill . Pan Am gathered all available data and added observations of its own . Last year , its meteorologists felt they knew enough to take the plunge . The Stratocruisers were regularly scheduled to fly nonstop from Tokyo . The first flight made Honolulu in 11 hrs. instead of 17 . <P> Since then , Pan Am has developed an elaborate technique of air hitchhiking . Before each flight from Tokyo , meteorologists figure out where the jet stream is going to be and how much help can be expected from it . The ship is loaded accordingly ( more help , more payload ) , and the captain is told what course to fly . Generally he climbs into the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As knowledge accumulates , more flying time is saved . Now each airplane hitched to the jet stream " finds " 2,200 gallons of free gas in the sky . <P> The jet stream is no good in summer ; it flows too far to the north . East of Honolulu , it is present but not dependable , and on east-west flights it is a hindrance rather than a help . When headed west , Pan Am still schedules the Wake Island stop . <P> 425 Knots . Pan Am 's observations are carefully studied by the Air Force . Though usually strongest over the North Pacific , the great stream blows around the earth , changing drastically the flying distance from point to point . Knowledge of its habits would make all the difference in successful bombing expeditions . Since the stream is strongest at 35-40,000 ft. , only high-flying military airplanes could make full use of it at present . For them and for future jet liners , its possibilities are striking . Two weeks ago , the stream was clocked at 425 knots ( 489 m.p.h. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might have flown to New York in 2 hrs.
