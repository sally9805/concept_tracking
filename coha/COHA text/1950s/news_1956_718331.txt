Settlement With Arabs To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I express my thanks to the editor of The New York Times for the balanced analysis of . the causes underlying the Middle East conflict which reached a climactic form in the past week . Neither the conflict itself nor the further penetration of the Middle East by Russia will be halted by resolutions which , fail to take action on the basic need of the , area . The need is peace  --  through a final settlement of the Palestine war . Such a settlement can not be imposed . Its terms must be negotiated and agreed upon by direct discussions between the Arab states and Israel . It is this which the State of Israel has sought since its foundation and which it continues to seek to this very day . Not since 1952 has , the ' United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of an international police force are not peace , even though for the moment they may bring some pacification to the Egyptian situation . The armies of Syria , Jordan , Iraq and Saudi Arabia are poised for action against Israel . Moreover , the Russian offer of aid and arms to Syria may act as an incentive for an attack on Israel 's borders . If this should happen , with or without Russian help , the expansion of the war to include the major powers is altogether possible . Many Proffers Israel seeks and wants peace . Since the ' decision of the United Nations to partition Palestine , Israel has sought peace with its neighbors year in and year out . Israel 's proffers of peace were made in its Declaration of Independence ; . in its proposals to the United Nations mediator ; on successive occasions to the Palestine Conciliation Commission ; to the General Assembly , and to the Security Council of the United Nations . Twice since 1955 the Prime Minister of Israel has offered to meet Nasser at any time or place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every such offer has been rejected by the Arab states . Despite the Armistice Agreements of 1949 , all the Arab states are committed to a second round against Israel , accentuated in the past three years by intensified border action on all of Israel 's frontiers . These border incidents have taken on ever bolder form since Egypt 's arming by the Russians . Nasser himself has been the Most vehement advocate of the destruction of Israel . Every public occasion has been used by him t0 proclaim this end . Thus the Egyptian arms deal with the- Russians was marked by such an announcement ; repeated on the day in which the Egyptian Constitution was presented , and again on the day on which the British withdrew from the canal zone base . Perhaps the strongest pronounces ment by , Nasser came on the day he announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company . the extent of giving rise to a troubled conscience , and that would be a good start . The Transit Authority might , in , time , recognize the reformed habits of a cooperatve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better lighting and less noise ; and so make for comfortable watching of a passing show of many facets , NATHAN L. GILBERT . New York , Nov. 7 ; 1956 . Tribute-to Raphael Zon Contributions Made by Forester Le His Profession Recalled Arab Objective Nasser is authority for the statement that the Fedayeen commando suicide squads were to be used " to take vengeance for their land . " In this objective he has been joined by the King of Jordan , the commander in chief of the Jordan Arab Legion ; the Premier of Iraq , the President of Syria , the King of Saudi Arabia and even the President of Lebanon . Eight years of vacillation have been encouragement to warlike acts and intentions . The opportunity exists now to produce peace discussions , and with them to destroy the effectiveness of the Russian role as the protector of Arab interests . Peace means the cessation of hostilities , the assurance of freedom of passage for Israeli shipping through the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba . It means also stabilization of frontiers , the resolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the development of the region for the benefit of its peoples . Palliative solutions which fail to produce direct . peace negotiations can only further chaos and strengthen Russian maneuvers . ROSE L. HALPRIN . , New York , Nov , 8 , 1956 . Improving Subway Rides To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : This is apropos the posters in subway cars touching on such related subjects as head cracking , neck breaking , etc . There 's no objection to the light touch , but there may be a more effective way of reaching the guilty and the suffering public . The riders ' problem is how to travel safely , speedily and , if possible , enjoyably  --  to which the Transit Authority would add " and profitably . " Those who insist upon blocking doors , crossing legs and leaving newspapers behind might be cured as recommended by the Queen of Hearts ? " off with their heads . " But this cure would only still further reduce the subway revenues . The suggestion is offered to equip certain trains with recorded announcements which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the closing of the doors : The recorded voice would remind us to move to the Center of the car , etc . It need not sound like a Coney Island sidewalk ba:iier , and would be free of rhyme and humor or such idioms as would be meaningless to recent arrivals . The immediate reaction to a reasonable voice ' overhead should in most cases be positive  --  at least to .

President , Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association , Inc . New York , Nov. 8 , 1956 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : During the past week death'overe took Raphael Zon , a forester . Native to Russia , Zon came to our country for political asylum . He studied fore estry at Cornell and upon graduation in 1901 entered the United States Forest Service , for which he workdd until his retirement in 1944 . As a young forester Mr , Zon ate tracted the attention of Gifford Pinchot and other leaders in forestry . Six years after graduation he became Chief of Forest Investigae tions . His contributions to forestry as ' an investigator , as a research ad. , ministrator and as a writer assure his name a prominent place in any history of the profession in the United States . Even more significant , however , has been his contribution ' to the philosophy underlying forest policy in the United States . Raphael Zon believed that forestry should be practiced for , the benefit of men , not for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considere ation should be given to the needs of the men who live in the forest and whose livelihood depends thereon , An original thinker , his ideas sometimes shocked , his fellow foresters . He was forever asking them to defend their policies and actions in terms of the public good and the good of the people most affected by such actions . His fertile and active mind grappled ' rigorously with such forestry problems as the light requirements of forest trees , the relationship between forests and water , world forest resources and the place of forestry in the use of land in the I United States . Planting Shelter Belt It was to Mr. Zon that forest administrators most often turned when faced with a particularly difficult problem . For example , when the Chief of the Forest Service received in the Nineteen Thirties . ' a note scribbled in longhand to Henry Wallace , " Why ca n't the Forest Service plant a belt of trees a mile wide from ' Canada to Mexico . and stop these horrible dust storms ? " signed F. D.-R. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Raphael . Zon who ' explained that the President 's idea was good but needed appropriate elaboration . This elaboration ultimately became a zone some seventy-five miles wide , in which intensive shelter-belt planting was undertaken . The success of this venture depended much on painstaking research carried out under the direction of Raphael Zon . Not the least of Mr. Zon 's cone tributions was his influence on the many young men with whom he came in contact either in person or through his , writings and his long editorship of The Journal of Forestry . He inspired them with loyalty to the profession of forestry , devotion to conservation as an ideal and the need for sympathetic understanding of the men living in forest communities with whom the forester must work . In a time when plaudits go more frequently to the doer than the thinker it is appropriate to pause in memory of one whose mind was ever searching for both material and moral justification for the course his profession should follow , HARDY L.
