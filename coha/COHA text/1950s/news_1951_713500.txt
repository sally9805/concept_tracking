DUNHAM , M.D. Letters to The Times Our Foreign Policy Reviewed Alternative to Isolationism and " Europe First " Program Offered To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRE : TimEs : In his recent discussion of foreign policy Senator Taft has revealed a curious split personality , making it seem as if two different men were speaking , one about Europe and the other about Asia . The Taft who spoke about Europe criticized a policy which he reluctantly conceded to be sound in aim , but found wanting in execution . The man ' who ten years ago had seen no threat to our security in a German conquest of Europe now realized the danger of a Russian conquest ; but he expressed the view that our present program for Europe 's defense is not only ineffective but likely to provoke the attack it seeks to prevent . This new non-isolationist Taft did not share the defeatism of terbert Hoover . He questioned the wisdom of rearming the Germans and of prodding the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would weaken their resistance to economic and political subversion or penetration without insuring their safety against military invasion . He expressed the belief that the primary Russian threat to Western Europe is political rather than military . He wished to re-examine the undertaking to send a substantial American garrison to Western Europe in advance of actual war , holding that such action combined with German rearmament might well provoke an otherwise unlikely attack . Rational Criticism Whether or not one agrees in whole or part with these misgivings , they represent a rational criticism of the efficacy of our present program . The Taft who spoke about Asia seemed to suffer from the same delusions and the same disregard of the existingI acts of life for which he criticized the Administration 's European policy . The perspicacity with which the first Taft recognized the essentially political nature of the struggle in Europe vanished as the second Taft mounted the rostrum . In Asia the second Taft saw only the military aspects of the conflict . Accepting war with China , he urged our Government to match Stalin 's use of Mao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Taft was wise enough to seek escape from Stalin 's military trap in Asia by avoiding the involvement of our own land forces . But he failed to see that a renewed alliance with the discredited Nationalist Government of China would take us right into the Kremlin 's political trap and lose us what few friends we still bave in Asia . President Truman wisely welcomed the great debate which has now begun . If that debate is to result in national unity in the face of danger , it must make clear to all of us that the Administration 's " Europe First " policy is essentially correct , though very likely at present pursued with the wrong means . The alternative to an ill-conceived and poorly executed " Europe First " policy is neither Mr. Hoover 's wholesale retreat nor Mr. Taft 's renewed embroilment with Chiang Kai-shek . The alternative is a soundly conceived and well-executed policy aimed at protecting the vital centers of the anti-Soviet coalition in Europe and the Middle East  --  a policy which recognizes the nature of the threat to these areas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be well advised to stop trying to appease the Taft who speaks for the intransigent " Asia Firsters , " but to listen carefully to the Taft who urges a more careful and sane approach to the defense of Europe . Misgivings on Program The fact is that no competent military authority has yet explained how our current European program can reasonably be expected to succeed . Mr. Taft is not the only American who has misgivings . Moreover , the peoples of Western Europe seem to have little faith in our program to defend them and to help them defend themselves ; they , too , fear that it is more likely to provoke than to ward off attack . If our European program is unsound , it must be changed before it is too late . If it is sound , then it is high time that the all-too-apparent objections to it should be authoritatively disposed of . Perhaps General Eisenhower will be able to supply the missing answers , not only to the people of America but to the peoples of Europe . The General is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult mission unless he believes in the soundness of the plan and the efficacy of the means assigned for its accomplishment . Meanwhile , no matter what the eventual program for European defense , our immediate job is to create the force-inbeing without which no program can succeed . In this endeavor the Administration has the right to expect the wholehearted support of every American . JAMES P. WARBURG . New York , Jan. 9 , 1951 . Uses of Rules Committee To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of Jan. 5 , " A Bad Beginning , " taking the House to task for the re-establishment of the Rules Committee , is not a very fair presentation of the facts and does not attempt to show the merit of this important unit of the lower chamber . As you know , much legislation s introduced into the House that it would be bad politics to oppose publicly . For example , Congressman Blank may introduce a bill providing for , a veterans ' bonus of $1,000 and a special bonus of $1,000 to everyone over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , in an election year our more sober Congressmen would find it rather awlt ? Ward to vote against such a bill , to go on record publicly as opposing benefits for veterans and old people . And this reluctance publicly to oppose " porkbarrel " legislation is not so much a discredit to the Congressmen as to their constituents , who undoubtedly would be influenced to vote against them for having so niggardly an outlook . The Rules Committee offers a dignified and convenient means of by-passing such ridiculous legislation . Actually , the Rules Committee serves in great measure to deprive an unscrupulous opposition of ammunition during election campaigns . In most cases when the Rules Committee refuses to report out a bill it is because the majority of the House does not want . it reported out . The members of the Rules Committee are not men from Mars , detached from the affairs of this earth ; they are themselves accredited Representatives , duly elected by their constituents , and it is to be expected that they reflect the general atmosphere of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Y. , Jan. 5 , 1951 . Britain 's Military Effort Facts Cited to Show Part Being Played in Global Crisis To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your issue of Dec. 27 you printed letters from E. T. Schell , Jay Beebe and K. H. Hecht , Mr. Schell wrote : " England has not shown a willingness to stand against communism " ; Mr. Beebe questions whether " Britain is willing to stand courageously on its own feet and defend itself ' ; Mr. Hecht speaks of " France and Britain together ( why France and Britain ? ) having a weaker army than Yugoslavia or Spain , " and hopes " Britain will arm to the hilt quickly . " As these gentlemen are evidently quite unaware of Britain 's military effort , here are a few facts which may be of interest to them and other readers . For the past three years 40,000 British soldiers with 70,000 native troops have been fighting , with many casualties , against Chinese Communists in Malaya , instigated doubtless by the same enemy as that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced in England in 1939 , is still in force . Every fit male between 18 and 26 serves two years with the colors and three and one-half years in the Territorial army . There are at the moment nearly a million English citizens under arms . The corresponding figure for the United States is , I believe , two million , but Great Britain 's population is only one-third that of the United States . The latest report of the Bank for International Settlements gives the defense expenditures of Britain as 7.4 per cent ; that of the United States as 5.9 per cent of the national income . The immediate program increases this figure in both cases to about 10 per cent . That in the case of Britain will be 30 per cent of the whole budget . What this means to the individual Englishman can be gleaned from the following facts : Only seventy people in Britain have an income of $14,000 a year or more after paying income tax ; there are numerous indirect taxes , including purchase taxes of 100 per cent or more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is suffering real hardship from a shortage of fuel ; the meat ration is less than 15 cents ' worth a week . These taxes and restrictions will no doubt be increased still further in the present year . Britain has more to fear from war than any other nation . Will she " stand on her own feet and defend herself " ? Well , perhaps Mr. Beebe has heard of the Battle of Britain and the whole year during which she stood alone against the enemies of the world . ERIC UNDERWOOD . New York , Jan. 5 , 1951 . A Correction To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Sic transit gloria mundi . In your excellent editorial of Dec. 29 you give credit to Dr. R. Paul for opening the First Baptist Church in Memphis for the funeral of the Rev. W. A. Johnson , the beloved former pastor of Mount Olive Colored Methodist Episcopal Church . First names are as important as last in the realm of goodness and justice , but the wires from here should not have taken this liberty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WOLCOTT B. DUNHAM , M. D.
