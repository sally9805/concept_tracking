Tough writers are seldom tough guys , but Alexander Fadeyev was an exception . His early novels are Russian-style westerns , full of galloping hooves and gun battles against terrible odds , simple taciturn heroes who figure that the only way to give an order is to snap yes or no . Fadeyev himself lived this kind of life as a Soviet guerrilla during the civil war , and he believed that if it was not yes it must be no . Later , when it became his job to ride herd on Soviet literature for Dictator Stalin , tough Fadeyev made many an author bite the Siberian mud . <P> <P> Russian literature , a powerful weapon in the Russian people 's struggle for liberation from the Czars , was plunged into confusion after the establishment of the Soviet state . Many famous authors ( Kuprin , Bunin ) went into exile voluntarily ; disillusionment led others ( Yesenin , Mayakovsky ) to suicide . To give literature drive and direction , and broaden its appeal , the party formed the Union of Soviet Writers , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " socialist realism " did not suit Stalin . The dictator found his man in Fadeyev , the steely-eyed yes man . <P> Rising Man . In 1936 , two years after Fadeyev joined the presidium of the Union of Soviet Writers , Gorky died suddenly . Then people began asking questions . Where is Isaac ( Red Cavalry ) Babel ? What has happened to Novelist Boris ( Mother Earth ) Pilniak ? Why is the work of Poet Boris ( Above the Barriers ) Pasternak no longer published ? About lesser writers there was no mystery : they had been arrested as " enemies of the people . " While they disappeared , Fadeyev became No. 1 man in the Soviet Writers ' Union . Disdaining elegant clothes , he habitually wore the party uniform , but he had his own chauffeur-driven car and a luxurious apartment . There was always a bottle of vodka within his easy reach . <P> By 1939 the Union of Soviet Writers was a well-drilled literary claque which dutifully applauded Stalin 's deal with Hitler and praised his " military genius " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The union helped whip up enthusiasm for the " patriotic war , " and Fadeyev himself produced a long , turgid novel called Young Guard about underground operations in the Ukraine . The Kremlin 's kept writers grew fat on the war ( Young Guard sold 3,000,000 copies ) , but when it was all over , Stalin cut them down to size in a new purge . Described as " filthy " and " obscene " in journals controlled by Author Fadeyev 's union were two survivors of the revolutionary epoch : Satirist Mikhail ( The Adventures of an Ape ) Zoshchenko and Poetess Anna ( The White Flock ) Akhmatova . Even Fadeyev , criticized in Pravda , had to eat a little crow . Told to rewrite Young Guard , he said : " I quite agree . "
