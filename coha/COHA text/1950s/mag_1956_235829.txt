Though he is one of Britain 's biggest industrialists , Sir Bernard Docker is better known in the sensational penny press than in the financial and society pages , and so is his wife Norah . There have been adoring pictures of Lady Docker playing marbles with factory workers , Lady Docker at a party given by one of London 's most notorious criminals ( Billy Hill ) , Lady Docker roguishly dancing the hornpipe for an audience of sheepish miners aboard the Dockers ' 878-ton yacht Shemara . Although both are millionaires , the Dockers also made generous use of the expense account and position of Sir Bernard , chairman of the Birmingham Small Arms Co. , which produces everything from air rifles to $40,000 Daimler limousines . On the swindle sheet were at least two gold-plated Daimlers-one of them upholstered in six zebra skins and costing $42,000 . Owned by Daimler , they were built to Lady Docker 's specifications and for her use . Said Lady Docker : " We bring glamour and happiness into drab lives . The working class loves everything I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Last year B.S.A . ' s business began falling off : profits before taxes slid to $8,000,000 by year 's end as the government 's anti-inflationary credit squeeze pinched sales . The worse business got , the less the B.S.A . directors and the insurance companies that hold blocks of B.S.A . stock appreciated the antics and expense accounts of their board chairman and his lady . Last week , in a fiery , three-hour meeting , they unceremoniously fired Sir Bernard not only as chairman and managing director , but even as a director . <P> Pink Champagne . Next day the Dockers called in the press , poured out pink champagne and their hearts . Sir Bernard 's father had helped build the B.S.A . empire ; Sir Bernard had been chairman since 1938 ; and his fortune was founded around the company . Said Sir Bernard , cigar in hand , tears in eyes : " I 've been sacked , sacked , sacked . When father left the board , they gave him a gold watch . For me they called a special meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damnable . " Cried Lady Docker even more tearfully : " It 's not the loss of the gold cars that makes me feel like this . And were n't they fun ? They were like my children . No , it 's that lovely party I was planning for 25,000 B.S.A . workers for my 50th birthday on June 23 . A tiptop affair - and now it 's all off . How could they do this to him after 17 years ? Why , he 's such a hard worker that he had a through line to the firm from our yacht . ' ' <P> Golden Dress . One of the big reasons for the final blowup was one of Lady Docker 's dazzling schemes : open a Gold Showroom in Paris featuring one of the gold-plated Daimlers . As the idea grew , so did the expense , until finally Lady Docker simply had to have some gear to go with it : a gold-plated dress , a mink cape and a mink-trimmed hat . The outfit cost $20 , - ooo but , said Lady Docker : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , I decided to charge it against tax . " When the tax people objected , Sir Bernard tried to bill B.S.A . B.S.A . also objected , and finally Sir Bernard paid for the rig himself , but the incident rankled the other directors . They brought up other charges : <P> 1 ) shareholders ' complaints were not passed on to the board ( Sir Bernard : " I do not remember any complaints " ) ;
