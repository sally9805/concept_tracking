A special train from Moscow rolled into the Peking railroad station one afternoon last week and stopped before a greeting committee of 1,500-odd bureaucrats . Out stepped 34 Russian ballerinas , composers and scientists and the 260-member Soviet Army Red Flag Song &; Dance Ensemble . Forward rushed 150 Chinese Young Pioneers with bouquets . The two sides embraced and , led by 70 gaily clad drum dancers , marched to a large square . There , according to Radio Peking , a waiting crowd rumbled " thunderous , spontaneous cheers of ' Stalin ! ' and ' Mao Tse-tung ! ' " while speakers extolled " the most devoted friends of the Chinese people , sent by the great Generalissimo Stalin . " The Chinese Communists proclaimed " Sino-Soviet Friendship Month . " <P> Fanned Friendship . Perhaps never in history had friendship between two nations been so determinedly fanned . In Peking , it was love , love , love on a timetable , production-line basis . Twenty-four official slogans proclaimed : " Warm Thanks for Selfless Aid to China 's Construction by Generalissimo Stalin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard Advanced Soviet Military Science , " " Salute Soviet Experts Who Have Tirelessly Helped in China 's Construction . " The others acclaimed Soviet women , youth , animal breeders , cooperative workers , farmers . <P> The printing presses rumbled their accompaniment . From Vice Minister of Health Fu Lien-chang came a long eulogy of Soviet medicine ; from Feminist Teng Yingchao ( wife of Premier Chou Enlai ) , a brochure extolling Soviet standards in marriage and personal relations . <P> Expert Help . Most revealing of the tributes was a speech by China 's No. 2 labor boss , Lui Ning-i , listing some-doubtless not all-of the Chinese projects on which Russian experts have been working : the Peking-Hankow , Canton-Hankow , Chengtu-Chungking and Tienshui-Lanchow railways ; the Huai River conservation plan ( employing some 5,000,000 workers , many of them slave laborers ) ; the Chinkiang water detention basin , the new Tangku harbor in Tientsin . According to best estimates , there are 60,000 Russians " helping out " in China . <P> Behind all the love , love , love stands the well-organized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown from 3,000,000 members to 39 million , organized into 120,000 branches . ( Every soldier and government employee must join . ) The association promotes Russia in a big way , with a big budget : last year it sponsored 74 periodicals , 580 books and pamphlets , 200 film projection teams , 2,500 lantern-slide groups , and 20,000 evening classes in the Russian language . <P> None of this was calculated to give aid and comfort to those who still think that Mao Tse-tung is bound to become another Tito . <P> China 's people could ponder another evidence of Big Brother 's presence last week . All over the land little boxes were going up in the streets . They are called Denunciation Boxes . Chinese were invited to fill them with unsigned notes that could send neighbors to death or slave labor camps . <P> The boxes are the work of China 's Beria , Lo Jui-ching , boss of the Peking equivalent of the MVD . Assisting Lo in the work is a resident corps of well-paid Russian " specialists . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
