Abandoned stone quarries , if they are used at all , are generally used only as swimming holes . But in the last year Esso Standard Oil has spent about $500,000 making an oil storage tank out of a vacant quarry at Wind Gap , Pa . Last week Esso pumped the first oil from its Linden , N.J. Bayway Refinery 65 miles through a 6-in. pipeline into the huge pit , capable of holding about 1,000,000 bbls. of heating oil . <P> If the operation is successful , oil manufactured at Bayway during the summer will be pumped into the quarry , where it will float on the water , be covered with 250 three-ton floating steel pontoons . In winter the oil will be piped back for distribution to homes . Esso owns or has options on nine other quarries in the area capable of holding 8,000,000 bbls. , enough to heat 225,000 homes for a year .
