On the western front , Chinese infantrymen stormed up the Slopes of " Porkchop Hill , " west of Chorwon , and fought hand-to-hand with the Allied defenders before they were driven off with heavy losses .

" much fought-over heights on the western face of the enemy 's old " Iron Triangle " in central Korea . The Chinese invested 350 men in the attempt to take the hill . They smashed into heavy barbed wire entanglements the United Nations had strung to defend their outpost . Rapid fire from small arms met the enemy , and the Allied soldiers hurled hand grenades into the advancing Chinese .

Rain fell along much of the western and central fronts yesterday , turning roads to slippery ribbons of mud .

Sixty planes came down over the slopes of " Papasan Mountain . "
