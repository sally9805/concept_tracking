If the diplomats of the great powers back up their scientists , the earth in a few years will be thinly dotted with observation stations , internationally controlled , packed with sensitive instruments , and each manned by 30-odd scientists and technicians . Most of the stations will be on level terrain , and as far as possible from cities , railroads and heavily traveled highways . Their purpose : to detect clandestine tests of nuclear explosives . <P> After seven weeks of scholarly consultation at Geneva , U.S. , British , Russian , Polish and other scientists issued definite recommendations for a nearly trickproof control system ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) . There were no minority reports , no signs of maneuvering for political advantage . Both sides agreed that a proper system of fewer than 200 stations would detect with high accuracy even small explosions anywhere on earth . <P> Air Waves . The experts considered all major means of detecting nuclear tests . If the explosion takes place in air , it starts a powerful acoustic wave that can be detected at great distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-kiloton explosion sends a detectable wave as much as 2,000 miles downwind , 300 miles upwind , or an average of 800 miles under conditions of light and varying winds . When exploded under the surface of the ocean , a one-kiloton explosion sends sound waves 6,000 miles through the water . <P> A deep underground explosion sends no air waves , but such explosions , and surface explosions too , send seismic waves through the earth . A station in a quiet place can detect the waves from a one-kiloton explosion as much as 2,200 miles away . The detecting apparatus is accurate enough to pinpoint the explosion within an area of 40-80 sq . mi. , less than one-quarter the area of New York City . <P> Radio Giveaway . Another detecting method is by means of radio waves caused by the gamma rays from a nuclear explosion above the surface of the earth or sea . Radio waves from a one-kiloton test can be detected 4,000 miles away under favorable Circumstances , and can locate within 20 miles an explosion 600 miles away . <P> All these detecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris from an explosion , takes more time , but is nonetheless useful . The experts recommended that rainfall all over the earth be checked for radioactivity . In dry countries a special collecting surface should be washed down periodically and the water checked . Weather airplanes flying their regular routes can carry observers and collecting equipment . <P> Each of these methods , the East-West experts pointed out , has its faults . Acoustic waves from a volcanic eruption , for instance , can be mistaken for waves from a nuclear test . Seismic waves from earthquakes can be misinterpreted , too . Nuclear tests deep under the earth or ocean yield no radioactive fallout , send out no air waves or radio waves . But they do send waves through the ocean , the earth , or both . Each type of test is detectable by one or more methods .
