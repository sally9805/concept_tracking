Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev , 65 , tough , devious , versatile , flies into the U.S. this week with the enigmatic fame of the " Hangman of the Ukraine " and the " Butcher of Budapest , " who has nonetheless restored to the U.S.S.R. ( pop . 208 million ) its broadest measure of liberty and prosperity since the Bolshevik Revolution . Khrushchev 's intentions in the U.S. are just as enigmatic . Is he seeking a genuine thaw in the cold war that might lead to forms of peace ? Is he seeking an American acceptance of the status quo of Communist conquests , a softening-up of American will ? Is he trying to shore up his own status in Communism 's labyrinthine society , and if so against whom-against an aggressive Communist China , against restless captive peoples , against hostile Kremlin cliques ? Is the sum of Khrushchev 's intentions that he means to show that his is the face of the future ? <P> Walks by the River . Already the huge importance of whatever Khrushchev wants is apparent from the propaganda lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.S. a success . On trip 's eve the U.S.S.R. hit the moon with a historic cosmic-rocket shot even though the moon would have been easier to hit . on other dates . Khrushchev violated every hallowed canon of Communist solidarity when he intervened between Communist China and India to calm down the Himalayan border crisis ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , thereby advertising to the world that Communism 's monolith has its flaws . And his U.N . delegation acquiesced almost amiably in the decision to send a fact-finding commission to Laos . <P> Perhaps even more remarkable was Khrushchev 's personal flouting of the other Communist canon , whereby the servants of the people are impersonal , i.e. , their private lives are of no consequence , hence are not subject to public inquiry . Last week , in an unprecedented bending to U.S. hunger for personalities , he posed for photographs with his whole family in the Kremlin . Khrushchev in the U.S.-for all the stirrings of conscience and stirrings of resentment among those who fiercely oppose his coming-will probably get more than his share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unfinished Business . " President Eisenhower , his personal leadership lifted to new highs of confidence by his triumph in Western Europe , was ready in the White House for whatever Khrushchev might bring . " The choice before world leaders is momentous , " he said in a 15-minute TV talk to the nation . " It is my profound hope that some real progress will be forthcoming , even though no one would be so bold as to predict such an outcome . In this connection I know that neither America nor her allies will mistake good manners and candor for weakness ; no principle or fundamental interest will be placed upon any auction block . " Then the President , a modest man whose strength lies in the fact that he is not enigmatic but is widely and deeply understood , set forth the face of the future as the U.S. sees it . " Fellow Americans , " the President said , " we venerate more widely than any other document , except only the Bible , the American Declaration of Independence . It stands enshrined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until these things belong to every living person , their pursuit is an unfinished business . "
