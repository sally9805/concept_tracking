During World War I , Great Britain commissioned the proud Hashemites , an old Mecca family , to lead the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks . To reward the Hashemites at war 's end , the British carved up the Turkish empire , installed Hashemites as rulers over two vast chunks of it . Thus were Jordan and Iraq ( formerly Mesopotamia ) brought awkwardly into the world . The grateful Hashemites have remained loyal to Britain . Until 1948 , they remained loyal to each other as well . Then Jordan 's Abdullah , warrior hero of World War I , defied the Arab League by annexing Arab Palestine for himself . Iraq , along with the rest of the Arab world , has been snubbing Jordan ever since . <P> Last week Iraq 's King Feisal II and his cousin , Jordan 's King Hussein , Abdullah 's grandson , got together in Baghdad to patch up the spat . Both are 18 , and new to their thrones ; they acceded on the same day last spring ( TIME , May 11 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were away studying at England 's Harrow during most of it . In the hot sun at Baghdad airport , they kissed in the Arab fashion , rode off together in a scarlet coach drawn by six white horses . Iraqi chieftains from far-flung oases came to Baghdad to pump the hand of the handsome visitor from Jordan . Feisal ordered a five-hour military show for his pistol-toting cousin . At European-style banquets , while diplomats and ministers drank wine , the cousins solemnly sipped Coca-Cola , decorated each other with the highest orders of their lands . <P> While the young kings appeared before cheering crowds together , their Premiers were hard at work , hammering out the principles of a new economic pact . Afterward , officials said that they had reached " full agreement " on all the major financial , economic and trade problems they discussed . Visas might be abolished , customs barriers might come down . <P> What would a real rapprochement mean ? First of all , it could be the first step toward realizing an old Arab dream : unification of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Mediterranean . More immediate , perhaps , was a threat to British influence in the Middle East . Iraq relies on Britain for oil markets ; Jordan relies on Britain for just about everything . If oil-wealthy Iraq lent money to impoverished Jordan , and overcrowded Jordan resettled Palestine refugees in Iraq , where they would speed Iraq 's own development , the two nations might find themselves less dependent on the British . That kind of decision is a long way off for two young Harrovians . They decided to meet again in August , this time on Hussein 's home grounds .
