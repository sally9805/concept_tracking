From Miami to Minneapolis , through nine states and across 3,600 miles . Adlai Stevenson went whirling across the U.S. landscape last week , spouting sparks and smoke . He showered scorn and anger on all Republicans , but saved his biggest rockets to lob at Dwight Eisenhower and members of his personal and official family . Such pyrotechnics did not go unappreciated . Time after time , voices in his small but enthusiastic audiences cried out , " Give ' em hell , Adlai . " And the new Adlai , when he heard , would grin and crack back : " I 'm doing my best . " <P> In his liveliest campaign week to date Adlai Stevenson : <P> Broadly suggested again that the U.S. should end the draft , which he described as " wasteful , inefficient , and often unfair . " Then he hedged his bets , called for " a fresh and open-minded look at the weapons revolution and the whole problem of military manpower . " Proposed a moratorium on H-bomb tests ; the U.S. can detect Russian violations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then at least the world will know we tried . " <P> Charged ( with Harry S. Truman grinning happily on the platform beside him ) that President Eisenhower was guilty of buck-passing and ducking the responsibilities of leadership : " Who 's in charge here , anyway ? Who , in this businessman 's Administration , keeps the store ? " <P> <P> Braved a possible booing at Little Rock , Ark. , instead was warmly applauded for firmly stating that he believed the Supreme Court decision on segregation " to be right ; some of you feel strongly to the contrary , but what is more important is that we accept . . . that decision as law-abiding citizens . " Proposed increased federal funds for school construction , more and better-paid teachers , and college scholarships-all without more federal " control over the content of the educational process . " Charged , without naming him , that the President 's brother , Dr. Milton Eisenhower , had " assumed special , if informal , responsibility " for U.S. relations with Argentina to the benefit of ex-Dictator Juan Pern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> At his press conference , President Eisenhower quietly set straight what was probably the most reckless blunder of the Stevenson campaign . The U.S. had indeed made a loan to Argentina , but it was for $130 million , not $100 million , said he . And it was made not by his Administration but by Truman 's . Later in the week Secretary of State Foster Dulles underscored another pertinent point : Pern thrived in office all through the Truman Administration , fell from power during the Eisenhower Administration-which has propped up the new government with a total of $160 million in loans . <P> The blunder on Pern typified the difference between the Stevenson of 1952 , a man meticulously concerned with facts , and the Stevenson of 1956 , a man furiously concerned with winning . Last week , particularly when he discussed his concept of a " New America , " Stevenson showed flashes of his old eloquent self ( " Leadership in a democracy can be no more than the capturing of a people 's power to realize their own best ideals " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to let the sparks shower merrily and fall where they might .
