Nearly a thousand Protestant and Catholic Sunday-school teachers crowded last week through the pillared facade of Cleveland 's Euclid Avenue Temple and jammed its high-domed auditorium . Three-quarters of them were women , but there were also some Presbyterian elders and Methodist deacons . Most of them had never been in a Jewish place of worship before . This was the first Institute on Judaism for Christian Teachers . <P> Rabbi Barnett R. Brickner , who conceived the idea of the institute , spoke of the importance of Jewish ceremonies in the life of Jesus : " The wine Jesus gave his disciples was from the Kiddush cup - the chalice . The bread he gave them to eat were these matzos , flour and water . Also on the Seder table is a shankbone , roasted ... In Jesus ' time they ate the lamb together . That feast of the Passover was the Last Supper . . . ' Shema Israel adonoi elohenu adonoi echod-Hear O Israel : the Lord our God , the Lord is One . ' Those were words that Jesus knew and recited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wine and drank deeply from the silver goblet , one young woman whispered to her companion : " And that 's real wine . " <P> The non-Jewish teachers were impressed by the solemnity of the ceremonies and were pleased when Rabbi Brickner held a question &; answer period . Samples : " Do the Jews believe in a Messiah ?

" The Jews , replied Brickner , believe in a Messianic age , " when there shall be no war , no hatred , " rather than in a Messiah , and they think of Jesus as a great teacher . <P> Rabbi Brickner has believed for years that Christian ministers should know what Judaism is and how closely related it is to Christianity . Approving his idea , Greater Cleveland 's Ministerial Association set aside one of its monthly meetings to get instruction on the Jewish religion . In recent years it has been their best-attended meeting , and a showplace for scholars of both faiths . <P> Pleased last week with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more pleased that Cleveland 's Religious Education Fellowship will shortly reciprocate and start an Institute on Christianity for Jews . Says he : " Many Christians think of Judaism as lurking behind a silken veil . . . Judaism is a rational , logical faith and the more questions we are asked the better we like it ... Good will between religions can never be achieved simply by mutual back-patting . . . We 're going to have to build bridges . . . "
