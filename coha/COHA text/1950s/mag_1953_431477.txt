SOME folks thrill to the sight of a diesel-electric locomotive , giving its all to hoist tonnage over a mountain . Others get misty-eyed when they glimpse an ocean liner standing majestically out to sea . Then there is that numerous breed which looks upon a gleaming convertible as one of earth 's grandest spectacles . But a bushy-haired , 47-year-old mechanical designer named Ivan Linus Collins feels his pulse slipping into high gear whenever he stumbles upon an ancient , dilapidated wagon . The older and crustier the wagon , the more do Collins ' well-thatched temples throb with excitement . In his back pocket he invariably carries a carpenter 's folding rule , to be used in measuring from tonneau to tongue any animal- drawn contraption which looms into view . Collins , who lives along the foaming reaches of the trout-filled McKenzie River near Springfield , Ore. , is a man with a single burning purpose . That purpose is to create authentic models of the vast assortment of vehicles which moved Americans and their belongings during the long years that preceded full development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes Collins a week to inch across a rural county . This is because he pokes around behind barns and crumbling livery stables in quest of drays and carriages which were left stranded when horses gave way to horsepower . Only Builder of Wagon Replicas in U.S. " Thousands of people are making miniatures of old trains , pioneer airplanes and the first steamboats and river packets , " explains Collins . " The automobile manufacturers are immortalizing their own early products . But I believe I 'm just about the only person in the United States who is trying to preserve exact and accurate copies of wagons . " During the past 18 years Collins has built precise replicas of 46 different horse-drawn vehicles which once were fairly commonplace . His ultimate goal is at least 100 . Lest this seem a modest  | ambition , it should be noted that a minimum of 600 hours of painstaking effort must be spent on each of Collins ' models . For example , nine separate coats of paint are par for the course when he is giving a wagon its gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockheed Aircraft in California and returned to his native state five years ago , just so he could spend more time on his wagons . He now designs mechanical equipment for the University of Oregon , but the five o'clock whistle merely starts him on an eighthour swing shift in his compact wheelwright 's shop at home . The models emerging from this shop are one-eighth the size of the original wagons from which they have been copied . Every separate item is built to scale , even lanterns and springs and buggy whips . In over-all bulk , a miniature van built 1w Collins matches the general proportions of a portable radio set . Furthermore , everything works ? the springs bounce , doors open and shut , tops fold back smoothly , blankets the size of a dollar bill fold neatly into cutter seats , the fringe of the surrey flutters if a bvstander breathes upon it . Collins is a hairsplitter for accuracy . In the strongbox of his stagecoach , he insisted on depositing genuine gold dust , flushed laboriously from an Oregon  | creek bed near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his blonde wife Laura wove identically as many threads per square inch as were used in the real vehicles . For the fire engine Laura knotted a rope life net , smaller than their two-year-old daughter 's handkerchief , but of just the right mesh . One of Collins ' favorite miniatures is a replica of the oblong , top-heavy wagon which generated gas for the first daredevil observation balloons , during the Civil War . His foot-long model actually will produce hydrogen gas . All he has to do is add hydrochloric acid to the iron filings and water in the tanks of the little vehicle . Collins has taught himself to become an expert draftsman , metal worker , blacksmith , wheelwright , wood carver , upholsterer and leather tooler . He thought this comprised the works ? until he found the Umatilla House omnibus behind a commercial garage along the upper Columbia River . Then he had to be a landscape painter . Old Carriage Reflects Past Glory The first Union Pacific trains on the twisting Oregon short line were met by a gaudy , high-wheeled carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there were chicken dinners , champagne suppers and elegant ladies . When Collins discovered the crumbling omnibus , the glory was departed . The mud of generations clung to it like frosting to a cake . But he still could tell that inside the ( lashing vehicle . over the windows , there had been different Pacific Northwest scenes in oils . Collins ' passion for detail forced him  | to paint a panel of tiny landscapes of Mount Hood , the Columbia Gorge and other natural wonders . Yet he waves aside airily any tendency to marvel at his persistence . " I 've got to be exact , " says Collins , with the zeal of a man with a mission . " Other modelmakers act as a check on each other because they 're working in the same general categories of transportation . But , so far as I know , I have no competitors . " This spring the Stanford University Press , which usually features the works of erudite scientists and scholars , published a book of photographs of Collins ' wagons . The title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the models is an art in itself . Collins places the wagon from three to five feet away from the camera lens . At least 75 feet behind the vehicle hovers an appropriate background ? Oregon trees for a logging wagon , Idaho desert for a stagecoach , bridge piers for an Army munitions van , a railroad station for an express wagon , a park plaza for a stately victoria . The wagon is in sharp focus , the background is blurred . Yet the tiny vehicle , a foot in length , seems perfectly matched with the distant firs , 175 feet high . A miniature dray and a huge warehouse synchronize harmoniously . After experimenting with many cameras , Collins finally settled on a Bausch &; Lomb Rav No. 7 which his uncle had purchased in Seattle in 1894 . Its ancient lens can be stopped to a pinhole outlet . It was what Collins sought to capture the detail of his miniatures . " Besides , " he confesses , " it made me feel in keeping with the whole project to be able to photograph models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just did n't want anything streamlined about this undertaking ? not even the camera ! " Doctor Suggested Model Building Collins was in bed with an ulcer in 1935 when the doctor counseled some form of handicraft as a means of relieving nervous tension . The physician himself suggested a prairie-schooner kit for Collins to assemble .  | But the finished result was sad to see . " I had been brought up on a wheat ranch in the wide-open spaces of Oregon , " Collins recalls , " but I never had seen or heard of a covered wagon like the one which came from that kit . It was not even approximately accurate . All at once I realized what a gap this was in our knowledge of American transportation . There were fine models of trains and cars galore , yet none of wagons ? and wagons had served our people for nearly 250 years before the first steam railroads . " Catalogue Gives Real Low-Down Collins at last found a hardware store which had a dog-eared catalogue of wagons in the basement . He got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its specifications . It was a ranch wagon . Collins ' tools were a pocket knife , egg-beater drill . hacksaw , screwdriver and pair of pliers . The task challenged him , and the effort made him forget his anxieties . A genuine covered wagon was Collins ' next project . He had to get a prairie schooner out of his system , to erase the bad taste left over from that disappointing kit . This time Collins had a real-life model ? a canvas-covered wagon near a Los Angeles movie set . Schooner Built with Precision Collins ' persistence for detail began with this wagon . It would be as accurate as the kit had been inaccurate . He read voluminously about horns and lanterns . All were built precisely to scale . The barrels contained water from the Snake River , which thousands of frontier families had forded at great peril . Of course , the powder horns were full of actual gunpowder . Could Ivan Collins leave his imaginary pioneers to face Indian hostiles , with only perfumed talcum to pour into the pygmy muzzleloaders on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly evpensive for a working man to produce . Collins ran through his savings , buying materials . Journeys to far-off wagon Valhallas took all of his vacation time . He sought out former employees of the Brewster Company , which had occupied the Cadillac and Lincoln realm of an earlier day , when it manufactured pompous Victorias and ceremonial hearses . Sets Up a Wheelwright Shop He fitted a tiny wheelwright 's shop with a tire bender for shaping the steel rims and with a tenoning bench for mortising in the delicate spokes . Like a brawny village smithy , Collins heated the metal rims and then shrunk them on the wheels as the steel cooled . Collins made only one minor concession to necessity . The wheels that carried early Americans over field and stream were fashioned of sturdy hardwood , principally oak and hickory and ash . But these solid fibers proved too coarse-grained for miniature work . At length Collins surrendered and turned to mountain maple , which was softer and more pliable . Equally important , it was close-grained and comparatively easy to shape . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . the wagon-building project of Ivan L. Collins has had something of the element of the chase . London Cabby Helps Him In California Collins heard about George Stone , a former London cabby who made his stake in retail business and then sent to Piccadilly Circus for his old hansom as a sentimental gesture . Collins latched onto Stone like a Canadian Mountie seizing his quarry . The hansom cab in Collins ' collection was constructed while using Stone 's onetime perambulating place of employment as a model . It is the sole- vehicle among the 46 which never was widely  | adapted in the United States . However . Collins justifies its inclusion by pointing , out that many wagons for use in America were made by the firm of Laurie Marner , producer of the hansom . Upon finding and measuring a vehicle which had seen better days , Collinwould draft a detailed set of blueprints to guide him in building the miniature . Frequently lie had to wash off straw . mud and clods of dried manure before he even could identify the wagon he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra zeal . Feared Originals Would Rot " I knew , " he remarks , " that if I did n't construct the miniatures pretty soon , it would be virtually impossible to do so . The originals would collapse into heaps of rotting lumber . " Of course , a few originals already were gone when Collins made up his mind that some craftsman had better devote his attention to wagons before it was too late . He created the hydrogen wagon for Union Army balloons from sketches in the National Museum in Washington , D. C. With pardonable pride Collins observes , " Several Civil War historians told me that the balloon wagon was exactly like the descriptions contained in War Department journals . " Models Are Heavily Insured Ivan Collins values each of his wagons at approximately $2,000 . The collection is insured for $100,000 and all records for attendance were broken when it went on display at the Los Angeles Museum recently . Ransom Mathews , the museum 's director of mechanical arts , said of the miniature wagons : . " They represent the finest craftsmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Collins has been urged to publish blueprints , in order that other model , makers around the nation can vary their locomotives and motor cars with buckboards and Concord coaches . He is con- sidering such a venture , but first he wants to try his skill with the bygone vehicles of countries overseas ? with the carriages that carried Napoleon and the battle chariots of Julius Caesar . Collins has compiled a vast quantity of data about every one of his miniatures . This makes it difficult for him to decide which is his favorite . He pictures himself on the high , swaying driver 's seat , reins in hand , whip at the ready . One moment he thinks he would like to be driving Teddy Roosevelt through Yellowstone Park and in the next minute he imagines himself wheeling a silver-fitted brougham down Fifth Avenue . But , finally , Collins settles for the Conestoga wagon which first was built iii the Conestoga Valley of Pennsylvania . Why He Likes Conestoga " It 's the wagon that made history , " explains Collins . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all American transportation on wheels . It brought the settlers beyond the Allegheny Mountains and across the Mississippi . Would n't it have been something to drive one of those great billowing wagons , back of fine horses , through a wilderness where white men never had been before ? " The blue eyes of the tall craftsman light up zealously as he concludes , " I want my miniature wagons to make many generations of Americans conscious of their past . I want the people of today to be proud of the men and women who rode in those wagons and built up our country . "  |
