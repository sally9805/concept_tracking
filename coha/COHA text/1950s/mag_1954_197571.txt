In the early days of Allied occupation , U.S. troops in Germany lived as high as Roman conquerors . A few parlayed their privileges into tidy personal fortunes ; all of them got special prerogatives denied the Germans . Little by little , as circumstances changed a defeated enemy into a necessary ally , occupation authorities trimmed down special privileges . By 1952 it was no longer possible for U.S. Army personnel to get free servants ( chargeable to West Germany as an occupation cost ) , or to ride first-class on a third-class railway ticket . But no amount of self-imposed limitations altered the fact that the Allied occupation troops were essentially immune to German law . <P> Last week , in special seminars anticipating the sovereign status West Germany will shortly enjoy , U.S. Army units all over Germany were busy teaching the conquerors to become guests . As aliens subject to German law , G.I.s will no longer be exempt from German excise taxes or the compulsory German auto insurance law . If they live in a requisitioned house , they will have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G.I.s will not be subject to property or income taxes ; nor will they be subject to criminal prosecution in German courts ( though the German police will have the right to " detain " them under certain conditions ) . <P> <P> But most important of all for many a G.I. , all occupying forces will in future be subject to German civil jurisdiction . Since British , French and American occupation soldiers have fathered an estimated 150,000 illegitimate German children , this means that many a G.I. ( some 70,000 of the children are guessed to be American ) now basking in occupation immunity may soon be called to court to account for his sin and support his child .
