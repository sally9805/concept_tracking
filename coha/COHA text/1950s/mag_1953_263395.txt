ON their birthdays , to ward off the demons that abound , the Twi-speaking peoples of West Africa smear their bodies with eggs . In other lands , where clothing is more complete , expression more verbal and eggs dearer , other customs prevail ; it is not unknown for the birthday boy , among his friends , to say a few words about what 's on his mind . TIME , the Weekly Newsmagazine , is 30 years old this week . TIME 's birthday theses : <P> That despite the " complexities " of the day , democratic public opinion can know enough to make the right decisions-provided that the press and the intellectuals do their job . <P> That public opinion is now hampered by a crisis among the intellectuals over the possibility and meaning of progress . <P> That if this crisis is solved-and there are signs that it will be-an opportunity for great progress lies ahead , especially in the fields of law , government , economics and international relations . <P> CONFUSION UNDER THE MULBERRIES <P> In 1953 , as always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of 1953 's mulberry bushes : <P> The cold war-how to wage it .

If an egghead is candled , what shows up ? <P> Any of these subjects could serve for birthday reflections . TIME chooses to write about intellectuality , its condition and prospects , because this subject cuts across all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion by reporting the news . <P> Fifty years ago James Bryce , who knew the U.S. as well as any man , raised the question whether democratic public opinion can know enough to do its job . Bryce concluded : " The masses can not have either the leisure or the capacity for investigating the underlying principles of policy or for mastering the details of legislation . Yet they may . . . attain to a sound perception of the main and broad issues of national and international policy , especially in their moral aspects , a perception sufficient to enable them to keep the nation 's action upon right lines . " <P> " Especially in their moral aspects . " That assumes a certain agreement on moral standards , a framework of philosophy about man , the world , and the truth in which facts relevant to the news can be assembled , tests applied , and a rational debate carried on . Speaking of the British public , Arthur Balfour said : " Our whole political machinery presupposes a people so fundamentally at one that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too narrow a word for the vast areas of disagreement and debate that a people who are fundamentally at one can fruitfully enjoy . <P> In the
