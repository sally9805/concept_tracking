Reach for the Sky . ( J. Arthur Rank ) . " Damn ! " thought R.A.F. Cadet Douglas Bader ( rhymes with ah 'd her ) as he lay in the smoking wreckage of his tiny biplane and inspected his shattered leg . " I wo n't be able to play rugger on Saturday . " Cadet Bader was right . By Saturday both his legs were off . " Sssh ! " he heard a nurse say . " There 's a boy dying in there . " The sick man stiffened . " Dying ! We 'll see , " he thought grimly , and began to fight for his life . <P> In fact , 21-year-old Cadet Bader fought with a ferocious courage that amazed his doctors , who had given him up for dead . After that he astounded the artificial-leg industry , which assured him ( as he hurried off to take his best girl dancing ) that no man with two artificial legs could so much as walk without a cane . He then horrified the R.A.F. 's brass , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the Battle of Britain , he painfully distressed the German Luftwaffe . For the few to whom so many owed so much owed much indeed to Wing Commander Douglas Bader , the dogfighting fool who hammered out , in the heat of battle , many of the fighter tactics that prevented a German invasion of England . <P> Reach for the Sky , the most popular picture ( gross : over $1,500,000 ) shown in England during 1956 , is based on Paul Brickhill 's lively biography ( TIME , Aug. 2 , 1954 ) , and has Kenneth More-the bachelor in Genevieve-in the title role . Actor More , who is probably the world 's ablest portrayer of damn-the-torpedoes extraversion , gives a cracking good imitation of a fighting nature that thrived in adversity . Yet the show , more or less , is More-or less . The script suffers from a kind of paraplegia of the narrative instinct , and the fly-stuff never gets off the ground . Even so , the man somehow comes through , and what a man . <P> The Devil 's General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinch , " says the German proverb , " the devil eats flies . " But how did he ever manage , in the puny form of Adolf Hitler , to gobble up all those meaty burghers of the German middle class ? How could so many " good Germans " have been so bad ? This picture , based on a play by Carl ( The Blue Angel ) Zuckmayer and magnificently directed by Helmut Kutner ( The Captain of Kpenick ) , gives an answer that apparently satisfies the Germans . Made in Hamburg in 1955 , the movie has been running for 18 months in West Germany and has grossed 4,000,000 DM . But the U.S. moviegoer , while acknowledging the film 's superlative skill and horror as a biopsy of the Nazi cancer , may have some reservations about how it reads the riddle of the German character . <P> The film 's hero , General Harras ( Curt Jrgens ) , is admittedly modeled after the late Ernst Udet , the German ace of World War I who was a Luftwaffe general in World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he loves his air force , and he knows that if he gives up the one he will have to give up the other . So he goes along , year after year , swallowing his disgust ( " After each sitting i.e. , conference I feel like pulling the chain " ) and guzzling champagne-the picture of a man too weak to put the public good before his private passions , the picture of a Fascist Faust . In the end , of course , the devil demands the reckoning , and Harras goes gallantly to hell .
