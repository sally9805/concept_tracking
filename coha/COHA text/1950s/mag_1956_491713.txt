" Boston , and James Franklin 's literary friends , welcomed Mrs. Dogood , and young Ben eventually " discovered himself " to them . The praise he received , as he had foreseen , irked James , who " thought , probably with reason , that it tended to make Me too vain , " The brothers quarreled .

" ? A new and secret indenture was signed , but " a fresh difference arising between my brother and me . I took upon me to assert my freedom , presuming he would not venture to produce the new indentures . " Thus Ben departed for Philadelphia a free man , and only seventeen . The scratch of his pen , amplified and broadcast by the printing press , had shaped a new world for the boy , and it forecast a career for the man . " Prase writing has been of great use to me in my life , " he testified . " and was a principal means of my advancement . " This was the estimate of a thoughtful elder compiling his only book  --  the Autobiography  --  which Franklin began as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off better in his Almanack for 173H ( Continued from Page 23 ) That year , the sixth of publication by Richard Saunders , Philomath , was a particularly salty one for the seer and proverb maker whose real name was Franklin . His comment on debt was not entirely disapproving : " He that would have a short Lent , let him borrow money to be repaid at Easter . " He was cynical about the weaker sex : " Keep youreyes wide open before marriage , half shut afterwards . " And he was prophetic : " If you would not be forgotten as soon as you arc dead and rotten , write things worth reading or do things worth the writing . " Franklin here penned the recipe for his own fame . No one , in the 250 years since his birth , has equaled him as a writer and doer combined . And the full story of Franklin , the journalist . who publicieed and furthered the aims of Franklin , the tradesman , the scientist , the leader in public affairs at home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told .

Franklin had no illusions about elegance " That is best wrote , " he said , " which is best adapted for ' , Wattling the end of the writer . " And for this purpose , he told his friends , " The words used should be the most expressive that the language affords , provided they are most generally understood . smooth , clear , and short , for the contrary qualities arc displeasing . " This was is tall order for eighteenth-century scribblers , devoted to allegory and involved , rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionably wordy paragraphs , but had inure fun with phrases " clear , and short . " A classic example wound up his letter offering Advice on the Choice of a Mistress . He enumerated , one by one , the reasons why an older woman should be the young blood 's choice . " sib and lastly , " he concluded , " they are so grateful ! " Timid editors excluded this letter from collections of Franklin 's writings until only a few years ago , just as his grandson , William Temple Franklin , rephrased early editions of the Autobiography because he thought the language too coarse . As his grandfather said of one editor : " He has drawn the teeth and pared the nails of my paper , so that it can neither scratch nor bite . It seems only to paw and mumble . " Poor Richard never mumbled . His sayings scratched and bit their way into the language for all time . " Little strokes fell big oaks , " " Lost time is never found again . " " Fish and visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise . " Some of Franklin 's phrases were original , others were rewrites , invariably sharpened by his wit . A joke was his delight . Poor Richard , for instance , converted a popular quotal WO Of the " Camd wits JULUtp- ? Lo " ' Great wits jump . ' says the poet , and hit his head against the post . " The mischievous six teen-yea r-old who jibed at the Temple of Learning  --  and who later published and pushed through a plan for Pennsylvania 's tint college  --  was setting the pattern for a lifetime of literary spoofs and hoaxes , usually at the expense of the high and mighty . Franklin , himself , was careful to stay in the camp of the common man , cultivating " doe habit of eapressing myself in terms of modest diffident " if you would " Wnie with the learned , pronounce with the vulgar . " The world-renowned statesman and man of science began his will : " 1 , Benjamin Franklin , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity with those who labor and trade . It echoed the epitaph he wrote nearly oats years earlier : The Body of B Franklin Printer ( Like the Cower of an old Book ha Contents torn out And strips of its Lettering &; Gilding ) Lies Here , Food for Worms But the Work dial ) not be : For it trill , ( as hr behey 'd ) appear once more , In a new and more elegant Edition Brvisecl and corrected By the Author The epitaph was never inscribed on Franklin 's grave , though he circulated it widely and several copies in his own hand ? writing still exist . It 's a fair guess that the clever sailing man was n't thinking of posterity , but only of amusing and impressing his immediate audience . Franklin 's world , at twenty-three , was Philadelphia . He had found a partner and the money to set up a press , and planned to establish a newspaper . Fk was bucking MO printers already in business . One of them . named Bradford , had a newspaper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining . " The other printer , Keimer , was Franklin 's former employer . A young friend asked Ben for work , but : " We could not then employ him ; bus I foolishly kt him know as is secret that I soon intended w begin a newspaper , and might then have work for him . " The friend talked to Reimer , who immediately announced that he would publish a paper too , Franklin " resented this ; and , to counteract them , as I could not yet begin our paper , I wrote several pieces of entertainment for Bradford 's paper under the title of Busy-Body .... By this means the attention of the ( Continued an Page V ) 53 RIP SAWING January 91 , 1956 ( Continued from Page 53 ) publick was fixed on that paper . " Kcimer found the competition too rough , and in Less than a year sold out to young Ben . This was The Pennsylvania Gazette , from which The Saturday Evening Post descends . Poor Richard had learned " Three may keep a secret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God helps them that help themselves . " Franklin 's ambition  --  and need for business  --  led him to take a hand in public affairs even before he got the newspaper . Now the journalist reached out to influence all of Pennsylvania . He " had forrn 'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement , which we called the Junto , " and one of the topics they discussed , deeply troubling the colony of Pennsylvania , was the dwindling supply of ready money . As Poor Richard said : " The sleeping fox catches no poultry . Up ! Up ! " " I wrote and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it , entitled The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency . It was well receiv 'd by the common people in general ; but the rich men dislik 'd it . " Pennsylvania 's politicians , however , passed a paper-money bill , and Franklin 's friends among them , " who conceiv 'd I had been of some service , thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to mc . This was another advantage gain 'd by my being able to write . " Once the printing business was on its feet , the young tradesman became the civic leader , launching his projects " by writing on the subject in the newspapers , which was my usual custom in such cases . " The Gazette quoted an ' ' old citizen " who claimed " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " and suggested that Philadelphians follow " the example of a city in a neighboring province . There is , I am well informed , a club or society of active men belonging to each fire engine , whose business is to attend all fires with it whenever they happen . " Within a few months the city had its first volunteer fire company . Just as sonic years later the Gazette 's editor invited citizens " to subscribe to the articles of insurance of houses from fire " at the organization of America 's first company for this purpose . Franklin 's name was second on the list of directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His account of the Newly Invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces  --  introducing the famous Franklin stove  --  pioneered advertising 's " scare " technique . " Fireplaces with small openings cause draughts of cold air to rush in at every crevice , " he said , " and ' t is very uncomfortable , as well as dangerous to sit against any such crevice . . . women , particularly from this cause ( as they sit so much in the house ) get colds in the head , rhcurns and defluxions , which fall into their jaws and gums , and ease destroyed early , many a fine set of teeth in these northern colonies . Great and bright fires do also very much to contribute to damaging the eyes , dry and shrivel the skin and bring on early the appearance of old age . " The stove , he explained , overcame this threat , the owner no longer " being scorched ? before , and , as it were , froze behind . " Franklin , incidentally , refused a patent On his stove , offered by the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the inventions of others , we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by an invention of ours , and this we should do freely and generously . " He followed this precept with all his inventions , including the lightning rod . Franklin , by I 7.1.7 , was both busy and successful : public printer for three colonies , deputy postmaster at Philadelphia , clerk to the Pennsylvania Assembly , and sur rounded by influential friends in the outgrowth of his Junto , the American Philosophical Society . The journalist was ready to test his skill in politics . England was at war with France and Spain , and raiders from both nations came plundering up the Delaware , nearly to Philadelphia . The editor of the Gazette and his friends decided that the time had come to stir the ileac --  loving Quakers and their business-as-usual friends to armed defense . " I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people . " he recalled . " To promote . this I first wrote and published a pamphlet entitled Plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strung lights . " Franklin 's memoirs , however , neglect to say that the pamphlet was not over his signature , but signed by A Tradesman , who called on his friends , the " middling people , the farmers , shopkeepers , and tradesmen of this city and country " to take the lead . The mythical Tradesman ridiculed the disputes of his neighbuts : " Till of late I could scarce believe the story of him who refused to pump in a sinking ship because one on board whom he hated would be saved by it as well as himself . " Franklin , prior to the Tradesman 's pamphlet , had published several articles from other writers in the Gazette , arguing the need for defense . The response was quick , and the Tradesman stepped forward under his true name with a plan for an association of militia which soon totaled litICO men throughout the province . This was Franklin 's trial run of the newspaper and pamphlet technique he later used in England . shaping the course of world ( ' vents as the quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the journalist reached London , where he lived from 1757 to 176 ' 2 , mid from 171 ; . t to 1775 , hr had the whole world for his audience , and made the most of it . Recent research by Verner W. Crane , University of Michigan scholar , revealing many hitherto unidentified articles penned and planted by " old traitor " Franklin , as British enemies called him , indicates that his political pleading of the American cause adds up to the largest sintli ? bo Iv of his contemporaneously publisheJ writings . Franklin was indignant at the stupidity of British policy hung before his first mission to London As Anwricanus , in the Gazette . he had an answer for the shiploads of convicted felons that England continued to exile to America . ? ' s'hy not return rattlesnakes ? " In the spring of the year , when they lust creep out of their holes , they are feeble , heavy , slow , and easily taken ; and if a small bounty vivre a per head , some thousands might be collected rannually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them carefully distributed in St. James 's Park , in the Spring Gardens and other places of pleasure about London ; in the gardens of all the nobility and gentry throughout the nation ; but particularly in the gardens of the prime ministers , the lords of trade , and members of Parliament , for to them we arc most particularly obliged . " Franklin shared the interest of other early Americans in the snake as a symbol  --  or he may have inspired it . Just prior to a meeting of commissioners from all the colonies at Albany , called to sign a treaty with the Indians , the first cartoon published in America appeared in the Gazette . Franklin , who had been appointed to travel to Albany , is believed to have drawn it , adding illustration to his use of words . The sketch shows a snake divided in eight pieces , each labeled with the name of a colony , above the legend " Join or Die . " A federation of the colonies became Franklin 's aim , and he attempted , unsuccessfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as Poor Richard said , " He that would catch fish must venture his bait . " In this instance the bait had not been offered by the journalist in papers outside Pennsylvania . There was only the Gazette cartoon . Union in America was part of the larger vision of a great transatlantic empire that Franklin , the unofficial press agent and propagandist for the colonies in London , Tried hard to sell . Not long after the Albany meeting he published a pamphlet , Observations on the Increase of Mankind , predicting that " our people must at least be doubled every twenty years . But notwithstanding this increase , so vast is the territory of North America , that it will require many ages to settle it fully . " So , he argued , " in proportion to the increase ul the coinnics , a vast demand is growing for British manufactures , a glorious market wholly in the power of Britain . " Franklin continually aimed Iris propaganda for America at the interests of Britain 's traders arid merchants . He had gone to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for the colony to tax the landholdings of the Penns . He planted an anonymous discussion of proprietary tax dodging in one of the London papers . Articles by other writers filled the press , and pamphlets on the subject were distributed . B. Franklin , Printer , with a wide acquaintance in the publishing trade , was augmenting the work of B. Franklin , journalist , to become , as Carl Van Doren described him , " ambassador from America before America had the right to send one . " The Penns were taxed , and Doctor Franklin  --  whose honorary degrees now 57 included one from Harvard ! ? turned to his imperial schemes . ' Die war had ended in Canada , and England talked of returning this vast wilderness to the French . By all means , gibed Franklin , writing as an anonymous Briton in the London Chronicle , " We should restore Canada ( to France ) , that we may soon have a new war , and another opportunity of spending two or three millions a year in America ; there being great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being sufficient to drain our immense treasures . " He turned also to the public welfare , persuading an outstanding physician to write a pamphlet on " do-it-yourself ' smallpox inoculation . Franldin sent 1,500 copies to America fur free distribution . Smallpox had robbed Franklin of his son , Francis , who had not been inoculated . He realized , he wrote feelingly in a preface , that " if one parent or near relation is against it , the other does not choose to inoculate a child without free consent of all parties , " and that " when a cormnon tradesman or artificer has a number in his family to have the distemper it amounts to more money than he can well spare . " These were the problems lie hoped the pamphlet would overcome . He was back in Philadelphia when Parliament proposed a new tax on America through the Stamp Act . Poor Richard , preparing his Almanack for 1765 at the lime , remarked that " Taxes of late years have greatly increased among us , and now it is said we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trade is at the same time to be curtailed and restricted . " If so . " Poor Richard suggested that Americans " supply ourselves from our own produce home . To this end , I have'colcoed and written a few plain instructions ... first , for making good wine of our own wild grapes . Secondly , for raising Madeira wine in these provinces . Thirdly , for the iinprovement of our corn spirits , so iis they may be preferable to rum . " Recipes for wine and whisky were not as strong medicine as the colonists had in mind . They wanted no part of the Stamp Act , and fur once in his life Franklin lagged behind his readers . He ran for the Pennsylvania Assembly and was defeated . The journalist in politics had forgotten Poor Richard 's advice to " Let thy discontents be thy secrets ; if the world knows them , it will despise thee and increase them . " Ile had once called the German settlers , whom he could n't reach with the English language , " Palatine boors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Christian white savages , " after they massacred some defenseless Indians . The Germans and the Scotch-Irish joined the Penns and their following of Philadelphia aristocrats in an anti-Franklin campaign , which failed , however , to keep the Assembly from sending him back to London . When the Stamp Act was passed Philadelphians threatened to burn his home . Mrs. Franklin barricaded herself in one room With a collection of guns , but was not disturbed . lier distinguished husband in Britain held fast to his dream of transatlantic empire , but " You may sometimes be timid , in the wrong in owning your being in the right . " He set his pen to work more vigorously for America , ridiculing newswri ters who discussed affairs in the colonies , yet knew nothing of America . Some , he said , have recently stated clothing manufacture is impossible there because " their sheep have but little wool . " " Dear sir , " wrote A Traveller in the London Public Advertiser , " do not let us suffer ourselves to be amused with such groundless objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The very tails of the American ( Continued on Page 60 ) sheep are ( Continued from Page 57 ) so laden with wool that each has a car or waggon on four little wheels to support and keep it flout trailing on the ground . " " All this is as certainly true , " A Traveller insisted , " as the account , said to be from Quebec in the papers of last week , that the inhabitants of Canada are making preparations for a cod and whale fishery this summer in the Upper Likes . Ignorant people may object that the Upper Lakes arc fresh and that cod and whale are salt-water fish : But let them know , sir , that cod , like other fish , when attacked by their enemies , fly into any water where they think they can be safest ; that telltales , when they have a mind to cat cod , pursue them wherever they fly ; and that the grand leap of the whale in that cheer up the fall of Niagara is esteemed by all who have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Franklin turned from satire to facts , writing as A Friend to Both Countries " That the acts for regulating commerce and navigation , and the post-office act , differ very materially from the stamp . act . The former lay duties on the importation of goods , which people may buy or let alone , and the other fixes a rate for the carriage of letter 's .... But the stamp art form ' the money from the country under heavy penalties , and denies common justice in the courts . " These were the arguments he later used in his examination by Parliament , which was followed by repeal of the Stamp Act . When that news readied America , Doctor Franklin 's loyalties were no longer questioned . The Stamp Act , however , was just a prelude to laws " to be abhorred and opposed by every free-bons Englishman , " for " taxation without representation is slavery , " Franklin and his assistants , labeled " young sucking Americans " by the British , filled the papers with their output . He had said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated in the belief that when men differ in opinion , both sides ought equally to have the advantage of being heard by the public . " America 's press agent now made the most of this opportunity , for , as he told a friend : " The ancient Roman and Greek or tors could only speak to the number of citizens capable of being assembled within the reach of their voice . Their writings had little effect , because the bulk of the people could not read . Now by the press we can speak to nations , and good books and well-written pamphlets have great and general influence .... We now find that it is not only right to strike while the iron is hot , but that it may be very practicable to heat it by continually striking . " HIS most famous hoax was hugely enjoyed by Doctor Franklin himself , who happened to be with friends when they first read it . He watched indignation turn to laughter , and finally found himself " discovered " as the author . It purported to he An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That the first German settlements made in the island of Britain were by colonies of our people , subject to our renowned ducal ancestors , and drawn from their dominions . " Therefore , said the king , " there shall be levied and paid to our officers of the customs , on all goods , wares , and merchandises , and on all grain and other produce of the earth , exported from the said island of Britain , and on all goods of whatever kind imported into the same , a duty . " The edict prohibited iron manufacture and hat making in Britain , " but , list the said islanders suffer inconvenience by the want of hats , we are farther graciously pleased to permit them to send their beaver furs to Prussia ; and we also permit hats made therefrom to be exported from Prussia to Britain , the people thus favored to pay all costs and charges of manufacturing , interest , commission to our merchants , insurance and freight , going and returning , as in the case of iron . " Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that these our royal regulations will be thought just and reasonable by our colonists in England ; the said regulations being copies from their statutes . . . entered into for the good government of their own colonies in Ireland and America . " The journalist now reluctantly began to abandon his dream of empire . " Where complaining is a crime , hope becomes despair . " He was stripped of his postmaster-ship for North America , and abused at a hearing before the lords of privy council . Secret diplomacy occupied his last months abroad . All tics with England were gouts from the mind of the man who returned to America feeling : " If we tamely give up our rights in t his con test , a century to name will not restore us in the opinion of the world ; we shall be stamped with the character of bastards , poltroons , and fools , and be despised and trampled upon , 001 by this haughty , insolent nation only , but by all mankind . " There was little time for journalism in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pustmaster for America , president of the Committee of Safety to defend Pennsylvania , and a member of the first Continental Congress . He helped with the drafting of the Declaration of I ndependence , and then , in his seventieth year , sailed for France to continue , as commissioner for Congress , his stork for America . Le dor Inv Franklin 's reputation was " more universal than that of Leibnitz or Newton , Frederick or Voltaire , " fellow commissioner John Adams admitted , although his blunt nature was repelled by Franklin 's worldly wit and charm . " His plans and his example were to abolish monarchy , aristocracy and hierarchy throughout the world . " To this end , commissioner Franklin negotiated patiently and privately with the ministers of France 's monarch , and journalist Franklin kept his hand in too . A Comparison of Great Britain and the United States in Regard to the Basis of Credit in the Two Countries was printed in many languages throughout Europe , arguing " From the general industry , frugality , ability , prudence , and virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to say nothing of the satisfaction generous minds ' mist have in reflecting that by loans to America they are opposing tyranny and aiding the cause of liberty , which is the cause of mankind . " He worked through the French press , although not to the degree he reached in London . His hoaxes became vitriolic . The Sale of the Hessians , pointing a bloody finger at Britain 's use of mercenary troops in America , claimed to be from a European count to his commander abroad . The count was delighted at die slaughter ; he was paid handsomely for every subject who Med . " I have learned with unspeakable pleasure the courage our troops exhibited at Trenton , " wrote the count , " and you can not imagine toy joy on being told that of the t95o Hessians engaged in the light , but 31,5 escaped . . . . I ant about to send you some new recruits . Do n't economize them . " Doctor Franklin 's most ambitious  --  and gruesomely effective  --  huaa issued from the press he installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . He concocted A Supplement to the Boston Independent Chronicle , complete even to advertisements , all of it embroidery for the story of a mythical Captain Gerrish , of the New England militia , Gerrish described packages " containing scalps of our unhappy country-folks taken in the three last years by the Senneka Indians , " who were in the pay of the British . He claimed to have found a letter from a British agent , Crauford , listing the contents of each package . " No. , s , " for instance , " Containing ! Oa of farmers ... only 18 marked with a little yellow flame , to denote their being of prisoners burnt alive , after being scalped , their nails pulled out by the roots , and other torments . " Credulous editors nearly too years after Franklin 's death quoted the British agent , Crauford , to substantiate the horrors of Indian warfare . " The form may not be genuine , but the Substance is truth , " the sage , and wily , old journalist insisted at the time ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves catches no mice , " and in this instance was sharpening his well-worn claws for the negotiations which brought peace with England that year , Franklin was besieged by those who wished to emigrate , and printed at Passy , in both French and English , Information to Those Who Would Remove to America . The new world welcomed the humble artisan and the industrious , he indicated , while the scholar , the artist and the soldier would seek in vain for a career . " Much less is it advisable , " he warned , " for a person to go thither who has no other quality to recommend him but his birth .... It is a commodity that can not be carried to a worse market than that of America . " Franklin returned to Philadelphia in 1785 . He was nearly eighty , crippled with gout and a kidney stone , but served for three years as President ( governor ) of Pennsylvania and participated in the framing of the Constitution . He had found time at Passy to write for his 05,41 pleasure and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the women who loved him because he , in turn , so obviously adored their little vanities and feminine charm . There was the parable of the boy and the man " who gave too much for his whistle , " and the moral of The Handsome and the Deformed Leg , advising " unhappy people , that if they wish to be respected and beloved by others , and happy in themselves , they should leave off looking at the ugly leg . " The elder statesman at home , who knew " in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes , " was too busy with the little time left to him , and often too uncomfortable , for more than occasional writing . But the journalist could n't resist one last newspaper hoax the month that he died , in his eighty-fifth year . Congress had been petitioned to abolish slavery and was warned by , James Jackson , of Georgia , against " meddling with the affair of slavery or attempting to mend the condition of die slaves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new nation , and putting on his cloak of anonymity for the last time , he answered Jackson through the pages of the Federal Gazette . The Algerian pirates , plundering young America 's ships and enslaving their crews , were then loathed by everyone . The writer in the Gazette , therefore , turned the tables on Jackson by quoting from a divan of Algiers , said to have received a petition for the abolition of piracy and slavery in his nation . Franklin 's invented African toiler decreed : " The doctrine that plundering and enslaving the Christians is unjust , is at best problematical ; but that it is the interest of this state to continue the practice , is clear ; therefore let the petition be rejected . " Franklin 's last hoax was as timely and unerringly aimed at his readers  --  both the marks of good journalism  --  as all that preceded it . He ended his writing as he had begun , poking fun . Poor Richard , who liked to quip , " There 's more old drunkards than old doctors , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise up with fleas , " knew the value of laughter , whether he was selling almanacs , describing an invention or shaping world affairs .
