Pakistan 's quarrels with India have been so virulent that outsiders have had to intervene-the U.N . to separate the armies in Kashmir , the International Bank to arbitrate rights to the Indus River waters . This summer , trouble flared along East Pakistan 's ill-marked borders , and once again Pakistan 's Moslem Leaguers whooped it up for holy war . Customarily , any politician who talks on India in conciliatory tones risks political suicide . But Feroz Khan Noon , the tall , Oxford-educated aristocrat who became Pakistan 's seventh Prime Minister last winter , decided that such irresponsible fire-breathing had gone on too long . Bluntly warning that " U.S. military aid will stop if Pakistan talks in terms of war , " Noon challenged the zealots : " If you think you can wage a war with India standing on your own feet , you can come and do it . I shall not lead this country to war , because I know war will destroy both countries and solve no problems . " <P> Noon 's words won quick response from India 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intolerable nuisance . " Last week Prime Minister Noon flew to New Delhi with his handsome , Hungarian-born Begum for the first meeting of Prime Ministers of the two countries since 1955 . Nehru sprang gallantly forward to retrieve Begum Noon 's golden slipper when it fell as she stepped out of the plane . He escorted them to the high-domed Presidential House , and the talks began . The two leaders quickly worked out an agreement to trade several small enclaves along the disputed East Pakistan border " with a view to relieving tension . " <P> Both Prime Ministers stressed that their present step was less important than the direction in which they were moving . Next , ministers from each side will tackle West Pakistan 's border .
