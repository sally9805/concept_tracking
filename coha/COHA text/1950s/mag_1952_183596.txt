Deep in the coal country , at Institute , W. Va. , 30 newsmen gathered last week to see something new in the way of a chemical plant . From a distance , the $11-million factory looked like many another-a mass of storage tanks , pipes , warehouses , and above it all a thin wisp of smoke . But close up , it was like nothing else in the world . Amid the maze of gurgling pipes and steaming valves , scarcely a worker could be seen . Staffed by only 50 men-mostly chemical engineers-the plant runs continuously , 24 hours per day , with scarcely any need of human attention . <P> It is different in another way . Built and operated by the huge Union Carbide &; Carbon Corp. , it is the only commercial plant in the world that uses coal as a direct raw material for producing chemicals . By means of hydrogenation , a method of pulverizing coal and combining it with hydrogen under extreme pressure , it produces cheap hydrocarbons . <P> With the new plant , Union Carbide opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new abundance of such coal-hydrogenation chemicals as toluene , xylene , napthalene and phenol , predicted Union Carbide 's President Morse Dial , will come an endless stream of new medicines and drugs , long-wearing and fireproof fabrics , new paints and detergents , better weed-killers and insecticides . <P> Saving Time . Hydrogenation of coal is not a Union Carbide invention ; the Germans used a similar method to produce gasoline during World War II , and the U.S. Government is also using it at a synthetic liquid-fuel plant at Louisiana , Mo . ( TIME , May 23 , 1949 ) . But Union Carbide is the first to build such a plant as a source of chemicals . After long research , it has succeeded in cutting the hydrogenation process from an hour to a few minutes , reducing the amount of high-cost hydrogen needed and boosting production of such chemicals as phenol ( a base for plastics ) and aniline ( a base for dyestuffs ) as much as 500 times the output by previous methods based on coke . <P> More Expansion . Until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in perfumes , synthetic rubber , explosives and drugs ) have been based on raw materials drawn from byproducts of the steel indus . try 's coke ovens . Yet demand for them is growing at an average rate of 30% a year , while the supply has been growing by less than 5% . With the information gained from the new pilot plant , Union Carbide hopes soon to build a full-scale hydrogenation plant which will help solve this raw-materials problem for good . <P> President Dial , who came up through the ranks as a star salesman , and took command only three weeks ago ( TIME ,
