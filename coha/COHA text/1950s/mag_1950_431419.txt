CHANCES are neither you nor your friends ever saw an engine like this . Guesses will run wild when you ask others how it works , and most of them will be dead wrong . Substantial and good looking , it has a lively pop as you turn it over by hand , and it has the staccato roar of a small gas engine when it 's running at speed . It will readily operate light model machinery and toys . Fitted to a turntable as on page 177 , it makes a fascinating shopwindow display . In tests it has run 40 minutes on one filling of its small lamp . But do n't expect it to turn a heavy load or run a model speedboat . Like a gas engine , it delivers full power only at higher speeds , and its weight makes it awkward for use in small model boats . Not only is this baby engine fun to operate . but it 's a top-notch project on which to break in a new lathe and get the hang of basic machining operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing , simple milling , drilling , and tapping . The photos on these pages show how Floyd McGuckin , of Ridgewood , N. J. , did the whole job while PS looked on . You can make the engine out of scrap , turning the cylinder from solid cast iron , bronze , or ducal , and building up a base . However , castings save a lot of shopping and machining time . Those who would rather spend a few bucks than many hours can inquire of Mr. McGuckin . The whole job can be clone on a bench lathe , although a drill press will speed up the job . Only one tap and one die ( 6-32 ) are required . In addition to engine stock , you 'll need a length of 1 1/16 " bar for a mandrel , and a Mt " disk of any metal for the jig on which the valve cam is turned . The cylinder casting can be gripped in a three-jaw chuck ; but since it 's not balanced , lathe speeds must be kept reasonably low . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding by hand , to get under the hard scale . Light cuts and power feed  | should be used to bring the bore to size . A tapered bore , or bellmouth , will be fatal to good performance . It 's important to get a free-running but reasonably airtight fit between piston and cylinder . The cast fins require no turning . If the port face is roughened in filing the port , you should lap it dead smooth . This can be done by rubbing it on a fine oilstone , but be careful not to rock the cylinder and so round the surface . If you have n't a drill press , spot the bearing holes on both uprights , drill them undersize , and run a k " drill or reamer through both at once to bring them into line . Probably the trickiest piece of work involved is the combined crank disk and cam . Take special care in laying out the 15/32 " offset center and the 30 ? angle on the jig . since these determine the valve timing . This part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cam profile , round its sharp corners with a file . Then rechuck the piece on the 2 " diameter as at the top of page 211 . Put the h " crankshaft in the tailstock chuck and press it in by advancing the ram with the handwheel . This trick helps you get the disk on square . Be sure to turn the bottom of the piston cavity flat so , that the wrist-pin stud will  | seat squarely for an airtight fit . Since all the engine 's power is derived from atmospheric pressure , a good piston fit is vital . But this must be obtained without undue friction . With the cylinder plug in , the port covered , and the cylinder only lightly oiled , the piston should offer real resistance to a pull , and should snap back by itself when released . If you have means of " miking " the cylinder , you can turn the piston about one thousandth undersize . If not , use the cylinder itself as a gauge . A couple of shallow oil grooves can be turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milling setup for slotting the wrist-pin stud , Turn the stud with a little pip about 1/16 " in diameter on the face . Set it up as shown ,  | aligning it with the slitting saw by bringing the stock against the saw before clamping the tool holder . This also insures cutting the slot across two corners of the hexagon . Line up the pip with the saw ; it gives you an aiming point , and , if you do n't hit center the first crack , you 've cut only into the pip , not the stud . A similar setup mills the valve and con rods . It 's a good plan to cut the eon rod a bit long and file it to size after a trial assembly . At top dead center ( all the way in the cylinder ) the top of the piston should come flush with the edge of the port nearest the flywheel . When threading the end of the con rod , it 's also well to open up the die , if it 's adjustable , to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight fit and helps keep it in alignment with the wrist pin . Heat the .010 " clock-spring stock red hot and let it cool very slowly . So annealed , it wo n't crack . The valve clip is meant to provide a flexible coupling without horizontal play , and also to hold the valve gently on the port face . You 'll have to anneal the small end to drill the rivet holes , but try to leave the center portion hard . After laying out the fork on 1/16 " stock , drill a hole at the end of the slot .. Saw to the hole and file the edges true . Do n't drill the hole for the valve rod until you 've bent the short leg . Turn the roller from steel . Shoulder down a bit of h " rod to fit the roller ; then put the roller on to locate the end of the shoulder , thread , and cut off . By assembling the valve and piston actions separately , you can make sure both run freely . If the piston binds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all parts assembled , the valve should lift with a pop as the flywheel is spun forward ( counterclockwise from the valve side ) .  | When turned backward , the piston should resist and snap the wheel back if released . Make a hole in a small oil can or similar container and solder in a bit of % " i.d . tubing to hold a soft string wick just below the port opening . Bend a retaining clip from spring stock and mount it on the base with a thumbscrew . Pull out enough wick to give a flame about 1% " high . To start the engine , turn it to top dead center and give it a hearty spin forward . Turn the lamp in the base ring for best operation ; flame position can be critical . If piston and valve seem reasonably airtight and the engine is mechanically free but wo n't run , or has little pep , check flame height and valve action . The port should be fully uncovered just past top dead center . If the engine picks up just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Lapping the port face , if you have n't done so , ma ) improve operation . Friction must be held to a minimum . The valve should bear very lightly on the port , and valve-spring tension must not be excessive .  |
