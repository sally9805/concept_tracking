THE holdup was a relatively rare form of crime forty or fifty years ago , though well publicized even then . Nowadays it is the most common form of serious crime . It would be interesting to know the reasons for this sudden rise in popularity . No doubt the ever-increasing complexity of our way of life has had something to do with it . Psychologists declare that excessive discipline is likely to result in impulses of cruelty and destruction , and it seems probable that the innumerable social pressures to which the individual is subjected in our society give rise to aggressive feelings ultimately requiring outlets ? certainly our preoccupation with bloodthirsty comics , movies , radio programs , and mystery and detective fiction is not accidental . And certainly the stickup is an aggressive action of classic directness and simplicity . Such an explanation may account in part for the innumerable holdups of drug stores and filling stations , the frequent heists pulled with glass pistols , cap pistols , water pistols , air guns ; the haberdasheries and cigar stores stuck up as Jesse James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose main purpose seems to be maltreatment of the victims : the Lovers Lane holdups , the cab-drivers robbed of fares and tips . Such holdups undoubtedly have a large emotional , or neurotic , component . Obviously , the motivation is not a rational weighing of risks against possible gain , for banks might be robbed almost as cheaply ? not that bank robbery is lightly punished , but that we punish robbery of any type more severely than several varieties of murder ( in some states by death ) , a lesson in applied Christianity as pointed , in its way , as our custom of requisitioning lives though not money in time of war , or the size of the vote polled by Norman Thomas . There are more tangible reasons for the emergence of the holdup as a professional technique , though here too emotional and social factors of course are present . Technological change occurs in the underworld , as elsewhere . During the past few generations several ancient and dishonorable professions have given way to others better suited to the times . In comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box-busting racket is a case in point . Forty or fifty years ago , the safe-cracker was considered the prince of thieves . Though the best of the modern boxmen can open modern safes as efficiently as the petermen of half a century ago could open those of that day , the profession is fast on the down-grade . Cash simply is not kept in safes as it was . For the most part , business is carried on by check , and checks are worthMr . DeBaun , who is now serving a sentence for robbery in a state penitentiary in the East , was himself a heavy criminal , specializing in the heist , before his arrest . less as loot . Similarly , securities are now seldom readily negotiable , stamps are giving way to postage meters , jewelry is a drug on the market ? " slum , " as it is familiarly called , brings but from 15 to 20 per cent of the replacement value at fence , while silver is hardly worth carrying off , and watches can be disposed of for no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cases . Furthermore , that infallible source of cash in large amounts . the bank , is no longer vulnerable to the safecracker , thanks chiefly to the time lock , a device which may be set to jam the bolt mechanism for a period during which a vault may not be opened even by some one possessing the combination . Consequently , the Max Shinburnes , Leonidas Leslies , Chauncy Johnsons , Adam Worths , Bob Scotts , and Jimmy Hopes who during the last quarter of the past century burglarized banks of sums said to total close to a hundred million dollars ? a number of the individual " scores " were for more than a million ? have gone the way of the horse and buggy . Their present-day counterparts are top-grade holdup-men ? " heist-men " in the underworld argot . For technical reasons , chief among them the relative scarcity of readily convertible securities , holdups the size of the old-time bank burglaries are few and far between . Scores running into the hundreds of thousands are no rarity , but so far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bank in Lincoln , Nebraska , in the early thirties . These big jobs are the work of what are probably the most highly skilled professional thieves in the world , but even on its lower levels the holdup in the hands of the professional has little but the name in common with the amateur , or neurotic , article . The almost invariable mark of the latter ? called " cowboy-job " by the professional in derisive reference to the stagecoach holdups in Western movies ? is recklessness . Planning is often nonexistent ; the simplest precautions may be ignored ; victims may be unnecessarily maltreated ; the robber is not infrequently caught in the act . A psychiatrist once said to me that the frequency with which holdup-men of this stamp manage to be caught on the job indicated to him a desire to be caught and punished ? the social conscience at work . The idea is not as wild as it may sound . However , under our system punishments are so ferocious MAGAZINE that the guilt-ridden culprit speedily becomes the aggrieved , free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This state of mind , which may of course arise more often from causes other than imprisonment , is characteristic of the professional thief . Not very surprisingly , the earmarks of the professional holdup are careful planning and efficient execution . SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY cookbook advises those who would prepare jugged hare first to catch their hare . To pull a heist , first find your " mark . " A mark may be any considerable sum of money or the equiva-lent in readily convertible swag . Professional heist-men judge marks in terms of the prob-able cash return relative to the risks involved . Marks are either dug up or tipped off . When a heist-man says that he has dug one up , he means that he has found it himself . He may have sought it out , tailing ladies who appear in public festooned like Christmas trees with jewels , or armored cars making deliveries of payrolls , for instance . Or he may just have stumbled upon it , like one who was introduced by a casual resort acquaintance into a private poker game in which some $12,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor of a saloon where he occasionally stopped for a beer made a practice of cashing pay-checks for employees of a nearby refinery . Marks that have been tipped off are those that have been pointed out by others . One who tips off marks is called a finger-man or tipster ; he may or may not be of the under-world . Sometimes pickpockets , gamblers , and other footloose grifters tip marks off to heist-men as a side-line . The standard remunera-tion for this service is 10 per cent of the gross score . A surprisingly large number of marks are tipped off by legit , or ostensibly honest , people , and no few are put up ( whence , inci-dentally , the colloquial expression " put-up job " ) or prearranged : a truck driver would like a share of the value of the load of cigar-ettes or whiskey he will be carrying ; a jeweler wants to beat his insurance company ; a bank manager wishes to cover his embezzlements . As the police are well aware of this , many heist-men fight shy of such tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor by the thief 's standards , is likely to break down under close questioning , and promises of immunity for himself , and finger his partners as thoroughly as he formerly fingered the mark . Other things being equal , the cash mark is always preferable . There is nothing like a bank for cold cash in large amounts , and until recently the " jug " was beyond argument the best type of mark by professional criteria . It is true that for many years banks of any size have had what looks to be formidable protection , but in robbery as in warfare of other types the aggressor has a heavy advantage . Armed guards , vaults with walls of steel and concrete several feet in thickness , and elaborate alarm systems did not prevent heist-mobs from knocking over an average of about two banks a day during the early thirties . In 1934 , however , Congress passed an act making bank robbery a federal offense and bringing it under the jurisdiction of the FBI , a police organization having almost unlimited funds and unique facilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably as extensive as any outside Russia . Simultaneously , the flat twenty-five-year sentence for hank robbery became mandatory , and the government established a special prison for " jug-heists " ( the species populates Alcatraz almost 100 per cent ) , operated on principles that would turn the stomach of a Turk . These additional risks require that others be at a minimum if a bank is to be marked nowadays , and the same is true of the mails . There are numerous types of cash mark which do not involve federal heat , however . Of these , the payroll is probably the most popular . Although payrolls do not compare in size with banks as marks , they are far more numerous and , since their physical protection is usually comparatively light , are vulnerable to smaller mobs . Anyone working as a member of a three-handed mob scoring three $10,000 payrolls fares as well financially as if he had taken part in a five-handed bank robbery worth $50,000 , at about one-tenth the risk . Marks for swag . or loot readily convertible into cash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they have the considerable disadvantage that the take must be fenced , or sold . Since this involves a suicidal risk if undertaken through legitimate channels , swag is usually sold to a professional buyer of stolen goods . The fence not only helps himself to a whopping profit ? he seldompays more than 20 per cent even for gilt-edge swag ? but often he is not reliable in the face of police pressure , and not uncommonly does business with police and politicians , or pays in money and information for tacit permission to operate . Sometimes , particularly when jewelry or securities are involved , it is possible to bypass the fence in favor of the company which has insured the loss . Settlement in such cases runs about 20 per cent of the insured amount , no questions asked . Several private detective agencies are widely known as specialists in negotiating such transactions , which also are often handled through attorneys . If the robbery was the doing of Americans , it is a safe bet that the $785,000 in jewelry heisted from the Aga Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IvEN a mark , the next step is mobbing up , or getting together the men who mill work the job . A working unit of underworld professionals of any type is called a mob . There are " single-o " heist-men , such as the one known in the papers as Slick Willie , who has robbed large and well-protected banks single-handed , but the vast majority of the brotherhood work in mobs . A heist-mob may comprise from two to six or eight members ? the type of mark is usually the determining factor . Thus , the " same " mob ? i.e. , several of a group of stickup-men who sometimes work together ? may be five-handed for a jug-heist and three-handed for a payroll job . There are excellent reasons why the mob is generally of the minimum size compatible with efficient operation . One is selfish : " The smaller the mob , the bigger the cut . " The other is protective : each additional member adds to the risk of a fall , paradoxical as this may seem . The answer is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , despite the highly imaginative information ladled out for popular consumption along this line , as a result of acute detective work . Almost always he is caught because of information given to police . Eddie suddenly squares his debts and springs with a new car , for instance , or begins shooting high craps and buying drinks for the house , or buys a fur coat for Marge , who can not resist throwing the needles to that catty Doris , who puts two and two together and confides the result to Nettie , whose husband Louie peddles dope or does a bit of pimping or wants to get City Hall 's okay to book numbers or horses in his cigar store . In every city , police permit numerous Louies to operate in consideration for periodical cash donations , plus just such favors as the one Louie is now in a position to confer . H Eddie can not stand up under the beatings he will now undergo as a matter of police routine , or if Marge knows who his partners are and can be talked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the whole mob may fall . Popular notions notwithstanding , the basic units of a heist-mob are not a " mastermind " and some servile morons who carry out his orders . As a matter of fact , among " heavy " * thieves no one gives orders for the good reason that no one takes them ? the heavy is as independent a character as walks the earth . Within the mob , equality reigns . All share equally in risk and gain . All have equal authority . This is not to imply that the members of a mob simply behave as they please on the job . There a rather rigid discipline prevails , but all have had a voice in the plan being carried out and authority has been delegated willingly . T HE true essentials of a heist-mob are a wheel-man and a rod-rnan . The former is a skilled driver , often a specialist who takes no other part ( this is preferred practice ) . Yet if the mob is short-handed or somewhat slipshod in operation he may work the inside with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rod is a gun . Since most holdups involve the close control of a number of people during the course of the actual robbery , most mobs have two or more gun-wielding members . In special cases , a mob may use a man on the outside in addition to the man on the wheel . For example , the getaway route for a job located in the business section of a city may begin with a run down a narrow alley or a one-way street , in which case a tail , a car or truck which cuts in behind * Professional thieves fall into two categories . The " heavy " is primarily the rebel-without-a-cause ; his attitudes are inflexibly anti-authoritarian ; his techniques are based upon the use or threat of force . The " grafter " is essentially the business man whose line happens to be illegal ; his attitudes are closer to the conventional ; his techniques feature superior dexterity or chicane.the getaway car and blocks the way long enough for the former to get a sufficient jump , may be used . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel and either two or three on the inside . A mob forms rather casually . Eddie , let us say , has a promising mark . He decides that it can " go " three-handed . Thinking over the experienced men of his acquaintance who are out for action he fixes on Big Pete . His choice is based upon several considerations . Pete has a rep as a good man , which means that he is known to be trustworthy , dependable , and resourceful . When he makes a meet , or engagement , he keeps it . He has plenty of belly , or courage . He has shown that he is a sticker who will not panic and leave the others to shift for themselves in the event of trouble , and he has repeatedly stood up , or kept his mouth shut , under police questioning ? American police question prisoners ; only foreigners torture them . Furthermore , he will not burn , or cheat , his partners ; he does not flash , or make a show of his money ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the job : he can control a whole roomful of people without frightening them so that someone may do something foolish . Eddie and Pete talk the job over ? " cut it up , " they say . If a tip is involved , Eddie lets Pete know that there will be a tipster 's end ( 10 per cent ) to come off the top , or before any deductions have been made , but without telling him who the tipster is , just as he will not tell the fatter who will work the job , for by his code anyone who deals with him is entitled to full protection , and he considers them bound by the same standard . Other details are discussed . Yes , between them , the two can handle the inside without trouble . Probably they could handle the whole thing , but to be on the safe side they had better have a man on the wheel . Since the mark is Eddie 's , he is boss in this respect . He " owns " the job ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate . Anyone who does not wish to work with any of the others may pull out , or withdraw . If one who pulls out should thereupon get his own mob together and take the job , Eddie would feel morally justified in shooting him , though if another mob working independently happened to beat Eddie to the job he would not consider himself wronged . If 1111.01.1.1.11 . **25;469;TOOLONG 1.14 something happened to prevent him from taking part in the touch and Pete filled in another man and took it , Eddie would be entitled to half an end , or share , even though he was in prison when the job came off . In this case , there is no trouble in filling the mob . Both Eddie and Pete are friendly with Bangs , so called from his habit of causing his car to backfire during chases to the end of instilling a proper caution in amateur pursuers , who seldom require much encouragement to imagine they are being shot at . One of them looks him up and inquires casually if he wants " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : what kind of action ? what 's in it ? who is working ? If the answers , which are given in general terms , are to his liking , he says , " Okay , I 'm in , " and the mob is complete . Only then is he given specific details . T HE detailed planning and preparation which constitutes the next stage is the most important part of the heist . If this layout is done well , the mark is in the bag . The robbery itself becomes a simple transaction lasting but a few moments ? sometimes less than thirty seconds . Professionals agree that casing is far and away the most important part of laying out a heist . This word , which like many others of underworld origin is coming into popular use , is from the argot of faro , once as popular a betting game as craps is today . It originally referred to a record of the cards played as kept on an abacus-like contraption called a " case . " As used in the underworld , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes detailed information , a good mob cases its marks with care . Tipsters often err . One mob , whose tipster worked in the place to be taken , was furnished with a layout-chart so complete that they did not bother casing the inside , to their subsequent sorrow , for the tipster had neglected to indicate that the partitions setting off the office they were to rob did not extend to the ceiling , and police were waiting for them when they came out . Several matters are cased with particular care . The size of the score is checked in advance whenever possible ? tipsters are likely to be very optimistic about the size of a prospective touch . If the mark is a bank , checking may involve little more than a glance at the quarterly statement , available at the local library or Chamber of Commerce , and the size of payrolls may be estimated satisfactorily from the number of employees , but most other kinds of mark are difficult to case accurately for size . A knowledge of the floor plan , arrangement of furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is essential to a fast , smooth piece of work . On the theory that it helps to know where trouble is likely to come from , some heist-men like to get an advance look at the people on the inside as well . Impressionable young squirts who attend the movies too often and an occasional old towser who has had his job for thirty years ? " heroes , " the heist-man calls them sardonically ? may , if not closely watched , rise in defense of the insurance company 's stockholders , especially if women or big bosses are present . It is always well to know how many women must be dealt with , since they are an occupational hazard of the first order which I will describe later on . Armed guards are of course cased with care , though unless ensconced in a protective cage or turret they represent a threat more apparent than real , since they can not go about with cocked pistols . A well-executed job takes so little time that alarm systems call for little or no attention , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Sometimes ingenuity is required to case a job without attracting attention . Unless there is heavy pedestrian traffic , outside casing is usually done from a car or the window of a nearby building . Various ruses are resorted to in casing the inside , the commonest being the pose of having business to transact . This can be excellent vocational training ? at least , it proved to be in the case of Keister ( Suitcase ) John , an old-timer who came by his moniker in honor of a battered salesman 's case full of janitor supplies which he used as a prop , religiously charging off the full original cost of the outfit , some forty dollars , against the nut , or expense , of every job he worked . A time came when jokes about his " ten grand " suitcase circulating in the hangouts came to the ears of police , and John went to stir . There he came to the conclusion that he was becoming too old and too well-known to continue in his wicked ways , so upon release he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prospered . Generally speaking , casing is the job of the inside-men . The wheel-man has work of his own . The procurement of the getaway car is one of his responsibilities . There are many car-thieves who will deliver to specifications of year and make for a moderate fee , but heist-men seldom patronize them for reasons of security . The simple job of stealing a car may be considerably complicated by the wheel-man 's personal predilections . Most of them have strong convictions concerning various makes of car for this particular kind of service . Certain makes , widely known as " dogs on the get-out , " which is to say that they accelerate slowly from a standing start , automatically are ruled out . In general , a small , fast car of common make is preferred for work in city traffic , but a heavy one where the getaway entails a long run over country roads . Having procured a suitable car , the wheel-man provides it with license plates which are not hot and plants it , or places it somewhere out of harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's other major responsibility is the layout of the get , or getaway route , a simple matter if the job is in a city and the mob intends to piece up there , but complicated if a run to another locality is in prospect , as is usually the case if the mark is located in a small community . In the latter event , he must cruise back roads and country lanes until he has pieced together a route which bypasses towns , main highways , and , so far as is possible , roads followed by telephone lines . He runs this route until thoroughly familiar with it , and may even chart it in detail : L over bridge 40 for S-bend mi. 4 R fork Bull sign mi. 61 weaves over 55 gravel .... Such a chart is called a " running get . " The back-country getaway ? the idea of a specific route , which was once a close professional secret ? is said to have been tipped off to the FBI by Brown Derby Bentz , a bank robber until recently in Alcatraz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his professional brethren . Whether or not the rap is a right one for Bentz , the principle of the get is now so well known that a movie glorifying the G-men has been based upon it . There Ivill be other details requiring attention . Perhaps the job is located in a town whose approaches may quickly be blocked off . If so , the mob may want to hide out in town until the heat has somewhat subsided , in which case a suitable plant , or hideout , will be required . There will have to be bags for the money ? the paper shopping bags used by housewives are as good as any . And there is the matter of guns . Mobs composed of men who often work together may have a small armory of weapons belonging to the mob as a whole , but as a general thing each man furnishes his own weapon , usually a pistol . Revolvers are preferred to automatics , for many of the Colt .45 's circulating in the underworld came originally from army or other federal sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may assume it has been stolen and enter the case on that basis . Moreover , if the magazine clip of an automatic is kept loaded for a protracted time its spring may become " tired " and the gun may jam when used . The sub-machine guns so common in the movies are rarely used in real-life holdups . They are cumbersome , difficult to acquire , and at once bring the crime under federal jurisdiction . Sprayers , which are automatic pistols of a foreign make provided with a detachable stock and custom-made magazines holding fifty or more bullets , are sometimes used on jobs where there are a large number of people to be controlled , but sawed-off shotguns are cheaper , far easier to obtain , less lethal ( except at pointblank range ) , and more effective in terms of shock effect upon the victims . The job is ready to go when it has been cased and the other details have been attended to . The mob will have met several times to cut up , or talk things over , and to lay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The preparations in their entirety will have taken anywhere from a few hours to several weeks , depending upon the mark and the class , or quality , of the mob ? the better the mob , the more thorough the layout . A s HAS been intimated , there is not much to the holdup itself if the layout has been well done . Each man knows just what to do on the job , when to do it , and what to expect of the others . Unforeseeable complications aside , the actual robbery is largely a matter of going through the motions on schedule . The term " schedule " is used advisedly , for the time element is important ? so important that the time taken to " get in , get it , and get out " is a good measure of professional competence . It is not unusual for a class mob to carry out a run-of-the-mill holdup in half a minute . The emphasis placed upon speed on the job probably owes less to fear of interference than to the hard-earned knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on about him with any accuracy , so that he is likely unconsciously to fill in from his imagination . This phenomenon has been verified by psychologists by means of experiments in which several people suddenly burst in upon a group engaged in some routine activity and act out a scene which those present are asked to describe . Witnesses are found prone to take urgent cries of " Onions ! " or some other incongruous word , for " Help " to take bananas for revolvers and the explosion of blown-up paper bags for shots , and to fail to recognize participants known to them from everyday association . Holdups executed without waste of time or motion have a similar effect upon witnesses . Thus , one man who is six feet three , skinny , and more or less blond , has been declared to be a red-head weighing over two hundred , a double for George Raft , and , following an occasion when he was masked and worked with a man who spoke with a Southern accent , a Negro . This tendency to fill in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bad side from the viewpoint of the heist-man . While it is by no means the rule , it is not a rarity for these gentry to be convicted for robberies committed by others , for it is police practice to give witnesses information ranging from hints to detailed descriptions of suspects as an aid to identification , and witnesses often convince themselves that the pictures thus built up are in fact retained from their own experience . T N WORKING a heist , the mob usually goes out from a meet , or appointment held a short time before the job is to go . Here the layout is gone over again , clothes are changed ? if the mark is in a factory district the mob may work in coveralls , if in a businessdistrict in business suits ; the idea is to remain as inconspicuous as possible ? and other last-minute details are attended to . The members of the mob leave singly and go to the mark by separate routes in order to avoid the possibility of being seen together by coppers to whom they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or arm themselves , until they reach the job , just in case one of them might be stopped and searched . The wheel-man brings the guns in the car . The mob meet the car a block or so from the mark and rod themselves up . They walk to the job ; the wheel-man pulls ahead and parks near the entrance in such a way that he can swing out from the curb in a hurry . If possible , the inside-men work covered , or masked . This usually can be managed without difficulty unless the place must be entered directly from the street , and even then if scarves fastened with pins so that they may quickly be twitched up over the mouth and chin are used ? the lower part of the face is the most easily identifiable . Covered or bald , the mob enters as casually as any other visitors . Melodramatics are for the movies . One man does the talking : " All right , folks , stay where you 're at ! Keep quiet ! Keep your hands where I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na get hurt , so take it easy . " Generally this fellow stands near the door where he can keep the whole room under observation as well as intercept anyone who may come in while the robbery is in progress . He is an authoritative figure , the center of attention . Most witnesses hardly notice the other inside-men , who go about their job of collecting the score as quickly and with as little fuss as possible . So far as may be , the mob are calm and polite on the job . " Cowboying , " or the wild brandishing of pistols and shouting of orders in all directions is frowned upon ? fear has made more heroes than courage ever has . People will not be gratuitously abused . The professional does not become so tensed up by fear and excitement that he strikes out blindly upon insignificant provocation . As one puts it : " When you 're out on a heist you 're out to get the dough and keep out of trouble . Halloween 's the night for scaring people . " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecision . A holdup may easily become a shambles if the people under the gun think they detect nervousness or hesitation on the part of the man behind it . r IHE boys are particularly careful if women are present . Nobody can tell how women will react ? at least , such is he considered opinion of the heist-men with whom I have cut up this situation . Looks tell nothing . One who has all the earmarks of a lady pipefitter may just roll up her eyes and swoon , while the little mouse who looks so scared a man itches to pat her on the head and say something soothing is really coolly examining the mob for warts or moles or counting the hairs on their knuckles as a means of future identification . Guns or no guns , some women will give out large pieces of their minds , and the less of this commodity they have to spare the more generous they appear to be with it . There are old ladies ? one heist mob had a harrowing experience at the hands of a motherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she realized what was going on . Then site was horrified and spoke severely to the mob . They should be ashamed , for she could tell that they were good boys at heart who had got off on the wrong foot . Since this was precisely what the boys secretly thought of themselves , they were moved ; they ordered one of the clerks to destroy the record of the old lady 's loan at once . This intended kindness only shocked her more , and she began to pray for them . The boys sweated copiously and might even have left if the manager , who had the combination to the safe , had not been due at that moment . Let us not overlook the screamers , who are legion . The automatic yelper , who lets go involuntarily , from surprise , is not much of a problem . Her scream is little more than a species of exclamation . The aboriginal , or ritual , screamer is a little more troublesome . Her scream is a notice to all males that a poor defenseless female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it ? Still , heist-men find that this one need only be ordered sharply to shut up and she will subside . Then there is the smarty who puts the primitive , or **27;496;TOOLONG , scream to more sophisticated uses . She lets out a shriek that can be heard over traffic for two blocks and then claps hand to mouth and gives with the big eyes as if to say : " Her did n't mean to , but her could n't help it ; gweat big you fwightened her so ! " Actually a brontosaurus would n't scare her . She has been feeding that great-big-you line to voracious males so long and so successfully that she would spring it with confidence on the first lion she met walking down the street . What is on her mind at the moment are newspaper headlines : HEROINE OUTWITS DESPERATE BANDITS ; PRETENDS HYSTERICS AND SUMMONS HELP , and she is just the cookie who will identify great big you with such dramatics that every man on the jury will yearn to see you hung and quartered , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . The consensus is that a good kick in the pants is what this number is asking for . Worst of all screamers is the hysterical screamer . This one takes a kind of fit ? clenches her eyes shut and lets loose at the top of her voice , and anything done to calm her is only likely to make her worse , if possible . Heist-men know of no formula for dealing with this kind of screamer , though isolated successes are spoken of . One says he stopped her cold by asking in the ordinary disgusted tone one might use to a bothersome child why she did n't quit that damn howling . Another claims to have done it with paper clips . He had to pass the woman 's desk on the way to the score ; she apparently had the idea that he was coming to cut her throat , rose screaming , to retreat , stumbled over her chair , and hit the floor in a sitting position . There she sat , eyes tight shut and mouth wide open , screeching like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some paper-clips from a desk and tossed a couple into her mouth . Presto ! Sometimes screamers can be a real hazard on the job , as when the mob must be inside for several minutes , but on the ordinary job they are more bothersome than dangerous and the mob ignores them . In some circumstances , as when there is a safe which must be opened , it may take the mob several minutes to get the score , but usually it is merely a matter of picking it up and carrying it out . The man on the door remains a few seconds to give the others time to get to the car , for despite his warning someone will probably throw up a window and begin yelling as soon as he leaves . As he comes out , the car already is inching ahead . It is off the instant his foot touches the run-111.111MIP ADVICE TO TO A TRAVELER ning hoard .

The car whisks around the first corner , takes several others in quick succession , then straightens out for a run of two or three blocks down a street having little traffic . If no chase car shows up behind , the getaway car heads for wherever the front car ? one legitimately owned by one of the mob ? is parked . Meanwhile , the inside-men may havegotten into or out of coveralls and transferred the money into the receptacle provided : where there is no pedestrian traffic outside , the mob may not take time on the job to put the loot into bags but carry it out in a wastepaper basket or any other handy container . One of the mob takes the score and pistols in the front car to the place prearranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , if they want to play it safe all the way , go separately . The wheel-man continues in the getaway car to another part of the city , where , having wiped down the interior to remove fingerprints , he ditches it . By the time he arrives at the meet , the money probably already has been pieced up into as many piles as there are members of the mob . " There she is , " one of the others says . " Latch onto one .
