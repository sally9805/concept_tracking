<P> Fidel Castro fumed . A court of his own rebel judges had acquitted 19 pilots , ten gunners and 16 mechanics of Dictator Fulgencio Batista 's air force on trial for " war crimes . " Taking judgment into his own hands , he decided that the pilots were guilty as charged of " genocide , murder and homicide " in the bombing and strafing of villages during his war on Batista , ordered the verdict reversed . It was . <P> The essentials of the prosecution case were that Batista 's bombers killed at least eight and injured 16 in 600 attacks . As evidence it submitted flight reports of the attacks signed by the pilots themselves . <P> The defense replied that genocide is not defined in any penal code in force in Cuba . Moreover , said the defense , although the airmen by their own count dropped 6,080 bombs and fired 5,000,000 machine-gun bullets , they deliberately misdirected their fire , dropped their bombs outside the target area , sabotaged bombs so they would not explode , falsified their flight reports . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll . <P> Sitting in Santiago de Cuba , capital of Castro 's Oriente province wartime stronghold , the three-man tribunal of Castro rebels made two main points . They acknowledged that many attacked villages were legitimate military targets , since " our forces were in most of them , " added that " it has not been possible to identify which of the accused on trial here were those who produced the deaths . " <P> Furious at the acquittal , Castro exploded that " it has been a grave error of the revolutionary tribunal to absolve those criminal pilots .

He sent his bearded Defense Minister , Augusto Martinez , to Santiago to organize a " review " court . The new verdict : 30 years at hard labor for the pilots , lesser terms for non-pilots . Two were acquitted . <P> The spectacle of Lawyer Castro 's ignoring the principle of double jeopardy caused the Havana , Santiago and National Bar Associations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pea Justiz , said the reversal could stamp Castro as " a new Napoleon in the Caribbean . " Muttered Castro : " Reactionary . " As he spoke , firing squads across the island were busy building the week 's execution total to 30 , the overall accounting to 392 . <P> Last week Castro also : <P> Caused a mild flap in Washington over his acceptance of an invitation of the American Society of Newspaper Editors to address their April 17 meeting there . As Cuba 's Prime Minister , Castro should have sent his intention to visit the U.S. through diplomatic channels . Just the same , said the State Department , he " will assuredly be welcomed . " <P> Sat down on the side porch of his villa outside Havana one afternoon to get acquainted with new U.S. Ambassador Philip W. Bonsai . " Friendly , cordial and knowledgeable about Cuba , " said Castro . " A good ambassador . "
