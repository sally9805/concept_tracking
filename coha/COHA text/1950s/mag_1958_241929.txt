THE surging popularity of U.S. painting in the art centers of Western Europe apparently does not stop short at the Iron Curtain . Proof of this is arriving at Manhattan 's Whitney Museum of American Art in the form of scores of warm letters of appreciation from painters , sculptors , critics , curators and librarians-many of them speaking out to the West for the first time-from the muted lands of Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary and Rumania . What triggered this spontaneous outpouring of sentiment was a single book : Three Hundred Years of American Painting by Alexander Eliot , an associate editor of TIME , which was published last November . Warmly as the book was received by U.S. critics , it now turns out that its best notices come from intellectuals and painters behind the Iron Curtain . <P> Hopeful of opening direct channels of communication with art movements in the satellite countries , the Whitney Museum had sent some 300 copies of the book overseas addressed to museums and individual artists . From Warsaw and Cracow , Budapest and Szeged , Prague , Zatec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and even original drawings and engravings from artists who wished to reciprocate the Whitney 's gesture . The letters were scrupulously nonpolitical . Nearly all had two points in common : 1 ) unstinting praise for the book , and 2 ) surprise that American painting was so good . One Rumanian intellectual , unreported for years and presumed by his U.S. <P> friends to have disappeared long ago , wrote carefully : " The book renders me a great pleasure , and it fills a real gap in our knowledge of American art . " A Budapest painter wrote : " We marvel at the richness of your art , of which we have only vague knowledge . " From a librarian in Szeged : " This excellent work has aroused in our reading public a great interest . <P> <P> It goes from hands to hands . " " Let 's do more of this , " suggested an impressionist painter from Czechoslovakia . " It is much better to exchange books than missiles . " Most of the letters were in good English , a few in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Union of Czechoslovak Writers , was moved to mix praise of the TIME volume with big-brotherly caution . It ran a reproduction of Richard Florsheim 's Night City from the book and commented : <P> " This is a step in the right direction . It is certainly better than mailing to our cultural workers various revisionist scribblings dealing with national Communism and earmarked solely for export . While we reject such malicious tricks , it is with the greatest pleasure that we become acquainted , through Three Hundred Years of American Painting , with the true national culture of the American people .
