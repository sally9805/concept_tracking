Within a span of six hours one day last week , the case of the U.S. v. Alger Hiss became a major political issue . <P> In a quiet Manhattan courtroom , Hiss was sentenced to five years in prison . Hiss scarcely had time to post $10,000 bail and file an appeal before Secretary of State Dean Acheson set off the storm . At a crowded press conference in Washington , Acheson went to the defense of the former top State Department official whom a federal jury had convicted of perjury and thus found , guilty of stealing State documents to be sent to Russia . <P> " Whatever the outcome of any appeal which Mr. Hiss or his lawyer may take , " said the Secretary of State . " I do not intend to turn my back on Alger Hiss . " <P> By His Own Standards . Dean Acheson spoke in a voice weighted with emotion . " I think every person who has known Alger Hiss . . . has upon his conscience the very serious task of deciding what his attitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That must be done by each person in the light of his own standards and his own principles . For me , there is very little doubt about these standards or these principles . They were stated for us a very long time ago ... on the Mount of Olives . " <P> Newsmen , unfamiliar with his reference , hurried from the room , found that a State Department aide had thoughtfully appeared in the anteroom with a Bible in which they could read the text . *From this fact and from the statement itself they concluded that the Secretary of State had spoken only after careful thought , and not impulsively . <P> A roar of indignation rose from Capitol Hill and echoed across many of the nation 's editorial pages . Snapped California 's Representative Richard Nixon : " Disgusting . . . Here he is serving notice in advance that he will not accept the decision of even the Supreme Court . " Illinois ' Les Arends , the Republican whip , declared that Acheson 's continued presence in the Cabinet was " an affront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowland said he would move to withhold all State Department appropriations . Said Georgia 's James C. Davis , a Democrat : " How long can Americans be expected to show respect for Acheson when he hugs to his bosom ; those who have betrayed their country ? " <P> Nobody in Congress raised his voice in rebuttal : to defend Acheson was to defend Alger Hiss . Even Harry Truman curtly refused comment . In the silence , the chatty , tea-table voice of Eleanor Roosevelt sounded . Mrs. Roosevelt , who obviously had not been paying much attention , was " very troubled " by the Hiss case : " It seems rather horrible to condemn someone on the word of someone else who admits to guilt , " she said . She was either unaware of , or determined to ignore , the corroborating evidence introduced by the Government to prove the charges of its chief witness , Whittaker Chambers , onetime Communist courier . <P> In Jeopardy . The condemnation of Acheson was not unanimous . The New York Herald Tribune thought that Acheson 's statement " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even among those who did sympathize with his personal reaction were many who deplored his official conduct . Was betrayal of one 's country a pardonable offense in the eyes of the Secretary of State ?
