" You have been so faithful , and so loving to us , you have fought so stoutly for us , you have been so hearty in counseling of us that we shall never forget your favor towards us . " <P> - John Bunyan <P> Beneath the mighty oak roof that Richard II built , on the spot where Charles I was condemned to the scaffold and Cromwell proclaimed Lord Protector , where Britain 's dead kings are mourned and its new ones feted , Sir Winston Churchill stood last week and received his country 's heartfelt tributes on his 80th birthday . Before him , vast Westminster Hall ( hard by the House of Commons ) was packed with top-hatted peers and tiaraed peeresses , members of Parliament and their wives , from closest allies to such old antagonists as Aneurin Bevan . <P> <P> Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee , in a graceful speech , declared he had come " not to bury Caesar but to praise him . Caesar indeed-for you have not only carried on war but have written your own commentary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of applause with his hands splayed across his paunch , beaming over his spectacles . He inspected carefully the ornate book , inscribed with Bunyan 's quotation and signed by nearly all MPs . " This is to me the most memorable public occasion of my life , " said the man who has known many memorable occasions . " No one has ever received a similar mark of honor before . There has not been anything like it in British history . " <P> It Was Wonderful ? Alternately solemn and impish , Churchill commented ambiguously ( " A most remarkable piece of modern art " ) on the portrait of himself painted by Graham Sutherland ( see ART ) . He was loftily deprecatory of his wartime role . " It was the nation and the race dwelling all round the globe that had the lion 's heart . I had the luck to be called upon to give the roar . " He concluded gravely : " I am now nearing the end of my journey . I hope I still have some services to render . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pat his hand affectionately . Then she took his arm , and together they passed through the applauding crowd , stopping once as Churchill , a tear glistening on his cheek , shook hands with Lord Salisbury and said : " Thank you so much , Bobbety . It was wonderful . " <P> <P> The whole day Churchill moved amid cheers , gifts and high praise . He called on the Queen ( who opened Parliament , then departed to leave the stage to her first minister ) , was toasted in champagne and received two pairs of antique silver coasters . That night he fell asleep to the singing of " For he 's a Jolly Good Fellow " from the crowds who had clustered all day outside 10 Downing Street .
