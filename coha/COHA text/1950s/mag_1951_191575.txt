There had always been a few chiselers in the army of 1,500 clerks , handlers , and carriers milling around each night in Boston 's South Postal Annex . With all the frantic bustle of sorting and dispatching the daily mail , no one would ever miss the man who slipped out for a few beers or a movie . Before long the word got around Boston 's pool halls and political clubs that the long , grimy building down by South Station offered splendid opportunities for anyone with the urge to cheat the Government out of a paycheck . <P> Soon the racket began to snowball . Loyal young Democrats flocked in to see their politician pals , went away with notes assuring them of a spot on the Annex 's roster of 3,000 temporary workers . All they had to do was punch in at 5:30 p.m. , while away the evening hours and return to punch out again at 2 a.m . If anyone squawked , the whispered threat of a politician 's name would fix it up . <P> Everyone wanted to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firemen , policemen , and schoolteachers arranged to have post-office time cards punched for them . One man stayed away for 75 days and collected every nickel of his pay . Others came in snarling drunk . Regular employees began goofing off worse than ever , formed " 50-50 Clubs " with the " temps , " to cover up and split their $1.42 hourly pay . During the two-week Christmas rush , a smart checker could make as much as $5,000 by forgetting to mark down the absentees . <P> Oddly enough , news of the wholesale frauds never got beyond the locker rooms until last December , when a group of indignant workers quietly laid the whole thing before postal authorities . Fortnight ago , Boston 's Chief Post Office Inspector Tennyson Jefferson and 42 inspectors swooped down on the annex . Though they had picked a bad night ( business was slack because of the railroad strike ) , they found 28 time cards punched for men who never showed up , and enough evidence to convince them that the Government had been bilked out of between $4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the housecleaning was still going on full blast , but the inspectors would have their hands full convicting the goldbricks and getting the money back . No one was telling on his friends . The politicos could be counted on to look after their own . And most of the " temps " seemed to agree with the worker who said : " The Government is sending ECA money to England-why should n't they take care of us ? "
