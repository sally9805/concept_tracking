At 4:45 one . morning last week , Valmore W. Bourque , 20 , of South Hadley Falls , Mass. , lugged a suitcase up to Patrick Hall on Denver 's Lowry Air Force Base and reported to a sleepy master sergeant . Said Bourque : " I figure it would be something to tell my kids I was the first air cadet in the U.S. " Sixteen hours and 45 minutes later , Bourque and 305 other members of the first class at the U.S. Air Force Academy were sound asleep after a double-timed day that included drill , a dedication ceremony , physical examinations ( one cadet had measles ) , lectures , assignments , hazing , uniform issue and an allowance ( $3 for the rest of July ) . <P> Visiting parents got official memos : " When your son reports ... his time will be fully occupied throughout the rest of the day and the summer training period . " To make sure it was , the Air Force picked 69 young lieutenants to simulate upperclassmen . Also on hand to catch new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English instructor with a Government Issue tape recorder . <P> While the cadets were hastily building traditions , politicians in Washington were lustily attacking the anything-but-traditional buildings planned for the new Air Force Academy campus at Colorado Springs . Sensitive to the fact that glass , steel and aluminum were the key materials in Air Force blueprints , Democratic Congressman John Fogarty ( onetime president of Rhode Island 's Bricklayers Union No.1 ) roared : " Glass and metal are alien to American monumental design-even to European . " Picking up his lead , spokesmen for pressure groups , including the Allied Masonry Council , representing brick , limestone and marble companies and for the Bricklayers , Masons and Plasterers ' International Union of America , charged that the modern academy design was unAmerican , un-Christian and unaesthetic . <P> In this spirit , the House of Representatives voted to cut off appropriations for the buildings . Across the Capitol , Indiana 's Republican Senator Homer Capehart was waiting in the same mood . After a talk with Air Force Secretary Harold Talbott , Capehart boomed : " He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the building should have lots of masonry work . I was fearful it would be made out of steel , aluminum and glass . I come from Indiana , and we have a lot of limestone there . Indiana Limestone Company produces it . " <P> At the Pentagon , Air Force officers answered that , at 1955 prices , it might cost four times the $126 million they have asked for their modern academy to build a new West Point or Annapolis with conventional stone and brick .
