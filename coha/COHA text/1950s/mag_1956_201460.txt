In Northern Rhodesia , on the broad lands between the Limpopo and Congo Rivers , more than half a million primitive Africans have found a new , fascinating way to kill time . Every night in their mud huts they listen to their kabulo ka kwa-bamakani ( small piece of iron that catches words in air ) . Their radios are tuned to Lusaka 's Central African Broadcasting Station , and their favorite show is a request program called Zimene Mwa Tifunsa ( Those You Have Asked For ) . They also have their favorite record , Do n't Sell Daddy Any More Whisky , a lachrymose ditty in hillbilly style : <P> <P> Do n't sell daddy any more whisky I know it will take him away . For we are all hungry and mommy is weeping Do n't sell him no whisky today . <P> Despite this contribution of the state of Tennessee to the culture of Africa , even the restrained British colonials of the area , long given to understatement , describe CABS as a " remarkable wireless indeed . " It is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasts almost exclusively to blacks . It began as a peanut-whistle transmitter during the war to get military news around the colony . After the war it was continued in the hope of providing a link between the government and its millions of Negro subjects . <P> Safe Blue . The big problem was receiving sets . Then a British civil servant persuaded a British radio manufacturer to produce a cheap , durable set suitable for the bush . The result was the Saucepan Special , a battery-operated , four-tube set with a 50 saucepan as its cabinet . The sets are painted blue , the only color that does not clash with any of the region 's innumerable tribal superstitions . Most important of all , they are insect-proof . Last week , with 60,000 sets in operation and an average of nine listeners per set , the Saucepan Special linked almost every Rhodesian village with the outside world . <P> With the success of Operation Saucepan , the government gave CABS more kilowatts , with the understanding that every day from noon to 9 p.m. it would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives . His Excellency the Governor tried some familiar commercial radio techniques to win cooperation from his subjects . " Be on the Side of Law and Order ! " CABS cried . " Pay Your Taxes Now ! " Such Madison Avenue methods left listeners bored and unimpressed . Little dramatic parables pointing to a simple moral proved more effective , but nobody can be sure of the effect of the daily lectures , e.g. , Proof that Germs , Not Witchcraft , Cause Disease . One indignant listener demanded : " Why do you waste so much time preaching to our people about harmless dirt on feet , when you could be broadcasting us how to make money and other usefuls ? " One African announcer refused to read a lecture on female hygiene . " You may think this does good , bwana , " he told the white station director , " but we do not speak of these things in our society . The people would tear me to pieces if I speak of their women in this way . " The lecture was dropped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
