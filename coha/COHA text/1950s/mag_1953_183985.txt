For nearly a year , four small boys , aged 7 to 10 , led the police of Rosenberg , Texas ( pop . 6,210 ) a merry chase . The boys stole keys from a used-car lot just for the thrill , broke innumerable light bulbs , tried to set a local dance hall on fire , scooped money off newsstands , broke into at least five stores . All in all , they were arrested a total of 21 times , but on each occasion , they were able to laugh right in the police chief 's face . As the boys knew only too well , they were too young for prosecution under Texas law . <P> The police lectured their fathers in vain . Once , after the boys broke into an auto-parts store , County Judge George Roane summoned the fathers before him and demanded that they make their sons obey . The fathers shrugged , and the boys carried on as usual . They broke into the Greyhound Bus station , later cracked a food market for candy and change . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . " We decided to try the parents , " says he , " not the children . " <P> Last week the judge gave each of the fathers six months ' suspended sentence with a warning that " if your children commit any more thefts , you will serve the six months in jail . " It was the first time in Texas that a parent has been held liable to imprisonment for the crimes of his children . It was also the first time in many a long month that quiet has reigned in Rosenberg.
