( See Cover ) Starting with superb confidence , the 20th Century plunged vigorously forward from ambush to ambush . <P> Other ages may have suffered greater agonies ; none suf fered greater surprises . Much that seemed for the best turned out for the worst . Germany 's progress led to Sarajevo and later to Buchenwald . Japan 's progress became Pearl Harbor . The overthrow of the Czar became Communist dictatorship . The greatest triumphs of capitalism fell prey to socialism and bureaucracy . Science led to Hiroshima . <P> Shock after shock threw civilization into confusion . As the 20th Century plunged on , long-familiar bearings were lost in the mists of change . Some of the age 's great leaders called for more &; more speed ahead ; some tried to reverse the course . Winston Churchill had a different function : his chief contribution was to warn of rocks ahead , and to lead the rescue parties . He was not the man who designed the ship ; what he did was to launch the lifeboats . That a free world survived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calamity , was due in large measure to his exertions . A Pardon from Napoleon . Churchill first came to public attention as the victim of an ambush and he never forgot the lesson . As a correspondent with British forces in the Boer War , he accepted an invitation to join a rash reconnaissance by armored railway train into enemy territory . The Boers waylaid the train . Churchill managed to get some wounded men to safety and started back alone toward his besieged comrades .

Within five weeks he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked unnoticed through the crowded town , hid all day in a copse tenanted by a large vulture , stumbled upon the only English settlement in 20 miles , and was smuggled under a carload of wool to safety in Portuguese territory . All Britain acclaimed Churchill as a national hero . Late in 1900 , the hero was elected a Tory member of the House of Commons . There , three weeks after Victoria 's death had opened the new era , he rose , inwardly quaking and outwardly calm , to make his first speech . His subject : the Boer War . He favored reinforcement of the army in South Africa , but his main point was to urge civil rather than military government of conquered areas . He wanted " to make it easy and honorable for the Boers to surrender , and painful and perilous for them to continue in the field . " <P> These Churchillian themes would recur in succeeding decades : no appeasement of the armed enemy ; no revenge on the beaten enemy ; no military encroachments on civilian responsibility ; look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has consequences which affect the goal . In short , Churchill at 26 was already a serious politician . <P> One day in 1904 he entered the House , bowed to the Speaker , and turned his back upon the Conservative benches . He sat down in the front row of the Opposition , next to the
