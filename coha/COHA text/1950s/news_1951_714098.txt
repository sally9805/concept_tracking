Since then he has had nothing but trouble ? $17,500 of it . he says . The story of the annoyances he and his wife and two children have suffered were related yesterday in legal phrases in a damage suit filed in federal District court against the 5550 Dorchester company , owner of a 15 story apartment building which sits where the steam shovel once sat .
