Wherever 26-year-old Autherine Lucy went on her first day at the University of Alabama last week , a policeman dogged her footsteps . " You get all kinds of assignments , " the officer grumbled to a reporter , but there was good reason for this one . Four crosses had already been set on fire on the campus , for Autherine Lucy is a Negro . <P> She got into the university after a long fight in court . Finally , Federal Judge Harlan Hobart Grooms issued an injunction ordering the university to admit her . Trailed by her guard , she reported to her first class , sat alone in the first row , tried hard not to notice the freshman who stomped out of the room muttering : " For two cents I 'd give up the course . " <P> Though Autherine will not be allowed to sleep in any university dormitory or eat in any university dining room , these restrictions are apparently not enough for her fellow students . One night last week , 1,000 marched on the home of President Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Keep ' Bama White ! " Nonetheless . Autherine had chalked up something of a victory . She is the first of her race ever to be admitted into any white public school , college or university in Alabama .
