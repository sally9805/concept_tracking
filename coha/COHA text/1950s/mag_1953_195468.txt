BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> The water drops , the ants eat the fish . The water rises , the fish eat the ants . So it is better to love than to hate . <P> <P> - Old Laotian Proverb <P> It was low water in Laos last week , and thousands of Communists were pouring across the northern border of the little Buddhist kingdom . The government of Laos , one of the three Associated States of Indo-China , was gasping on the mud-bank of its unpreparedness . <P> Six months had passed since Communist General Vo Nguyen Giap conquered the Thai country lying between Red China and Laos ( see map ) . Instead of throwing all his forces against several hundred thousand French Union and Vietnamese troops bottled up in the Red River delta and in the airstrip at Nasan , Giap began probing the defenses of Laos with his Viet Minh commandos . In his exquisite white palace overlooking the palm-fringed Mekong River , aging ( 67 ) , crew-cropped King Sisavang Vong told the French : " This is my country ; this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . " Not until three of Giap 's crack divisions appeared at Laos ' borders last week did King Sisavang Vong call on his happy-go-lucky Laotians to mobilize . <P> Elephants . Laos , once known as Lane Xang ( the Land of a Million Elephants ) , is the Shangri-La of Southeast Asia . It is mistily mountainous , covered with tiger-haunted jungle and elephant-inhabited rain forest , and can only be reached by air , by traversing two very bad roads , or by sailing up the mighty Mekong . Half its people are Thais , living in the lowland valleys ; the other half are primitive Khas and Meos . Huge , smiling statues of Buddha dot the landscape , and saffron-robed Buddhist monks are everywhere . Wearing scarlet jackets , gold and silver beads and bracelets and flowers in their hair , the Laotian women are graceful and attractive and given to music , dancing and proverbs . At nightlong parties , they dance the Lap Ton to a harmonious , high-pitched , 17-hole flute called the Ken . It is said that French officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward vaguely inattentive and quietly dissolute in manner . But last week the French had put aside love and proverbs for a hard look at Laos ' defenses : under King Sisavang Vong 's banner ( a field of red with three white elephants under a white parasol ) , Laos could muster only 10,000 trained &; tried soldiers and 13,000 armed but untried men , all with French officers .
