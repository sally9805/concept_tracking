Rear Admiral Hyman G. Rickover , 58 , wispy ( 5 ft. 7 in. , 130 Ibs. ) , single-minded godfather of the atomic submarine , speaks only one language : plain English , spiced with pepper . Last week he flouted Navy customs by showing up in civvies before the House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration , flouted congressional etiquette by unleashing peppercorn potshots that had even his hosts ducking for cover . <P> Pity for the Mind . First came his blunt reasons why he thinks that the Administration 's new space program ought to be directed by a civilian agency . " The Defense department is already too large , " said he , " and if you let it grow on as it is , it soon will be controlling the country . " <P> As for the idea that the U.S. ought to spend its time and money in a space race with Russia-that , to Rickover 's mind , is so much hot air . " The most pressing problem " is education . <P> " If you people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee of this type , " he said . " you 'd probably have a committee investigate what goes on in education today . You people set up laws on what is to go in people 's mouths , but you wo n't even set up recommendations on what goes into their minds . " A survey of European educational methods would cost about $50,000 , and , he added with a touch of acid , " I know you people do n't fool around with peanuts like that . " <P> The Admiral was taking nonsense from nobody-not even Massachusetts ' Democrat John W. McCormack , chairman of the committee , who made the mistake of observing that one of his subcommittees once recommended that there should be more stability in the technical services of the military establishment . Back came Rickover : " I indict you . You wrote a report and then did nothing to put it into effect . " <P> Pity for Weeding . Annapolisman Rickover had still more in his sea bag , and he unloaded it later in an address on getting an honorary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blast : " We waste the best years of our children in the name of democracy and of the sacred comprehensive school . The careful manner with which European authorities find the proper schooling for each child 's gifts is criticized here as cruel and undemocratic . Weeding out by examinations arouses pity and horror . <P> " Most Americans seem to regard education as a commodity or service which anybody ought to get , simply by paying tuition or by having the cost of education met through taxes . A school system that insists on the same instruction for the talented , average , and below-average child may prevent as many children from growing intellectually as would a system that excludes children because of social , political or economic status of parents . Neither system is democratic . " <P> Along with the silver-haired admiral 's blunt words last week came quiet word from the Pentagon that Hyman Rickover , passed over twice ( 1951 and 1952 ) for rear admiral on the promotion lists because of his plain English opinions , will soon be marked down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
