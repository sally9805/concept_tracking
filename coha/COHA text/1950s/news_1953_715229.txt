txt Thirteen secondary Communist leaders got the chance yesterday to go to Russia as an alternative to going to prison for criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow-of the United States Government by force and violence . The offer was made by Federal Judge Edward J. Dimock . Defense counsel and several of the defendants emphatically rejected the proposal , terming it " intolerable " and " unpalatable . " Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , one of the thirteen , declared : " We feel we belong here and have a political responsibility here . We feel we would be traitors to the American people if we turned our backs on them . just to escape jail . " Judge Dimock also said he would not impose the maximum sentence of five years and $10,000 fine on the thirteen . However , United States Attorney Myles J. Lane recommended that the maximum sentence be imposed on each . The actual sentencing was postponed until today by Judge Dimock after oral barrages by twelve of the thirteen defendants . At 4:40 P. M. , after the court had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys would add to the voluminous record of the nine-anda-half month trial , Judge Dimock adjourned court. ? The first suggestion that Judge Dimock had an alternative plan came when the jurist asked Mr. Lane what he thought of the idea of permitting the defendants to go voluntarily to Russia rather than serve a prison sentence . Mr. Lane said he had no objection if the defendants first served their prison terms , then headed for the Soviet Union . Then , after Miss Flynn had addressed the court for fifteen minutes , Judge Dimock shot at her : " I am tra id that if you ... go to prison you would still feel - the same way as you do now . If something like spending the rest of your life in Russia could be worked out as a substitute for prison , would that interest you at ail ? " " No , I am an American , " Miss Flynn answered curtly . " I would reject any such proposition . " As the next defendant , Pettis Perry , finished his remarks , he said to Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to choice , I intend to stay in the United States . I was born and raised here and that 's where I intend to stay . " Of the third defendant , Claudia Jones , who is fighting deportation to her native Trinidad , Judge Dimock asked : " What would your attitude be to spending the rest of your life in Russia ? " " I find that a strange request , " Miss Jones replied . " I am fighting deportation to earn my citizenship . " Russian-born Alexander RittelMan then was asked if he would accept the substitute and he said : " I adopted this land of my own volition and I intend to stay here the rest of my life . " Defense Counsel Gives Views At this point John T. of defense counsel told Judge Dimock he was " disturbed and shocked " by the plan . He said that banishment had never been recognized as punishment under American law . He added that the Court 's solution was impossible because the Soviet Union had not admitted within its borders any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question does not befit a court of justice in the United States . " Judge Dimock said : " It was engendered in my mind as an . alternative . These defendant8 are convinced that what they have done is right and will continue to ? clo so after they get out . I think it could be worked out as a method of probation . I would only consider it if it was the desire of a defendant . " The thirteen were convicted on Jan. 21 by a jury of six men and six women after six days of deliberation . They were originally to have been sentenced last Wednesday but defense counsel 's argument for acquittal or a new trial took until last Friday . Before making his recommendations , Mr. Lane told Judge Dimock that the thirteen were convicted of one of the most serious crimes on the statute books , one that strikes at the very heart of our form of democracy . Judge Dimock interrupted to say that he considered murder , robbery , counterfeiting and racketeering more serious crimes . ' Lack of Remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane said . " They feel they were right in their desire to take over the Government . " " I think you are absolutely right , " Judge Dimock replied . " They think they are martyrs and right in what they did . " Then , once again reviewing what he considered the more serious crimes , Judge Dimock said : " I shall not invoke the maximum sentence in any case . " ? In addressing the court , each of the defendants reaffirmed his innocence of the charge of conspiracy and contended that the trial was a " frame-up " perverted by Government " stool pigeons . " Perry asked : " Where were a jury of my peers of which I am entitled to under the Constitution ? " Miss Jones said : " The only act which I proudly am guilty of is membership in the Communist party which is not illegal . " Alexander Trachtenberg termed it a trial of books and ideas . He quoted John Milton : " You might as well ? kill a man as a book . " Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded not guilty . Now , as I await your sentence , I reaffirm my position . " Albert Lannon said the prosecution of Communists was an " inquisition to stifle liberty in this , country . " William W. Weinstone charged that the trial was determined by a prejudiced jury , and that " the real conspiracy started the day of our indictment . " Arnold Johnson said the trial was a " monstrous frame-up and fraud against the American people . " Betty Gannett said : " In spite of the verdict , I have committed no crime against the American people . " Jacob Mindel pleaded : " I am guilty only of the peace program of my party . We expect and ask no mercy . " Louis Weinstock termed the trial a " big business and police state sort of justice against the Communist party . " The thirteenth . defendant , George Charney Blake , will address the court today . Besides Mr. , other counsel Who will speak for the defense are Frank Semi , Mrs. Mary Kaufman and James T. Wright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
