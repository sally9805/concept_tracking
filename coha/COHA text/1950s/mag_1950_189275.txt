In their wild state , polar bears and Alaskan brown bears do not mate . For one thing , polar bears live on arctic ice , brown bears on solid ground . They also belong to different species . So when a male polar bear cub named Snow White and a female brown bear cub named Ramona were put together in a cage at the Washington Zoo more than ten years ago , the animal experts did not expect much to happen . <P> But propinquity and persistence eventually triumphed over zoology . Snow White and Ramona produced two litters of cubs , four of which lived . At first they were white like their father , later turned brown like their mother . As they grew into big bears , their color faded to a compromise buff . <P> The experts were still bearish about any hope of posterity . Hybrids- with parents of different species-e.g. , mules-are almost always sterile . Since they receive different kinds of chromosomes from their parents , they do not grow into reproductive adults . <P> Nonetheless , the four hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded the experts by producing a litter each . One cub lived , nursed from an Evenflow bottle on a diet of Esbilac ( a Borden animal formula ) . Last week he weighed more than five pounds and was starting to open his eyes . Washington 's Zoomen named him Gene , just to needle the geneticists . They watched him with pride and hope and designs on his chromosomes . If Gene proves fertile , he could be the Adam of a wholly new race of bears .
