txt Letters to The Times Upkeep of , Highways Anti-Diversion ? ' Amendment Opposed , Figures ; for New York Given To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Trams : In your Sept. 6 issue there appeared a letter from Roy Fruehauf , in which the noted truck manufacturer made several highway improvement suggestions . The principal one was the traditional plea for a constitutional amendment requiring that all highway-user revenue  --  fuel taxes and motor vehicle license fees ? be used solely for highway purposes . Mr. Fruehauf laid the blame for New York 's lagging road repair program on our state 's failure to have this so-called anti-diversion amendment . I would like to answer Mr. Fruehauf and others who succumb to the seductive and specious anti-diversion argument with a few facts and observations of which they are evidently not aware . ' The forty-eight state governments spent more on highways last year than they received from highway users . This fact was reported by the United States Department of Commerce in its annual study , " Compendium of State Government Finances , 1950 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures last year . were $2,581,000,000 , excluding debt service , and total fuel taxes and vehicle license fees collected by these states were $2,300,000,000 . It certainly can not be diversion when the states spend $280,000,000 more than they receive . The Commerce Department 's analysis , the definite study of state income and expenditure , shows the same thing happened in 1949 and 1948 . Money Received When Mr. Fruehauf spoke of diversion , he referred , although tacitly , to state government expenditures only . Nationally there has not been diversion even on this restricted level during the past three years . In New York , however , it is true that the state government , by itself , receives more money from highway users than it spends for state highway purposes . In 1947 the state government received almost $140 , - 000,000 , and spent only $86,000,000 . From these figures alone it would appear that there is diversion in New York State . But these two figures do not show the entire picture ; they ' show only a small part of it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget ? it is a state and local budget . More than 55 per cent of the state budget is composed of " state aid " ? money returned to local municipalities for local purposes , including- streets and roads . Therefore the entire picture must also include the street and road expenditures of cities , counties , towns and villages . When such expenditures are included there is clearly no diversion in New York . In fact , if there is any diversion , it is from general taxpayer revenues to road purposes . In 1947 , the latest available year , the state and local governments in New York spent a total of $234,000,000 on their highways , streets and roads . Highway-user revenues that year were $140,000,000 . This disparity is even more pronounced over a period of years . According to the Griffenhagen and Associates analysis , " Highway Finance and Taxation in New York State , " total highway expenditures in this state were more than double highway-user revenues over the 22-year period through 1947 . The state and its subdivisions poured a total of $4,300,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of this ? $1,900,000,000 ? came from fuel taxes and motor vehicle license fees . The balance , of course , came from property taxes , general funds , bond issues and federal aid . Situation in Ohio Mr. Fruehauf 's implication that New York would have plenty of money for highways if the state would only stop diverting highway revenues is . not borne out in Ohio , where there is an anti-diversion ruling . Ohio did n't have enough money for highways last year ; they had to draw $15,000,000 out of their general fund to meet necessary road outlays . This year they moved to make up the deficit by increasing truck license fees , with the greatest increases , incidentally , being levied on the type of vehicle manufactured by Mr. Fruehauf . And , finally , there are the various effects of putting the state in a " financial strait-Jacket , " as Governor Dewey has said , by earmarking revenues . In 1947 , when the state 's highway-user revenues were $54,000,000 more than the state 's highway expenditures , the total budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If New York had In force an anti-diversion ruling , then the $54,000,000 Would have been spent on state highways and the state would have been faced with three difficult choices ? ( 1 ) go into the red , ( 2 ) curtail other vital services such as schools and welfare , or ( 3 ) increase other taxes . ROBERT J. MENZrn , Executive Secretary , Citizens ' Tax League of Rochester and Monroe , County , N. Y. Rochester , N. Y. , Sept. 7 , 1951 . Victimizing ' City 's Tourists To THE EDITOR OP THE NEw YORK TIMES : , On the afternoon of Tuesday , Aug. 21 , some time between the hours of 2 and 5 o'clock , my car was broken into and robted as it stood parked on Riverside Drive in front of Riverside Church . I had left it there on the advice Of two policemen who came across the street as I parked the car . That a car could be broken into add ? robbed in mid-afternoon in front of Riverside Church , with hundreds of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bold lawlessness and ' corruption that exist in New York City . Where were the patrol cars on Riverside Drive ? Where were the two policemen who said it would be all right to leave my car there ? Where were all the people who were going by and who were strolling along Riverside Drive ? Did anyone see anything or do n't the people of New York care what happens ? I believe that some of your thieves and hoodlums are preying on the tours ists that daily park in ' the Riverside Church area , and I believe that the New York - Police Department could stop it if they cared enough about the protection of innocent citizens in broad daylight . I do not expect to hear anything of the losses I incurred , but do hope that future tourists will have better protection when parking . A. W. COLEMAN. , , Okla. , Sept , 3 , 1951 , Ban on Scholar Criticized Professor Fairbank Said to Be a Victim of Campaign of Innuendo To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE Tams f The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security grounds , to permit John . K. Fair .. bank of Harvard University to visit Japan is shocking evidence of how far . we are going to imitate the control of " dangerous thoughts " as practiced by the pre-war Japanese militarists and by all authoritarian regimes . This restriction on so eminent and liberal-minded a scholar as Professor Fairbank is a logical outgrowth of the . crusade of Senator McCarthy and his allies to indict a whole generation of American scholarship as welt as diplomacy in the Far East . It goes along with the repeated but unsubstantiated attacks on the integ ; rity of Ambassador Philip C. Jessup and Prof. Owen Lattimore ; the campaign of innuendo now being carried on to discredit the research activities of the Institute of Pacific Relations in the McCarran committee hearings , and the charges- leveled against State Department officers like John P. Davies and John S. Service , whose crime was that some years ago they accurately predicted the fall of the Chiang regime unless it could be strengthened by political and social reforms . The Japanese militarists , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were defending the ancient , authoritarian ? ideals of their country against democratic tendencies which were " un-Japanese . " But the campaign we are now witnessing against. , " unAmerican " activities , where it leads to indiscriminate smearing of loyal , non . Communist Americans , violates the most fundamental tenets of the Amer ? ican heritage . What effect ' it will have , incidentally , in Japan , where we have been trying to inculcate democracy , hardly requires comment . It is about time that Americans woke up to the intellectual as well as moral dangers in McCarthyisni . In our rela. tions with Asia today they are particu ? tarty serious . To understand the corn . plex and momentous ' upheavals taking place in that area is difficult enough , given the widest opportunities for free and dispassionate study . Our failures of understanding in the past have led the United States into grievous errors of policy ; unless we do better they will be repeated on a still larger scale . Nothing will bring this about more surely than to accept the naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the triumph of communism in China . There are no easy answers to the problems of Asia . But the least we can do in our own interest is to encourage American officials , Journalists , scholars and business men to report freely and honestly their findings , without fear ' of . peing irresponsibly labeled as Communists , black reactionaries or anything else . Otherwise we shall sacrifice one of the chief assets of democracy in its struggle against communism . WILLIAM W. Locxwo011 . Princeton , N. J. , Sept. 5 , 1951 . Protest Lodged on Fight Ban To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEX It can not be said that we 're happy about the trend by sports promoters to refuse sponsors the rights to telecast main sports events such as the Turpin ? Robinson bout . This decision negates the very reason for which my friends and I purchased our television sets .
