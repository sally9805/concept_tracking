The fourth atom bomb blast at Frenchman 's Flat , Nev. was the biggest of the series . It lit up the sky brightly at San Diego , 300 miles away . At Los Angeles , 250 miles away , the light was strong enough before dawn to take a dramatic picture ( see below ) . Earth tremors shook Las Vegas ( about 70 miles away ) , where the air blast broke a plate-glass window in Marjer 's department store . <P> A much more distant effect of the explosions was a radioactive snowfall in the northeastern U.S. University of Rochester scientists boiled snow water and found the residue radioactive . In other cities , scientists got similar results , but all agreed that the radioactivity was much too weak to be dangerous . <P> The complete absence of scientific information about the Nevada bomb tests makes guessing about them hazardous . One thing seems certain : that the bombs were of several types . More interesting to scientific guessers than the powerful final bomb were the earlier , weaker ones . An urgent project of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactical " atom bomb small enough and cheap enough to be used in considerable numbers against enemy troops . <P> The weak bombs exploded in Nevada may have been this long-sought-for weapon . They may have been dropped from small aircraft or even fired from something resembling artillery . If such weapons lave been perfected , they will be a powerful addition to U.S. military strength .
