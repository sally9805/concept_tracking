txt Explosions and fire aboard the aircraft carrier Bennington killed at least ninety-one men and injured more than 200 today . It was one of the worst peacetime disasters in modern United 1States naval history . The blasts originated on the deck below the hangar deck , the first one occurring at about 6:20 this morning . The hangar deck is just below the flight , or top , deck of the ship . The 41,000-ton vessel was in the Atlantic about seventy-five miles south of Newport , R. I. , when she was rocked by the explosions . The carrier , escorted by the destroyer Ingraham , was on her way north to this naval air station from Norfolk , Va . The Secretary of the Navy , Charles S. Thomas , who flew here from Washington to inspect the ship and talk to eyewitnesses , said the cause of the explosion was not known . A court of inquiry will begin here tomorrow . According to Rear Admiral John M. Hoskins , commander of air activities here , the inquiry will " try to determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fault and try to make sure that it never happens again . " Ambulances Stand By From the first of three explosions , until the last man left the ship , the scenes often were reminiscent of wartime . Heroism was mingled with death as rescuers fought through ' smoke and bent steel to find comrades . The fire raged for about four hours after the explosions . Helicopters made as many as a dozen trips out to sea to bring the critically injured to hospitals . Ten of the victims were on the critical list and some personnel were missing . Long lines of ambulances were on the pier here before the carrier arrived , and later in the day many hearses occupied the same area . While ranking Navy officers held conferences , hundreds of wives and parents sat tensely in a theatre here , waiting to learn if their men were alive . Several theories advanced to explain the disaster were discredited during the day . Capt . William F. Raborn of Oklahoma City , skipper of the ship , suggested at first that a fuse magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a check had shown this to be unlikely . The possibility of sabotage was discounted by Admiral Hoskins , but he added he could not dismiss this entirely until the investigation was concluded . Other officers , including Captain Raborn , said they did not think the trouble began in the catapult room , which contains mechanism for launching planes . At the time of the accident Captain Raborn was on the navigation bridge and the ship was doing twenty knots , Rear Admiral Edgar Cruise , commander ' of Carrier Division 6. was aboard . He had made the Bennington his flagship . Captain Raborn said that his first knowledge that something was s wrong came about 6:20 A. M. when he saw a puff of white smoke from below the flight deck . Shortly thereafter he felt a " minor " explosion , followed by two stronger blasts . General quarters was sounded and the captain organized and directed rescue parties . He said his men performed many acts of heroism , saving comrades trapped in smoke-filled compartments in which the water used to fight the fire was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck , the captain ordered planes still aboard to take off . Twenty aircraft , including jets , left the carrier before the accident . In the next few minutes another twenty took off . The captain said none of the planes was damaged  --  they landed at the Quonset Naval Air Station . Not all the planes on the carrier were flown off . Some that were on the hangar deck at the time of the explosion were moved up to the flight deck as the ship made for port , During midafternoon , after inspecting the carrier , the captain said there were no bodies remaining aboard the vessel and that all the injured had been removed . In announcing the organization of a court of inquiry , Admiral Hoskins said it would include , in addition to himself , Admiral Cruise , Capt . James E. Leeper , commander of Fleet Air Wing 3 , here , anti Capt . R. J. Zanzot , materiel officer of the staff of the commander of destroyers in the Atlantic . Admiral Hosknis said that , except when classified information was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press . An inspection of the ship by the court will take place tomorrow , he declared . Admiral Hoskins said he did not yet know the exact location of the first explosion . ' He described the tragedy as " the worst I can recall offhand in peacetime . " He asserted , " I do n't believe there is any possibility of sabotage . However . I ca n't be certain about that until the inquiry is completed . " The admiral praised Captain Raborn for his work in controlling the fire and limiting the damage to a " comparatively small area of the ship . " Secretary Thomas , who came aboard the Bennington about an hour after she arrived here at 12:25 P. M. , said he knew there was " nothing I could do , but I wanted these men and their families to know the deep , personal interest I had in these men . " The Secretary , whose son is serving aboard another carrier , vowed the injured would get the best possible medical case . He praised not only the rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their services . Mr. Thomas said he was particularly proud of the work don@ by the helicopter pilots . Their efficiency , he said , would undoubtedly mean the difference between life and death to some of the injured . The Secretary said he assumed he would make a report but indicated that this matter obviously could not be discussed in detail pending completion of the court of inquiry . The Bennington Jeff Norfolk on Monday . She , was conducting air operations at . sea and was not due here Until Friday . The carrier had last been at this naval air station over the week-end of May 15 . and 16 . Telephone facilities here and in surrounding areas were so badly snarled that calls were generally held im for about three hours . The Navy had priority for official business and relatives swamped the switchboards in their anxiety to learn . the fate of men aboard the carrier . Reporters at the scene were hampered in relaying stories ' to their offices in consequence .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
