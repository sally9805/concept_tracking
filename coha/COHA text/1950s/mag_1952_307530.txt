In 1948 , Henry Staffel , 52 , Chicago meat packer and owner of the Perk Dog Food Co. , teamed up with a new business partner : Bishop Bernard Sheil , Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of Chicago and founder of the Pilot Guide Dog Foundation , which supplies free dogs to the blind . Their agreement was no ordinary business deal . Staffel , who had long wanted to do something for the blind , agreed to turn over to the foundation " forever " the profits on every can ( about a penny ) of Perk Dog Food for which a label was mailed in to Bishop Sheil . " I had no idea at the time , " says Staffel , " how many people read the offers on labels . " <P> Last week the 125 millionth Perk label came into the foundation 's Chicago office . And out from Staffel went another check , bringing the total of profit payments since 1948 up to $125,000 . <P> Today , Perk 's profits provide P.G.D.F. with 90% of its operating costs , pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee , room &; board ) for blind persons who could not otherwise have afforded them . <P> Even though Staffers agreement has cut heavily into profits on Perk , which now accounts for one-third of his business , he has plenty of other profitmaking products ( he owns the Ready Foods Canning Corp . and the Roger Staffel Meat Co. ) to keep him going . Born in Chicago , Staffel started working when he was 16 , was managing a meat-packing plant by the time he was 21 . In 1934 he started Ready Foods , followed with Perk , since the war has opened a provision business , two slaughtering houses , one canning plant and bought a boneless-roasted-turkey business . Says Staffel : " It may sound corny but we 've had a lot of good luck since we started this thing . " He plugs the Perk agreement in his sales-promotion campaign on his can labels . In four years Perk 's sales have jumped 100% v. a 75%-or-less rise which Staffel figures they would have had without the agreement . He now gives so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deductions by the Internal Revenue Department that a special tax ruling allows the entire donation to be written off . <P> Recently Staffel extended the penny contribution offer to include labels from some of his other products , but what he would really like to see is the spread of the idea to industry in general . Says he : " Business today has come to be pictured as a ruthless thing . A project like this shows people that it is not ruthless , and that they themselves can take part with business in helping a worthy cause . "
