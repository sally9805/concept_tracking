Postage Due ? The U.S. Post Office has lost money for most of its 157 years . Recently , politicians have been laying much of the blame on the costs of carrying second-class mail , which includes magazines and newspapers . Last week President Truman himself teed off on magazine and newspaper publishers before an audience of postmasters , most of them political appointees . Harry Truman , who has joined Congress in asking raises for the mailmen despite the $500 million-a-year postal deficit , laid the " biggest part of the deficit " on the low rates on newspapers , magazines and advertising matter , a subsidy " to the tune of several hundred million dollars a year . " Opposition to raising rates has come from " the slick-magazine publishers , " said Truman , " and I mean that word in two ways . . . They have the nerve to complain about the high cost of government . " <P> In the Hole . Last March , Postmaster General Jesse Donaldson told Congress that the cost of handling the mail has increased by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go up . He proposed to raise $271,320,000 by increasing most rates , and doubling the rate for second-class mail . When the Senate passed a postal bill three weeks ago , it shaved these increases , boosting newspaper rates by 10% a year for three years , magazines by 20% a year for three years , or 60% altogether . <P> Many publishers , both large &; small , protested . They were willing to bear their fair share of increased costs , they said , but they pointed out that , on the Post Office 's own figures , the cost of handling magazines and newspapers has increased not 60% but about 30% . A 60% boost would put many small publications out of business . And why should they have to take twice as great a rate increase as newspapers ? <P> Elusive Figures . Actually , no one knows how much the Post Office really loses-or makes-on carrying publications . Its own figures show a $192,500,000 loss in 1950 on second-class mail . Only a little more than half was due to daily and weekly newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huge loss is based on the Post Office 's intricate system of " cost ascertainment , " which charges off many other services to second-class mail costs . Example : in 1949 , a third of the cost of operating Rural Free Delivery was charged off to second-class , though 20% more first-class than second-class mail is carried on R.F.D. routes . The publishers pointed out , too , that the Post Office had always been intended to be a public service . No one had expected all its services could pay their own way . <P> An outside accounting firm , Manhattan 's Price , Waterhouse &; Co. , found a far different picture . After it separated the actual costs of carrying paid second-class mail from all other costs included in second-class , Price , Waterhouse reported that the Government actually made a $7,000,000 profit on newspapers and magazines .
