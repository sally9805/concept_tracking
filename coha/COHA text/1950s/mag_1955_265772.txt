Although Guatemala 's Red-lining ex-President Jacobo Arbenz has never visited Switzerland , many a tie links him to that tight little European democracy . He is of Swiss descent on his father 's side and still has relatives there . He chose Swiss banks to hold the plunder , reportedly $6,000,000 , that came into his hands while he was President . And it was in Zurich that an Arbenz henchman last year negotiated the purchase of $10 million worth of Communist arms . If the President who almost delivered Guatemala to the Reds now wanted to visit Moscow headquarters to talk over the past and future , he could hardly find a more discreet door through the Iron Curtain than Switzerland . Last week , inevitably , Arbenz headed that way . In Mexico , where the former President has been living , there was speculation that when his official three-month " leave from exile " expired , Arbenz would be back primed with money and promises of Communist guns for a try at regaining power in Guatemala . The rumors were partly based on the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has repeatedly cautioned its numerous Guatemalan exiles to refrain from " political activity . " Arbenz ' arrogant refusal to do so has left a bad taste with many Mexicans ; the leading daily Excelsior last week sourly cartooned him as a hen flying off and leaving a brood of chicks marked with the hammer and sickle . Stopping in Paris en route to Lausanne , he told reporters : " I am not renouncing politics . I will remain in politics all my life . " But , mindful of the rumors , he cautiously added : " I have no political projects at the present . " <P> One of the relatives Arbenz will doubtless see in Switzerland is his father 's well-to-do brother Ernst Arbenz , and Ernst may talk to him like a Swiss uncle . A blind cheesemaker of Alstatten ( " One does n't have to be able to see to put the holes in cheese " ) , Ernst told reporters last week that he had written his nephew a letter of advice a few months before the President fell from power . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ernst recalled . " But either he got annoyed or his Communist friends intercepted the letter , because neither I nor any other member of the family heard from him again . " Reflected Uncle Ernst , who once lived in Guatemala : " I remember the boy well . One of the smartest . He could have done great honor to our name if he had only chosen his friends better .
