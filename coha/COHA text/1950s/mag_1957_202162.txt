THE WONDERFUL O ( 72 pp. ) - James Thurber-Simon &; Schusfer ( $3.50 ) . <P> Captain Black , a monomaniacal pirate , abhors the letter 0 . " I 've had a hatred of that letter ever since the night my mother became wedged in a porthole. ' ' he explains . " We could n't pull her in so we had to push her out . " <P> With this darkling confidence , readers are off on a voyage into the vast punumbra inside Humorist Thurber 's head . Nothing is credible , yet all might have happened at any moment between waking and sleeping . Black and his beastly pirate crew land on the island of Ooroo ( " It sounds like the eyes of a couple of ghosts leaning against an R , " shudders Black ) and proceed to knock the 0 out of everything . They smash in doors and cupboards , rip roofs off houses , dismantle towers , drain pools and ponds . But all they find are opals and moonstones , not the valuable , 0-less gems they seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black issues an edict : the illegal O , whether upper or lower case , must vanish from the language . Doctor becomes dctr , books are bks , clockshop , clckshp ; saying cockadoodledoo aloud would be tantamount to fomenting rebellion . The docile natives of Ooroo , now renamed " R , " try hard to talk the new gibberish . A by tells a girl she sings like a chir of riles , and gets slapped . Lads studying Igic at schl recite : " Mist is always mist , but what is mist is n't always mist . ' ' Peple can n Inger tell rot from root . Babies make as much sense as their fathers . <P> But there are four 0-words the people refuse to give up : hope . love , valor , and one other that remains not too mysteriously hidden until the final pages . The islanders rebel and , with the aid of beneficent magic , rout the pirates . Like his charming 1950 fable , The Thirteen Clocks , Thurber 's new fairy story is written for a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddles sprinkled with poetic dust . Curiously , the author deprives Pirate Black of an argument that might have won the Ooroovians to his cause : even with the abolition of all 0-words , they would still retain life , liberty , and the ability to pursue happiness .
