Reading LIFE in 1945 in the Bahamas , the Duke of Windsor was impressed by the understanding of Britain shown in a series about his old friend , Winston Churchill . The Duke had a mutual friend call up Charles J. V. Murphy , now a LIFE staff writer , a big , ducal-looking Bostonian who had written the article ( with John Davenport ) . The friend 's suggestion : the Duke of Windsor and Reporter Murphy ought to know each other because " the Duke is thinking of doing some writing himself . " The result of the delayed meeting ( Murphy first spent six months in the Pacific as a war correspondent ) was a three-part story , written by the Duke and edited by Murphy , on " The Education of a Prince . " It was published in LIFE in December 1947 . <P> This week LIFE began publication of the sequel , " A King 's Story , " by the Duke of Windsor . In the memorable four-part , 35,000-word account of the making and unmaking of a king , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up his throne for " the woman I love . " ( The story is appearing in the London Sunday Express and papers in 29 other countries , but not in any U.S. paper . ) <P> The Duke spent three years on the memoirs . As he acknowledges in his foreword , Charlie Murphy was his collaborator most of the time , prodding , suggesting , editing and cajoling , in Paris and at Cap d'Antibes . To help refresh Windsor 's memory , Murphy supplied him with digests of diaries , court calendars , newspaper clippings , books and interviews with other actors in the royal drama . ( The Duke himself had saved a bale of state and unofficial papers and albums of his own photographs of the historic days . ) Then , while a secretary recorded every word , the Duke reminisced . <P> With uncompromising pride of authorship , Windsor then rewrote the typescript drafts , fiddling endlessly with every word , frequently chucking out sentences or words suggested by Murphy because " I do n't talk like that . " The Duke worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my coat " ) , with six pipes close at hand . At the start , he rarely settled down to work until 11:30 a.m. , and he generally broke ; up the afternoon for such engagements as golf with Leopold of the Belgians . At the end , he was on a strict 9-to-6 regimen . <P> Banalities &; Black Bottoms . The engrossing story begins with the Prince of Wales 's casual classes in kingship and a talk about the facts of royal life with his father ( said George V : " Always remember . . . who you are " ) . But the Prince 's " mature development " was left pretty much to chance . One of the only positive pieces of advice came from an old courtier who observed : " Only two rules really count . Never miss an opportunity to relieve yourself ; never miss a chance to sit down . " * The Prince 's first important royal job was an exciting and educational 150,000-mile road show as " Britain 's Best Salesman . " " The generous applause that greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tolerance with which the world 's most democratic people continued to view its princes . "
