Can a good male tennis player beat a topnotch female tennis player ? This week the world 's best woman player gave New York Times Sportswriter Allison Danzig a decidedly nonfeminist answer . Said U.S. and Wimbledon Champion Maureen Connolly : " He would simply annihilate her . I know . I was annihilated myself yesterday by a pro no one has ever heard of . " Added Little Mo , the hardest hitter in the ladies ' division : " Men hit so much harder and run so much faster than women that we do n't have a ghost of a chance against them . . . They are so much stronger at the net , and even when they stay back , it does n't make much difference . The pro I played . . . hardly volleyed once , and still he killed me. "
