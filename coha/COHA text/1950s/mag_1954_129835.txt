It 's a fairly safe bet that Floretta McCutcheon , who announced her retirement from bowling the other day at the age of 65 , wo n't be absent from the lanes for long . One of the most colorful figures in the game 's most colorful era , a champion for 15 years and a moulder of champions for 15 more , she is as much a part of bowling as bowling is a part of her . // Mrs. McCutcheon was a star in the days when the great Jimmy Smith ( whom she defeated in 1927 in a three-game exhibition , 704 to 687 ) , Joe Falcaro , Jimmy Blouin and Mort Lindsey were touring the country in search of money matches . She was still the foremost women 's instructor when she resigned recently from the Chicago Bowlium to help care for her two grandchildren in San Gabriel , Calif. // Because she was so far superior to the women bowlers of her day  --  there were only some 3,000 in the U.S. in the early 1920s  --  she often competed against men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // A DODO FOR A HECKLER // One spring night in 1938 she opened her " School for Women " with an exhibition at Jamaica ( N.Y. ) Recreation . Most of the large crowd which turned out expected to see a strapping woman with a powerhouse ball . Instead , they found a soft-spoken , gray-haired lady of five feet three . She rolled a " soft " ball which backed up slightly . // " Why do n't you learn to bowl before you try to teach ? " yelled a man who fancied himself a bowler . // The audience was appalled . But Mrs. McCutcheon merely smiled and sweetly asked , " Would you like to give me a lesson ? " The man said he would . // Mrs. McCutcheon changed her ball and her style of delivery . As the ball left her hand it headed for the No. 1 pin , backed toward the No. 3 , then swished into the strike pocket at the last moment . She went on like that for two games , getting strikes on pocket hits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she did n't strike . If memory serves me right , she averaged 230-something to win by 70 pins . The heckler was laughed out of the hall . He probably is unaware to this day that he was defeated by a " dodo " ball  --  a ball weighted with lead on one side . A dodo is difficult to control , but in the hands of an expert it 's like dynamite on the pins . Motherly Mrs. McCutcheon was an expert . // In her prime , " Mac , " as she was called , did n't need a dodo . She averaged 201 for 8,076 games on strange alleys over a ten-year period . She rolled ten 300 games , nine 299s , four 290s . In one exhibition she scored 832 for three games  --  a 277 average  --  and once she hit 248 in 12-game blocks . // But her greatest contribution to the sport was her school . She taught bowling in almost every major city from coast to coast . She is credited with having instructed 300,000 women personally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours . She is one of three women on the honor roll of the Women 's International Bowling Congress , the equivalent of the American Bowling Congress Hall of Fame . // If Mrs. McCutcheon clings to her resolution to retire , bowling will have lost one of its great personalities . Throughout her sparkling career , however , she has above all been a lady . And you know what they say about a lady 's prerogative . // Mort Luby 's National Bowlers Journal , with an assist from the country 's bowling writers , has come up with its annual All-American teams . The first team includes Bill Lillard , who has joined the Pfeiffers of Detroit ; Don Carter , who moved to the Budweisers of St. Louis ; Basil ( " Buzz " ) Fazio , of the Strohs of Detroit ; Tony Sparando , Rego Park , N.Y. , proprietor who holds the A.B.C . singles title and last spring rolled the 13th perfect game in the history of the championships , and Joe Wilman of Chicago , whose Tri-Par Radio team won the A.B.C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-time record . Ed Lubanski , also of Stroh , is sixth man . // Those who chided me for not listing the Tri-Pars among the country 's top teams ( SI , Aug. 30 ) might be interested to know that a well-to-do sponsor agreed with them . The quintet has been signed this year by the Hamm Brewers of St. Paul . Joe Norris , latest member of the Hall of Fame ; Carmen Salvino , who with Wilman held the national doubles match game championship in 1953-54 ; Harry Ledene , and Chuck Wagner complete the team . Breweries now sponsor four of the nation 's championship-caliber outfits , proving , I suppose , that bowlers can sell beer as well as drink it .
