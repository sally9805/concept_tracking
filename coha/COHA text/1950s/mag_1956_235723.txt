THE city through whose streets Jesus walked to His death and triumph 1,923 years ago was vibrant with tension and murderous with hate . It is tense and murderous today . Suleiman 's 16th century wall and Palestine 's 20th century travail divide Jerusalem between Old City and New , and sentries-Jordan 's Arabs , Israel 's Jews-stand an uneasy guard . " If one of those soldiers throws a tin can at another across the wall , " says a Western diplomat at the bar of the National Hotel , " it could touch off a holocaust . " A travel agent sips his drink , then breaks in : " There has been no change . There has never been peace in Jerusalem . " <P> There were savage riots in January , and there may be more violence at any moment , but for the 800-odd Christian monks , priests , ministers and missionaries who care for Christianity 's holy places in the Old City , time passes in centuries . " Just as Herod 's men in the time of Our Lord used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said an Irish priest last week , " so the Americans in the oilfields down in Saudi Arabia send lorries today to buy up our food at prices we ca n't match . " <P> On Holy Thursday of 1956 , the Garden of Gethsemane glows with flowers beneath its ancient olive trees-the poppies and daisies , the groundsel , ranunculus , garlic and blue lupine that grew wild there when Jesus sweated blood in the agony of His prayer : " My Father , if it be possible , let this chalice pass from me . " In the grotto nearby , where Judas betrayed his Master with a kiss , the murals from the Byzantine and Crusader periods have peeled away , and the air is still dank from the winter 's rains . <P> In the city below , the Church of the Holy Sepulchre looms in the dusk beneath a skeleton of steel girders that shores it up , a byproduct of the 1927 earthquake . A group of Greek Orthodox priests in conical hats chat quietly in the courtyard , and inside a Russian nun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stone of Unction , where Christ 's body is supposed to have been anointed for burial ( several such Stones of Unction are said to have been kissed away by pilgrims ) . <P> Just outside , an Arab barber named Aouni leafs through an Egyptian picture magazine while he waits in his shabby shop for a late customer . From the bare-walled coffee shop comes the click of dice . An aged street vendor watches for hungry pilgrims with his roasted peanuts , and the Moslem proprietor of the souvenir shop next door offers a special on the miniature crowns of thorns made by Arab refugees . The Holy Week price : $1 . At the barricaded Jaffa Gate , a pair of Arab Legion sentries stuff hands in pockets against the chill , and a radio blares a newscast . A bright red poster on an ancient wall nearby advertises an American movie , Massacre Canyon .
