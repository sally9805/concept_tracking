The U.S. Treasury , which likes nothing better than to sell bonds , was disturbed last week for a strange reason : it was selling too many . In towns and cities through the South and East , the demand was so great that banks were running out of savings bonds . Reason for the rush : a new person-to-person chain letter in which bonds change hands instead of money . <P> " This is a giveaway wealth campaign , " said some of the letters . " Give away two $25 U.S. savings bonds and get $38,400 back . Worth $51,200 in ten years . " The get-rich-quick scheme , starting in the South last fall , spread into New York and New England last week . Each participant buys two bonds ( total outlay : $37.50 ) , gives one to his sponsor and pops the receipt for the other in the mail to the person on the top of an eleven-name list . He then knocks the top name off , and adds his to the bottom . Then he lines up two friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money back ) , and makes sure that they each mail a bond to the new No. 1 man . By the time a bond buyer gets to the top , he theoretically should receive 2,048 bonds in the mail . <P> Dubious Treasury officials last week issued a warning against the plan . But such lucky bond buyers as Used-Car Dealer Cliff Pettit of Knoxville , Tenn. , who with his wife and son has already received 252 bonds in the mail , were happily counting up their riches .
