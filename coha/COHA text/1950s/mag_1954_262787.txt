With all the talk about Italy 's No. 1 threat-Communism-not much is said about another ailment which works on Communism 's side . The other sickness : statism . This leftover from Fascism stultifies free enterprise in business and perpetuates a swollen bureaucracy in government . Last week Don Luigi Sturzo , Italy 's aged and respected political priest , addressed himself to the problem Italian politicians prefer not to talk about . Said Don Luigi : <P> DEMOCRACY has two fundamental elements . They are : freedom , as opposed to despotism and a society in which there are no special classes , castes or interests . Freedom must be total or else it is not freedom . <P> Despite all the good will and the oft-repeated statements of the men in government , both in the past and present , it can not be denied that the weight of an ever more intrusive interference from the government is upon us . I am not opposed to measured government intervention in the various branches of private activities , especially where private initiative can not of itself adequately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , all attempts at getting back on the road to freedom have been barred by three factors : lack of faith in freedom or , more exactly , fear of freedom ; an inferiority complex in the face of Marxist propaganda ; and the vested interests of a government bureaucracy . Today , nine years after war 's end , we find ourselves in such a maze of interlocking interests-and in such a psychological state-that it is hard to speak of an effective reduction of state intervention without being misunderstood . That is why I , who have no ties , can speak of it . It does not matter that my voice is that of an unheeded Cassandra . If I were silent , I should fail in my duty . <P> Two concepts face each other . One of them is state intervention , leading to state socialism . The other is freedom , leading to civic and social cooperation . I am for freedom . <P> Someone said that freedom must be defended at all times because , like virtue , it is at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cases . But the profound meaning of freedom must be understood . The best definition was given by Cicero : " Freedom is participation in power . " Only in democracy can we have direct and indirect participation in power . But power presupposes property-and property means initiative , responsibility and risk . This is a law of history . Therefore , the proletarian will have no power as long as he remains a proletarian . <P> But when . . . the state is introduced in the place of the greater possibilities of private property , when government monopolies are created , when perpetual tenures are established by state-controlled groups , and government participation is established in private enterprise , then the course of freedom is altered or interrupted .
