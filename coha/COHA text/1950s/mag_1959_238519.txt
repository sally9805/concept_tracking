Asia 's own cold war-between Pakistan and India-last week unexpectedly showed signs of thawing . The Kashmir issue still divides the two countries , but their quarrel over dividing the canal waters of the Indus Basin ( TIME , June 1 ) seems to be heading for amicable settlement . At first , Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had hard words for the government of Pakistan 's General Mohammed Ayub Khan ( " a naked military dictatorship " ) . But Ayub 's incorruptibility , his undeniable popularity , and his own sensible willingness to patch things up with India has done a lot to diminish the enmities that grew out of the violent partition of India and Pakistan twelve years ago , when between half a million and a million people were killed . <P> At week 's end word came that General Ayub , in flying the 1,000 miles across India that divides West and East Pakistan , will make what is officially described as a " fuel stop " at the Indian capital of New Delhi on Sept. 1 , and will have time enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two heads of state . One item that may well be discussed : General Ayub 's suggestion last spring that Pakistan and India get together for the joint defense of the Indian subcontinent , an idea that Nehru-confronted with Red China 's challenge on his northern borders - apparently no longer considers so outlandish as he once did .
