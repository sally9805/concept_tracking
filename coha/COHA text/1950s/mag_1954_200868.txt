Hardly ever before in peacetime has U.S. public interest in foreign policy run so broad and so deep . The fall publishing season has brought a batch of foreign-policy books , including four by authors with topnotch reputations : George F. Kennan , onetime ( 1947-50 ) director of the State Department 's Policy Planning Staff ; Charles Burton Marshall , a top State Department planner under Dean Acheson ; F.S.C. Northrop , Sterling professor of philosophy and law at Yale , noted for such provocative books as The Taming of the Nations , The Meeting of East and West ; and Adlai Stevenson , titular head of the Democratic Party . The four volumes are being heavily advertised , have been widely reviewed and have caused quite a bit of chatter . They are indeed newsworthy , not because they are good , but because-for all the work that has gone into them-they are so bad . <P> Their common denominator could be expressed thus : in international relations , the U.S. should speak ever so softly and never appear to be carrying much more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson ( Harper ; $2.25 ) , will sound to many more like a call to weakness . Stevenson is seriously disturbed over the possibility that the U.S. will appear to be too arrogant in world affairs . He is troubled by " pronouncements of rigid policy by American leaders " and by " the growing emphasis on the military aspect of anti-Communist defense . " Any unilateral action by the U.S. , he fears , " will tend to confirm the Communist charge that our purpose is not disinterested cooperation but self-interested domination . " As the U.S. stands before the world it must be humble . " We are never going to solve many of the hard problems of the world , but will simply have to learn to live with them for years and maybe for centuries . " <P> REALITIES OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY , by George F. Kennan ( Princeton ; $2.75 ) , disagrees with Stevenson on the question of humility : " There is no use blinking the fact that we are a great nation . " But Kennan , too , is worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force its standard of morality on the rest of the world , may abuse its power and responsibility . His recommendation : " If we all sit quietly in our little boat and address ourselves to the process of navigation , I doubt that it will tip over . " <P> THE LIMITS OF FOREIGN POLICY , by Charles Burton Marshall ( Holt ; $3 ) , maintains that there can not be much initiative in foreign policy : it is " necessarily in large part a response to situations . . . beyond our Government 's control . " Americans , says Marshall , are too fascinated with Davy Crockett 's formula , " Be sure you 're right , then go ahead . " For the purposes of world politics , he writes , the best that can be expected is some such paraphrase as : " Be as sure as you reasonably can of the rightness of your premises . Take care as best you can to see that the conclusions which you draw from them are tolerably right . . . . After you have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the circumstances taken as a whole warrant , getting others to go along as far as you can . "
