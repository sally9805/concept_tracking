Inspecting imported wheat last week , the manager of a Brazilian flour mill caught a glint of metal , plucked out the hammer-and-sickle button of a Russian army uniform . How the button got mixed with the grain , no one knew , but it provided a brassy accent for a plain fact : Latin American trade with Iron Curtain countries is rising . Items : <P> Cuba last fortnight agreed to deliver 200,000 tons of sugar to Russia for $12 million . Though the price was low ( 3.05 a Ib. v. the 3.17 world price ) , Cubans were overjoyed , would gladly accept similar out-of-the-blue orders for the 860,000-ton sugar surplus that is still left . <P> Colombia , in its first sizable deal with the Reds , signed up with some visiting East German drummers to barter $10 million in coffee and tobacco for light machinery . Said Pedro Bernal , manager of the Coffee Exporters ' Association : " Now let 's see whether we can open markets for coffee in the real Iron Curtain countries . " <P> Argentina signed with Czechoslovakia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a like amount in steel , machine tools and newsprint . <P> Brazil concluded an agreement with Hungary to exchange goods worth a total of $20 million , and raised the target for total trade with Czechoslovakia , originally $8,000,000 , to $30 million . <P> The new agreements , piled on top of existing pacts that promoted a trade totalling $150 million in 1954 , promise to make 1955 a record year for commerce between Latin America and the Reds . Argentina , for example , is now sending around 13% of her exports behind the curtain . But the trade is nonstrategic and still relatively small : U.S. exports to and imports from Latin America total about $6 billion a year . Washington is not alarmed .
