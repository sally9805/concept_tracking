( See Cover ) <P> In northern India 's state of Uttar Pradesh last week , Moslem trappers working in teams of four set out their nets before dawn . While three hid , one man walked to a clump . of trees . Loudly he called " Ao ! ao ! ao ! " ( Come ! come ! come ! ) , and began to scatter grain . Rhesus monkeys scrambled down and followed his grain trail . When the monkeys got to the grain in the trap , a hidden operator pulled a cord and meshed them in the netting , an average dozen at a time . <P> The Moslems ( no Hindu will do this work because of religious scruples ) stuffed the monkeys into bamboo cages and carried them on shoulder poles into Lucknow . The train hauled them 260 miles to New Delhi . There , 1,000 specimens carefully chosen for health and size ( 4 to 8 Ibs. apiece ) were collected . Then a four-engine transport flew them , with a full-time attendant to feed and water them three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , another plane and another attendant took them 3,000 miles to New York 's Idlewild Airport and trucks carried them 700 miles to Okatie Farms in South Carolina . There the rhesus monkeys from India were caged with other hordes of " Java " ( Cynomolgus ) monkeys from the Philippines , to be used as ammunition in a great battle now being fought by medical science . The enemy : polio . <P> Though Okatie Farms may receive 5,000 or more monkeys a month , the supply never catches up with the demand . After 21 days for rigorous health checks , they are on their way to laboratories in Toronto , Pittsburgh , Detroit and Berkeley , Calif . <P> From South to North . The man behind most of this monkey business ( the biggest in history ) is Jonas Edward Salk , 39 , an intense , single-minded medical researcher who spends his days and a large part of his nights in the University of Pittsburgh 's Virus Research Laboratory . Behind Salk. in turn , are Si million of the 3 billion dimes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paralysis . <P> This spring . Dr. Salk 's vision and his delicate laboratory procedures and logarithmic calculations are to be put to the test . Beginning next month in the South and working North ahead of the polio season , the vaccine that Salk has devised and concocted will be shot into the arms of 500,000 to 1.000,000 youngsters in the first , second and third grades in nearly 200 chosen test areas . A few months after the 1954 polio season is over , statisticians will dredge from a mountain of records an answer to the question : Does the Salk vaccine give effective protection against polio ? <P> Dr. Salk 's laboratories could not produce more than a fraction of the hundreds of gallons of vaccine needed for such a massive trial . So it is being made according to his specifications on a nonprofit basis by five pharmaceutical houses-Parke , Davis &; Co. in Detroit . Pitman-Moore and Eli Lilly &; Co. in Indianapolis , Wyeth Inc. in Philadelphia , the Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley , Calif . For all of them , the indispensable raw material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . For example : <P> The University of Toronto 's Connaught
