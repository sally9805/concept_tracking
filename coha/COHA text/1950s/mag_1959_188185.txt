Alias Jesse James ( Hope Enterprises ; United Artists ) , for moviegoers who have almost given up Hope , is a pleasant surprise : a Bob Hope farce that is actually funny , and sometimes downright hilarious . Comic Hope is cast as " the world 's worst insurance agent , " a 19th century nincompoop who caps his career by writing a $100,000 insurance policy for a man who avers that he is " well known in railroad and banking circles . " Only later does Hope realize that he has insured the life of the nation 's No. 1 public enemy : Jesse James ( Wendell Corey ) . <P> " What do you hope to achieve with such colossal stupidity ? " his boss roars , and Hope meekly replies : " I wanted to become your assistant . " Instead , he is ordered to head west , find Jesse James and keep him alive at all costs . " B-b-but . " Hope stammers , " I 'm liable to get killed . " To which the boss bellows a retort that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scratching the wax : " Stop trying to cheer me up ! " <P> Out at the James ranch , Hope is met by Ma James ( Mary Young ) , a dear little old lady with a rifle in her lap . As she oils it she quavers , " Ah 'm jes ' cleanin ' up after the boys . " Next morning Jesse announces wearily that he has to get up early and go to work-there 's a man he has to kill . Ma pipes up . " Promise me you 'll wear rubbers , son . " But Hope rides out to the duel instead , rigs his guns to fire when he tips his hat , drops his man , saves the policy , captures the villain , gets the girl ( Rhonda Fleming ) . Conclusion : as the grateful townsfolk gather around and promise to erect a statue of the hero in the public square , Hope strikes a statuesque attitude , suddenly finds himself occupied by a passing flock of pigeons . Best spot gag : Hope saunters over to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wingding , pats his head , gently inquires , " What 's your name , son ? " The boy looks up , peering uncertainly through thick glasses . " Harry Truman , " he says . <P> Compulsion ( Zanuck Productions ; 20th Century-Fox ) is a terse , tense , intelligent melodramatization of " the crime of the century " : the Leopold-Loeb murder case of 1924 . Richard Murphy 's screenplay borrows many of its keenest scenes from Meyer Levin 's Broadway version of his own bestselling casebook of the crime ( TIME , Nov. 12 , 1956 ) , preserves in the film ( 103 minutes ) all the essential details of the play ( 180 minutes ) , eliminates only a few of the far-out psychiatric references . One important addition : a taut sense of dramatic sequence . <P> Judd Steiner and Artie Straus ( fictional names for Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb ) are wealthy , brilliant young law students at the University of Chicago . Straus-Loeb , as portrayed by Bradford Dillman , is the spoiled-rotten son of a socialite mother . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steiner-Leopold , as Dean Stockwell interprets him , is a motherless young genius whose IQ is too high to be measured by any known intelligence test-essentially a gentle boy who has been completely mesmerized by the animal magnetism of his evil companion . Straus-Loeb is the superman , Steiner-Leopold the " superior slave " in a private world of post-Nietzschean fantasy and homosexual practice .
