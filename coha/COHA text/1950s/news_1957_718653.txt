txt The fourth graders of the Meadowbrook School sat grin- .. ning and pleased , ' eyes fixed on the movie screen . Every now and then one would let out an especially delighted cry . Another would fire his cap pistol . Why all the excitement ? They were watching a 45-minute color movie about pioneering days in America that they had made themselves ! And the cap pistol was vital to give the sound effects in a battle with marauding Indians . It all started when David P. Williams , fourth-grade teacher at this private school in Weston , decided that a good way to make social science study about our early - American heritage meaningful would be to produce a movie about pioneer life . And Miss Esther Edwards , headmistress , quickly concurred and volunteered to do the photography . All-Year Project All year " My New Kentucky Home " has been the big project of the 18 wide-eyed fourth graders . And they have emerged with a fiery interest in America 's history  --  the kind of interest many educators wonder how to arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should happen during English periods . The plot became the story of the pioneering Rob- inson family who moved West to Kentucky , fought off several Indian attacks , lost their horse , finally built a log cabin in Kentucky . There were planned scenes of Indian raids , deserted campfires , frying hoecakes and an encounter with a mountain lion ( actually a stuffed one ) . Outdoors , during carpentry periods , they learned to handle axes with care . They chopped down some trees . These they notched and with Mr. William 's help gradually built into a tiny log cabin on the hill behind the school . Even Cut Own Shingles In arithmetic they figured how many shingles would be needed for the roof . Then they carefully cut the shingles and hammered them on the roof . For music they learned and recorded folk songs of the pioneering days ? " Sourwood Mountain " and the " Riflemen at Bennington . " When they could n't find the words for an old hoe-cake song they wrote them themselves : " I was on my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal when I fell down . Bake them hoecakes brown .... " Finally this month there was a grand showing of the movie to the school 's parents at a " Pioneer night " with roast raccoon , succotash , and sweet potato pie on the bill of fare . What did they learn from all this ? ' They Had No Stores ' oneers had n't been brave they would have run back where they came from . " Such realizations are what Mr. Williams and Miss Edwards have been working for . Feeling Understood As fourth grade teacher David Williams puts it : " The chiHren have really identified themselves with the pioneers . " " It 's also been a great opportunity for them to learn to share and work together . " says Miss Edwards , the headmistress . " There was some way every child in the group could distinguish himself . A blind child in the class played one of the best character parts . " Of course it presents geography and history in a way that makes sense to 9-year-olds . And it helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something important . " Well . " says fourth grader Pam Dwinnell who played the part of Mother Robinson , " if you were just studying about them from books you would n't feel as we do about the pioneers . Just think ! They had to make their own things . They could n't just go to a store as we do . They had to make soap and candles as we have made them this year . " " But the ' Indian attacks were the hardest things for them , " puts in Lillah Gray who played the part of an Indian named Arrowhead . " We chopped down a whole oak tree for this cabin , " explains Alex Frish . " Do n't think it was easy for pioneers to build their own houses . " " We know this particular story in our movie did n't happen , " says David Foster who as Father Robinson had led his clan to Kentucky . " But something like this did happen to millions of people . And if it had n't been for the pioneers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " adds Alex , " if the pi-
