The familiar issue of church and state relationships , the immediate cause of Juan Pern 's downfall , touched off raucous student demonstrations in Argentina last week . <P> At the heart of the dispute was the stubborn fact that President Pedro Aramburu 's acts and attitudes toward the Roman Catholic Church pleased almost no one . The proclerical wing of Argentine opinion , which threw its considerable weight against Pern only after he had imprudently attacked the church , felt defrauded : Aramburu did not restore the church 's prerogatives , such as religious education in public schools . So heated have ardent Roman Catholics become that one priest recently cried : " Never has there been such a rift between the church and the government as now ! " <P> Anticlericals , many of whom opposed Pern during the long years of his good relations with the church , felt equally cheated : Aramburu 's Education Minister was a noted Roman Catholic layman , Atilio Dell'Oro Maini . Dell'Oro proposed nothing more ominous than authorizing any group of citizens to organize a university-a right hitherto reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opening for the Vatican to build Catholic universities that would dominate Argentine higher education . They demanded Dell'Oro 's scalp . <P> With the approach of the new school term a fortnight ago , both sides decided to battle the issue out . Fiery , fight-happy students served as troops ; they fought for the occupation of school buildings in Buenos Aires , La Plata , Rosario , Crdoba and other cities . Winning forces locked themselves inside . Other students , 6,000 strong , clashed and rioted in front of the presidential palace , using tear-gas bombs made by chemistry students as weapons . The weight of numbers favored the anticlericals . At length Aramburu accepted Dell'Oro 's resignation ( offered by telephone from Lima , where Dell'Oro had just been elected president of an inter-American conference of education ministers ) . <P> In replacement , Aramburu appointed Carlos Adrogu , a longtime anti-Peronista who tries to go down the middle of the road on the religious issue . Loud cries of Roman Catholic resentment at Dell'Oro 's ousting suggested that the President had by no means settled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that opposing factions could dispute and demonstrate freely on a vital public issue without fear of Pern-style oppression . Even ex-Minister Dell'Oro said : " I 'm proud of the free debates going on at this moment over this case . "
