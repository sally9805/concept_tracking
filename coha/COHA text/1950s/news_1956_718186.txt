txt Fire Signs in Apartments to Go ; Mayor Heeds Tenants ' Protests Those fire-prevention signs on the inside of apartment doors leading to public halls are coming down . Mayor Wagner announced yesterday that he would ask the City Council to remove from the city 's new Multiple Dwelling Code the requirement that the signs be in plaa on and after July 1 , 1956 . A local bill to repeal the code section will be introduced tomorrow in the Council . There is reasonable assurance that it will be passed by the Council , approved by the Board of Estimate and signed by the Mayor by the end of September . The sign requirement now applies to self-closing doors in 1,776,537 apartments in 141,943 buildings housing three or more families . Violations are punishable by fines up to $500 or thirty days ' imprisonment for a first offense . Building Department regulations call for a sign measuring at least 31/2 by 2 inches , placed from four to five feet above the floor and carrying the following notice in capital letters : " I ; CEEP.THIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUR LIFE IN CASE OF FIRE . " The requirement that apartment doors leading to public halls of multiple dwellings be kept closed when not in , use has been in the state 's Multiple Dwelling Law since 1929 . Before that it was in the Tenement House Law enacted in 1901 . Neither of these Statutes required the posting of signs , however . The Mayor mid that his move to repeal the sign requirement was prompted by a report submitted by City Administrator Charles F. Preusse . The report // was based on a study ordered by the Mayor and made with the cooperation of Fire Commissioner EdWard F. Cavanagh Jr . and Building Commissioner . Bernard F. Gillroy . The Mayor ordered the study after his office received protests by mail and telephone from indignant apartment-dwellers who complained that their privacy was being invaded , the appearance of their foyers marred - and their sensibilities offended . Landlords reported privately that many tenants were refusing to post the signs. * So far , there have been no prosecutions and the impression has prevailed that no serious effort was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mayor 's announcement of the move to do away with the signs declared that it was recognized when the code was enacted . last year that some . of its provisions would have to be modified in the light of practical experience . : ? " After full and careful review by- the City Administrator , the Fife Commissioner and the.Commissioner of Buildings , " he said , " it has been concluded that . the objectives of the requirement of sign posting can be better attained through substitution of an intensive educational pro . gram . " The Mayor said that he , thought that such a ; campaig be all the more effective in obtaining compliance- with safety requirements because the interim mandate " for sign ' posting has impressed the public With the necessity for- keeping doors closed to - prevent the spread of fire . " It is my hope , " he said , " that upon the assurance that such a. program Will be vigoronsly pursued the Council will repeal the provision requiring the posting of the warning sign . " At hearings preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warning signs was opposed by the Real Estate Board of New York and apartment house owners in general as " impractical , " " a nuisance " and " a needless expense . " Mr. Gillroy who asked for retention of the provision in the code said that he assumed full ' responsibility for recommending its inclusion . The Mayor also announced that he was having introduced in the Council tomorrow three other measures to amend the new code to make it more effective and enforceable . One of these would empower property ownerste require affidavits from tenants in regard to occupancy . He said that the code now made it possible to penalize landlords for ' over-occupancy of which they might , through no fault of their own , be unaware . Another proposed ' amendment would reduce the penalty for first ' offenses in cases of violations ? ck ' a fine *up to $500 ; It would permit jail sentences only for a second or subsequent offense arising from failure to remove violations upon which a first offense was based . The third amendment would give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of all code provisions except the one calling for a five-1 year moratorium on creation oft new single-occupancy establish7 ments.
