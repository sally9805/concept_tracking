A fashionable and distinguished-looking Londoner , Mrs. John R. Bassett , found a Christmas note from her son in the mail one day last week . This commonplace occurrence made headlines all over Britain , for Mrs. Bassett is the mother of Guy Burgess , the young British diplomat who disappeared behind the Iron Curtain more than two years ago with his foreign-office colleague , Donald MacLean . <P> The note , dated November and written in ink in a hand positively identified as Guy 's by Mrs. Bassett , was the first tangible evidence that Burgess is still alive . Beyond that fact , it proved nothing . Written on British stationery and enclosed in an envelope postmarked " Dec. 21 , London , S.E. 1 , " the note might have been written anywhere and mailed by any one of thousands wandering the streets of southeast London that day . Two Soviet cargo ships were tied up in London at the time , and the Waterloo Airways Terminal is part of the postal district in which the letter was mailed . The message itself , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereabouts . It came , as The Manchester Guardian put it , " like a rap on the door-but when the door is opened , nobody is there . " <P> Senior Evaluator . The disappearance of Burgess and MacLean , followed last year by the similar disappearance of MacLean 's wife and three children from their home in Geneva , still ranks high in the hearts of British mystery lovers as one of the top unsolved riddles of the age . Last week 's rap on the door sent a new blizzard of speculation swirling through pubs and drawing rooms . But in point of fact , except for the lack of official documentation , the mystery surrounding Burgess and the MacLeans has grown fairly thin . <P> After sifting hundreds of contradictory reports , British intelligence officers are now reasonably satisfied that Burgess is working for the Russians in Moscow as adviser on English-language broadcasts , that MacLean is living with his wife and children in Kladno , Czechoslovakia as " senior evaluator " of Western diplomacy and propaganda . <P> Last week the U.S. magazine World fleshed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together by its overseas staffers . World traces its story back to the late 1930s , when leftward-leaning young MacLean , then the ambitious foreign-office cub , and his future wife first made friends with an other young couple-Italian-born Scientist Bruno Pontecorvo , a favorite pupil of France 's Physicist-Communist Frederic Joliot-Curie , and Pontecorvo 's Swedish mistress . <P> The friendship continued through the 1940s , when Pontecorvo joined an atomic-research team working in Canada and MacLean was posted to the British embassy in Washington . In 1950 , MacLean , whose reputed homosexuality , increasing drunkenness and Soviet-sympathizing had nearly cost him his career , was approached by Russian agents . They sought a nuclear physicist after Britain 's Klaus Fuchs had been discovered as a spy . According to World , MacLean suggested Pontecorvo . His friend , Guy Burgess arranged the details , and after a few weeks , Pontecorvo and his wife ( the former Swedish mistress ) went on a vacation to Sweden and disappeared . Nine months later , Burgess and MacLean followed suit , leaving behind MacLean 's now-famous telegram to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
