grounds of ill health , and it was true that he was generally overtired , that his circulation was poor , but Hoye had never felt that this justified the deep seclusion he had entered , retreating to his Montana ranch , where for two years he remained , receiving scarcely any visitors except Anne and occasionally Porter himself . Averse to all forms of physical exercise , he neither fished nor hunted nor rode . His interest in the workings of the ranch was nominal , and as a consequence there were no reassuring pictures for the papers to print of Gibbs enjoying rural life . He read a great deal , in history for the most part , particularly Toynbee and Niebuhr , and worked intermittently on an autobiographical account of the war years . Hoye had been allowed to read through parts of this , and it was only with the greatest difficulty that he had concealed his distress at what he saw . He had always regarded with astonished admiration Gibbs 's grasp of nearly all aspects of total war , had heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with impressively detailed knowledge , yet in his writings there was little or nothing of this . It was introspective and digressive , a collection of impressions rather than an account of events . A drunken woman crouching in a doorway in Soho cursing into the night : " You rotten , lazy , stinking pig ! " as Gibbs passed by , Gibbs stunned for an instant at the thought that she had addressed him , realizing then that she had not , then weighing the words as if she had : " It is a war of pigs , stinking from the sty of their own unfeeling , lazy in their humanity to a point of paralysis rotten beyond piggery . "  |p51The  pride of an official at an agricultural exhibit at VictoriaStation , pointing to the words " God Save the King " spelled out in stalks of vegetable marrow . " The majestic banality of the Empire . . . its king ruler over all the swans of his realm and , I am told , certain portions of its whales . If he is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle of old love-letters tied up in pink ribbon is saved or the ticket stub of an opera your grandmother slept through . " A description of the face of Harry Hopkins as having " the look of a man who has peered deep into the dark night of his own soul for some trace of the existence of God and has found only Franklin Roosevelt . " For page after page , Gibbs wrote of what was then the American policy of isolationism . Inserted in the manuscript was a photograph which Kuykendall , corresponding with him on the same subject , had once sent . It showed that portion of the black obelisk of the ninth-century Assyrian war lord Shalmeneser III which pictures Jehu , King of Israel , prostrate on the ground before his conqueror . " Such is always the fate of the nation that tries to maintain its isolationism by cautiously playing both ends against the middle , " Kuykendall had written , on which Gibbs had commented : " As for the isolationist of the soul , the world does not graciously destroy him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were dark days indeed that Hoye had spent visitingGibbs at his western retreat , reading over the pages he was in the process of writing ; and they seemed to Hoye darker still for the absence in Gibbs 's manner of any visiblep52trace of the somber change which he felt to be taking place within him . For Gibbs by spoken word or act to have revealedhis melancholy directly would have comforted Hoye , for then he could have challenged him on the subject , could have tried to reason him out of it . But instead Gibbs conducted himself with the same bland reserve as always , and Hoye had been obliged to conclude that the malady , whatever its nature and source , was at least for the time being beyond the reach of his therapy . And now , this January , with Gibbs 's expectations at their highest and Hoye 's helplessly dependent upon them , the symptomswere reappearing but no less obscurely : a mild distractionin his conversation upon arriving , a sigh at the breakfast table , and consequently , Hoye wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Nothing , he thought , unconsciously saying it aloud to himself as he sat there in his office . If he tried taking Gibbs up on words overheard and reported to Louise by her butler , by Louise to him , Gibbs would be quite justifiably derisive . Hence " Nothing " Hoye said again , at which his secretary glanced up from her typewriter questioningly so that for the third time Hoye repeated it . " Nothing , " he said . " Just a sigh . " Less than an hour later , Gibbs himself arrived at Hoye 's office . Hoye had not expected him , and he entered unannounced , having simply walked by the receptionist , who , of course , knew him . He was carrying under one arm several flat packages wrapped up in brown paper and twine , and a cane . He laid the packages down on a table as he came in and stood before Hoye 's desk , tall and stooped ,  |p53with  his head thrust slightly forward , holding the cane out before him . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember it ? It unscrews . " He twisted the handle several times until it came off and then tipped out from the shank the slender glass tube that fitted inside of it . " Holds about three or four good nips , " he explained . " I 'm seeing Rudy 's boy this afternoon , and I thought he might like to have it . There were some old pictures , too , " he added , indicating the packages behind him . He had gone down to the law firm which still bore his name to dictate some correspondence , he told Hoye , and in a closet along with some other miscellaneous possessions had found these . " We live in memory and anticipation , " Gibbs said , putting the cane back together again . " The present is a kind of no man 's land . " " Can I have a sworn affidavit to that effect ? " Hoye had risen from his desk and put his hand on Gibbs 's shoulder . His way was to roar the meagerest jest into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpness with which his little eyes looked out from his full , red face , the failure of his smile , betrayed a poverty of conviction that there was anything here to jest at . If only Gibbs would swear to anything , by that alone he would in effect create a fact with which Hoye felt that he would be able to deal . Without facts , a man was lost . " You can have anything you want badly enough if you 're willing to pay for it . " Gibbs smiled . " Anything . I 'm convinced of that . "  | " You 've also got to know what you want , would n't you say ? " " That , too . " " And you , Ansel ? " " Know what I want ? I know what I have , that 's for certain  --  a future . A man with a future is how they describe me , my promoters . A man with a past , the opposition , and my promoters , too . Only they interpret it differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past so plush and easy as to isolate me from my peers . You take your pick . I ca n't . I have to take the whole thing , my entire past which I am the world 's foremost , if not unchallenged , authority on . " " The facts are on your side . I would n't worry . " " You 're a lawyer , Porter . Facts do n't take sides . But as far as the future 's concerned , I do n't worry anyway because  --  you'rea good old friend , I can speak to you with candor  --  because I 'm not altogether sure that I care vitally one way or the other . " " Dear God , Ansel ! That 's a terrible admission . Others care . I care . And the country , too , if I may say so . " " As a man grows old , he begins to lose his hair , his teeth , and his concern  --  for others , for the country , even for himself . He does n't get so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , but begins to flap along about ten feet off the ground . He sees what 's going on , mind you , but it does n't get in his way particularly . He becomes a kind of cumbersome bird . " " A dead duck if you ask me . To talk this way . . . "  | " Dying . " " God help us all , Ansel . What you need is a couple of good swigs from Rudy 's cane . " " To the best of my knowledge it 's been empty since about nineteen-twenty-nine . " " Has the Senate contacted you yet ? " " There was word at the office . I go down the first of next week . " " You need a rest . " " I 've had a rest , two years . What I need is lunch . " " Will you do me the honor ? " " No . " Gibbs ran his hand across the back of his head where the hair grew thick , thinning only on top . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbs had a young face tricked into middle age with little welts beneath the eyes , the firmly settled jaw : a slightly imperious , blunt-nosed face , but still zestful and aware . " I dropped in only long enough to depress you . I have other commissions . " " Do me a favor before you go ? " " Name it . " " Recite the seven-times table through twelve or so . " " You 're serious ? " " Yes . " Hoye stood at his office window , his hands in his pockets , the loop of his watch chain glinting across his vest , and waited for his friend to begin . For a moment it was as if Gibbs did not intend to do so . Crooking the cane over one arm and tucking his packages under the other , he walkedp56to the door and only then stopped and turned . Not the least tremor of a smile unsettled the intensity of his expression . " Seven times one is seven , " he said , " times two is fourteen , times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face each other throughout the recital , neither of them dropping his glance . From the harbor below came the whistle of a tugboat . " Do you want to know why I asked you to do that " Hoye inquired when Gibbs had finished . " No need to explain . One asks what one must . " " I thought I would find it comforting to hear you say something in specific , concrete terms again . I did . Thank you . " Poor Porter , " Gibbs said , smiling at last , his hand on the door . " I 'm glad . " Gibbs ate his lunch alone . From Wall Street he took a subway to Grand Central and from there walked along pavements lined on either side by gray drifts of city snow to an Italian restaurant where the sudden warmth after coming in out of the winter day , the sounds of eating , lulled him out of any desire to read the newspaper that he had brought with him . He propped it on the table before him anyway as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there and gave himself over completely to the sound of his surroundings , the chink of silver against china , of ice in glasses , a guffaw , a command to a waiter , the drone of someone counting four , five , six hundred shares or dollars or years . If any thought of past or future crossed his mind , it left no sign upon his face ; andp57eating his omelet and salad , drinking his milk , he sat there a fortress walled and moated , impervious to the occasional glances of recognition from men eating near by , to the solicitude of the waiter who had addressed him by name and hovered by his chair throughout the meal . Leaving when he had finished , he forgot his packages and cane so that the headwaiter in his tuxedo , black as a raven against the snow with his breath coming out in little puffs of mist , had to chase after him with them , handing them over like treasures , then standing for a moment beneath his own awning to watch his distinguished patron continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then walked north along it to the square in front of the Plaza , where several hansom cabs were drawn up at the curb , the horses blanketed , the drivers conferring together in their rusty top hats . Entering the park , he walked as far as the zoo and stopped there by the seal tank for a few minutes to watch the seals asleep on their concrete deck . He tapped the handle of Rudy 's cane sharply against the iron railing and roused one of them , who raised his head , flicked his silver whiskers , yawned . " Who are you ? " a small boy in a leather helmet asked at his elbow and remained there with his dusty face tipped up in inquiry as Gibbs moved on . At the top of the stairs leading back to the street , he stopped for a moment to shift his packages to the other arm , then continuedthe few remaining blocks to Louise von Louwe 's house . Walter , the butler , met him in the hall to say that Miss von Louwe and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm his appointment for thatp58afternoon . Gibbs asked him to bring the young man to the library upstairs when he came , and proceeded there himself . He sat down in the dusk of that room with its silence filtered in through the book-lined walls , through the voluminousrose damask that draped the French windows , looped full above them and falling in heavy folds to the carpet . Small and thus richly hung as it was , the furniture deep and soft , dark , an India shawl on the piano , a needlepointbellpull to cover the one strip of wall that would otherwise have been bare , it seemed less the Victorian blunder of a room that Louise von Louwe herself had called it , than a kind of darkly heroic tent , a king 's pavillion of silk and wool , hung with banners , muffled and dim . He sat there , Gibbs , with the pictures that he had brought unwrappedon his knees . Though some of them were relevant to his meeting with young Tripp , not all of them were . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white , her shoulders bare ; another of a group of men on the deck of a man-of-war , among them the President shielding his eyes from the sun and looking up into the sky , beside him Gibbs with his overcoat collar turned up ; Gibbs again , twenty-five years or so younger , and Rudy , standing in their bachelors ' gowns and mortarboards , all brindled by the shadows of spring leaves ; Louise sitting in the sand of a Long Island beach with her hair tied up in a bandana and a small child easily recognizable as Anne playing at her feet . Gibbs slowly studied these and more , slipping one behind the other , discovering , perhaps , that if you look atp59pictures of people long enough in a poor light , the faces seem almost to come alive , to smile , to open or close their mouths . Yet not all of them , for the pictures of people who have died seldom seem to move , have a way of in some fashion dying themselves . They go flat about the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming a kind of sameness so that Rudy and Corinne said almost the same thing through their likenesses now whereas in life they had been very different . Very long ago , they said , and very , very far away , or something like that ; for something seems to pass out of the faces of photographs of the dead just as occasionally it will pass out of the faces of the living : a capacity for encountering other faces , an immediacy of eye . This was no sad dream of Gibbs 's , however , for his absorption in the photographs themselves precluded dreaming , but if young Tripp or someone else had broken in upon him there and confronted him with it , he would have recognized the phenomenon as one which he had observed before . Lecturing once on King Saul , Kuykendall had touched upon it in his hearing . " We 're told , " he had said , " that the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul , ' and do n't think that Saul did n't know when it happened . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trouble  --  he was too handsome , too strong to escape it  --  but he 'd alwaysbefore been sustained by the spirit of the Lord , which , contrary to popular modern opinion , is n't some kind of pious deodorant , but the terrible vitality of the Creator Himself which lacerates as it sustains , and when it departed from him , he knew it , and so did everybody else.  |p60You  did n't have to be a Samuel to see it in his face in five seconds flat . Something had gone out of him that never returned , and he died one of the only two suicides in the entireOld Testament . " Gibbs laid the photographs on the floor by his chair and from the hallway downstairs heard the sound of voices . Heaven only knew what he expected to see when Robin Tripp , upon hearing an answer to his knock , first entered ; but for an instant he was simply stunned both by the boy 's resemblance to his father and by the dissimilarity between them , which was just sufficient to jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that age . He was almost as tall as Gibbs and slight of build , with a thin face , his head tilted a little to one side and leaning slightly forward in a kind of earnest , tentative lunge . His eyes were sharp , his hair was a deep red , and there was an air of vigor and boldness about him , yet a restraint , too , as he stopped at the door for a moment to accustom his eyes to the dim light before going to Gibbs , who had unaccountablynot come to him , to shake hands , saying : " Wonderfulto see you again , sir , " watching Gibbs come alive with : " Not since you were a little fellow . You 're so much like your father that when you first came in , if I believed in ghosts . . . . " " You 'd have handled the situation , " Tripp finished , " with no less than your usual aplomb . " " I hate to think of it as a situation . " Gibbs smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mockery in the young man 's face , found nothing but a kind of reckless ,  |p61admiring  expectation , an eagerness to push here , pry there , until he discovered a door that would open . " You 'll want me to explain why I got Anne to arrange this when , of course , I know all you 're involved in these few days . " " The past explains the present . I 'm sure I do n't know what else it 's good for . " Test , prove , try the boy , Gibbs thought , and see what door he himself might open in him , in Rudy 's son , whoever he was , Gibbs thought  --  gag-man and flirt , singer of songs , young Lochinvar  --  as he watched him there bright-eyed and crashingly rude perhaps , by his presence alone somehow pleading with him for something , willing to go to any lengths of effrontery even to get whateverthe young want of the old . " Whatever you 're after , there 's time enough for that , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're here . Sit down . " But Tripp did not , remained standing instead with what struck Gibbs for a moment as an almost lunatic smile , wide-mouthed , his teeth wet , white , as if at any instant he might burst into laughter ; but , after all then , only the helplesssmile of a boy that lingered on beyond its usefulness into his : " I suppose they 're all after something . " Gibbs , too , remained standing , his arms extended out along the mantlepiece again as if they suspended him there , his head sinking slightly toward his chest , his glance to the carpet , as the unlit tent of the room grew darker with the day . Never do battle with a man when you can enlist him , make use of his services , see the possibility of loyalty in him . But for what use , this Robin , of what capacity forp62loyalty the famous young Tripp , riding in upon him on the crest of his giddy wave ? " You 've made quite a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen you in action myself , but certainly Anne 's full of enthusiasm . I always wished your father might have gone into something of more or less the same sort himself . " " From what I remember , he would n't have been half bad at it , " Tripp said , and Gibbs thought that there was a look of something like indulgence in his eyes as if , though this was not the subject which he himself would have chosen , he was willing to go along with it for as long as Gibbs might choose . " Your father was without a question the most , " Gibbs paused for a word , shrugged slightly at the one he found , " charming person I have ever known . Do you remember him well ? " " Not really , " Tripp said . " Only glimpses . I was just a child when he died . " Gibbs was on the point of mentioning the photographs that he had brought but decided against it . " Yes , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark that it was only with difficulty that they were able to see one another clearly . He switched on a lamp which stood near the fireplace , and through its red shade the light shone warmly . " Look , I 'll be frank with you , " he said , something approaching frankness being made possible for him simply by the irrational leap of his heart at all the richness of the room restored again with the lighting of the lamp . " Morep63than your mother , I think , or anyone else , I 've questioned how much I was to blame for his dying as he did . Do n't for an instant think that because I 've had other matters on my mind since , I have n't thought about it again and again . And do n't think either that I have n't felt qualms about seeing you today . There 's a ghost here with us , and I 'm fully aware of it . I 'm being candid with you . " They were sitting side by side now , Gibbs gray-suited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glasses gleaming in the light , his expression all moderationand reason as in effect he presented his case to the young man , who to his clearer view looked less young , more solid , leaning comfortably back in his dark blue suit , his color the healthy pale of redheads . And this was the momentat which anything was possible , Gibbs thought , glancing hard at Tripp to see traces of whatever it might be , but without apparent anxiety , more resolutely , resignedly . He found himself looking forward to no matter what Tripp was to say or do , gripped by the mere potentialityof reaction because what the boy 's expression lacked in the kind of intensity from which some authentic response might spring , it more than made up for simply by its vitality . Even though Tripp 's eyes showed nothing so much as a faintly indolent curiosity as they met Gibbs 's , his face was somehow triumphantly alive , and Gibbs thrilled to the sight of it . " That was n't what I came to talk about , " Tripp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any objection to talking about it , but it was n't why I asked to see you . Oh , I know , " thep64young man continued , " there were hard feelings between my mother and you for a while . There was a time I used to hear plenty of it from her , and a couple of times Anne has gone on about it . But you know Anne . She 's crazy about soap-opera situations , and this one 's just too good for her to drop . If you want to know what I think ... " " Yes , " Gibbs said , leaning forward , " that 's what I want to know . " " Well , sir , I 'll tell you . " At just the point where Gibbs would have expected Tripp 's voice to become hushed , confidential , it rose in volume . IIe clapped his hand softly to his knee and spoke directly , a shade belligerently , to Gibbs but as though others , perhaps not so receptive , were listeningas well . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead wrinkling beneath a fallen red plume of hair , " and this is a part I could really sink my teeth into . You fire my father , and he shoots himself , and years later I arrive on the scene , his only son , to face you with it . I could tear around here like a bee in a jam pot , break a few windows and stand on my head . In fact , when the thing happened , as a kid , I did more or less that . An uncle of mine got to the house before the body was gone even  --  still lying in the back yard near a stand of croquet mallets  --  and I 'd loved my father , of course , anybody could have seen that , but having him dead all of a sudden was more exciting than anything , just plain exciting , and I had n't cried a drop till this uncle of mine put his fuzzy hands on my shoulders , I remember , and looked down at me with his eyes like sad caramels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy that hep65expected me to cry that naturally I decided that was what I was supposed to do  --  I 'd sensed there must be something  --  and I remember smothering my face against the prickly front of his overcoat just so he could n't see I was half faking , and then really letting myself go . But if you want to know , sir , I ca n't rise to the occasion again now , so do n't you worry . I 'm not a good enough actor to be able to pretendthe whole business has bothered me for years because it has n't  --  or that I blame you , I do n't . If that helps clear the deck . . . " " And Sylvia , your mother , what about her , do you think ? " Gibbs watched Tripp smile broadly at his question . " She hates thinking , you know . If you try to get her to , she usually wo n't listen . The last time I saw her , I gave her a long lecture about keeping her checkbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all she said was , Guess what I saw on the street today ? Two nuns and a hunchback . ' " Tripp laughed . " But if she ever does think about this the way I suppose she must sometimes , I have a feeling she blames herself now as much as anybody . She 's changed a lot since you saw her last . Married again , you know . " Gibbs nodded . He held one of his hands in the other , massaging the palm with his thumb . " And what about you ? Do you blame anybody ? " " He pulled the trigger himself . I was the last one to see him . I 'd woken up early that morning and was finishing a model airplane till it was time for breakfast , which was ap66little later than usual because it was a Sunday . He opened the door on his way downstairs and looked in on me for a minute , so I could have stopped him , asked him to help me or something . But I did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unique in my experience , " Gibbs said , rising to his feet and walking to the window , where he stopped for a few moments looking out into the winter evening , then turning to Tripp , who had remained where he was , his legs stretched out straight before him with his feet crossed and his hands in his pockets . " A crime is committed  --  call it a crime  --  and each of the prime suspects is inclined to believe that he himself is the guilty one . The evidence in each case is , to say the very least , inadequate . A lost job . I had to let him go , you understand . I could have done no differentlyif he 'd been my own son , and he knew that . A model airplane to be finished by breakfast . A woman who suffered to be beautiful . She had that mirror , you remember ? Queer , queer , " Gibbs continued , " how the facts themselves have such an innocence about them . The croquetmallets . . . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room on this particular day , himself speaking these words to this boy , his friend 's son , he thought , his own son and friend ; and looking at him , young-eyed , alive , he shudderedalmost with an instant of warmth . The innocence of events , he thought , following one upon the other like dumb beasts to the manger of this present instant ; and if in general the present was meaningless , a wilderness , ap67no man 's land , it was for the duration at least of this instantno longer so . " It must have been very hard for you , " Gibbs said . " I mean the shock of it , the shame . . . But you survived ? " " Maybe I was lucky it happened when I was too young to have a heart to break or a psyche to warp . Whatever 's supposed to get damaged . Yes . I 've survived . And I 've kept on being lucky , " Tripp said . " Enough after taxes to keep me in convertibles . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've wanted . . . " He cut in upon himself with a quick smile of something between complicity and apology , with his " Do n't get me wrong , not a lady-killer of anything , " but not before Gibbs perceived the image which it was as if the boy were trying to screen from him as he blew a mist of cigarette smoke out into the still air between them : the image of Tripp surrounded by ladies who would , of course , have found irresistible , as Gibbs thought of it , the soft jeer of his eyes , the reckless smile . If for the strange warmth of an instant 's recognition Gibbs had seen him almost as a son , he saw him suddenly now as in some sense a rival as well , although for what reason he could not have explained , and said only : " Anne told me you were lucky . " " That 's my girl . " A joke and not a joke but , smiling , Gibbs chose to take it as such . " By all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friends as your fathers were , " he said . " It 's true we eyed each other with a certain suspicion atp68first . It 's funny really that we ever met at all . Our paths were n't the likeliest ones to cross . " " I know almost nothing about your recent path , " Gibbs said . " Tell me about it . " For the first time he felt that it was the boy and not himselfwho stood in judgment , felt that the boy , too , was aware of it as he pulled himself straight in his seat , then gestured loosely with one hand , a kind of entreaty . " Oh , if what you want is my life story , " he began , pronouncing his last words with sonorously satiric emphasis , " you 'll be disappointed . The publicity people play it down because it 's such a blank . Iligh school . Then a year of boardingschoolbecause my mother wanted the ritziest she could find , of course , and one year was all she could afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years went off well enough . I got by , had some success writing songs for the spring musicals . Then , my senior year , the war started , and I had my own private Pearl Harbor . One by one everybody was being drafted or enlisting , so it was all just a series of farewell binges which japped me in the end . I do n't think I cracked a book or went to a lecture for three months , so just before the big showdown I signed up with the Army and took off . Most of my time I spent in an I.R.T.C. headquartersoutfit in the south , compiling morning reports and sending in monthly charts of the AWOL and VD rates to the Third Service Command in Baltimore . As far as I know , they never looked at one of them , and that 's just as well because I never knew beans about what I was doing anyway . But off-hours I played the piano at an officer'sp69club , and week-end passes were automatic as long as you got your work done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bored stiff most of the time , but at least I was n't being shot at . I would n't have minded a taste of it , but I figured you took what they gave you . And that was Tripp 's military career . " He had risen and walked away from Gibbs toward the piano , where , leaning with one elbow upon it , he continued : " Our shoulder patches were red , blue , and yellow ; red for the blood you never shed , they used to say . Blue for the ocean you never crossed . And yellow for the streak down your back . Joke . " I thought of going back and finishing college after I was discharged , but I got a job disc-jockeying in the wee hours for a small Chicago station instead . I started talking a little to myself in between records , as much to keep awake as anything , and singing some of my own stuff , more or less made up as I went along . And God help me , it took . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . " He rapped the piano slowly with his knuckles as he spoke . " I got an offer in New York . Eventually worked into a fancier kind of show  --  less singing , more talking and interviewing . And there you have it . There ! " he finished , giving the piano a final rap and sitting down on the stool . " Which brings me , " he began again , looking up at Gibbs , " to why I came . I have a favor to ask , sir . " " Whatever you want , " Gibbs smiled at him . He stood there at the window where he had remained throughout Tripp 's account , with his hands in his pockets , his shadow broken against the damask behind him , and , gazing at thep70boy seated before him , smiled and heard himself say that he could have whatever he wanted . " The head of John the Baptist , " he added . " Half of my kingdom . But while you 're there , do me a favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , no . " Tripp said with a laugh . " I did n't come to waste your whole afternoon . " Gibbs brushed away his objection with such finality that , protesting no further , Tripp swung around to the keyboard and began to play . Whatever it was , Gibbs hardly listened at first , attending Tripp himself rather than his playing . The young man sat with his head tilted back , his eyes ceilingward , and something like jubilance in his smile as if he dreamed of music too absurd for his fingers ever to convey . Yet for all his air of self-assurance , Gibbs was instead suddenly struck by something unprotectedand alone about him . There was something in the tilt of his shoulders , in the slightly hesitant lilt of his playingas it incongruously filled that dim room , that aroused in Gibbs a feeling whose immediate and unthinking translationwas to stand close behind him with his hands on his shoulders and quietly , more than half to himself , to say , as in another instant he wished unsaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point when Tripp , whether he had heard or not , began to sing some song of his own peculiar extemporizing , his voice soft and clarion , shaping words that fell like water through the air of that room as dark as the wool of tents . It was a song about birds flying through snow and wishing for spring , as nearly as Gibbs could tell ; for he heard only dis/connected phrases of it , distracted by standing there with his hands on the boy 's shoulders when he yearned to removethem , yet felt that , in conscience , he somehow could not . Ile became oddly , rather dazedly , preoccupied with what individual words he did hear  --  wings , snow , leaves , sky  --  and weighed them lawyer-like , stiff and a little embarrassed , until all at once something within him seemed to fall under their weight , and he came aware of a sharpening of his senses , especially of his sight , so that everything appeared with a splendor of detail that he had not known before : the crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harp of the piano , the glint of lamplight on the books that lined the walls , even , or so it seemed , the separate hairs that grew in whorls at the crown of the boy 's head . For the first time , the room seemed endowed with a life and significance of its own , the moment with content , and once the song came to an end , Gibbs expressed his delight in it with what must have appeared to Tripp an excessive warmth , told the young man that it had carried him back , carried him back , yet not so much back to the past , had he stopped to reflect , as to the present which he had of late neglected . " I unearthed some relics I thought you might be interested in , " he said , handing over at last the photographs and cane , but instead of commenting upon them he said only : " They were your father 's or of your father , " and let it go at that . And only then had Tripp asked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the week ? Tripp knew , he said , that it was ex/tremely short notice and that this was an extremely busy time for him , but Senator Farwell was scheduled for an interview then , and it would be an excellent opportunity for them to air their differences on neutral ground , freed of any necessity to discuss political matters exclusively . What was more , he added , smiling , it would be an unquestionablecoup for him personally to be able to secure Gibbs 's services at all when Gibbs had already made it clear to the press that his intention was not to make any public appearance whatever until such time as the Senate might confirm his appointment . If he felt simply that he must maintain that position , Tripp insisted that he must for no reason feel in any sense obligated for his sake to abandon it . And yet it was , of course , no less than this that the boy asked , Gibbs knew , and for what reason indeed should he act against his own disinclination , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare himself while yet he could , not to complicate matters any further by declaring himself on issues that might provide those who opposed him with more material for doing so . And what sort of interview did the boy have in mind ? Would Tripp play the piano , his hair aflame and his strong teeth bared in laughter , while Gibbs and the Senator lumbered about like bears at a baiting ? He had never met Farwell  --  by his pictures a short , stout man with a face like a wedge  --  nor could he guess from his knowledge of him what issues other than political they might find to discuss ; but in terms of the instant 's wild imagining the possibilitiesp73were limitless , and Who Killed Rudy Tripp might just as well be one of them except that even as he paused there about to reply to the boy 's request , he realized that if that death had involved guilt on anyone 's part , he had himself been absolved of it and by the very one who might most justly have accused him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unruining . " Well , and why not ? " Gibbs said , reaching out to shake Tripp 's hand . " Favor granted . Case closed . "  |p74ANNE  HAD returned home while Tripp was still upstairs in the library with her father , but she had gone directly to her room so as not to see him when he left , or so that , if a meetingbetween them was to take place , it would be up to Tripp to arrange it . She had been standing in front of a mirror brushing her hair when she heard him in the hall saying good-by to Gibbs and had continued to listen then as his footsteps had passed by her closed door and down the stairs . But she did not stop brushing her hair , felt the tiny crackle of electricity in it and watched it rise in wisps to the stroke of her brush as she regarded her reflection , careful only not to meet her own glance . The mirror was a full-length one , so framed that it could be adjusted to any angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back now with the result that she saw herself pitched perilously backward and about to fall over with a crash into the crazilyleaning room behind her , yet all the time calmly brushingher hair , wishing herself less height , more bosom , and feature by feature appraising her face . The eyes would getp75by was the best she could say , and , hating her nose , too long , too pointed , she puckered her mouth into the shape of whistling so that she would look less like herself and could think of other things as she finished her brushing . This she abruptly did , tapping the mirror once more , forward this time , so that all it showed were her legs and feet , the low heels of her shoes together and her toes awkwardlyfar apart , she thought , on the flowered carpet . She threw her hairbrush into an armchair then and lay down on her bed , where she stared at the ceiling for a few moments . To close her eyes as then she did was not simply to shut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to enter another not half so well ordered , where her barely waking dream little by little took on something like substance until , as if with her eyes open , she seemed actually to see Tripp come into her room and stand by her bed without for a long time saying a word but merely looking down at her , his face impassive , until finally she asked him what had happened in his meeting with her father , and he answered that he had killed him , or that he had told him that he loved her , or that they had exchanged no words at all , but had simply sat together in silence . She showed him with her face and mind , which in her dreaming were all one , that she knew that he was lying , whereupon , smiling , he lay down beside her there and whispered softly to her words that she could not hear . In her half-dream he lay at her side like a lover , but hard as she tried , she could not dream the content of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ,  |p76though  warm as breath at her ear , and then , as so often happened just as she was on the point itself of sleep , it was as if she suddenly stumbled or tripped over something so that , lying there , she seemed actually to feel her whole body jolted and came totally awake to find , of course , no Tripp , no words . And then the world of waking flooded in upon her  --  " My toes begin to twitch , " she had described it once to Aunt Louise  --  and she opened her eyes to her empty room , both familiar yet for an instant foreign , still cluttered with her childhood : the little glass and china horses arranged on the bureau around a silver cup she had won for riding , the photograph of her mother in cloche hat and furs among pigeons in the Piazza San Marco , pinned to one curtain an advertisement which she had cut from a magazine showing Tripp in tennis shorts with a towel around his tanned neck lighting a cigarette whose brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the impossible blue sky behind him . He was looking up over his hands cupped around the match , his brow wrinkled , his glance inquiring , and she had said : " You want to be careful of that face of yours , you know . It 's not good to have it looked at so much  --  TV , magazines , ads , and everything . All those eyes staring at it all the time will start leaving their mark on it , especially love-starved femaleeyes , because eyes are hot and they 'll start melting it if you do n't watch out . " Except that Tripp had so many faces , she had concluded , that she supposed he could afford to lose a number of them . " Your street face , " she hadp77begun to enumerate , " your cocktail face , your publicity face , your girl face . . . " to which he had responded , smiling , by asking her which one he was wearing at the moment as they had stood on a windy corner waiting for a taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , and it was left for him to reply with " My Annie face , of course . " And with which , she wondered , rising from her bed and about to go downstairs , had he confrontedher father that afternoon ? Dr. Kuykendall was expected for dinner , and she found her father and Aunt Louise waiting for him in the livingroom . Newly emerged from a hot shower , Gibbs was still flushed from it as he rose to greet his daughter , kissing her , and seating her on the sofa beside him , while Louise von Louwe acknowledged her entrance by simply glancing up for a moment from her needlepoint . " I do n't know how your spiritual mentor feels about drinking , " she said , pulling a crimson thread through the petal of a rose , " so perhaps you 'd better have one quickly now before he comes . Your father , " she continued , indicatingGibbs with her needle , " is in a state of elation . At fifty-two , he has decided to enter the entertainment field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me has all the fascination of an ax murder . " Gibbs answered Louise von Louwe with a single loud laugh , speaking to Anne instead . " I met your young friend this afternoon , Annie , and we had a delightful chat . Delightful , " he added , patting Anne 's knee , " and ... "  | " . . . he refuses to make the least comment on it , " Louise interrupted . " Such delight is obviously not to be shared with clods . " " I stupidly neglected to have a stenographer present to take it all down , " Gibbs said . " I wish you 'd stop talking to each other through me . " Anne took her glass from the tray that Walter passed her . " It makes me feel like a telephone . And what 's this about entering the entertainment field ? " " I consented , " Gibbs said , " to allow Robin Tripp to interview me , together with a member of the United States Senate , on his program day after tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment , to the savage rhythms of a guitar . " " I see , " Louise von Louwe said , for the first time addressinghim directly as she thrust her embroidery frame to one side , " what I see . That is all . " " And that 's why he wanted to talk to you ? " Anne asked . " Principally , yes . I suppose it was . " " What do you think of him ? " Imagining she had heard the doorbell ring and that it was Dr. Kuykendall arriving , Anne asked the question abruptly , almost fiercely , in order to have it answered before the old man came in . Deciding then that it had not been the doorbell at all , she asked it more easily again . " Did you get along together ? How did he look to you ? " " What she wants to know , " said Louise von Louwe , " is did he talk to you about her . " " What you want to know . She , " Anne continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who wants to make a romance of this thing . " " I do n't want as much as that , you know . " Louise von Louwe raised her glass , stopping Gibbs before he had a chance to speak . " Pros it , both of you , " she said . " This is such a comfortable time , the hour before eating . Do n't let me spoil it just because sometimes I get a macabre impulse to spoil the very nicest things . Exorcize me . All I want is a little clarification . Do n't think I 'm not charmed by the boy myself . It 's his metier , after all , and I am . Just tell me  --  or do n't if you do n't want to , of course , or ca n't  --  why he 's been glittering so brightly in this house for the last four months or so if all he 's wanted was to get you on his program , Ansel . If he did n't get around to saying something this afternoon about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? " Looking at her , large and immobile in her purple dress with a string of amber beads at her bosom , Anne felt her annoyance slip out from under her and asked her question out of nothing but purest curiosity . " Oh , words , words , " Louise von Louwe answered with a little wave of her hand . " In this case it would n't much matter which ones . Anything on the subject would satisfy me . " Dear ladies , " Gibbs said . " Now you 've succeeded in making me feel like a telephone . Robin Tripp came to me for a purpose , and the purpose was not to ask for my daughter 's hand in marriage , if that 's what you want to know . " The failure of either of them to respond to thisp80seemed to suggest to him that it was perhaps precisely what they did want to know , and he continued quickly , lowering the glass from his lips before he had so much as sipped from it . " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made of it . In fact I 'm pleased to report the conversation really did n't involve any issues at all , you know , except this one simple request I 've mentioned . There was nothing tense about it . He even sang one of his songs for me . Damn it , " Gibbs said , clapping one fist softly into the palm of his other hand , " the boy really has a way with him . There 's no getting around that . " " IIe most certainly does , " said Louise von Louwe . " Have a way with him . On that we 're each in our own peculiar ways agreed . The question , " she went on , leaning forward to pick from a silver dish a single peanut which she then held out before her for the scrutiny of a few seconds before placing it on her tongue like a pill , " is not so much what that way is , but for what end does he plan to use it . I for one ca n't escape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family I speak openly . If I 'm irritating either of you , tell me . " " In any relationship between two human beings , each is always after something , " Gibbs said . " In a general sense , I mean , and more often than not in a specific sense , too . Specifically , young Tripp wanted me to say yes , I would go on the air with him . He was frank about it . He said it would add to his prestige , and I 'm sure it will . But you 're unquestionably right , Louise , that he 's after something in a general sense , too . I 'm certain he is . Only who in God'sp81name is to say what ? I doubt whether Tripp could say him-self . " " He 's right , you know , " Anne added to her cousin . " You 're asking these questions about Tripp because you 're after an answer , but I 'm sure you 're after something else , too . " " Such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassurance through your reacting to me at all that I really do exist in space and time ? " " I never know what you 're after , " Anne said . " Or what anybody is , I sometimes think . " " Look then , " Louise von Louwe said , rising from her chair and walking toward the door to greet Dr. Kuykendall , who had not yet appeared , but whose voice she had heard in the hall , " let me register just one thing with you , and that will be an end to it . Dumb animals and certain middle-aged celibates have a way of smelling danger or thinking they do , and young Tripp is so fragrant with it that it reaches me even over a television set . Beware the barefoot boy in the Brooks Brothers suit . Both of you . Also sprach von Louwe . " Setting her drink down on a table , she disappeared into the hall . Gibbs raised his head and laughed , looking at his daughter . " Are you scared , Annie ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only meeting Gibbs 's glance , her face slightly flushed , Louise von Louwe re-entered with her guest . At the age of seventy , Dr. Henry Kuykendall seemed at first glance to be a considerably older man than that , withp82his hair thin and white , his shoulder stooped . His nose and chin jutted large and bony , and the stare of his eyes was wild and wondering until , when he smiled , he lowered them with an air of absurd bashfulness . But if the first impression he gave was that of an old man , it became apparentat closer range that the flesh of his face was firm and relatively unlined and that behind the awkward abruptnessof his gestures there lay great energy . He was dressed in dark gray with a clerical collar . " I do n't believe , sir , " said Gibbs , advancing to shake his hand , " that there 's anyone in this country I 'd rather see right now than you . " " Especially , " Louise von Louwe added , " at this particularmoment . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We meet in the fullness of time , " Dr. Kuykendall said . He held Gibbs by the arm as he spoke . " Of your time , Ansel , " he continued . " I have no intention of making a speech , but . . . Let me have one of those , if I may , " he pointed to Anne 's glass . She poured him one , and raising it toward Gibbs , he said , " Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee ; and before thou tamest out of the womb I sanctified thee , and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations . ' I drink to you , Ansel . To your name . You remember what Israel felt about names . " In his days of teaching Old Testament at Harvard , beforebeing ordained at the age of fifty and taking on a parish , this had been one of Kuykendall 's recurring themes , one which he touched upon again and again as he flailed and postured his way through the Pentateuch , thep83historical books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are you ? " he would ask , suddenly stopping in his erratic progress down the aisle of the large lecture hall and grabbinghold of some seated undergraduate by the shoulders . " Just a lump of flesh , a blob , a thing , until I find out . . . your name . Your name ! " And he would raise his arms as if in the wonder of discovery . " Of course . Now I know who you are . You are . . . " and he would pause , perilously poised on the very brink of the ludicrous , " Harry ! " his face wonderfully brightening , " or Peter or John . Israel understood that a person is his name . You do n't know him until you know it . And then one day Moses asked the Lord 's name , and the Lord said , I am . . . Jahweh . ' So at last Israel knew the name of her God . " " I do n't know what Israel felt about anything , " Louise von Louwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toast . To you , Ansel , " she raised her glass , " and to whatever lies ahead for you , for all of us . Always make friends with the inevitablewhile you still can . " Anne , who had risen at Dr. Kuykendall 's entrance , lifted her glass , too , and together all three of them drank to Gibbs , who stood there before them , smiling , his arms hanging straight at his sides as if at attention . A little snow mixed with sleet rattled against the windowpanes , and Anne looked for a moment to see what it was , made only the slightest turn of her head , her glass still raised to her lips , and yet at the very instant of discovering the source of the noise  --  it was only snow , she saw , not a human hand , bird 's wing , or ghost  --  she decided , and thep84decision took no more than the instant , that she would not see Tripp again . So , taking another sip from her glass , she drank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the center of the living-room , sitting down on the couch next to one of them , but all the while in that state of strange remoteness which follows upon decision , scarcely noticing where and with whom she was , not hearing whateverGibbs banteringly said to deflect attention from himself . It was , of course , the only thing to do , she thought : not to see him again . The only thing . Of all the other things of her life  --  the people ; her job with Kuykendall ; the impression , whatever it was , that she gave to the world ; even the objects of that world ; her room , its pictures , the clothes in her closet  --  of all of these , her knowing that she would not now see Tripp again was the only thing which for the moment seemed of real substance to her , and it flickered in her mind like a solitary candle . She wondered , but still remotely , dispassionately , barely hearing the queer , tense gurgle of Kuykendall 's laugh as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it would be like not to see Tripp again , however exactly she was to manage it  --  no melodramatic scene , she thought , but simply an unanswerable indifference . It would be , of course , to lose him ; to lose perhaps worst of all just her excitement , her unending amazement , at being pursued by a young man whose fame after all rivaled in its own way even her father 's . For certainly , she knew , she had loved that fame , had loved more than that perhaps , but certainlythat , too , possibly that above all : the famed imagep85of Tripp whether in black and white on the studio 's monitor or in the colored warmth of flesh sitting beside her in a restaurant , wearing his famous face , his public face , or dancing with her at a night club where he was sure to be recognized , and she with him . When , as had occasionally happened , news of their having been seen together at one place or another reached the gossip column of some paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , like the cigarette advertisement , to her curtain or slipped it under the glass of her dresser top , but treasured it away between the pages of an old copy of Vogue which she kept on the table by her bed , its covers stained here and there with the shape of her mouth where she had used it to blot her lipstick . " Your lips are marked on everything in this house . There seems to be nothing you have n't kissed , " Aunt Louise had said , momentarily giving the girl a wonderful sense of being the profligate , the scarlet woman of that placid house . Dr. Kuykendall was answering a question of Gibbs 's about conditions in East Harlem ; and she would not see Tripp again , she continued to think , turning it this way and that , smiling vaguely at her father , and why , she wondered , not as a way of undermining her decision but rather , simply , to sanctify it with a motive . She would not see him again because not even in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only once , the autumn before , he had ; because his motives in seeing her father that afternoonhad unforgivably and in no sense involved her ; more than for any other reason , perhaps , because in turn/ing to identify the noise at the window , she had for a wild moment thought that it might be Tripp come back , Tripp standing outside in the snow trying to attract her attention , to say all that for so long he had not said . At the sound suddenly of her own name , not from the window , but from Kuykendall sitting beside her on the couch , she was drawn again into the conversation . " There are moments when I wonder , " he had been saying , " what side Anne and I are on . There they are , " he continued , mainly to Gibbs , " my flock . I hate exaggerating the poverty and suffering of their lives . Sometimes I find myself almost boasting of it , whereas it is certainly true there have been improvements in the last few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . But the horror of it is still indescribable . Indescribable , " he repeated , louder than before , his hands taut . " Their situationoften seems so hopeless that I ca n't avoid the suspicion that for some terrible reason God has marked them out for damnation and that in trying to better their lot in one inane way or another , it 's God we 're working against , not for . Try that on for size . " Not merely his voice but his whole presence  --  his stare intense , his shoulders hunched like the folded wings of some ungainly bird  --  confronted them in such a way that the little silence following his words seemed strained with the sense in all of them that there must be some way other than merely conversational for dealing with what he had said . It was Louise von Louwe who first acknowledged defeat by speaking.  | " In the circles you move in , you could be burned at the stake , could n't you , for thoughts like that ? " " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden smile of beaming shyness releasing ng them from any obligation more onerous than to smile with him . " I believe by now I 'm no longer flammable . " " We all burn , " Anne said , with such conviction after her long silence that she drew to herself the attention she would have preferred to avoid . " Surely not you , Anne , " Kuykendall said . " I could hardly get on without her , you know , Ansel . And I have no intention either of letting her slip through my fingers as I did you a number of years back . Though thank heaven I did , of course , " he added . " It would have been a grave mistake for you to have entered the clergy . " " Imagine our Ansel a priest ! " Louise von Louwe laughed . " Oh , but do n't misunderstand me , " Kuykendall interruptedher . " He would have been absolutely first-rate at it , the kind of a priest I think God dreams of . A man who profoundly knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoicing in Heaven , you can be sure of that . " " Then why on earth did you spoil their fun by discouraginghim from the idea ? " Louise asked . " Because I saw him called to be a prophet instead . It embarrasses everybody for me to speak this way , but old men can be gauche with impunity . " " I 'm not in the least embarrassed , " she said.  | " Well , I am , " Gibbs said , " enough for us both . I like to think there 's a kind of endearing nobility in a man 's knowing his own limitations , and I know I 'm no prophet . Not that I 'm any the less grateful to you , sir , for your generous thoughts . " " I have n't expressed myself properly , " Kuykendall said . " Help me out , Anne . I said I believe you were called to be a prophet , and from Moses on down the tendency for everyone so called has been to try to squirm out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence or they were too young , or asked for how long their services would be required . Now you say you know your limitations . That 's just what you do n't know . No man does . " " Exactly what is a prophet supposed to do ? " Louise von Louwe asked , continuing her needlepoint . " It 's a matter I 've never been clear on . " " To ask the painful question , " Kuykendall said , " and make the painful point . To hit below the belt if that 's where the blow will do the most good . More than anything else , a prophet 's supposed to know , profoundly know , the times he lives in and to speak what seems to him the truth about them in the most compelling way he can find , no holds barred . " " Even the way of television ? " Louise von Louwe asked . Kuykendall 's momentary bewilderment at this was brought to an end by Anne , who with sudden animation explained how her father had agreed to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents.  | " Farwell ? " Kuykendall expressed his pleasure by half rising from his seat at the news , sinking back into it only at a confirming nod from Gibbs . " More rejoicing in Heaven ! Leave it to the genius of that boy to get the two of you together . " " Like trained seals , " said Louise von Louwe . ' " Every man has his hobbies , " Gibbs said , " and for a long time one of mine has been not meeting the Senator , but at this particular juncture it struck me that it might be an entertaining idea . " " Oh , and a great deal more than that . " As if somewhat taken aback by his own overexcitement , Kuykendall continuedmore moderately . " This seems to be my night for making speeches , but where else , I ask you , could you find embodied in one man more of the very principles that the appointment of someone like you constitutes such an earthquake for ? " " One of those cocky little mid-westerner men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , and have faces set like traps . " Louise von Louwe made tiny little jabs in the air with her needle as she spoke . " Watch out for him , Ansel . " " I 'd watch out in general if I were you , " Anne said . " Tripp loves him , and he might take his side . He says he 's completely unspoiled . " " And he 's right , " Kuykendall said . " A hundred years of painful human progress have left him unspoiled . " " You 're unfair to him , I think , " Gibbs said . Alone among them , his voice did not quicken and slow down atp90the straightaways and turns of conversation , but continuedat an even pace . " I admire him for remaining totally himself . He could have let them make a demagogue of him . Potentially , he has the appeal , you know . But he did n't . He just travels his own road , casting his vote on all issues with relentless consistency and invariably getting re-elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Anne said . " You always know where you stand with them . " " They 're usually not worth standing with , " said Louise von Louwe . " If you know how a book turns out , after all , why bother to read it ? " " What interests me , " Gibbs said , " is why exactly he should go so far out of his way to oppose this appointment . Especially when it 's so highly unlikely that he can in any way thwart it or benefit himself by trying to . " " You do n't have to be a prophet to answer that , " Kuykendall said , getting to his feet . " He opposes you becausehe distrusts you . Politically , of course , but more than that  --  basically , humanly distrusts you . And why ? " Kuykendall in effect acted out the reply to his own question , half crouching there before his former student , pointingan accusing finger at him , drawing his face up into the parody of a snarl . " Because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alleghenies and learned a lot of ten-dollar words there and how to use them . Because you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth and never had to work to get where you are now , but had it all handed to you on a platter of the same silver as the spoon . Becausep91you 've spent all-told probably ten years or more outside the continental limits of this great nation , not only losing touch with things back here , but picking up a lot of tricky foreign ideas in the bargain , especially a lot of tricky English ideas . The bellowing watchdogs of this country are always on guard against the likes of you . " Kuykendall had spoken with such rapidity that , as he paused , he had to take a deep breath , standing straight again , his expression beginning to relax , but still bearing traces of the role he played . " You 're much more charitable toward him than I can find it in my heart to be , " he continued . " You admire him for always being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed for . For God 's sweet sake , Ansel , be the voice that cries out against the prejudice , the self-interest , the narrowness and complacency of these Farwells . " " And yet , you know , " Gibbs said , and it was by contrastlike the idling hum of an engine , " he may well be all you say and still not absolutely wrong to distrust me . And his reasons , if you 're right about them , are n't one hundred per cent invalid either , after all . He may be a caricature , an overstatement , of what this country is , but I venture to say that he still more accurately represents the essence of it than I do . Rising politically in it step by step , he 's become an integral part of it . Whereas , on the other hand , I , " and he raised his chin at the pronoun , paused at it with a kind of strange , loose majesty , " I remain on the outer edge of things . I populate the coasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion or necessity to know thep92homely , inner details . If my views are apt to be liberal and disinterested , it may be simply that compared to Farwell I 'm at heart uninterested . This country is all he has , he sees its fortunes as his fortunes , and his narrowness is n't too gross an exaggeration of its narrowness . But I am a man of the world . I do n't belong any one place in particular . I do n't have anything in particular to lose . I suspect such men may be quite rightly not trusted . " " Well , go to , now , go to , " Kuykendall smiled as he sat down on the couch once more . " I wo n't bore the ladies by continuing this debate . I should add that what I 've said is my own and not necessarily the word of the Lord . But when you see Tripp next , Anne , do congratulate him for me , will youP For arranging this televised encounter , because , whatever your father says now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . Commend the boy for me . Rudy would be proud of him . " To which Anne murmured something , glancing sidelong at Louise von Louwe as if she might give evidence of somehow knowing that an honest response to the request would involve saying that her plan was not to see Tripp again at all and that Dr. Kuykendall would have to deliver his own congratulations . But Louise von Louwe 's attention was engaged elsewhere . She loved the idea of having serious male conversation going on under her roof and encouraged Gibbs and Kuykendall to continue theirs now by indicating to Walter , who had appeared in the doorway with his confidential smile to announce dinner , that they would be somewhat late , and by asking Gibbsp93some further question about Farwell , to which Anne did not listen . Unlike her cousin , she took less pleasure in hearing conversation than in simply watching people converse , observing the expressions of their hands and faces , letting her imagination play over their pasts , the divisions of their lives unknown to her . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seldom satisfactorily part of any group she found herself in , and this was a fault for which Louise von Louwe was particularly likely to criticize her . " You ca n't just sit there , " she had frequently said , " with that dazed , intent expression you get , as if you were having a vision , not paying attention to what anybody says , no matter how much you say you enjoy it . A girl ca n't get away with just having a good time . She must give a good time . " But whereas Louise ascribed this lapse on her young cousin 's part to her being indifferent to , incurious about , people , actually no one was less so . What visions Anne had at such times concerned only the people whom she was with . At the mention of Rudy , she tried now to picture him , her father , and Kuykendall , as they had been thirty-odd years ago , in the days of their first knowing each other . In an old trunk of Louise von Louwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash or bandeau , which smelled metallic and bitter , but at the same time fragrant with a remnant of old perfume , and this for Anne had become so much the smell of that era , the twenties , that she envisionedher father and his friends as having breathed air then of just this composition : silvery , tarnished , bitter asp94metal , and dimly sweet . You read so much about those days , she thought . As thick as falling leaves , there were photographs just beginning to go brown with age to attest to the reality of them : the Norfolk jackets , knickerbockers , knee-length waists , and huge fur coats . And there were the mah-jongg sets in the attics ; some of the dances and songs preserved or revived , and a few of the movies and novels , although , when you stopped to consider , surprisingly few . But how seldom , Anne thought , did the survivors themselves reminisce about that era . That was the oddest thing of all , she found , quite as if it were all only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of the century 's teens and its thirties , the war and the depression , but rarely of the years between . Even Louise von Louwe , of usually voluble memory , was curiouslylaconic on the subject ; and Gibbs , when he mentionedthem at all , for the most part mentioned only those of his activities which had not been peculiar to them . Well , and perhaps life had not been very different then , Anne thought , looking at the three of them sitting there . Yet she felt that it had been . Their very reticence on the subject , after all , suggested that it had , and then once in a great while even they admitted it . Gibbs himself had once remarked that the mental age of the century seemed always to have approximated its last two digits and that in the nineteen-twenties everybody was more less twenty . " God forbid , " he had said , " and with a deplorable sense of conse-quences . " " I remember , I remember perfectly well , " Louise vonp9595Louwe 's words had dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , " how every single morning when I woke up , I had exactly the same thought , which was how was I going to have fun that day . Fun . Fun . Of course , I still wake up with exactly the same thought , but nowadays all the un-fun in the world gets you by the throat just about the time you start brushing your teeth . " And there seemed to be an air of confraternity among them , these survivors . It included even Kuykendall , Anne thought , althoughthen as now he had surely belonged to a different world from that of Gibbs and Louise . It was as if they had all attended the same fantastic school where no one ever thought to formulate a curriculum , grades were given on the basis of savoir faire and charm , the endowment was all squandered on extracurricular activities , and the headmasterlost his mind and shot himself to the tune , whinniedthrough a saxophone , of " Jada , Jada  --  Jada , Jada Jing , Jing , Jing . " In rooms there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world outside , and as Gibbs and Kuykendall talked  --  Louise von Louwe prodding them forward with an occasional question , Anne sinking back into the cinnamon-coloredcushions of the couch  --  there was a sunset : the warm air gathering somehow to a brilliance and a lull that flushed their faces and made the sound of their voices seem by contrast cool and brittle . Though winter night outside , the day was just ending here , and by its last , queer light Anne believed that she could at last see them as once they had been : in some fashion younger than shep96felt that she herself had ever been . There was Rudy , Tripp 's father , whom she knew only through photographs , with something about him that begged to be ruined , as Louise von Louwe had said the night before , swimming and dancing his way through the silvery hours . Her own father , having given up his momentary enthusiasm for the ministry , and already aiming himself like a rifle for law school and beyond , was still getting up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Aunt Louise , for she had known Gibbs before even Corinne , later his wife , had , and it was she who had originally introduced them . Anne found it almost impossible to imagine Aunt Louise herself in those days although she had seen photographs of her as a plump young woman with dark bangs covering her forehead , a puffy mouth , and long , helpless-looking arms . Only her shrewd eyes seemed not to have changed . Looking out belligerently from these likenesses of her flapper days , they seemed to say : " Perhaps we are low-comedy now , but just wait until we have come into our own in thirty years or so . " Kuykendallalone , Anne guessed , had already come into his own then . She had known him for most of her life as an old friend and occasional visitor of her father 's , and what had almost more than anything else decided her , upon graduatingfrom college , to go to work for him in East Harlem , had been her sense that he was a man who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , he 's insane , " Aunt Louise had said at the time , and to the degree to which this might be true , Anne was certain that it had beenp97equally so always . In 1920 , he was unquestionably as racked as he was now by , on the one hand , his fierce , disheveled commitment to a God who acted in and spoke through history , and , on the other , by his horror at the ambiguities and distortions of that history . When they finally went in to dinner , for Louise von Louwe was unable to postpone it indefinitely as she would have liked , Anne was drawn back into the conversation again by Dr. Kuykendall , who asked her if she had told her father about her first days of working in his parish , especially about her coup with Lillian . Gibbs denied ever having heard anything about it at all and sent across the candles to his daughter a glance which with a kind of blurred sympathy excused her in advance for any attempt that she might make not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood seemed to be all evening , and then changed to a look of interested surprise when , on the contrary , she began with obvious relish to tell it . The story itself was simple enough . Lillian , the reigning Negro prostitute of the block where the parish office was situated , during one of her periodic seizures of remorse came in one morning to see if any of the parish staff could help her find a job as a maid . Anne , having no idea who she was , took on her case , wrote her a letter of unqualified recommendation which she said would have brought tears to anyone 's eyes by its eloquent praise of Lillian 's character and aptitude , with the result that Lillian got an excellent job and had it to this day . It would have been impossible to say that Anne described the event with anyp98particular wit or felicity of language , but she showed throughout such a rich if never quite resolved sense of the comedy of the situation in so far as it involved her own naivete ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rave on about her troubles with her eyes bugged out and rolling from side to side with misery until without a single bit of warning there 'd be one of those uncontrollablesneezes of laughter that scrunched up her whole face and showed her pink gums so that you just knew that really , in her heart , she took the whole thing as a great , wild joke " ; above all , she , Anne , looked so young sitting there by the light of the candles with her fair hair bright against her gray flannel dress , speaking her piece as she had been bidden , that Gibbs , in good spirits already , gave out his single , explosive " Hah ! " of delight when she had finished . " Well , Louise , " he said , turning toward her , his face florid and composed . " This family is getting back on its feet at last . My daughter runs a placement bureau for bawds . I do a comic turn on television . All that remains is for you to start distilling red-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clover . " " With myself selling sham Bibles to Sunday-school children to help out if the going gets rough , " Kuykendall added , at which Anne burst into laughter just as Walter came in to remove the soup plates . In face of such a festive turn to the evening , it was left for Louise von Louwe to become the silent one . She managed a smile at the outset of their laughter , but for thep99most part sat there solid and immovable at the head of the table in her purple and amber , the fingers of her left hand working obscurely with the edge of the lace tablecloth as she dismembered her duckling bigarade . She was a gray , full-bosomed witch in the dim cave of her foreboding , and let them laugh while they might , her entire presence seemed to say : Gibbs with a fight on his hands , under the spell of a boy who had reason to blame him for his father 's death ; Anne , Anne , although perhaps not yet fully aware of it , in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for what appeared to be some curious end of his own . Louise von Louwe spoke no word of this , only continuing to eat , saying each time the conversation happened to turn her way something just short of what was required . But had she spoken her mind , Gibbs might well have admitted that for all his good humor , his odd sense of release , there was some seed of apprehension in him , too . Anne might well have recognized an instant 's wild ache at the recollection that her decision was never to see Tripp again.  |p100TRIPP  's program took place at ten o'clock in the evening on Friday , but Ansel Gibbs arrived at the studio a full hour in advance , as Tripp had suggested . In that way , the young man had explained , there would be time to answer any questions that Mr. Gibbs might have , show him around the studio , brief him on what few technical details it would be well for him to know , and put on his make-up . Gibbs balked at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of panchromatic powder to correct the dark effect of his beard and a light pancake make-up to tone down his slight baldness in front , Gibbs humorouslybut firmly declined to submit to it , with the result that he appeared on the screen far older and less vigorous than actually he was . He consented , however , to wear a blue rather than a white shirt for the sake of avoiding glare , and when Tripp added that for this same reason it would be better not to wear a hand-painted tie , Gibbs replied that although this came to him as a considerable disappointment , he would accede to that , too , on conditionp101that the Senator also would . Porter Hoye and Louise von Louwe were to arrive in time to observe the proceedings from the glassed-in control room , but Anne insisted that she would prefer to stay at home and watch from there . Senator Farwell , who compared with Gibbs was a veteran at affairs of this kind , did not appear until shortly before the program was to go on the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small room adjoining the studio where the Senator , entirely bald except for a fringe of gray hair , was having his head anointed with the make-up that Gibbs had earlier refused . Describing this initial meeting later , Gibbs said that he had secretly hoped that it might have something of the same quality to it as that encounter between Alexander the Great and Diogenes , when Alexander dismounted from his horse , approaching his old enemy face to face for the first time where he sat basking by the side of the road , and magnanimouslyasked if there was anything in the world that he could do for him , to which Diogenes replied by requesting only that he be kind enough to step away from between himself and the sun . As luck would have it , however , Gibbs went on to explain , in the case of himself and the Senator , there was no opportunity for any such rejoinder since Farwell had greeted him with only a single word which , if his memory served him correctly , Gibbs said , was " Howdy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to the program and technical directors and two young engineers , and then led by Tripp to the far end ofp102the room , where the floor was covered with a dark carpet upon which were arranged a desk , a sofa , several deepseatedeasy chairs , and a couple of small tables . On the wall , framed without glass , hung a number of photographs of Tripp in the company of various celebrities , another showing Tripp in his staff-sergeant 's uniform . Leaning against the wall stood a guitar . There was a low bookcase at one side of the desk in which Gibbs noticed a current edition of Who 's Who , a collection of American folk songs , Alice in Wonderland , all six volumes of Carl Sandburg 's Lincoln , and several novels written by men and women whose likenesses were among the others on the rear wall . Off to one side stood an old-fashioned coat rack on which , even as Gibbs was looking at it , a boy hung up a fringed leather cowboy 's jacket , a racoon coat , a plaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been built out to either side , one hung with a Navajo blanket , the other entirely bare except for a framed cover of Time enlarged to several times its usual size , picturing Tripp with his head tilted slightly back as though he were about to burst into laughter , his hair a vivid red against the background of feathery green trees with the sun in the form of a klieg light blazing through them down upon a meadow where men and women in full evening dress strolled with classicalnymphs and satyrs and small children in gingham and overalls . The whole three-sided room , Tripp explained , was what amounted to the stage although they were not , if they could , to think of it as that , but rather as somebody'sp103untidy living-room , the main lounge of a mental home , a Senate office , or whatever they chose . They were to sit down anywhere they liked , Tripp told them , and could move about wherever they wanted to , never worrying about the cameras , but letting the cameras worry about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that it was , as he had already told them , theirs to determine . They would simply follow wherever their own conversation might lead them , avoiding specific political issues as much as possible , with Tripp himself playing a very minor role , he said , but ready to jump in if they should show signs of bogging down or if in any way things started to get out of hand , as he put it . Just then the incandescent lamps were switched on , both the ceiling and floor units , and the effect was momentarily blinding . Porter Hoye and Louise von Louwe had already taken their seats in the control room , and their expressions as they looked out through the glass were as if they were seeingthe three men for the first time . They gave the impression , in fact , of not only seeing them , but of seeing around them and behind them , of indeed seeing quite through them , so brilliant was the light . Pulling up the knees of his trousers , Senator Farwell sat abruptly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few moments blinking into the blaze like some wiry , gray animal transfixed by the headlights of an automobile . Gibbs stood absolutely still with one hand raised to shield his eyes , his mouth shut tight in a deep-cut line of resigned exasperation . Onlyp104Tripp continued , unperturbed , with what he had been saying . In fifty seconds they would be on the air ; at preciselyhalf past the hour they would go off . There was a clock above the control-room window , but they would get a signal to bring their discussion to a close . In silence then he sat down on the edge of the desk and crossed his legs as they all watched the second hand circle slowly toward the hour . Tripp wore a dark blue suit and , like Gibbs and the Senator , a blue shirt , which made his lean , boy 's face seem the color of milk but richly , warmly so . Though he did not speak , his wide , mobile mouth was not totally still , but trembled faintly at the corners as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pane , Porter Hoye glanced down at his watch like the picture of a man glancing down at his watch , and Louise von Louwe raised her hands to shoulder height and , attempting to catch Gibbs 's eye , shook them , clasped , in the gesture of victory . " This is Robin Tripp , " the young man began almost dreamily , still sitting on the edge of the desk , " speaking to you from New York , which is . . . believe me , a cold , dark city this January night . The air has that soft , heavy chill to it you get when there 's snow up there in the sky somewhere waiting to come down , and as far as I 'm concerned , it ca n't start coming down too soon . I do n't know about you  --  hardly anything about you at all for that matter  --  but personally I love it . It takes me back to roughly a hundred and fifty years before I was born , I 'll settle for a hundred , when snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like coming down thick enough , everything inp105all Manhattan stopped moving except maybe the eye of a hungry sparrow or a kid or two on a sled . But I 'm not here tonight to talk about the weather . In fact , for the next half-hour you 're going to get precious little talking from me at all . If you 're steady customers , you 'll have heard me announce last week that my guest this evening was to be Senator Edward M. Farwell . Well , the Senator 's sitting beside me now . You 'll see him for yourself in a minute . He does n't need anybody to introduce him , as the saying goes , but just in case somebody 's tuned in from Mars , I could say in very general terms that he is , of course , one of the mainstays of the right wing of our government . But do me a favor and forget about that , will you , because we 're going to keep away from politics this evening ? You know our policy around here . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on the movies , musicians to chew the rag about their days on the highschoolbaseball squad . Let them talk about anything , as a matter of fact , except their own lines because what we 're interested in on this show is n't the news , but the men behind the news . We do n't want to know what they do , but who they are . Who is Senator Edward M. Farwell ? And who is . . . But I do n't want to jump the gun on myself . " There 's somebody else here with us tonight . He started hitting the front pages again earlier this week when word came through of his nomination by the President as a key member of the Cabinet . He 's in the city for only a few days before heading off for the capital to appear before a committee of the Senate , which must confirmp106his nomination , and when he arrived here Tuesday , he told the press that he planned to make no public appearancesat all prior to that date . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into agreeing to come here this evening anyway , so it 's with very special pleasure that I welcome him now , the Honorable Ansel Gibbs . It 's a particular treat for me personally because Mr. Gibbs was a very close friend of my father 's , and this is the first time we 've met for a number of years . " But on with the show . Who is Senator Farwell ? Who is Mr. Ansel Gibbs ? You ca n't just say , Gentlemen , reveal yourselves . Advance and be recognized . ' That 's asking too much of any man . But you can say  --  Senator Farwell , let 's begin with you if we may , sir  --  you and Mr. Gibbs have in different ways both been serving our government for about as long as my generation can remember , and it would be interesting to know whether your paths have ever crossed before . " " If you mean have I ever had the pleasure of making Mr. Gibbs 's acquaintance personally , my answer is that unfortunately I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you  --  " " I was just going to say that once  --  " " Yes . The Senator and I came very close to meeting in 1939 , I think it was . " " Early 1940 , I think . " " 1939 or early 1940 , in London , we met  --  or , that is , we just did n't meet  --  at a large dinner given by the then Air Vice Marshal . "  | " I was overseas with a committee investigating British war production . " " I believe we exchanged some suspicious glances , " Gibbs said , " down the length of a very long table . " " I do n't seem to remember having had any particular suspicions of anybody , Mr. Gibbs . " " I did n't mean particular suspicions . It has always struck me that Americans meeting each other abroad are apt to be suspicious of each other in a rather general way . You come across your countryman surrounded by strangers , conducting himself with great circumspection , and you ca n't help wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . When you meet another American abroad , it 's sometimes hard to be sure just where and how he fits into things back here . " " That is very subtle . The only ones I 'm suspicious of are the ones who stay on over there . I have an old-fashioned feeling that the best place for a U.S. citizen is in the U.S. " " I believe that I would agree with you in seventy-five per cent of the cases . " " And the remaining twenty-five ? " " I 'm perfectly willing to believe that they can best serve their own or their country 's interests , or both , abroad . " " The trouble is they lose touch . " " This business of losing touch , Senator . I keep running into that phrase these days . I 'm not sure that I altogetherunderstand its meaning . " " I think its meaning is very simple . If you and I are friends and I go away somewhere for an extended period ,  |p108we  lose touch with each other . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of sight , out of mind , you might say . " There are some minds that are n't so accommodating . A man may see his friend most clearly and poignantly precisely when he has gone away from him somewhere . " " That sounds a little cold and calculating , does n't it ? Give me a man with a heart who stays right in the thick of things and fights it out shoulder to shoulder with his friend or his country . " " Not all battles are won in the thick of things . " " I 'm afraid this is a little too intellectual for me . " " Well , but you gentlemen have differed on one basic point here , " Tripp intervened , " that I think causes a lot of people trouble . Senator Farwell , you 've used a very old saying when you said : Out of sight , out of mind . ' But there 's another one which is probably just as old that says : Absence makes the heart grow fonder . ' Are you definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , I 'll give you an example of what I mean . My mother and I were always very close . When I first went up to the Senate back in the days when you were in knickers , I do n't imagine a single week went by without me writing her a long , newsy letter full of my comings and goings , all those kind of things I knew she 'd want to hear . But , you know , after a few months went by and there was too much piled up on my desk for me to get home to Goshen Falls to see her , it would begin to be as if I was writing those lettersp109to myself . I had a picture of her in my mind all the time , but that picture would just fade and fade like an old yellow photograph . Then I 'd get back home some day , maybe only long enough for a cup of coffee and a cruller in the kitchen , and right away it was just like it always was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , all right . But that young fellow up in Washington 's no kin of mine . ' In a way she was dead right , and I knew it . Now I just do n't know whether Mr. Gibbs would agree with what I'fn saying or not . " " How about it , Mr. GibbsP " " I think we 're pretty far adrift from my original remark , which was simply that the temporary expatriate , geographically or emotionally , is apt to gain a valuable perspective . It 's certainly not an original insight on my part , and I 'm not going to belabor it further . But , of course , I understand what Senator Farwell has been saying about his relationship with his mother . We all know and love people who fade in our minds when we leave them , becoming flesh and blood only when and if we return , but are n't they almost all of them people with whom our relationship is based primarily on sentiment , an emotional relationship whose very substance is a matter of fairly constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only love my friend , but am also concerned with him as a complex , thinking human mechanism with certain ideas that challenge or confirm my own , why then I think he wo n't fade in my mind at all when I leave him . On thep110contrary , I am always in spite of myself seeing things as he would see them . When I argue from my point of view , I 'm apt to have his in mind as well . And that goes for a country , too  --  if you take your country really seriously , that is . Not just as the wave of a flag and a lump in the throat . " " 1 do n't know , " Senator Farwell said , " but it seems to me you 're commencing to say that there 's something not quite bright about loving your country or your mother or your friend or just about anything else . Of course , I may be wrong but  --  " " I apparently have n't made myself clear . What I intended  --  " " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always  --  " " Please . Maybe I 'm crazy , but when you clear away all the language out of here , it 's what a man loves that he lives and dies for , and he stays with what he loves , emotionallyand geographically and every which way . This complex , thinking human mechanism ' kind of relationship has just got to take second place . Do n't you agree with that , Mr. Gibbsll " " Sometimes , Senator , you have to make the best of second place . There are even times when it may be the better of the two . " " Senator Farwell , if I can interrupt here for a minute , " Tripp said . " Not to change the subject , but you mentioneda few minutes ago your home in Goshen Falls , and I wondered if you 'd be willing to give us a few more . . . "  | " Let 's leave Goshen Falls out of it for the time being , son . I 've got my teeth in something here , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you ever held an elective office ? " " No , I have riot . " " Well , it 's an experience you ought to have . Like yourself , I 'm a college man , but campaigning through the backwaters of my own home state I learned more than I ever did in any ten lectures on American government I ever heard . For instance , I learned that intelligence counts with the voters the same as it does anywhere else . But the man who gets elected has got to have more than that . He 's got to have a heart , and a lot of the time he 's got to wear it on his sleeve right out where folks can see it . They respect intelligence , but it 's the heart they vote for . " " What are you afraid of , Senator ? " " How 's that ? " " You keep trying to find cover . You let it be known that you have a heart and a mother and an occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rarer commodity , you make no claims there at all as if for fear that it might make you stand out in a crowd . " " I 've stood out in quite a few crowds in my day , Mr. Gibbs . " " Only as someone bigger and more successful than the rest . You 're determined , are n't you , to be everyone 's slightly magnified image of himself , but under no circum/stances qualitatively different . We 're told the purpose of this interview is to ascertain who we are . My guess is that you do n't want to be found out . " " You do n't stand up for election as often as I have without having that made plain enough . My record is an open book . It 's well known who I am . What a lot of us are interested in is who you are , Mr. Gibbs . " " I 'd be equally interested to hear your view on the sub-ject . " " I have n't made any secret of it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' speech . " " I had it on good report that you made such a statementonce . That statement has certainly been widely ascribed to you . " " I am almost tempted not to repudiate it . " " Then you did make it ? " " I did not . But I 'm tempted to make it for you now , if only because you 're so confident that , like you , I 'd never dare to  --  would never dare to admit to being anything other than what people expect their public servants to be . " " Either you make the statement because you believe it , or you do n't because you do n't . " " Very well , I will make it because I believe it . I am civilization . There you are , Senator . " " You know , some of my other victims on this show , " Tripp said , " have told me after all the shooting was over that there 's something about the whole business here that 's like a sort of queer dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strong that you see more thanp113eyes were ever meant to . The make-up you wear , these cameras like huge , black bugs , and the faces staring in at you through the control-room window . People tell me you 're apt to say more than you want to , things you may not even mean in the first place , the way you do when you 're dreaming . But it is n't a dream , gentlemen . There 's real snow outside waiting to fall on a real city , and over a million real people watching and listening to what you do and say in here . " " Thank you , " Gibbs continued , " but I 've said no more and no less than I want to . I 'll even say it again for you , Senator . I am civilization , and I 'm prepared to explain at least part of what that means . " " Please do . I 'd like to hear that explained . " " They ran a cartoon with your speech , you remember . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching all the way up from  --  oh , the grotesque and mysterious beginnings , the one-cell blobs and the monkeys , at the bottom , and then finally , way up at the top , me . To be civilization means to stand at the top , to be the last and best as far as things have gone to date , the educated , liberated man with his back to the grotesque mystery of his origins and his face to God knows what . Mind you , I do n't stand alone up there . You 're civilization , too , Senator , whether you care to say so or not . " " You 're putting words in my mouth . " " It was you who started the practice . But I 'll speak only for myself if you prefer . The civilized have responsibilitiestoward the less civilized . Politically that leads top114imperialism , of course , and on the personal scale it leads to cynicism or despair . But that 's far from being the worst of it . To be civilization , to be civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action at any given time that no one of them ever seems to be without qualification right . Everything is qualified . Legal and ethical principles are good for today , but ca n't be rigidly fixed for tomorrow . There has been talk tonight about love  --  love between humans and love for country . No matter how hard you may pretend to the contrary , there is ambivalence here , too . We know too much about the component parts of love the self interest , the insecurity , the Freudian grotesqueries . Love is no longer an answer , or if so , only one of an indeterminate number , none of them certain . " I do n't know . If there were to be a congress of planets  --  something like the U.N . celestially conceived  --  the chances are that one of us , one of the ultra-civilized , would be sent to represent this earth . You can imagine his arrival , soberly dressed , clean-shaven , a brief case under his arm , to hold forth in his rational , moderate tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human history . One wonders with what single mighty asseverationhe would enlighten that cosmic assemblage as to the nature of this civilization . I have no idea what he would say . But . . . ambivalence . Ambivalence . If he were limited to only one word , that is the one I would suggest to him . " " No standards , Mr. Gibbs ? No fixed legal and ethicalp115principles ? No love ? This is your man who is civilization ? " " On the contrary , all of this and any number of contrary alternatives as well . " " A man ca n't be many things at once . " " In all candor , I find him rarely capable of being less . It 's just that which makes him civilized and civilization possible . " " Look , let 's get down to the facts here . You keep talking about him , ' about the civilized man , and civilization , and I do n't know what all besides . What I 'd like to hear you talk about for a change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own past for us , Mr. Gibbs , " Tripp said . " I know everybody would be very interested to hear something about yours . " " What I suspect the Senator wants to hear especially is what he already well knows  --  that politically my past is a handicap . I was born with money , for instance . Not by any means a fortune , you understand , but enough , conservativelyinvested , to guarantee me a certain security for my lifetime . Consequently , I never had to work my way through college or anything else , and when I received my law degree and was subsequently admitted to the bar , I became associated very naturally with the firm founded by my father and his elder brother . I confess that I would n't have had it otherwise . Add to that the fact that I have never borne arms for my country . I was too young to get to France in the first war , and too old for the second . And , as the Senator has already brought to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Nobody holds these things against you . It 's just the infernal pride you seem to take in them . " " I 've never understood why one man should n't be as proud of his good fortune as another man of his lack of it . " " I think it 's time for one of us to tip our hand and stop just talking words . You know as well as I do that the way this country works , Cabinet appointments are more the President 's business than anybody else 's , and it 's the Senate 's job to confirm them unless they can show a case of strong ineligibility . After what you 've been saying here tonight , I think we have a case of that right now . " " I wish you would present that case . " " I will present it . You 're an educated man , Mr. Gibbs , and nobody 's going to question your ability when it comes to executing policy . But proud as you may be of it , you 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life out with the rest of us , and in my opinion you have the kind of cold , impersonal way of looking at people and history that makes me question whether you have or ever could have the imagination , the heart , the guts , to create and formulate policy . How can a man who 's never had to earn his own living and whose only training has been at a rich man 's college and a Wall Street law firm  --  now , what I want to know is how is a man like that going to be capable of suddenly pitching in and making any sense out of a world threatened by the H-bomb and by Communism inside and outside ? It 's like stepping out of the front parlor into a lion 's den . " " I do n't know how to answer a charge like that unlessp117perhaps by telling you something about the front parlor . " " You talk just words . You keep trying to trick me into playing word games with you . " " In the front parlor words are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front parlor . It was just a figure of speech . I 'm not going to be hoodwinked into shifting this business to a discussion of figures of speech . " " If I trade in words , you trade in emotions  --  yours against mine , or what you call my lack of them . " " I 'm not ashamed of my emotions . " " There 's a difference between us . I 've always been rather ashamed of my words . " " Why ? Which words ? " " All of them . Because they 've been so necessary . When you suggest that I 'm an overly verbal person , you 've put your finger on something . There have been times when I 've wished I had chosen the kind of life that more clearly speaks for itself . A soldier 's life . Or a priest 's . Even a prodigal 's . The kind of life that does n't have to depend so heavily upon words to define it . " " You 're still avoiding the issue here . I questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You persistently refuse to give me a straight answer . " " I 'm speaking about myself . That 's what you asked . " " Facts , Mr. Gibbs . Not words . " " What facts would you like ? In 1928 I bought a fourhundred-acreranch in Montana . My wife died soon after we were married and left me with one child , a daughter . I have never been a card-carrying Communist . For somep118time now I have been engaged in writing a record of my experiences in England during the war . Roughly fifteen years ago my closest friend shot himself near a stand of croquet mallets in his back yard . There are some facts . " " This is ridiculous . " " If any fact is relevant , all of them are . " " I think what the Senator means , " Tripp said , " is that you ca n't consider all of these facts to be equally impor-tant . " " They are all part of who I am , and that is what the Senator has asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana and the suicide of a friend , " Tripp said . " Certainly you do n't put them on a par with each other . " " It would n't surprise me if he did , " Senator Farwell said . " Simply as facts , there is no essential difference between them , " Gibbs said . " The difference is not a factual one . " " What is the difference then ? " Tripp asked . " It exists only in my mind . It does n't have any substanceexcept the words I describe it with , and it is not a fact . The ranch in Montana is nothing  --  to me , that is . And to me the death of this friend is  --  this death is for me one of the worlds I live in . " " Why ? " Senator Farwell asked . " Because for a long time I was troubled with the suspicion that I was perhaps in some negative , partial way responsible  --  inmuch the same way that some might accuse you and others , Senator , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zealous advocacyof isolationism in 1939 . " " You 're what I call an international do-gooder . Your brand of foreign policy can only weaken us , and as far as " We 've been asked to keep politics out of this discussion , and I apologize for being the one to introduce the subject . I am making no charge  --  " " You very clearly stated  --  " " I stated , and only by way of analogy , that this is a possible charge that could be made against you . I am not pressing it myself , and I have no doubt that you could absolve yourself of it if I were to . In the case of my own conscience 's charge against me , I 've been absolved comparativelyrecently . I 've become convinced that my friend was bound to take his own life whether I had come at the right moment with help or not . Looking back at it now , I can see that in any number of ways his whole life had been leading up to it , and it ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can even believe that it may not have been the worst thing . In the long run his survivors do n't seem to have suffered for it . If he 'd lived , they might well have suffered a great deal more , and he with them . " " Why are you telling me all this ? What 's this got to do with anything . " " I 'm not sure why . Perhaps just because you asked for facts , and this is one that 's been on my mind for a long time . And also because it 's helped me understand that , despite your anxieties on the subject , the man who says hep120is civilization is n't apt to do injury to other people , but only to himself . I do n't think you need fear for the safety of this country in such hands . Even our policies , disapproveof them as you may , need n't cause you alarm because you can rest assured that , in the last analysis , we 're never likely to try forcing them down your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right any more than we are ever entirely convinced that yours are wrong . For the civilized man there are n't apt to be any absolute principles or holy causes . That 's what makes civilized life possible . We may not be heroes , but by and large we 're also not villains  --  either collectively or taken one by one . Tolerant . Ambivalent . Call us what you will . " " I call you the worst kind of cynic . You do n't quite believe in what you stand for , and you do n't quite disbelieve in what you 're opposed to . " " And that infuriates you as it infuriates a litigant to see his lawyer having lunch with the lawyer of his opponent . " " You 're dead right it does . And this friend of yours who killed himself . Did he have ideas like thisP It was presumablysomething like them that drove him to it . " " He was too young for ideas . If he were alive now at the same age as when he died , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember him almost as a son . " " Before you absolved yourself , as you put it , you say you were afraid that maybe you 'd had something to do with his death  --  very indirectly , of courseP " " I meant that if I 'd only known what was in his mind , I might have been able to help him in some way . "  | " Was there any way you could have known what was in his mind ? " " Looking back at it , I thought that there was . Is n't that always the case ? " " Ilow could you have known ? " " He 'd always been a very modest person , for instance  --  extraordinarily good at a great many pleasant things , as popular a man with all kinds of people as any man I 've ever known , but he was always very self-deprecating  --  charmingly , genuinely so . However , the last few months of his life he became boastful in a strange , belligerent way . He 'd blow his own horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him and break it over your knee . " " Was there anything else ? " " I remember his laugh changed . Before , he 'd had a way of tipping his head back and just letting it come out , but later he 'd watch you when he was laughing . I suspect he was watching to see whether you knew he was n't really laughing at all . He also became indiscreet . " " What do you mean by that ? " " He was working for me at the time , and I had good opportunity to notice it . He tried exploiting the fact that he and I were good friends , for one thing . He betrayed certain confidences just for the sake , I think , of having it known that I confided in him . He borrowed money from his own secretary . It reached the point where for everyone 's good , including his own , it became essential to let him go . " " I take it that 's your way of saying you fired him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that he wasp122badly overtired and needed a rest . All the sweetness of the man seemed to come back that day , and he agreed to take a few weeks off and go away somewhere . It was the last time I ever saw him . " " He never came back ? " " No , no . He came back . But while he was away , it came out that he 'd been talking quite irresponsibly about some highly confidential matters . Everyone was up in arms . It was impossible to keep him on  --  even if he 'd been my own son . " " I thought you said you never saw him again after your earlier talk ? " " That is correct . " " Ile just came back and found out he was fired . " " Everything was explained to him . It was made clear that his salary would be continued until he had found other work . I most certainly did n't bear him any ill-feeling . Nobodydid . He understood all that . " " But riot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it would be easier for us both that way . " " How long after this did he shoot himself ? " " I do n't remember exactly . Several weeks . A month . " " Mr. Gibbs , I do n't think you 're talking good sense . You made the point a while back that if you 'd only knownwhat was in his mind , you could have helped him , but itseems to me that you knew what was in his mind very welland went about helping him in a mighty peculiar way . " " Senator Farwell , " Tripp said , " when I asked youp123gentlemen to avoid politics this evening , I did n't mean that there was no restriction at all as to the kind of thing you " You want to know who he is , do n't yon " Senator Farwell asked . " Do n't start getting cold feet just when you 're about to find out . " " I 'm certainly just as eager as you are to find out and maybe more , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tripp said . " He was the closest friend I 've ever had , " Gibbs said . " I 'm certain now , and so are others who loved him , that he would have done what he did quite apart from any action of mine or anybody else 's . No one was to blame  --  not I any more than all his other friends or even his wife . A man chooses the instruments of his own destruction , and I 'm willing to believe that in some fatal , half-conscious way that 's why he chose us . But to say that we all destroyed him is the same as to say that none of us did . Justice ca n't be chopped so fine . " " Then in justice you feel you 've been completely absolved , Mr. Gibbs , of any responsibility whatever . " " Yes , in justice . My son  --  my friend , that is  --  this young man they found dead  --  he took his own life . There was no one else responsible . I 'm convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , Mr. Gibbs . " " Civilization survives , Senator . There 's nothing especiallymerry about it . It may well be its tragedy just to survive so much that was beautiful , expendable , and misdirected , young , that died along the way . "  | " Yes . You 've survived a great deal . Your principles , for one thing . Your belief that what 's right is right and what 's wrong is wrong . Your emotions . Love even . You 've said so yourself . " " It may not be a merry business to be a survivor , but there can be a kind of pride in it . There 's a pride just in lasting . " " Lasting for what , I 'd like to know . " " Maybe just to continue making it possible for the young to be beautiful and misdirected . I do n't have all the answers . " " My mistake , sir . I was under the impression that you did . " " You forget something , gentlemen , " Tripp said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . Each of us sees the other two looking just as high and wide and thick as they really are . The lights in here are brighter than the sun , and they make us seem if anything bigger and solider than life and realer than we are . But remember how we look flickering in the dark of thousands of living-rooms , bedrooms , dining-rooms , where we 're reduced to blackand-whitemidgets a few inches high just about big enough to saddle mice and go charging at each other with pins . When anything that size starts getting noisy and out of hand , there 's just one thing to do . You fumigate . I offer this warning . We have only a few minutes left . " " I do n't care how I look on a television screen , " Senator Farwell said . " I , for one , am grateful for the chance of appearing in the living-rooms of the American people in anyp125form whatsoever for the purpose of going on record as beingfirmly opposed to the appointment of Ansel Gibbs to any position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a strange feeling of being on trial here , " Gibbs said , " though on just what charge I 'm still not certain . " " I think I 've made that clear enough , " Senator Farwell said . " And I agree that it 's a trial . I only hope the people watching us this evening will take their responsibilities as citizens seriously enough to write to their Congressmen expressing their own verdicts . Pressure must be brought to bear . " " Mr. Tripp , this was originally your dream , as you call it , " Gibbs said , " and you 're not entirely uninvolved in the issues here yourself . What is your verdict ? " " I 'm just the man behind the man behind the news , sir . I sing songs and ask questions . It 's a long , hard pull , but the pay 's not bad . " " Sing out your judgment then . I 've been telling no less than the truth about myself all evening  --  a remarkable experience for any man  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator 's . Sheer horror . Sing us your own feelings . I see you have your guitar in the corner over there . " " I do n't sing verdicts . That 's not part of my act . Besides , I do n't know the chords that go with dead friends and ambivalence , isolationism in 1939 and a United Nationsamong the stars . It would take me hours to work them out , and our time 's running short . " " You 're a wise young man . Find out who everyone is , but never let down your own guard . "  | " Not for a minute . " " If I had a son , that would be my advice to him . " " I 'm the father of sons myself , " Senator Farwell said . " Three of them . Fine boys . And I 'm here to say that if I can help it , and I think I can , they wo n't be raising boys of their own in a country run by men who have minds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . You said you liked the snow , boy . Well , give me the good old sun any day . " " Oh , take the good old sun then , Senator , " Gibbs said . " Take the sun , take all the brightness and warmth of the world , the love guaranteed against failure , coffee in the kitchen with Mother , and three fine boys  --  take everything brave and true and uncomplicated there is in the world . Take it because your war cry is that you already have it . Only , for God 's sake , do n't think I question its worth . " " I apologize for interrupting again , " Tripp said , " but our time 's up . This is the point where I usually say how this program 's completely spontaneous and unrehearsed , but tonight that does n't seem necessary . You might say that , like some kinds of murder , it was unpremeditated . But , seriously , I know that nobody 's going to hold any grudges for words spoken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm concerned , it 's been not only extremely illuminating , but a pleasure and an honor to have  --  " " It 's been a trial , " Senator Farwell said . " That 's what it 's been . And as I said before , I leave it to your listeners to  --  " " Yours is the verdict I want , Tripp , " Gibbs said.  | " I 'm sorry , but time 's up . " " The verdict 's plain enough as it is , " Senator Farwell said . " Tripp , " Gibbs said . " Back with you again next week , strangers out there in the flickering dark . In the meanwhile  --  " " What 's your verdict , Tripp ? " Gibbs said . " Yes , yes . All right . I 'll give a verdict , but it 'll have to wait till next week  --  same time , same station . In the meanwhile , this is Robin Tripp in New York wishing you all good-night and dreams to gladden your hearts . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gesturing hectically for Tripp to bring things to an end , and when he finally did so , racing through his last words , someone switched off the incandescent lamps so that , although the room was still dimly lit , it seemed night by comparison . The control room , on the other hand , remainedbright , and for a few moments everyone in it was still , including Porter Hoye and Louise von Louwe , who sat at the window unmoving as stones . Then just the ceilinglights were switched on again , and immediately an elaborate dismantling process began as cameras were moved back into place , the lighting units checked , the furniture in the three-sided room where the interview had taken place pushed to one side , and the carpet rolled up . Gibbs , Farwell , and Tripp had all stepped out into the studio proper , but it was only with difficulty that Porter Hoye and Louise were able to single them out in the midst of all the activity , and through the soundproof glass theyp128could hear nothing . All in pantomime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Farwell 's hand , but with the powder streaked on his forehead where he had tried to wipe it off with his handkerchief , the Senator was hunched over with his fist to his mouth , violently coughing . With his free hand , he gestured the young man aside . The program director and a young woman with a clipboardand pencil stood talking to Tripp , but at a beckoning signal from Gibbs , Tripp left them to go to him . They spoke briefly , Tripp all earnestness , Gibbs with his hands clasped behind his back , his chin high . Then with a kind of mock salute , smiling , Tripp seemed to say good-by and returned to the pair whom he had left , drawing them through the crowd toward the Senator , to whom he introducedthem . The Senator had stopped coughing and was drinking a glass of water , which he set down for a moment to shake their hands . Shortly after this , Tripp , leaving these three together , disappeared rapidly through a small door at the rear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Louise managed to catch Gibbs 's eye , and with a nod of his head in the direction of Farwell and just the slightest raising of his eyebrows , he indicated to them that he must speak to him before leaving . The Senator wheeled around so suddenly as Gibbs came up to him from behind that the water spilled out of the glass which he had by now retrieved , soaking Gibbs 's sleeve and the front of his coat . The Senatorinsisted on ineffectually dabbing at it with his own handkerchief , and it was with this incident that Louisep129von Louwe finished describing her impressions of the whole evening to Anne much later . " Tripp had stolen off like a shrewd , red fox , " she said , " and there were the two of them left together . Everybody else seemed to draw back as though there was going to be a shooting , and , believe me , my dear , I was prepared for anything myself . And then this burlesque ! Your father standing there dripping wet , with his whole career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred bits and pieces all around him , and that bald little senator pecking away at him with a pocket handkerchief . I did n't know whether to burst into tears or wild laughter . From beginning to end , it was all upside down and distorted like a face reflected in a spoon . "  |p130IN  ANSWER to Anne 's question , Porter Hoye only shook his great head from side to side twice , yet she felt greater apprehensionat this than at any other point during the entireevening , which she had spent alone in the living-room , watching Tripp , Farwell , and her father on the small screen . She had asked her question in a whisper , hanging Hoye 's overcoat in the hall closet while he stood close behind her , and it was when she glanced back over her shoulder for his answer that she saw him with his lips pursed , silently shaking his head from left to right . Fartherforward in the hall , Louise von Louwe stood in front of a mirror unpinning her hat with a look of intense indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowflakes were caught in the light from it , Gibbs was bent over , peelingoff his rubbers . People must always be wrapped up and then unwrapped again , the girl thought , no matter what high purposes they might serve in between ; and there was a kind of comfort in this . " What do you thinkP " she had whispered to Hoye only a moment before , and the gravity of his unspoken reply was abruptly belied now by his turn- ing away from her and roaring into the still air : " Dear Gussy , Louise , I 'm half starved ! " then somehow propelling them all toward the kitchen . It was the kind of move that you felt he brilliantly blundered into rather than planned . Nowhere but in the kitchen could they have been so mercifully and naturally relieved of the necessity , at least for a time , of making conversation . Hoye himself , with hoarse good humor , took over the scrambling of the eggs , standing at the stove in his iron-gray suit and starched collar , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white enamel table top and set about making coffee . Gibbs sat by the counter on a high stool waiting for the toast to pop and then buttering it , his gaze intent on what he was doing . It was Hoye again who thought to switch on the tiny radio , and the music that he found , turning the volumeup to where it obscured the sounds of cooking , was some frenetic piece of Dixieland jazz which he bravely gave evidence of enjoying even to the extent of humming along with it off-key until Louise von Louwe passed close to him , her hands full of egg shells for the garbage , and quietly but with awesome clarity said : " You can strip yourself naked and stand on your head if you want , but a wake 's still a wake . " He stopped his humming at this , but the radio itselfwas sufficient to restrict conversation to little but the most functional exchanges until the eggs were finished and Hoye was dividing them into meticulously equal portions , whereupon the music came to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turning it off when Gibbs stopped him with a gesture , and there was thus nothing to do but sit there , the four of them , waiting , with no longer any pretense of doing anything else . Not until the broadcast was nearly over did the report come of Tripp 's program an hour before . It was a late bulletin simply announcing that Gibbs 's unscheduled appearance had taken place and mentioning a heated debate between him and Senator Farwell . It was , however , enough to bring Hoye to the point of making his first open pronouncement on the whole matter , which he did rather hastily as if determined to be the one to set the tone for anything further that might be said on the subject . " Well , " he began with an introductory finality calculated to discourage contradiction , " I was against it from the start as you know , but it 's over and done with now , and I do n't think any particular harm 's going to come of it . " He looked at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the uneaten food upon it . " Harm ? " Louise von Louwe asked him sharply . " I should think the harm 's been done already . Ansel , " she continued , turning to Gibbs with her fork pointed toward him , " I will never believe that you did n't for some reason do it on purpose . " " Do what ? What do you think he 's done ? " Hoye asked , at which Gibbs , laying one hand on his friend 's shoulder , interrupted with : " I 've no intention of gumming my porridge in the corner while you discuss what 's to become of me . I 'm as grateful for that incredible half-hour as forp133any other I 've ever lived through with the possible exceptionof the one in which I was persuaded to go through with it in the first place . " " The boy hypnotizes you , " Louise von Louwe said . " There 's something about him . I feel it myself  --  in the stomach somewhere . When he warned you that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your head somehowthat it was . You said things you 'd ordinarily say only in your sleep , if then . " " On the contrary , Louise . I have never been so awake . " " Louise exaggerates as usual , " Hoye said . The coffee began to boil over at this point , and , reaching out to turn down the gas without so much as a moment 's pause in what he was saying , he gave fresh evidence of being  --  as from the beginning he had clearly set out to appear  --  the man in control of a difficult situation . " But if I may say so , Ansel , I do n't believe it was a wise move to bring up the business about Rudy . Do n't think for a minute they 're going to let the matter rest where you left it . They 'll probably try to dig up Sylvia somewhere and get her version . " " I very much doubt that , " Gibbs said . " I beg your pardon , but they will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do you any harm , but they 'll be after the facts all right . " " Will at least you eat your eggs , Anne ? " Louise von Louwe said . " I hate to see them smeared all over a plate like a street accident . " " Maybe there 's snow where my heart ought to be , " Gibbs said , laying his hands palms down on the table , thep134fingers apart , " to borrow the Senator 's rich metaphor , but there are no three people in the world I 'm fonder of than the three of you . If it 's not apparent to you what 's happened to me , I owe you an explanation  --  you three if anybody . " He looked at Anne as he spoke where she sat on the kitchen stool , her toes slipped between the rungs , leaning forward with her arms on her knees . " I 'm tempted to say that it happened when Tripp was here to see me for the first time the other day , but , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things do n't happen neatly , slap-bang , like that , alluring as it is to think so . It was a process , althoughcertainly seeing Tripp that afternoon was a crucial part of it . Oh , all I mean , " he went on , taking a cigarette from Hoye , who smoked continuously , whereas Gibbs himself rarely did , " is that somehow the winter 's over . I know this has its comic side . Springtime for Ansel . I 've never been one to deny my own grotesqueness . But I find that after being away a very great deal longer and farther than two years in Montana , I 'm back again . Not just to this city , and to you . Back to nothing Farwell would call the thick of things , I suppose . But at least to the thickness of things , you might say  --  to the solid present , what 's happening right now  --  snow falling , this table under my hands , having a job again , or being about to . Somehow I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't lost my mind . I do n't think so . A lot of it was deciding  --  I told the truth about that  --  that I no longer had this tragedy on my conscience . The boy himself exonerated me . He 's obviously unscarred by it himself , though I dreaded seeingp135him , thinking he would n't be . But returning from that is only part of it . It 's a much more pervasive thing . When he sang me one of his songs  --  some silly thing , I ca n't even remember what it was about  --  I knew that I 'd arrived back in an infinitely more real sense than at the airport Tuesday . I ca n't be any plainer than that . Returned . So this evening with Farwell I was perfectly aware of everything I was saying . They wanted to know who I was , and I told them  --  not who they expected me to be , but who I precisely am  --  for better or for worse . Personally , I do n't regret a word of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the long run they 'll interpret what I said in terms of what they expected me to say . That 's usually the way . But this is beside the point . Do you understand what I 'm trying to say , not about the television program , but about myself ? " " I understand one thing , " Anne suddenly said , and it was apparent to all three of them as they turned to her that there were tears in her eyes . " That politically you 're ruined . Everybody understands that except you . But I do n't care about that . What I care about is that he set out in cold blood to ruin you . " " Who , Anne ? " " Of course , Tripp . He made a fool of you , and it 's what he must have planned to do all along . I could hardly bear to watch it . " " Come , come , my dear , " Louise von Louwe said , taking her by the arm and pointlessly trying to force Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doom in this house , and even I would n't go so far as to say that . Besides , you 're crying . "  | " Why should he want to ruin me , Anne ? " Gibbs asked , leaning toward her across the table . " Because of Rudy , you mean ? Something like that ? " " Melodrama ! " Although up to this point the sight of the girl 's tears had left Hoye 's face helpless somewhere betweenexpressions , as he boomed out this single word , he could not help faintly smiling at what struck him as the ineffable accuracy of it . " Please do n't interrupt . " Gibbs 's voice came closer to anger than Hoye had ever heard it before . " My daughter and I are talking together . This has rarely happened , and I wo n't be interrupted , " at which Hoye was silent , only glancing at Louise von Louwe , who almost imperceptibly shrugged . " Is that what you 're saying , Anne ? " Gibbs asked . " That Tripp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " she said . " because of that mostly , I think , and because it 's the kind of thing he 'll do whether he has a reason or not . It 's the way he is . I ca n't explain why . " " If you ca n't explain why , we ca n't take what you 're telling us seriously , " Louise von Louwe said . " You do n't get about enough . You should be seeing more people of your own age and kind . I 've told you that again and again . " " Look , " Anne said . " If you wo n't take me seriously , I tell you what . This is no tantrum , and I 'm not crying now . But do you see this ? " She indicated one of the pink-andwhiteMeissen cups which had been set out for their coffee . Her tears were gone , and she held it in her hand for a moment ; then , taking it by the handle , broke it with onep137sharp stroke against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious enough to do that in cold blood . " In the interval of silence that followed , Louise von Louwe bent over in her chair and started to gather up the fragments . Anne took her by the shoulder and tried to stop her . " Do n't pick them up , " she said . " I 'll get you another . " " Your gesture was to break it , " Louise von Louwe said , " and mine is to pick up the pieces . " " Anne , " Gibbs said , " this is an extraordinary accusationto make against the boy , and it 's essential to know what you base it on . Did he ever speak to you of any such intention ? Did he at some point give you reason to believe that he felt hostility toward me ? Did he at any time discuss with you what form he expected this thing with Farwell and me to take ? " The curious air of fatigue that had suddenly come over him seemed particularly incongruous in contrast to the speed with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . None of these , " she said . " It 's not like him ever to say what he 's really thinking . The only proof I have is what I saw , and about a million other people , too . How he got you in there and let Farwell keep on baiting you until you did n't care what you were saying . He could have stopped it any time he wanted . But that 's what he 's famous for , you know . Getting people to make fools of themselves . Only this time he decided to go farther than that and ruin you . " " What are you talking about ? How can he ruin me ? "  | " You do n't know what a following he 's got . In that , Hooper-rating thing or whatever it is , he 's in the top five , and that means there are literally millions of people watching him . " " That is correct . " Hoye said . " He 's extremely popular . " " So if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week that his verdict is you 're guilty somehow , there 'll be letters pouring into the Senate . And do n't think for a minute that is n't exactly what he 's going to do . " There was a kind of soft wonder in her voice as though , in addition to everything else that she felt at this plan which she ascribed to Tripp , she was also strangely awed by it or by the sound of herself describing it . " Guilty of what ? " Gibbs had risen from his chair and stood behind his daughter now , looking down at her . " Oh , I do n't know , " she said . " Of being who you are . Of saying the kind of things you did . It does n't matter what . Whatever he says , he 'll make it sound exactly right . " " I 'll grant you it 's possible that if he should do something like this , public sentiment might be strong enough to have some appreciable effect on the Senate and might even bring into serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , I flatly refuse , " Gibbs said , taking her face in his hands from behind and tipping it up toward him , " to believe that he would conceive of doing any such thing or that he has any motive for doing so . "  | " Wait and see then , " she said . " I know him . " " Everything most certainly hinges on that , " Louise von Louwe said . " I do n't believe you know him at all . You 're only in love with him , and that 's far from the same thing . " " What do you know about him , Annie ? " Gibbs asked . Sitting there in a yellow sweater paler than her hair , her clasped hands unmoving on her gray skirt , and her eyes wide , but vaguely averted under the glances of Porter Hoye and Louise von Louwe , she might have said that what she knew principally was that she would never see him again , but this she did not say because , like everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her throat and hesitated for an instant on her lips , but then , with the faintest catch in her breath , vanished . She might have said that in New York on summer week ends the city empties , and looking down the broad avenues cleared of all but a stray car or passer-by , you can see the heat rise in a haze as fair as the haze of sun on meadows . To walk in the green dusk down side streets planted with spindly trees was always to believe that the person coming around the corner might well be a person you knew because there were so few of them left during summer , and again and again it was Tripp  --  in a dirty felt hat with the brim turned down against the warm rain or his red hair sleek and bright in the sun , coming on purpose to meet her or , as often had happened , walking toward her when she did not expect him at all . Except that in some remote way she was always expecting him then , and to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then afterp140they had met and were walking along the river or eating supper in a restaurant where the waiters stood bored by the empty tables , he had sometimes said , " Good evening . This is a delightful surprise to be sure , " so that in effect they could meet again , a play within a play , and so on , until sometimes they came very close to meeting truly . That narrow , boy 's face was famous enough to puzzle the stare of children , and if only once had that wide , boy 's mouth shaped the true salutation of these last , true meetings  --  whichwas : " You know I 'm in love with you , Annie , " muttered in front of a shop window full of pumpkinsand candy corn one autumn night  --  it had often come close to shaping words very like them in meaning or at least had suddenly , recklessly smiled as if such words existed somewhere and it was at them that he was smiling . But there had been only that once , and although afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outermost sort grew more frequent , the inner meetings , even without salutation , grew less and less until finally  --  when she had seen that the rattling at the dark windowpane was , of course , not Tripp , as for one inane instant she had imagined , but only the snow  --  she had made her decision not to continue seeing him at all . She could not sanely hold it against him that in his first interview with her father he had not asked for her hand as Aunt Louise had with oracular elegance phrased the possibility ; but surely , she felt , he could have spoken some word or given some sign , which Gibbs in turn would have reported to her , that at least part of his motive in having sought out Gibbs top141begin with was simply to make himself known to the father of the girl who at sunrise on a Long Island beach had kissed him for his birthday , thinking him asleep , and to whom he had some weeks later , if only once , spoken in terms of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Gibbs had asked , standing behind her as now he still was , looking down at her head turned slightly away from Porter Hoye and Aunt Louise , and she could have answered by saying that she knew that she was herself not entirely convinced that what she had charged him with was true . Yet perhaps she was . She found it just possible to believe  --  let Hoye roar " Melodrama ! " if he chose  --  that all summer and all fall Tripp 's chief motive had been somehow through her to work her father 's ruin . And now it would appear that he had or , with little more effort , very easily could . She had sat by herself in the living-room watching his program as if in a dream at first , but waking all at once to the fact that her father was speaking a language almost too private to bear and that Tripp was clearly determined to do no more than make an occasional gesture of stopping him . She was humiliated for her father and for herself , sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know you ca n't be sure of him , " she replied . " I know what I 've told you is true . And I 'm not in love with him , " she said to Louise von Louwe . " I 'm not going to see him any more . " " I have a terrific headache , " Gibbs said . " It must have been those lights . " As he walked around the table to his chair , he stepped on a piece of the Meissen cup whichp142splintered beneath his foot . " Everything 's breaking to pieces in here , " he said and sat down . Anne in pale yellow , Louise in black , Porter in a gray so dark that it amounted to black and holding a smoking cigarette in front of his face with two stained fingers : they sat stiff as waxworks around the blinding white table looking at him as the kitchen clock ticked . The top of his head felt cold , and the pain gibbered tediously . He remembered reading that Franklin Roosevelt 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the last words of thousands upon thousands , noticed the smoke from Hoye 's cigarette listing horizontallytoward him across the table , and knew that he was dying . He drew himself up straight in his chair , placed the fist of one hand on the back of the other , and in a voice steady as mountains said : " I 'm going to clear this thing up tonight . I 'll call the boy and ask him point-blank what he means to do . " " It would be much better if I called for you , " Hoye said , stubbing his cigarette out in his plate , and Gibbs started to protest but stopped as Hoye pushed back from the table , rose , and left the room . " He takes a great deal upon himself , does n't he ? " Gibbs gave a short laugh . It was appropriate for Hoye to be present , perfectly dressed for the occasion , and perfectly prepared as always to take matters in hand . Only Hoye had eaten his eggs , Gibbs noticed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought what a terrible waste . " Somebody say something . "  | " I expect to hear a deafening crash any minute , " Louise von Louwe said . " He 'll never find that telephone in the dark . The chances are the dignified thing would be for me to go help him . " " What do you think , Louise ? " Gibbs asked . " Ordinarily , I would simply have waited to see what happened , but under the circumstances it strikes me we might as well get hold of the boy and find out right away . " " Well after all , Ansel , what do you expect him to say ? " she asked . " Yes , Mr. Gibbs , ' or whatever he calls you , I 'm out to destroy you , and my verdict will be that you 're guilty ' ? " " If that 's his intention , how would he benefit by denyingit ? " " You should ask your daughter these questions . This is her hour . " " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Anne told her father . " He wo n't answer the telephone . He almost never does . I 've just said what I know he 's trying to do , " she added to Louise von Louwe . " For God 's sake , do n't think I feel triumphant about it . " The pain in Gibbs 's head droned on more insistently , but through it or above it , he realized again yet as if for the first time that this was , of course , the issue : what Tripp was trying to do . " Impossible , Anne , " he said , looking at her quiet there in this bright headache of a room , her eyes deeply asking some question of his , aware perhaps of what was happening to him . " I ca n't believep144what you say . I love the boy , " he said , more than half to himself , with one hand pinching a deep frown into his forehead , " as much as I loved his father . " " Oh , forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush her words came to him as if from some other room in some other house , and she pressed both her hands on top of his where it lay before him on the table . " Maybe I 'm crazy , " she said . " I 'm not sure of anything . " " It 's so good talking to you , " Gibbs said . " We 've talked so little , you and I. It 's been my fault , of course . I believe you , Anne . " " Then you do believe what she 's said about Tripp ? " Louise von Louwe rose from her chair and stood there black as night against the white kitchen walls , a diamond crescent glittering at her breast . " I believe that she believes it , " Gibbs said , " and on that basis I wo n't disregard it . " " Once a woman has been in love with a man , you can disregard anything she ever says about him . Privately she always disregards it herself . " Louise von Louwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier and dropped them from waist height into the garbage pail . " If you want to hear my opinion on this whole business , I will tell you . " Gibbs nodded , his hand still at his forehead . " Grown-up people , " she said , " are as a rule much simpler than you think . When you are very young , you feel you must always have a reason for whatever you do , and if you do n't have one beforehand , you will make onep145up later . If you ask a boy why he hit his brother on the head , he will tell you it was because his brother was bothering him , but actually , if the truth were known , it was probably just because he wanted to hit him anyway . When you are young , there is so much around you that you ca n't explain , that you want to be able , at least , to explain yourself . So you make up reasons for everything you do , and from your reasons you find out who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to be . You decide , for instance , that you are a person who is bothered by his brother . But when you grow up , " she continued , wiping butter from her fingers with her handkerchief , " this is no longer necessary . You have found out now who for better or worse you are , and you let simply your identity be reason enough for doing whatever you like . You do what you do because you are who you are . Tripp is still a young man  --  what is heP twenty-seven , twenty-eight ?  --  but in this sense he is grown up . He knows who he is even if we do n't , and he does n't particularly need reasons any more . I wo n't deny that he has you right now in an extremelyunpleasant position , and if he decides next week to continue this fantasy of trial and verdict , he can make it a great deal more unpleasant still . Maybe he will and maybe he wo n't . But who knows ? That is my point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . Most importantof all , Tripp himself does n't know . To say that he has some reason for doing all this , some plan for ruining you to avenge that poor Rudy , is nonsense . He is a showman , and tonight he put on a show . Next week he will putp146on another . Beyond that he is probably not consciously doing anything at all . He has no reasons , black or white . He is just a dangerous young man being dangerous . " Gibbs said nothing to this , and for a few minutes the kitchen was silent . Again he drew himself up straight until he was sitting there high and stiff in his chair , and from his pocket he took a fountain pen with which , without opening it , he traced small , invisible circles on the little space of table top cupped inside of his left hand . The pain in his head whispered on , and he made every effort not to show in his bearing how helpless he felt with Hoye making the call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in silence undoubtedly turning over and over in their minds the situation to which , hard as he tried , he himself could no more than disjointedly attend . He cleared his throat  --  a rasping , tentative sound at which Louise von Louwe glanced up at him for an instant  --  and with it , briefly , his mind , so that he caught a glimpse , at least , of what was happening beyond his dying : that for one thing he was , of course , not dying at all . He thought of his law office downtown with his books in the shelves ; his father 's safe in one corner with the name R. B. Gibbs across its front in old-fashioned , gold letters ; his secretary , a Miss Humphrey , who had retired several years before from fulltimework but who returned now whenever Gibbs himself returned , wearing the same green eyeshade and the same tan cardigan buttoned up to her chin , smelling musty and resinous like an old desk drawer . The very fact that Missp147Humphrey had not notified him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending , as for years she had notified him in advance of every other pending appointment , seemed to him proof enough that nothing of the sort was just now scheduled . It was Miss Humphrey who had explained to Rudy on his return from the two weeks ' rest that Gibbs had prescribed that under the circumstances it would be impossible to take him back at his former job . To everyone 's amusement , she had always been undisguisedly enamored of Rudy , and , once , he had taken her out to lunch and filled her with cocktails , chatteringalong with her in his amiable , directionless way , to the point of making it an episode that she had never forgottenbut filed away in her spinster 's heart and sometimeshad occasion to refer to still . Remembering Rudy , Gibbs once more came up against Tripp and Anne 's accusation . Each time it reoccurred to him it was as if for the first time  --  like recognizing a face in a crowd , then losing it and forgetting it , then seeing it again . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on it , as it were , followed close upon it and finally seized it , spinning it around to face him so that , truly for the first time , he saw the full , preposterous horror of it . The effect upon him was instantaneous . " Damn it , " he said , almost upsetting his chair by the abruptness with which he rose from it , " I 'm going to talk to him myself . " It was at just this point that Hoye flung the swingingdooropen and came back into the kitchen . " I let it ringp148twenty-five times , " he said , " and there was no answer . " " I told them there would n't be , " Anne said . " He 's there , but he wo n't answer . " " What would you have said if he had ? " Louise von Louwe asked . " I 'm fascinated to know . " " To be perfectly frank , " Hoye replied , still standing by the door and talking to her past Gibbs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . But I thought it would be a great deal better for me to , rather than you , Ansel . There 's no point in letting him know you 're excited , and I do n't think there 's any reason to be anyway . I would simply have told him that I felt he had let the discussion this evening take an unfortunate turn at the end , and as an old friend and adviser of yours , I 'd like to know how he planned to go about setting things straight next week or if the press gets hold of him before that . They may , you know , with this verdict business . Personally , I do n't blame him for not answering his telephone . " " Where does he live ? " Gibbs asked . " At the Carlyle , " Anne said . " He has a suite there . " " What 's the room number ? " he asked , and as she told him , he wrote it down on the back of an envelope . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louwe said , coming up behind him , " you 've sat here like the ghost of Christmas Past . Then you leap to your feet in a frenzy , and I 'm now steeling myself to hear you announce that you 're going to go see him this instant . " " I am going to bed , " Gibbs said . " If you 'll all excuse me . I 'm through for the day . "  | " I must be off myself , " Hoye swung open the door for Louise von Louwe and Anne to pass through , and as Gibbs followed them , clapped him on the shoulder , holding him back . " I 'll call you from the office tomorrow . If the papers try to get hold of you in the meanwhile , take my advice and be unavailable . This is all going to blow over . " The women had gone ahead into the hall , and he was left standingalone with Gibbs in the darkened dining-room . Through the French windows facing the street , they could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my books , " he said . " She 's a delightful girl and she 's got a head on her shoulders , but she 's obviously gotten herself emotionally involved with our friend . There 's only one word for that outburst tonight , breaking the cup and everything . Melodrama . If I were you , I would n't give it a second thought . There 'll be time enough to worry when the time comes . If it comes . " They were standing side by side now , looking out of the windows , and as Hoye spoke , a policeman passed , his rubber cape glistening in the light of the street lamp . Gibbs raised one hand in salutation , and the policeman returned the gesture . " I realized tonight as never before how little I know her , but there 'll never be time enough to worry about that . " As Gibbs spoke , his breath misted the cold pane . " There are many things you can call what she said , and a melodramatic , emotional outburst is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , but that only presents another question . Why ? She 's got a head onp150her shoulders , as you say , and she 's not a person to get entangled with someone who 's indifferent to her . Accordingto Louise , Tripp 's been far from indifferent . He kept after her all summer , followed her everywhere . Even Kuykendall 's come to know him . Yet neither of the times I 've seen him has he made more than the most casual reference to her . Tonight , for instance , he never asked why she had n't come to the broadcast . It surprised me that she did n't , and it certainly must have surprised him . Suddenly it seems I 'm the only member of this family he 's interested in , which means either that he 's transferred his affections from my daughter to me or he 's been pursuing her all this while for the sole purpose of eventually getting to me . " " He certainly did n't need Anne to do that , " Hoye said . " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for him to have come to you on his own , as Rudy 's son . " " If all he wanted was to ask me to appear on the air with him , yes . Or if he was simply curious , as I could well imagine his being , just to meet the man who was possibly his father 's best friend  --  who , whatever construction you want to put on it , played a major part in the last weeks of his father 's life . " " What else could he have wanted ? " " He 's the only one who can answer that , of course . If even he can , " Gibbs said , pinching the palm of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other . " What Anne said he wanted , perhaps . To finish me  --  and just when I 'd really begun . Better than that , when you come to think ofp151it . To begin me first  --  to let me first see him unscarred and forgiving  --  and then to finish me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . To each of us singly and to each through the other . " " We 've been friends a long time , Ansel . You ca n't convince me that he planned all this . " " First of all , I 'm not sure I do believe it . Secondly , if I did , believing it would n't necessarily involve believing that it was anything he 'd planned . We 're apt to destroy each other with our left hands , you know  --  without ever clearly facing the fact that we 're doing it at all , or doing so many other things at the same time that the fact 's ob-scured . " " You can put it any way you want , " Hoye said . " It 's still fantastic . " " It 's fantastic as a possibility , and it would be more so as a fact . Perhaps the best way to discover which is to do so fantastically . " " Sleep on it , " Hoye said . He stood with his hands on his hips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a vantage where he himself could not be seen , but searchingas the look was , it revealed far more about himself than ever it discovered about Gibbs . It was as if Hoye lived entirely in his eyes for the duration of it and left all the rest of that great face unguarded in the interim . If there was compassion there , anxious affection and concern for his friend , there was also the almost imperceptible , dry curse of a smile that deepens the lines of men 's mouths when they watch their own ship sink . But " Sleep on it , "  |p152he  repeated , quickly taking command of that face again , " and in the morning it will all seem just like a bad dream . " When finally Hoye had left and Louise and Anne had retired to their rooms for the night , Gibbs sat half undressedon the edge of his bed with a quilt wrapped around his shoulders . He had taken off his suit coat and his shoes and then slowly had stopped and sat down , pulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room , but because he could see that outside it was still snowing . On the table by his bed was a whisky and soda which he had poured for himself before coming up , but he left it untouched . He sat there for half an hour , hardly moving at all , until at just about quarter to two he got up , dressed again , and went downstairs . Shortly afterward , with his overcoat buttoned up to his chin , he quietly unlocked the front door and stepped out into the winter night.  |p153THE  SNOW had almost stopped as Gibbs walked up MadisonAvenue , but the street and sidewalk were still white with it , and at one corner he tripped on the curb , grabbed hold of a letter box to catch himself , but fell , heavily , on both knees . Only after some seconds was he able to rise to his feet again , the pain tightening his legs as he did so , but with the streets empty and no one to see him , it was a pain which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued along his course . It was a pain which demonstrated to him how without pain the rest of his body was , his headache gone , and with it , totally now , his sense of having been about to die . At the idea of death he had felt , after the first lurch of fear , nothing so much as a kind of teary helplessness . He might almost have told them there in the kitchen that he was dying except for knowing that emotion would have choked his words . But now , reprieved , the very ache in his knees witnessing to the durability of flesh and blood , he felt instead a rush of anger . It was an arrogance of anger ,  |p154controlled  and articulate , that fed on the very preposterousnessof what , angrily , he felt himself now forced to do : to rouse Tripp in the dark of this winter night to confront him with what he had done and to demand an explanation of what he intended next to do . The boy had come to him with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could easily guess to be Gibbs 's sense of obligation to any son of Rudy 's , had persuaded him to appear on the air with Edward Farwell . The result of this was that in the exhilaration of the moment , and with only token attempts on Tripp 's part to restore order , Gibbs had said tragically more , he had come to believe as he sat on the edge of his bed wrapped in a quilt , than ever he should have said . He had told no more and little less than the truth about himself , but it was precisely the truth that Farwell could , after all , best turn against him , appealing as he had to all publicspiritedcitizens to rise in arms against a man by admission so cold and unprincipled . Through all this Tripp had sat there in the blinding light , smiling , at ease , and then at the end had announced that yes , perhaps this had indeed been a trial , and he would be happy to oblige with a verdict of his own the following week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Farwell 's call for vengeance , and the effect upon public opinion , Gibbs thought , and thence upon the Senate itself might well , as Anne in her outburst and Porter and Louise in their comparative reluctance had asserted , be devastating . Over the years Gibbs had viewed his rise to national prominence with a curious remoteness and the absence of anything like pride  --  he had left it top155Hoye to be proud and to the others , his family , his friends , who had in one way or another risen with him  --  and until now it had been a matter of some indifference to him even whether his nomination was to be confirmed or not . But as soon as he saw his chances jeopardized from without , it became another matter altogether , especially if they were to be humiliatingly jeopardized by a boy young enough to be his son who , for all he knew , might well be capable , as Anne had claimed him to be , of somehow using her as well to work his ruin . Tightening his gloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowy pavement , no longer limping to spare his knees , but perversely rejoicing in the pain , he wore his achievement like a sword , both what he had already achieved and what he was determined now should still lie ahead of him to achieve , notwithstanding the worst that Tripp or Farwell or anyone else might try to do . For no more than an instant did he hesitate at the entrance of the Carlyle , then pushed through the revolving door and gave his directions to the elevator man with a composure and determination impenetrable enough to preclude any question as to the propriety of his arrival at so late an hour . But if the elevator man raised no such question and only set about doing neatly what he had been told he nonetheless turned for an instant toward Gibbs as they rose in their mirrored cage and gave him a glance which easily trebled Gibbs 's resolve to continue with what he had planned . He saw it as the glance of a man who not merely recognized him , but had either seen or heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mingled curiosity and amusement as yet another distinguished victim of the young man 's unique talents . Gibbs returned the glance without the faintest change of expression , standing there stiff and tall with his arms straight at his sides , and stepped out at Tripp 's floor and rang Tripp 's bell aware that the man had remained there to see if his ring was to be answered , but not once giving any sign of that awareness although it was some minutes before the door finally opened . With a surprise then that he was not quick enough to conceal , starting to speak and then stopping , sharply striking the palm of his left hand with the gloves he held in his right , he found that the personbefore him was not Tripp , but Tripp 's mother , Sylvia , who stood there in a violet dressing gown with her hair done up in a net and saying in her mild southern accent , " Ansel Gibbs . . . the last person on the face of this earth ! . . . " Unflattering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before had been , he had tended to forget the beauty which she had once been famous for , and which was apparent to him again as he faced her now . On that occasion not long after Rudy 's death when he had finally forced his way in to see her , she had been sitting up in bed in a bedjacket all made of pink ribbons , tears streaking her cold-creamed cheeks , and refusing , with her hands pressed to her ears , to hear what he had been trying to explain to her about Rudy , about what he was prepared to do in her behalf . Although she was dressed again for bed , her facep157now , although older , with a web of tiny wrinkles drawn tight about her mouth and eyes and her eyes themselves a blurred blue , was not only undistorted by grief , but so undisguisedly and delightedly surprised to see him again that much of its earlier charm returned with an intensity that took Gibbs farther back than fifteen years , to the days when she and Rudy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First World War her parents had sent her up from Savannah to Boston to live with an aunt and uncle in order to complete her education by a winter 's exposure to what they considered to be the intellectual and aristocratic capital of the North , and it was there that she had first met Rudy , who was then a senior at Harvard . Rudy , who looked upon her as his first real discovery of any importance , introduced her with pride to a number of his classmates , among them Gibbs , and it was not long before she had become so popular that a song to her appeared in a Hasty Pudding show and for a time in Cambridgethe name Sylvia Stowe came to mean to almost every undergraduate , whether he was favored by actually knowing her or not , the kind of vague , abandoned , game beauty that could go on dancing until the sun rose and then appear at a milk-punch breakfast as bright and new as the morning itself . Even after she and Rudy were engaged , her other admirers continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while it looked as though the engagement must surely be broken ; but then , just after graduation in the spring following the Armistice , they were married in Savannah , with Gibbs asp158one of the ushers , and went to live in New York . Friends never doubted that she was in love with her husband , but it was a love which required a setting of large apartments , servants , and summers on the south shore of Long Island ; and her demands of him , if never explicitly stated as such , were consequently so excessive that as a result he was constantly shifting from one job to another that paid more . Finally , in his mid-thirties , with the reputation of a delightfulbut highly undependable young man , he found himself without any job at all and accepted what amounted to little more than an impressively titled clerical position with Gibbs . It was not long after this that he shot himself in the back yard of the small house in Westchester which they had been reduced to when the city at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbs 's one meeting with Sylvia several months later , he and she had not seen each other since . So there were several minutes of just standing there on the threshold of Tripp 's apartment staring at each other with the curiously unabashed intensity possible after a separation of many years while Gibbs apologized for his untimely arrival and tried to explain , as best he could , that he had simply been passing by and , knowing that Tripp kept late hours , had stopped in hoping to find him still up . It was not until he had finished that he realized by her carefully noncommittal laugh , the little circling gesture of her right hand that could mean either amusement , surprise , or acceptance , that she had heard little if anythingof all that he had been saying and was , in fact , al/most totally deaf . But now that he was here , she said , taking him by one arm and gently drawing him into the apartment , he must sit down and have a chat about old times no matter what hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she disappeared for a minute or two to make herself more presentable . For a moment , when she had gone , Gibbs seriously consideredleaving before she returned . Tripp was apparently not at home , and if he should come back while Gibbs was still there with Sylvia , Gibbs could hardly question him as he had intended , would be hard put to justify his presence in any other terms , and the situation would be impossible . But then , partly by persuading himself that if Tripp was not at home now it was probable that he had gone away somewhere for the weekend , but largely on the basis of an irrepressible curiosity to see Sylvia again , he decided to stay . He sat down on a wood chest by the fireplace , rubbing his knees where he had bruised them , and glanced about Tripp 's living-room . It was a large room with white walls and a deep red rug , a grand piano in one corner , but otherwise sparsely , almost shabbily , furnished with a number of pieces that Gibbs guessed must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudy 's . He had expected something interior-decorated and theatrical , and tried to picture the boy moving about here instead , among these rather frayed relics of his parents ' past , playing the piano or sitting with his long legs stretched out , as they always seemed to be , over the arm of the sofa or across the back of the dark-stained pigskin pig which appeared top160serve as either a couch or footstool . But he found that he could not picture Tripp at all , neither here nor anywhere , and all that he could summon up in his mind was his likenessas it had appeared on the cover of Time , which he had seen framed on the studio wall earlier that evening  --  his head tipped slightly back and his smile precariously wide as though he were about to burst into laughter . For the first time it occurred to Gibbs that laughter was perhaps what the boy might have chosen to greet him with had he and not Sylvia opened the apartment door , and he tormented himself by conjecturing , while he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that he had already allowed himself to be made a fool of once that evening and , in coming here now , was only making a fool of himself again . Yet it had seemed no foolishness when he had started out . Only now , in tranquil reflection , did Gibbs realize what had been the extent of his anxiety as he had left Louise 's house and the degree to which he had no less than actually hated the boy who had with the effortlessnessof a young athlete managed to twist out of shape not only Anne 's life , but , or so it had seemed at the moment , the life and ambitions of Gibbs himself . Now , however , while he waited for his old friend 's widow to make herself more presentable , as she had said , these emotions slipped out from beneath him , and he felt himself floundering there foolishly indeed , seeing all the events of the evening as a kind of fever-dream from which he was only at this point awakening to discover that in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trippp161should yet arrive , be obliged to continue playing an aberrationalrole by which he himself was no longer convinced . He had risen from the chest to walk briskly to the other side of the room where on a table stood a photograph of Rudy , when Sylvia re-entered . She wore the same dressing gown , but with a spray of artificial lilies of the valley pinned to its sash , and her hair , a cinnamon-colored mixture of gray and light brown , no longer in a net but brushed out fluffily to conceal the mechanism of a hearingaidwhich just barely showed behind her left ear . She had put on lipstick and powder , and , with a little twitch of her violet skirt as she passed around the table , came to stand by Gibbs before the photograph of Rudy . " Ansel , let me look at you , " she said , turning him towardher and presenting herself to be looked at again now that she had had time to prepare for it properly . " I 'm sure you must have some serious reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm not even going to ask you what it is . I 'm just going to feast my eyes on you for a few minutes . A lot of hair 's gone through the comb since the last time I had a chance to . " Gibbs , breaking away from her scrutiny under the pretextof reaching for a cigarette which he did not want , repeated the substance of his earlier explanation of why he had come , adding this time that , as she undoubtedly knew , he had been on Robin 's program that evening and was interested to know how he thought it had gone . Of all of this , Sylvia appeared to hear little more than her son 's name and made him the subject of her next speech . Shep162had been having such a lovely few days with Robin , she said . As Ansel probably knew , she explained , she was married again , to a Southerner this time , and living in a little mud hut in Georgia , but she had come north to do some shopping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . He had left town after his broadcast that night , and she herself would be flying home in the morning . She was so terrified of airplanes , she said with a little grimace , that the thought of getting into one always kept her awake trembling the whole night before , and that was why she had heard the doorbell when he rang . Gibbs noticed as their conversation continued that she spoke almost entirely in statements or , if ever she asked a question , either supplied him with an answer which he could simply nod to or put it in such a way that just a yes or a no from him was sufficient . If , for his part , he kept to her subject , whatever it happened to be , she seemed able to gauge the general tenor of what he was saying and to respondrelevantly if not directly to it , but if ever he changed the subject , she was clearly lost . On these occasions , however , she never asked him to repeat or in any other way admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of her hand , the same soft , aimless laugh contrived to be understood in any one of a half-dozen different ways , continued on some lonely path of her own . What was originally Gibbs 's surprise at her seeming to be quite unawarethat he had appeared that night on Tripp 's broadcastvanished with his realization that Tripp had withoutp163doubt spoken to her of it , but that she had simply not heard . The turns that their conversation took were thus entirelySylvia 's to determine , and if Gibbs 's first reaction to this was one of frustration , he came soon to appreciate his freedom simply to listen , observe , and occasionally commentwithout the necessity or , for that matter , the possibility of making any greater effort . She had brought with her a silver tray containing whisky , water , and ice , and , pouring them each a highball , she settled back among the cushions of the sofa with Gibbs beside her and talked on , for the most part without interruption , until for whole minutes at a time Gibbs forgot who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to what he must return , and was so entirely taken up in the world of Sylvia Stowe , Sylvia Tripp , that he found it more and more difficult as she went along to step back far enough out of it to realize either that hers was only one of many worlds or that any more had taken place in the last fifteen years than what she chattered on about now . It occurred to him only that , quite apart from any sentimental attachment to them , a man is so inextricably bound to the friends of his youth that no matter how light a view , if any , he may take of them during the increasingly long and unregretted periods of their absence , as soon as they reappear , all that has taken place without them seems to become insubstantial and irrelevant by comparison . " Oh Ansel , it 's so queer to be old , " she said . " I canp164hardly believe it . And yet I am , you know . Nobody 's sure how much . I 've lied about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I used to tell Robin I was as old as the century , but once when he was a little boy he said to a good-for-nothing brother of mine  --  just think of it . Mummy 's as old as the century is , and in 1900 she was zero . ' And Brother said , Son , in 1900 your mother was punching cows . ' So that did n't work any more . And now even the century 's too old for me to have as a twin . It 's a losing battle . So much has happened . My boy is a famous man . Just in terms of money , he makes more in a week than his father ever brought home in a year , and his pictureeverywhere you look  --  on billboards along the public road and in any magazine you 'd ever care to pick up . You 'd think I 'd be proud of him , and I am , but his little joke is that I 'm not even interested in what he does . Of course , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I keep losing track of it and forget to make enough fuss over him for it . And here you are , Ansel . My own age or maybe a year or two older , and I read in the paper that you 're going to be in the President 's Cabinet . If I have great-grandchildren , they 'll be reading about you in history books . I still ca n't help wondering what Rudy would think about it all if somehow he could know . I had the strangest dream about him once . It was during the war , years after he died , and yet he seemed to be in the Navy , stationed on some far-off island in the Northern Sea or somewhere . He was wearing a peajacket and one of those dark blue knitted sailors ' caps pulled way down , and he told me how worriedp165he was about everything  --  the war , our safety , Robin 's and mine . He told me to be careful . You 'd think the least they could have done would be to have made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was , poor lamb . I 've never forgotten that dream . I do n't believe in them , though . Do your ? You believe old women and black mammies are the only ones who put any store by them . When Rudy died , we had a funny little nigger working for us named Bessy . You should have heard her murder the king 's English . She kept cartoons of milk in the icebox and was always buying cosmeterics for her daughter who spoke French influently . She also believed in spirits . She called them spurts . On her Thursdays off she used to go in to a medium in Port Chester , and in one of their sessions they got word that there was a young man who was trying terribly hard to get hold of my little black Bessy . He was very good-looking and very excited to get this message through . It was Rudy , of course , and she told me all about it later . I asked her what the message was , and you 'll never guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine it ? And Rudy was never very keen on apples anyway . I went to her myselfonce , the medium , and she told me to beware of people whose names began with M , B , and G  --  she did n't even say whether she meant first or last names  --  and she tied somethingup in my handkerchief which she told me I was to take out in twenty-one days and throw over my left shoulder . To this day I do n't know what ever became of that handkerchief . I 've always thought I still might eventuallycome across it and find out what she put inside.  | " Someday you 'll have to meet my husband , Ed Muller . He would have come up with me this trip except he could n't get away from business . Business being cotton . He has mills all over the south , and he 's in Who 's Who , so you can see I got myself a real guy again . It 's not the same as young love , first love . . . heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend all the rest of your born days looking for it . But we 're dear pals , Ed and I , and I love him . He 's not like you or Rudy or any of the other Harvards or Princetons . He does n't have that easy , gay way with him , and he 's a man without the slightest notion how to relax . He 's farm born and bred , one of six boys and three girls , and all he has he 's made on his own . He 's gentle and kind and honest , and I 'll never forget something Robin once said about him . It made a lasting impression on me . He 's worth all the rest of us put together , ' my boy said , and I think he was probably right . " I do n't want to pat myself on the back or anything , but all in all I think he 's turned out all right , this Robin of mine , do n't youD Of course , it was n't easy being both father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be  --  Ed and I were n't married till he was almost twenty  --  and in some ways I know I spoiled him silly , but in other ways I always leaned on him like a husband , and from the day his father died he had to bear responsibilities way beyond his years . It only hurts me a little sometimes that we have n't stayed closer than we have . We 're still great pals , and we pay each other little visits like this one , but he 's a man now , and naturally he is n't going to come to me withp167all his troubles any more . To look at him , you 'd never think he had troubles  --  so handsome and sure of himself and famous  --  but I know he does . Rudy 's death for one thing . In some queer way that 's with him still . When Rudy did it , I 'm sure it seemed like such a simple thing to him . He just decided the time had come for him to step out , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the right thing . The only thing . But , oh , Ansel , an act like that casts such a long shadow . I 'll never understand how he could do it . He tried to make it look like an accident so I would get the insurance . He wanted people to think he 'd gone out to shoot crows the way he sometimes did early in the morning and had just tripped over a croquet wicket , but , of course , nobody was fooled for a minute . He left me a note in a place he thought no one else would ever find it . It was the year Gone with the Wind came out , and he wrote it on the last page of the copy he knew I was reading . I did n't find it till almost six weeks later . He just said he loved me with all his heart , but that he was weak and no good and this would be the best way out for both of us . He said he wanted Robin to have his pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never had an idea in the world that anything like that was in his mind . Of course , I knew he 'd been terribly overtired and had had certain disappointments , but nothing like this . Why , even that last night , Ansel . . . we always had a double bed  --  neither of us could get to sleep any other way  --  and he slept that night  --  I 've never told this to another living soul  --  he slept with his hand on my breast . I never even felt him get up in168 The Return of Ansel Gibbsthe morning . Then that crazy little Bessy came running in to tell me what had happened . I thought she must have gone out of her head . And it 's a funny thing , but I think of his two parents , it 's his father Robin looks back to most now . You notice the only photograph in this whole room is that one of Rudy you were looking at when I came back . I suppose it 's because Rudy never lived long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . I realize now I made many bad mistakes , but how could I have realized it thenP You do for a child what seems the best thing at the time . " I 'm so glad he 's come to know you , Ansel . It 's only right that he should , after all , and it was such a joy for me to hear how much he 's been seeing of your Anne . Of course , I have n't set eyes on her myself since she was a tiny little thing , but she sounds like such a dear . Do you have a picture with youP Of course not . Only mothers and sweetheartscarry pictures any more . I do n't know how she feels about him  --  she probably has loads of other beaux  --  but I think he 's really serious about her . It would be such fun if something actually came of it some day  --  such a lovely end to a long story . It would make so many people happy . A kind of vindication almost , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't suppose I 'd bring this up if I had any sense . All my life I 've been saying things at night I could have bitten my tongue off for the next morning . There 's something about its being dark outside  --  all the sharp edges of things get blurred . I 'm not a very religious woman any more , I 'm afraid . I think a lot of the awful things thatp169happen in this world are harder to explain if you believe in God than if you do n't . And I gather the church says that suicide is a sin while in my opinion  --  I know this is terrible to say  --  I think that if sin 's mixed up in it at all , it 's a sin of God 's to let life do such things to people . But what I mean is I believe that , God or no God , as far as Rudy and everything is concerned , it all turned out the only way it could . I do n't blame anybody any more , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore a grudge against you  --  there 's no use pretending I did n't  --  that time is dead and gone . So do let 's be friends again . I 'll never talk your ear off this way again , I promise . You may have noticed I 've gotten a little hard of hearing in my old age , and sometimes I think I keep on jabbering just so I wo n't have to try to listen . But when I come to the city , I can call you up once in a while , and maybe when you 're down in Washington , you can come on down a little farther and spend a few days with Ed and me . We 'd love it . And do be good to my boy . He and Ed get on terribly well together , but when you come right down to it they do n't speak the same language , and what I think my Robin needs more than anything else is some wise , older man he can talk to sometimes . And now let 's have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go home to bed . " Gibbs took the glass she handed him and leaning slightly forward said as distinctly as he could : " I 've never thought of you as anything but a friend , Sylvia . I 've always had and I always will have your and your son 's best interests at heart . "  | " Heart ? " She seemed really determined this time to hear all that he had said and looked at him intently as he spoke , her lips compressed in a bewildered , self-conscious smile . " I 've never thought of you , " he began again , more loudly this time , almost shouting , but at the familiar wave of her hand , the faint laugh , he stopped . " You and I , " he said , pointing at them both in turn . " We will always be friends . Friends , " he repeated , and then lightly kissed his hand to her to illustrate his meaning . " Friends always , " she said , leaning back into the cushionsagain and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here 's to you , Sylvia Stowe , " Gibbs said in his normal tone of voice , raising his glass to her though she could not see him . " God forgive us all . " He rose to go soon after that , but not before writing a note to leave for Tripp in which he said : Boy : I dropped by here in some anxiety to see how you thought things had gone this evening . Why did n't you shut me up when I started getting out of hand ? If they hang me to a sour apple tree , I 'll hold you personally responsible . But I ca n't believe that all is entirely black , perhaps not even the human heart . I 've had a fine chat with your mother . A. G.He kissed Sylvia good-night at the door and walked back to Louise von Louwe 's house through the night , which had become much colder and clear , the sky bright with stars and a thin , high moon . He lay down on his bed without undressingand within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on a Friday , and on Saturday morning Dr. Kuykendall tried to reach Gibbs by telephone from East Harlem only to be told by a harassed Walter that there had been countless calls already that morning , there were about half a dozen reporters waiting across the street at that very moment , and the only informationwhich he , Walter , was authorized to give out was that Mr. Gibbs , together with Miss Gibbs and Miss von Louwe , had left by car early that morning for a day in the country and were not expected to return until either late that night or sometime the following day . Dr. Kuykendall then tried to telephone Tripp , but no one answered there at all . With his pastoral calls to make , several hundred letters appealing for money to sign , and his sermon still to prepare for the next day , he nonetheless left the poorly lit vestry at the rear of the Church of the Holy Innocents which served as his office and bought copies of all the leading newspapers . He returned to his office with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to within a few inchesp172of the printed page spent the next hour reading all that there was on the subject of Gibbs 's encounter with Farwell . The Senator had issued a brief statement from his hotel room shortly after returning from the studio , and this was reprinted in full everywhere : I have great respect for anyman who can be as frank about himself as Mr. Gibbs was tonight . It was as much of a surprise to me as I am sure it was to everybody else listening in . I nevertheless believe that his ideas and beliefs as he painted them himself are not those which this country wants in the executive branch of its government . This kind of cold intellectual approach which plays with words and dodges issues , which looks down its nose at many of the ideals that have made this nation great , may fit Mr. Gibbs for a college professorship , but not for the cabinet . If Mr. Gibbs said one article first appeared before the television cameras looking every inch the distinguished world citizen and speaking with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming to a close he had the haggard , flustered look of a man who had put both feet in his mouth and knew it . The general view reported another is that Gibbs like his unnamed friend has committed suicide  --  political suicide . There are certainly few public figures who have ever pulled more boners in public . But there are others who say it 's the smartest move he has ever made . The American people are always suckers for a man who gives the impression of having owned up to the worst . Whether the distinguished appointee stands to win or lose by his words last night , we rejoice in the fact that apparentlyp173genuine personal honesty can still flourish in the political scene . Whether or not you can agree with all of the rather world-weary and , in some cases , painfully blunt remarks that he made about our civilization , you ca n't help giving at least two cheers for the courage he showed in making them . It is difficult to predict what effect if any the Farwell-Gibbs affair will have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet . The issues he raised cut across party lines and even the left-right cleavage . A great deal will depend upon what reception the Senator 's appeal to the public receives , and Robin Tripp 's verdict ' is also bound to be of no small significance . Informed sources in the capital say the President feels it unnecessary to issue any official statementat this time . It is not expected that he will withdraw his nomination . Debate in the Senate , however , promises to be vigorous . Robin Tripp , the dead-end kid of TV , must be really laughing up his sleeve this morning . By high-pressuring eggheadI-am-civilization Gibbs into putting on the gloves with two-fisted Ed Farwell , he sponsored the comedy bout of the season . Ansel went down to the count of ten in round one . But definitely . Score one up for the young maestro . Kuykendall pushed the papers aside and tipped back in his chair . There was Inez Rosas with a son up for parole if an employer could be found to guarantee him work , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for a pair of shoes , whereas it was the staff 's unanimous conviction that she would use it instead on food for the eleven dogs and three cats who shared her cellar room . Riversidep174Hospital was conducting a free series of lectures on employment-counselingfor ex-drug addicts . Would anyone from the Parish be free to attend ? What do you preach to a congregation twenty-five per cent of which has come to church for an hour of sleep in a place with a more comfortabletemperature than a doorway or an abandoned automobile rusting on its wheel-rims east of Third Avenue in the low hundreds ? He picked up a mimeographed sheetheaded Minutes of Christian Action Committee , Jan. 3 andwith a black carpenter 's pencil scrawled across it , " Christiansno longer act . They form committees , " then threw it into the top of his portable typewriter case , which served as a wastepaper basket . He left the vestry-office and walked down the few stairs into the sanctuary itself . Looking across the rows of empty pews , he could see through the window a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . In the central aisle between the pews was the customary litter of candy wrappers , bits of newspaper , discarded ordersof service from vespers the evening before . From the half-domed ceiling above the communion table the paintingon plaster of the Virgin , a relic of the church 's more prosperous days under an Italian Catholic congregation , still visibly stared down through the thin coat of whitewashwith which it had been covered before Kuykendall 's incumbency . Ile went to the pulpit and from the lectern took the heavy Bible and sat down with it in one of the front pews to look for a text for the next day 's sermon . Unthinkingly , with his right hand he held together the pagesp175of the New Testament and with his left opened to somewherenear the beginning of the Old . " Messieurs , " he had frequently said in his lecturing days , " I do n't want to cause the pious among you undue pain , but the New Testamentwithout the Old is in constant danger of becoming superficial and banal . In addition to everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was Israel , and it is Israel 's Heilsgeschichle , the sacred history of the elect of Jahweh , that you must know to know him . " And that was twenty years ago , he thought , and maybe he had been right and maybe he had not . He let the book fall closed between his knees and sat there staring fixedly forward , his face like that of a tragic Punch , the nose and chin , as Louise von Louwe had remarked , looking as though at any moment they might meet in front of the small , thin-lipped mouth . It was only at this point that he thought again of Gibbs and what he had read . In a bar on Second Avenue with a glass of vermouth and water before him , and persuading the bartender to switch his set from a professional wrestling match to Tripp 's program , he had watched Gibbs 's image , hoping always that it would somehow become Jeremiah in the valley of the son of Hinnom  --  seizing a potter 's vessel of invective and smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord of Hosts , Behold I will bring upon this city all the evil that I have pronounced against it because they have hardened their necks that they might not hear my words . ' " And yet it had in no sense been a complete disappointment to hear instead the even accents of Gibbs ob/liquefy inveighing against a mediocrity and complacency of sentiment , the general refusal of men to admit to the tragic ambivalence of a world where what looks like the holiest cause may have perdition in it and winning is often indistinguishable from losing . Only " Go to , go to , " he had kept repeating in his mind , " speak in concrete terms of the worst there is , the pain , the tedium , the despair , " whereuponGibbs began to speak of Rudy , of the worst , perhaps , that he had known , Kuykendall thought , but less than enough , less than enough . " For the most part , my prayers are sheer blubbering , " he had told a generation of undergraduates , but in that bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter on his tongue , for a prophet to appear on the trembling , blue-white screen where instead there was only Gibbs  --  perhaps the best that you could hope for , he thought . And he had thought as well of Rudy : how in him he might have found his prophet  --  in the young power of him , in his charm that you felt like a hand when he entered a room , that he , Kuykendall , need only have somehow directed , yet had not . " Who am I to tell them to give up the latitudes of joy they were created for to become stewards of the mystery and agony of Christ ? " he had asked and kept on asking until at last he had left teaching to become ordained himself , to minister to the abandoned of God , as he had put it , since he could not bring himself to recruit for His army . And still  --  crying out against what he called the idiocy and fraudulence of his own move , calling himself a combination of Tartuffe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay , whop177assisted him in East Harlem and asked himself the same question again about them : who were they to have sacrificedtheir chance for joy as the world richly knows it for the sake of living and working in the squalor of these streets for a cause that might or might not stem from some sick desire in themselves for self-punishment or Heaven only knew what ? Men and women alike , they all developed after a time a curious remoteness of heart , gradually showingless love of the poor than cold misunderstanding of all who did not share their poverty . They became obsessed with their own roles as dispensers of mercy , were constantlymeeting in each other 's rooms , which were studiedlyno less bleak than the rooms of their poorest charges , and evaluating each other 's and their own motives , achievements , and failures . Honey Gruber , the plump , pretty young woman in charge of doling out free clothes , developed after two years the ability of laughing rather than bursting into tears over the grotesqueness of the little knot of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But learning not to weep at them , she learned as well not to weep with longing , as once she had , for the day when at last she would marry and leave the parish for good , but tended now only to laugh at any young man who ever gave evidence of trying to persuade her to leave it for him . The demands of the Lord were great and terrible , Kuykendall had thought as he sat there watching television , and it was no wonder to him that Gibbs spoke with something less than the voice of prophecy that he had nonetheless so hoped for a time to hear from him . " To be ap178prophet of Jahweh , " he had said to the bartender , who stood polishing a glass as he listened to Gibbs , " is to rend your garments and curse the day you were born . " Henry Kuykendall sat now in his empty church with the Bible shut on his lap , his eyes closed , and thought of all that Gibbs might have said  --  about cities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same self-obsessed valiance as the individuals composing them ; about the wrath of Jahweh speaking his awful judgments in the tongue of history with his spirit descending on the chosen and in the end destroying them ; about the chosen nation of the Jews which alone at the time believed in a God who acted in history only to be itself , as a nation , demolished in history . And yet in the end you could only fall to your face in the unbearable light , Christ with you and for you , you hoped , and blubber : " Thou only art God . " Kuykendall opened the Bible to the first book of Samuel and found his text  --  " But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul , and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him . "  --  then let the book fall shut with a report that echoed the length of the sanctuary . In the vestry again he signed the three hundred letters asking for money , dropped them off with Honey at the parish office to fold , stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate and a glass of sweet , pink milk at the candy store at the corner . Ile cut his calls short , sat with Inez Rosas while she nursed her baby and talked on and on of the goodness of her son and the evil of his companions , her voice growing gradually tinier and more persistent until it began top179pierce his ear like a pin and he rose to go , promising to find work for the boy if he could , and leaving abruptly then to the sound of her " Adios , Enrique , " which she spoke dreamily , as though he was already miles away . Mrs. Tyree refused to sit down for the length of his visit , but stood barefoot on the stone floor of her cellar covered with dogsoilednewspaper and spoke to him about shoes while her dogs nosed at his laces . There were others whom he had intended to see as well that afternoon , but he returned to his office instead and began work on his sermon . With a congregation as variegated as his  --  the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout ladies and few men of the parish whose command of English was for the most part deficient , and the seminary students who did their field work under him and herded their Sunday-school classes in to morning service  --  he found that for all tastes the best that he could do was to retell the stories of the Bible , which were , he pointed out to them , the stories of themselves as well . This was his forte , and he acted them out , frequently coming down from the pulpit and using as his stage the center aisle , where , with a gift for characterizationby which he transfixed the seminary students as readily as the regular parishioners , he virtually became Noah drunk , Abraham forcing up his hand to strike down Isaac in sacrifice , or , as on this particular Sunday which he was preparing for now , Saul in the dark tent of his despair and young David at the harp . he had never yet preached such a sermon without the painful conviction , once he had finished , of having made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time obliged to admit that this had been very nearly , yet somehow , miraculously , never quite the case . On this Sunday , furthermore , there was not only the sermon for him to anticipate , but the bazaar . The Protestants of the area were by no means its most numerous religious group . The Catholics outnumbered them ; and then there were also the adherents of the small pentecostal churches which flourished for as long as the voluble spirit lasted and the tambourines rattled , and then disappeared to be replaced by others ; and , in addition , there were those people who consulted practitioners of black magic  --  interpreters of dreams and dispensers of charms against disappointment in love and disease . But on the occasion of parish bazaars , Protestants appeared who had never come forward to be recognized as such before , and in numbers so large that the basement gymnasiumof the Church of the Holy Innocents was filled to capacity . There was a rummage sale of clothes , shoes , toys , collected from charitable institutions and individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight-guessing , ring tosses , a fortune teller ; one section of the gymnasium floor was roped off for dancing ; and free refreshments were served . " Belshazzar himself would pale at the sight , " Kuykendall said , and he depended heavily upon Anne Gibbs to help him with the organization . She was in generalof great help and comfort to him , being the only one of of his staff who had come to him from outside of the church in one or another of its ramifications , and who ,  |p181exce|pt  for her several hours a week with him , had remainedoutside . It was likely to be to Anne that he confidedhis darkest suspicions concerning his whole function in East Harlem . " Has it ever occurred to you , " he had asked , " that they might be much better off without our endless meddlingP Thank God at least for the likes of you who can look at us through secular eyes and tell us when we 're becoming really insufferable . Only for the love of heaven never forget to tell us " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his most impassioned indictments . " Damn it all , " he had once exclaimed , " the sweet , the reasonable the pious ! You go to church and listen to the preacher . Notice the gentle , other-worldly look about him , and do n't miss his sensitive hands either . He 'll take a cocktail , too , if you offer it to him , and he plays a dandy game of golf . He talks about injustice in ethical , Platonic terms . See what a lovely picture he paints . So perfect and so true . I nod and smile . I go away feeling all nice and clean inside . But show me a Puerto Rican boy whose hand has been held over a gas burner until his fingers are black and his eyes start to pop out of his head because he would n't get down on his hands and knees and kiss the American flag , and then . . . " his voice had risen harsh and raucous , " then I know what you 're talking about . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help with the bazaar as she had helped with the last one in September , and Tripp also had volunteered to come , but now , Kuykendallthought , it was unlikely that he could count on either of them , what with Anne 's having fled the city with herp182father , and Tripp 's being apparently no less determined to remain out of sight until the furor which he had caused subsided . So early Sunday afternoon , still shuddering at the memory of his sermon on Saul and David , he set about managing as best he could without them . People had alreadybegun to gather in front of the church door waiting for admittance while he and the crew-cut young rectors who assisted him supervised the preparation of the gymnasium . With the help of Honey Gruber and the other permanentsocial workers , they strung red and yellow crepepaperstreamers around the walls , mixed an enormous bowl of grape juice and water , instructed the parishioners who were to run the various entertainments , and out of a considerably scratched and outmoded collection of phonographrecords picked several dozen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , and within minutes the large floor was at least half filled . Kuykendall stood at the foot of the stairs to greet them as they entered , and to his surprise one of the last to come down was Tripp . In an O.D. rubber raincoat and his Army boots still wet with snow , he shook hands with Kuykendall as a group of Negro children came pushing through past him , and apologized for being late . He had gone out Friday night to his agent 's on Long Island , he explained , but , of course , he had intended to come in to the bazaar today as he had promised , and needed now only to be told what to do . " Unless of course , " he said , grinning up at Kuykendall as he bent over to brush the snow out of his trouser cuffs ,  | " you happen to share everybody else 's opinion that I 'm a scheming S.O.B . who ought to be excommunicated , gelded , and burned at the stake . " In that case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flames together . Was Anne there by any chance ? the young man asked then , but before Kuykendall had a chance to reply , a group of high-school girls , recognizing Tripp , crowded around him so that Kuykendall was left alone to call Honey Gruber over to see what task they could assign to him . Everything had been pretty much parceled out by now , she said , standing there in her sneakers with her hair done up in a tight blonde bun , and eying Tripp , still surrounded by admirers , with a look of uncertain speculation . But there was one thing that she had seen done with great success on similar occasions elsewhere , she said , which he might be willing to undertake . But probably he would not , she added as he broke away from the girls to come up to them , and she had to be coaxed by Tripp even to say what it was . The three of them stepped into a small storage room where the gymnasium equipment was kept , and with a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung it from the ceiling , securing the bottom to the floor with a string or wire so that you had in effect a fixed rubber screen with a hole in the middle . Then you got somebody to sit behind it on a high stool with his head thrust through the hole , and for five cents people could buy three balls of rolled-up newspaper dipped in water to throw at the head from a reasonable distance . " It 's fair for you to duck if youp184can , and their aim is usually lousy anyway , and it does n't hurt even if it does hit you , " she said , at which Tripp , grabbing up a basketball , bounced it against the wall twice and then threw it at Honey , who caught it hard against her breast . " You 've got yourself a sucker , " he told her , and with a look of amused horror from Kuykendall , they stepped out onto the main floor again and , going off in search of a clear area at its far end , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a celebrity , as was Robin Tripp to them , only momentarily distracted those who had noticed him enter , and as soon as he was gone , they mingled again with the others while Kuykendall stayed by the door to greet anyone else who might still come , and viewed the proceedings from there . Only a few faces among them all were not familiar to him , and for the most part he had not only seen them before , but had in one way or another had dealings with them . There were the boys in their late teens who , so long as they stood , as now , somewhat aloof from the others , constituted a danger of which no one in the entire room was totally unaware . Everything depended upon the nature of whatever it was that first caught their attention as a group , and if it should turn out to be the least sign in anyone of authority that they were being especially watched , in some way discriminated against , or , worst of all , made fun of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an almost visible relaxing of every face in the room as soon as Spook , a tall Negro boy who had left school at sixteen after some successp185as an amateur boxer and was their acknowledged leader , asked one of the girls to dance , whereupon , one by one , the others followed him . At the rummage table , women held clothes out at arms ' length to look for holes . Inez Rosas 's oldest son , brother of the one eligible for parole if first a job could be found for him , held a thin , fierce-eyed Czech named John Brno under the arms and lifted him experimentally , in an effort to guess his weight . Brno lived on the same block on which was Honey 's office , and was always either muttering somber threats against the parish or brushing away tears of gratitude to it . He was a very angry , very sentimental man , and in his daily progress up and down the block , sometimes drunk , sometimes sober , he always took along with him his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he called upon to express whatever the emotion was which his father currently felt but was characteristically too overcome to describe . Kuykendall noticed that Mrs. Tyree was also there in bedroom slippers augmented by rags wrapped under her insteps and tied around her ankles , drinking one paper cup of grape juice after another as she watched a group of men tossing rubber rings from Mason jars at a table littered with packages of cigarettes , toothpaste , chewing gum . And it was all of these , Kuykendall thought , who had sat in his church that morning and heard him tell the story of Saul and David . Unconsciously he grimaced at the memory . Standing between the two front pews , he had let his arms hang limp at his sides , his shoulders stooped and hisp186head bowed , and in a voice so low and desolate that even the Sunday-school classes stopped fidgeting to listen , had said : " Saul was the first king of the Jews and a proud and mighty man , but he sat in the gloom of his black tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and an evil spirit of the Lord had come to trouble him . God had commandedhim to do certain terrible and frightening things , and Saul had not been able to do them . God had told him to kill Agag , the king of the Amalekites , but Saul did not hate Agag enough to kill him , and the prophet Samuel had to instead . Agag fell to his knees , " Kuykendall had continued , half crouching there , throwing his arms up as if in supplication , his voice almost breaking as with sudden force he cried out , " Surely the bitterness of death is past ! ' but the prophet Samuel hewed him in pieces with Saul standing by . I believe myself that if Saul , who had not hated Agag enough to kill him , had loved him enough to save him , God would not have punished him for his disobedience . But Saul had neither loved nor hated enough , and the evil spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he sat sick and alone in his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prophet Samuel had wanted him to be . But then  --  what was that strange , sweet sound he heard ? " By this time Kuykendall had walked halfway down the aisle , and at these words he spun around , his hand cupped to his ear , his stare wild and questioning . " What was the sound the king heard ? It was the sound of a harp . Can you hear it ? Listen . Listen . It 's the sound of soft , summer rain when for days the sidewalks have beenp187scorching hot and the air is filled with dust . It 's a sound like the smell of food when your stomach aches with hunger . Once you heard that harp , nothing was ever so sweet again because it was the boy David who played it , and suddenly Saul forgot all troubles , and for a while it seemed as if the evil spirit of the Lord had departed from him . " And what sense had they made of that ? Kuykendall wondered now , standing by the door as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian church , " a voice asked from behind him , " or the Darktown Strutters ' Ball ? " and turning quickly around , he saw Louise von Louwe standing in the doorway . " It 's still snowing in the country , " she continued , " and we were afraid if we did n't leave soon , we would n't be able to get out at all and Ansel would never make it to Washington tomorrow . Anne said she was expected here anyway , so we 've all come to you for sanctuary . " She stood there in a Persian-lamb coat with a black felt hat pinned to her hair by a garnet , her face pale with cold . Even as she spoke , Gibbs and Anne appeared in the doorway behind her . The realization that Louise would now be confronted by John Brno , that Gibbs was within a few minutes of coming face to face for the first time with Mrs. Tyree , that , in general , worlds so remote from one another could so fantastically collide , left Kuykendall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her own explanation , her own apology , gave him time to collect himself , and with a comic shrug of helplessness at the kermis beforep188them , he made them welcome . Having as his last memory of Gibbs the tired , aging face which he had seen on the television screen two nights before , Kuykendall felt now that not for years had he found him looking so well . About his eyes there was a certain puffiness that suggested lack of sleep , but the whole cast of his face looked firmer , less almostpathetically dependent for its expressions upon the expressions and words of others , and he seemed in excellentspirits . For years , he said , he had been meaning to make it his business to find out exactly what it was that Kuykendall was up to here in the city , and he was grateful for the circumstances , however tempestuous and Wagnerian , that had made it at last possible for him to do so . Dr. Kuykendall must go on with whatever his function was , and he and Louise would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood it , had duties of her own to perform . For an instant Kuykendall was filled with fear for Gibbs , almost came to the point of actually warninghim not to wander out onto the crowded gymnasium floor at all . It was as if the very appearance of him  --  his thin hair brushed immaculately back on his forehead , his suit dark and soft against the starched white of his collar , his whole bearing so tall and kingly , so graciously and precisely just  --  would arouse in these people from another geography , another astronomy altogether , such emotions of astonishment , admiration , fury , that they could adequatelyexpress them only by falling upon him and tearing him to pieces . With at least half of his purpose , then , being simply to hold Gibbs back , Kuykendall chose this time top189congratulate him on his performance with Farwell . In the stress of the moment he made no attempt , as under more normal circumstances he might have , to add to his praise some mention of the rather less restrained and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbs but had not , and the result of this was that he knew even as he spoke that he was evincing more enthusiasmthan actually he felt . But Gibbs gave no sign of detecting this , merely listened intently , thanked him , and , by making no further comment , left it to Kuykendall either to think of some other subject with which to detain him or to let him go . Anne had by this time already gone off to help out at the rummage table , and it was Louise von Louwe who relieved Kuykendall of the necessity for making any such decision by announcing that she herself was going to " plunge in , " as she put it , and Ansel might accompany her or not as he chose . With a nod to Kuykendall , Gibbs set off after her . Almost immediately , with Louise von Louwe having gone off in some direction of her own , Gibbs found himself alone in the crowd and , by edging his way slightly to one side , was able to get near to the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A number of people stood in front of him , but he was a good head taller than the tallest of them , and his view was unbroken . He remained there watching for a time until a short and almost totally black colored girl in a dress of so deep a purple that it seemed to be of one piece with her rich skin , pushed around in front of him and rolling her eyes in mock horror at his heightp190gave out the hoarse screech of a tropical bird . The couples went on dancing  --  the boys ' faces painstakingly indifferent as though it was by some tedious accident that they happened to be holding girls in their long arms  --  and none of the spectators turned to see who had screamed or why , but Gibbs nonetheless softly shouldered his way farther back into the room , leaving the dancers behind him . Mrs. Tyree held out a paper cup of grape juice to him as he approached , but he failed to notice her gesture and unknowingly , as he passed by , knocked her arm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the front of her moth-eaten sweater . Over a number of heads he caught sight for a moment of Louise von Louwe apparently dickering with one of the women in charge of the rummage sale over the price or condition of something that seemed to be heavy and black with a handle to it . Kuykendall 's young associate minister , recognizing him , shook his hand and said something , but Gibbs could not hear what it was . He sat down for a few moments on one of a number of wooden folding chairs lined up along the wall . It was Porter Hoye who had suggested that he leave the city the day before , and with Louise and Anne he had driven out to an inn in Connecticut where he had spent most of the time in his room , watching the snow fall and reading the newspapers . Louise had called Walter twice to discover what was happening there , and Hoye  --  the only person entrusted with the details of their whereabouts  --  had telephoned Gibbs periodically to keep him informed in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been said on Friday night . He had himself been approached from several different quarters , Hoye said , to identify Rudy , but interest in that question was less than he had expected it to be and seemed already to have died for lack of nourishment . In a few days , he reassuringlytold Gibbs , the whole business would have blown over . Louise had brought her needlepoint , and Anne had claimed to have letters to write , so for the most part they had met only for meals , served not downstairs with the other guests , but on a bridge table in the small livingroomwhich separated Gibbs 's room from his daughter 's . Their conversation was limited largely to conjectures as to the probable duration of the snow , and it was as if in the meanwhile it had fallen cold and deep in their very midst , each snowbound from the others , snowblind to all but their own unspoken preoccupations . So it was out of deep winter that Gibbs had come into the August of this crowded room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , he was suddenly filled with the desire to identify himself with the breathing warmth of it  --  the air fragrant with garlic , cigarette smoke , wet rubber , the musty sweetness of hair and clothes . He craved to thrust himself into the hot heart of the crowd , somehow to press himself against all their bodies at once , soiling himself with the perspiring flesh of them , jostled by their buttocks and shoulders , knees and arms , lost in all this humid , clamoring , unclean kennel of summer . He rose from his chair and made his way toward the most crowded part of the room that he could see  --  faces craning , nodding ,  |p192mouthing  about him as in a dream  --  and came to a length of floor that lay under a somewhat lower ceiling behind the far basketball net . The main floor was fluorescently lit and almost as bright as day , but here there were only a few caged bulbs on the walls so that all that he could clearly see at first was a little mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be a kind of billboard at the far end of this oblong , cavelike extension . At intervals a cry of applause would go up , then a shifting toward the front of the group , a silence , and another cry . More like dwarfs than children , Gibbs thought , with the faces of men and women on small , wiry bodies , they pushed about him from all sides , intent on working their way forward , while a young woman with her hair done up in a blonde bun kept trying to maintain some kind of order above the shrill excitement of their voices . With some difficulty Gibbs managed to squeeze forward himself until he could see that in front , roped off at some distance from the billboard , there was a table with a bucket of water upon it and a mound of old newspaper rolled up into balls . A small colored boy stood there with his right arm raised way back above his head preparing to throw one of these , which , even as Gibbs watched , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light , he szw that in the center of the billboard or screen , protruding from a hole , was a human head which bobbed to one side to avoid the missile . Twice more the boy threw , and twice more the head bobbed . Then another boy stepped forward , the process was repeated , and this time there was again a shout ofp193applause signifying , Gibbs concluded , that the target must have been hit . Curious to see whose head it was , he pressed his way to the front despite the angry protests of the childrenabout him , and only then was able for the first time to behold it clearly . For an uncanny moment it seemed to him that it was Rudy 's head , and he had the giddy , weak sensation of looking over the edge of a high cliff , half fearing , half wanting , to fall . But then he recognized it as Tripp 's  --  his neck bare , his hair tangled and wet on his forehead , his teeth white and his eyes narrow and bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear until all that was left for Gibbs was the boy 's face , the boy 's widemouthedsmile disembodied there in the dim light . Gibbs tried to catch his eye . Perhaps , though he could not be sure of it himself , he even called his name , made some wild gesture with his hand . Then suddenly , as if having known all the time that he was there , Tripp looked his way , and their eyes met . It was then that the boy laughed . His laughter was sharp as a sword , high-pitched and loud , with all of joy in it , wanton and young , yet taunting as well , an insolence of mirth that cut the room into a hundred pairs of eyes , Gibbs 's among them , bulging with shock at the triumph and challenge of it . It was the cry of a bird circling high above the heads of its pursuers , a shout of scorn from the battlements , a peal of high bells ringing the new year in and the old away . Gibbs heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow to emerge unruinedfrom the wreckage of the past to deride that wreck/age and all involved in it , who , gay-eyed and careless , was destined brilliantly to succeed where all else failed , and roughly thrusting aside whoever blocked his way , he pushed forward to the table in front . A thin Puerto Rican girl stood there now , and taking her by one arm he virtuallylifted her aside , grabbed up one of the wet paper balls and hurled it at Tripp . Still laughing , the boy ducked to the right , missing it , and Gibbs hurled another , this time catching him on the side of his neck . Another missed , then another , and then he hit him squarely on the forehead , on the cheek , the mouth , until the children set up a wild shouting and people from the main gymnasium floor pressed in to see what was happening . In his passion , Gibbs upset the bucket , the water flooding the length of the table and off its sides , but sopping the paper wads in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Kuykendall , who had come in with the others , took him by one shoulder to stop him . Without looking to see who it was , Gibbs tried to wrench himself free and in doing so partly ripped the arm of his coat from its seam . Then , as suddenly as he had started , he stopped . In the effort to withdraw his head from the hole , Tripp had pulled the poncho loose from its moorings and kneeled there now with it hanging loose about him . His face was dripping wet as if from tears , and all in one rush Anne , who had accompanied Kuykendall , ducked under the rope and ran up to him . She crouched beside him and pressed his head down against her throat so that as the children , their excitement still at high pitch , began hurling the wet paper ,  |p195it  was she who shielded him , hit here and there about her head and shoulders . She turned from him , crying out for them to stop , then back to him again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd with his arms raised ceilingward , began to restore order . Still on his knees with his face tipped up to hers , Tripp heard her whispering , felt her hands warm in his wet hair , then rose from the floor and with one arm about her waist led her out into the gymnasium proper , where they passed unnoticedthrough the main part of the crowd which had remainedthere . With everyone else now watching Kuykendall , who stood with his back to the rope , angrily trying to subdue their clamoring and belligerent overexcitement , which threatened to spread out to the adults , Gibbs alone was aware of their departure . Flushed and perspiring from his exertion , he remained absolutely motionless on the edge of the jostling mob . When Kuykendall finally succeeded in quieting them and the poncho was hung up once more with one of the high-school boys to replace Tripp as target , everything returned more or less to normal , and after some searching Kuykendall found Gibbs with Louise von Louwe at the foot of the stairs that led up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Persian-lamb coat turned up against the cold to come , while Gibbs spoke only briefly , his face expressionless . He was appalled , he said , at the trouble he had caused , at the spectacle he had made of himself . To plead that he must have been more overwroughtthan he had realized by the events of the last daysp196might constitute a kind of excuse , he told Kuykendall , but inadequate in view of what had happened . " If the boy really wanted to know who I am , " he said , " I 'm sure he feels he knows all there is to know now . " " Who you are , who you are , " Kuykendall repeated , more to himself than to Gibbs . " I 've asked myself that question often enough . There was a time I thought it might be you who were going to speak the word of judgmentto this generation . I even looked for another Jeremiah , another Isaiah , but what I found was only Ansel Gibbs . I should n't say only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's also not good . It 's the way things are , that 's all , and that 's what we 're usually left with , hope and blubber and pray as we will . I 'm sorry " he said , " sorry for you and for all of us , " and suddenly then his expression which , until a moment before , had been funereal almost to the point of caricature , fell apart into his absurd , selfconsciouschild 's smile . " But after all , there was a time I thought I might have amounted to something myself , " he said , " and all I 've ever been is Kuykendall. "  | " ALWAYS , " Tripp said . " Always and always . Every time I came into a room full of people , it would happen again . The eye would start to revolve  --  slowly like the light of a lighthouse . Sweeping the horizon . Was she the one ? How would she be ? . . . not just to go to bed with  --  though that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed with , to wait for trains with , to be bored stiff with and fight . Maybe I 'd only see her for three minutes at some sweaty cocktail party , but that was plenty of time to ask myself all those questions and more . Everybody does it . You 'd be sur-prised . " For thirty blocks they had walked , down the snowy pavements through East Harlem , and then suddenly , at exactly 96th Street , into the world of Park Avenue . " There should be some border to cross  --  passports , customsinspection , money declaration , something . It should n't be so easy , " Anne had said , and then on down Park Avenue , where the doormen stood behind their glass doors , keeping warm , and a little boy in a blue snowsuitp198with red tassels on the tips of his mittens and his wool cap waded out waist deep into a high , white drift until , without warning , his knees buckled under him , and he sat there in the snow , trilling like a bird . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to gather early . The lights were lit on the Christmas trees down the center of Park Avenue . The tires of cars hushed or clinked with chains along the white streets . When the bells of St. Ignatius Loyola started to ring , they seemed to have the cold , gray city all to themselves . No other sound competed , only faint human sounds  --  children dragging their sleds back from the park , people hurrying home and talking to themselves as all women and most men in New York do : oh God , God .. . and I said to her . . . tomorrow , tomorrow . . . good-by . . . all cut to pieces by the gaudy peal of the high bells . And then just at dark , as they neared the Carlyle , the two shafts of windows on the Grand Central Building , one vertical , one horizontal , lit up in the form of an enormous cross , and a shelf of snow blew off the roof of an apartment building , floating down on them like mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet , " Tripp said . " I 'd noticed them before , I suppose , but then one day I realized they must be mine . Annie , Annie .... " They lay side by side on his red carpet , the room smellingdimly of steam heat , the shabby furniture religiously still , and Rudy 's wing chair turned with its back half top199them . " People kiss so they wo n't have to look in each other 's eyes , " one of them said . " Will you just tell me one thing ? " Anne asked , her voice rhyming with the whisper of the mantle clock . " Why has it taken so long ? . . . " and he watched the tiny pulse in her throat , felt the little space of warmth between his hand and her hair , and he knew that to tell her the answer to that would be to tell her everything . He had shown her his apartment . Rooms in a hotel , no matter how elegant , have so much history that it amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his and as if they had been his always . His dirty laundry lay in a heap on the floor of his bedroom closet , somewhere at the bottom of them his shoes , a tennis racket , a large manila envelope full of letters from Sylvia Stowe to his father , love-letters , which she did not know that he had . They had written to each other as " Blessed " : " Blessed , I thought of you this morning while I was . . . " and in Tripp 's kitchenette , itself the size of a closet , there were a case of scotch , a case of gin , a tape recorder on the cover of the stove . In his bedroom on a shelf above his desk were a dozen orange-backed cardboard containers full of clippings about himself . " In the beginning , " he told her , " I always played the same game with people . You 'd meet somebody somewhere . You 'd talk , and the game was to see how long they 'd take to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them . If you had to tell them , it did n't count . It meant you were n't anybody yet anyway . " Andp200he showed her around the rest of his apartment . She had seen the living-room before , but that was all . " All my life I wanted a drawerful of money . Just money , " he said , and he pulled open a dresser drawer and showed her a pile of coins . " That 's so you wo n't think I have to marry for money , " he said , and taking a fistful of them , opened the bedroom window and threw them out into the winter night . " That 's to show you how rich I am , " he said . " That 's an awful thing . They might hurt somebody . " " Money never hurt anybody . " " I 'd rather have you sane than rich . " " I 'm sane and rich both , " he said . And now they lay there on the carpet the color of young kings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rooms , and now she had asked to see himself . " Why has it taken so long ? " she repeated , and he looked up at her , his thin face flat against his bare arm , as if to make sure who it was that had asked such a question . " Blessed , " he said , " do you want to hear the whole business ? " With his shirtsleeves rolled up and wearing a pair of khaki pants , Tripp sat up then , holding his knees to his chest . Anne lay beside him , leaning on one elbow , her head in her hand , and they were both barefooted , their shoes drying near the radiator . " There 's nothing I do n't want to hear , " she said . " Well , first there was my feet , " he told her , pushing at her knee with his toes . " They 're the first things I can remember being aware of . Then you . If you want to hearp201the details , I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking . " " I 'm not asking who you are , though till this afternoon I would have . I 'm asking who you 've been up to now , all these weeks , and before . " " That 's just it , " Tripp said . " I was never sure myself . We were always on the move  --  like Okies heading west , but , oh God , what fancy Okies . My father would go ahead first and find a house he thought my mother would considersuitable  --  something with trees around it and a driveway and rooms for servants . Then she would follow along with me and a nurse , the silver all strapped up in a wicker hamper , and their clothes , trunks of them , and the furniture , the piano nobody knew how to play . Oh , the works , " Tripp went on . " Nobody would have ever known to look at us that the reason we were pulling up stakes was because we 'd gone broke where we were and my father had to switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . So I never had a hometown or anything  --  how the public relations people hate that !  --  and I went to a different school almost every year of my life . So I was always the New Boy . Have you ever been a new boyP " he asked . " Something like that sometimes . " " Then maybe you know what I 'm talking about . A new boy 's supposed to prove himself , but I never bothered much with that . I found out it was a whole lot easier to prove how much I was like whatever I thought the old boys wanted me most to be . If you get me . I got to be a regularp202chameleon  --  a kind of nine- , ten- , eleven-year-old lizard with a hide that could change colors in ten seconds flat . I had red hair so they 'd usually get the idea I must be a hellraiser , and then I 'd raise hell till my tongue was hanging out  --  pick fights , razz the teachers , everything . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd figure out because I was n't much fit for anything else , I must have a brain . I went along with that , too , and in one place I got to be head boy of my class . They gave me a gold star or a roll in the hay with the principal 's wife or something . Anyway , that 's the way it went for so long that the day finally came when I did n't know which of all the people I 'd been I really was . I could change my personality quicker than a hat , and it 's still true . When I 'm with men like your father or old Kuykendall , I 'm the bright , promisingyoung man . When I 'm on the air , I 'm Mr. Mediocrityhimself  --  no better and no worse than the best or worst who 's watching me . " " And when you 're with me ? " Anne asked . " Now ? " Maybe now I 'm myself , " Tripp answered . " But do n't bet on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about what I asked ? " she said . " About why it 's been so queer all these months  --  you keeping after me till I was ready to scream , never saying anything , only once . " " I 'll get to that , " Tripp said . " But first my secret , inner history . You asked for it , and I 'm all wound up . I 'll spare you no details . You know this business about how before it 's born the human fetus in the womb is supposed to runp203through all the evolutionary stages  --  a blob , a fish , a monkey , all in nine months ? Well , it 's the same thing when love happens . You go back to the beginning and come up through all the people you 've ever been so you know who you are who 's loving now and down on his knees asking to be loved back . I 've done it before , and I 'm doing it again now with you . " " Oh , do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I can take only so much in a week . Only so many problems , " and as she spoke , she rolled over so that she was lying face down beside him , her head in her hands and her shoulders hunched . " O.K. , " he said . " I 'll give it to you uncomplicated andno sadder than the facts . Facts ca n't be sad anyway . I 'll give it to you in a few short , snappy scenes  --  like a movie preview . Coming next week . For adults only . The theater goes dark . The curtains light up like a sunrise . They part . The screen starts flickering all silver and gray . Movies are dreams . Are you with me , Annie ? " He leaned over and , brushing aside the hair , touched the back of her neck with his nose . She nodded without speaking . " The first scene is in a kitchen at night . There 's a man playing the part of a young husband , a woman playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight , their son , who 's playing the only part he knows at this point  --  which is himself . The man is always trying to make just a little more money because they 're always living on just a little more money than they have . They like things nice , he and his wife , and they have rich friends , and they forget they'rep204not rich themselves until all of a sudden someday the phone is shut off because they have n't paid the bill , or the nurse quits because they 're three months behind with her salary . Right now the man is wrapped up in a sure-fire scheme to make a million . He 's heard about a couple of guys who think they 've invented a kind of heat-proof glass  --  this is in the days before there was such a thing  --  and he 's sunk a good-sized piece of his capital in their project to manufacture a few samples . He 's brought one of these back with him tonight . It 's a baby 's bottle which you can put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as cracking . His wife and son have come out here in the kitchen to watch him demonstrate it . There 's a pot of water on the stove . There 's a dishpan full of ice cubes in the sink . The man 's standing by the stove waiting for the pot to boil . His wife is sitting at the kitchen table looking pretty and brave and trusting . The little kid , who knows a hell of a lot more than they think he does about what happens when bills are n't paid and nurses have to take care of him without a salary , is standing by his mother watching his father . At last the water boils . The young husband takes the baby-bottle and holds it up like a magician who 's just pulled a rabbit out of a hat . With a string tied around its neck , he dips it into the boiling water . Then he pulls it out and lays it in the dishpan with the ice cubes . There 's a pop like a rifle going off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene that has everything , " Tripp said . " Suspense . Pathos . The wife laughs a little , then cries . And humor , too . The boy is so humiliated for his father that hep205runs up and tries to kick him on the shins , so his father picks him up , laughing , and holds him upside down and shakes him till twenty-five cents and a yo-yo fall out of his pocket . The camera irises out on the yo-yo , which rolls into the dust under the stove . " Tripp had risen in the course of this and stood now by the window , looking down at the street many stories below . Anne had remained on the floor , although leaning up against the wing chair now , and consequently , though with his back to it , Tripp felt represented in the room , as if he had another heart beating there , another pair of hands and eyes . " It 's getting ready to snow some more , " he said . " There 'll probably be forty days and forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . " " The rain did n't , " Anne said . " That was because of Noah , " Tripp answered , turning to her again , " and we do n't have a Noah . " " What 's the next scene ? " Anne asked . There was only one lamp lit , and she sat near it , the light falling on her hair , so that the room seemed to belong more to her now than to Tripp , who remained by the dark of the window . " The next scene is left out of the preview , " he said . " In some ways it 's bigger and more dramatic than the one you just saw , but it does n't really add too much to it . The time is an early spring morning five years or so later . A twenty-two goes off , and the noise it makes is n't much louder than a baby-bottle breaking in a dishpan of ice . It does n't even wake the young wife , who 's upstairs in bed . Their son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p206and  when he finds out what 's happened , he does n't kick his father 's shins this time , but he 's humiliated for him in a lot the same way , only worse . Except that because he 's older than when you saw him last , he 's had time to develop other feelings about his father , too  --  love and fear and respect plus this humiliation for him because no matter how hard he tried , it seemed he was always messing things up and getting in bad . So when the son looks out of the window of his bedroom where his mother has made him promise to stay and sees what used to be his father lying on the wet grass down below , all these feelings are frozen in mid-air , so to speak . In time the chances are they 'd have melted together into one  --  the love and fear and respect and humiliation all finally turning into one complicated but single feeling about his father that he could have eventually dealt with somehow . But this way they 're frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separatethat way for years and years to come , which is very confusing for the boy and causes him no end of trouble and grief . It 's like having three or four fathers at once , all very different , very dead , and very apt to haunt him in his dreams and in between times , too . So you can see how at a tender age he picked up quite a few parts to play , all suggested by his different dead fathers  --  the one he feared , the one he loved , the one he respected , and the one he felt so humiliated for that for a long time the only tears he shed over him were tears of awful embarrassment . This is a very complicated psychological scene , " Tripp said , " and that 's why it 's left out of the preview.  | " But the next scene is n't complicated at all , " he went on , still standing by the window so that when Anne looked at him , she saw herself as well , reflected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . You better say in a whole lot of bedrooms and some of them not bedrooms at all , sometimes not even in rooms , but on lawns , on beaches . Do you want to skip this scene ? " he asked . " I hate all the years I did n't know you , " she said . " I wonder if we ever met before . " " I ca n't remember , but I bet we did . " Tripp came over and sat down in the wing chair which she was leaning against , shifted her toward him so that she sat now with her head tipped back against the seat cushion between his knees . " I remember seeing your father a couple of times in those days . He and my father used to clown around together . I remember once we had a Swedish cook who kept threatening to quit because she was lonely and did n't have any friends , so our fathers sat down and wrote her a letter as if it came from some guy who 'd seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her going for weeks . " " I ca n't imagine Father clowning around somehow , " Anne said . " I think he must have been born civilized . " She laid her hands on his bare feet . " Rub , " he said . They sat there for some minutes in silence while she did as she was told , Tripp softly , comically moaning as he gazed down at her shoulders through half-closed eyes . It was only six-thirty by the mantle clock , yet there was the sense of its being late at night . " Whatever sex is , " he said , " having your feet rubbed isp208exactly the opposite . Sometimes I think even better . That 's what the next scene was about . " " Having your feet rubbed ? " " No , " he said . " Sex . " " Oh , let 's have it then , " she said . " You asked for it , " he said . " When the boy with the three or four dead fathers is around fifteen or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing since Valentino  --  a regular Greek god , in fact . To coin a phrase . She 's a Southern lady and does n't mean any harm by it . Maybe she even believes it , and after a while he starts thinking himself that maybe she 's got something . They 're living in Georgia now in a house her family owns , and he 's going to the local high school . Have you ever been to a local high school ? " he asked . She shook her head . " Well , in a local high school the opportunities for an adolescent Greek god are sometimes unlimited . In the gym of this one , the girls ' and boys ' locker rooms are separated by a wall with a door in it . There are separate entrances plainly marked Girls and Boys too in case anybody might ever make a mistake , and the connecting door in between them is kept locked tight . But there are ways of getting through tightly locked doors , and it 's in those locker rooms that our boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite what to do at first , coming from a respectable family and having no living father to brief him on the ways of the world , there are plenty of opportunities for instruction . The older boys are very generous with their knowl/edge , and some of the older girls do n't mind providing entirely gratuitous demonstrations . There 's nothing simpleand old-fashioned about what they do either . They have eager young minds , and they 're crazy about experimenting . Sometimes three or four couples will experiment down there together with the air full of steam from the showers , smelling of sweat and Absorbine Jr . and perfume from the Five and Dime , and by the time this skinny , redheadedGreek god is seventeen and about to be sent up North for a year of prep school to give him polish , he 's seen everything there is to see , and there 's damned little he has n't done . He finds he has certain natural gifts in this direction , and he carries around what 's called in his localhigh-schoolcircles a monkey on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school are strictly limited , but when he gets to college , the field broadens out again , and in the Army he finds it 's really wide open . He 's learned to play all kinds of new parts by this time . his mother tells him he 's her best friend and adviser and almost a husband to her , and that 's one part . People have found out he 's fairly handy with a guitar or a piano , so they 're always after him to sing something he 's made up or play something , and that gets to be another part . And then there are still all the parts he learned when he was a kid  --  somehow living up to , or living down , all his fathers  --  so after a while it gets to be where sex seems to be the only place where he does n't have to play a part at all  --  where he can forget all his lines and his fathers and the chords and words of his damn songs . So this scene , as Ip210said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place in bedrooms , and it 's a 3-D , technicolor production with a cast of hundreds . Look , " he said , leaning way forward in his chair so that for a moment his mouth touched her forehead . " I 'll stop any time you get bored or want to go out and be sick or anything . " " I 'd like something to eat , " she said , " if you have anythinghere . And , Tripp , " she began again , looking at him , straight and somehow lost , " I do n't care what you tell me . Whatever you want . I wo n't be sick . But do n't do it in this movie way . Say I ' and we ' and they . ' Will you for me ? " " I 'll do anything you want , " he said . " And I 'll feed you . I do n't carry much in the way of food here , but there must be something . You 're sure you do n't want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anne said , " and let them know where I am . " " They know where you are , " Tripp said . So when he began again , it was sitting beside her on the couch with a glass platter full of olives and cocktail onions , crackers , cheese , and two glasses of milk on the coffee table in front of them . " I 'll tell you about an old woman named Kitten Dory , " he said . " This was just after I 'd gotten out of the Army , and I had a job disc-jockeying for a small Chicago station . They gave me a week off at Easter , and I flew down to Savannah to spend it with my mother and Ed , the man she married about the time I was a junior in college . The second day I was there , all hell broke loose in the smelling/salts , old South way my mother specializes in . I 'd sent some clothes to the cleaners , and they called up later to tell Mother I 'd left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drove down to pick them up , and the idiots gave her the works  --  some money , some cigarettes , and a package of gadgets I was in the habit of using on some of my more colorful nocturnal adventures . She had a private showdownwith me and in the course of it made it clear that as far as she was concerned , I was turning into a regular satyr , and God knows there was more truth in that than she ever guessed . She cried and said I was weak like my father , that it was her fault , she had n't brought me up right , but she 'd had to do it all alone and she 'd done the best she knew how . And she had , you know , " Tripp said . " I keep making her sound like the villain of all this , but she was n't . There are n't any villains . But anyway , " he went on , " she was terribly upset , and she decided one thing my father and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been a particularly religious person herself  --  and she has her reasons  --  but when she was going through change of life and afraid for a while that things were n't going to work out between her and Ed as well as they finally did , she was more or less straightened out by an old woman who claimed she was n't a Christian Science practitioner or a faith-healer , but who was really some of both . So mother persuaded me to go see her while I was down there over Easter , and that 's where Kitten Dory comes in . " Nobody knew much about her past , but Kitten did n't need one . She might as well have sprung full-blown on thep212world with a voice that could open a can of sardines and a personality like a pneumatic drill . But I do n't want to make a gag out of her . Whatever she was up to , she was dead serious about it . I had to wait in her sitting-room for about a half an hour before she let me see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookcase while I waited . There was Science and Health , The Prophet , a collection of hymns , and crammed right in among them was a tenvolumeset of the Business Encyclopedia  --  everything from double-entry bookkeeping to investment banking . She knew what she was doing , all right . But anyway , she finally called me in , and then I saw Kitten for the first time . " She was wearing white the way she always did  --  a white dress like a nurse 's uniform , white shoes , and white cotton stockings  --  the fattest woman I 've ever seen , with a great pale moon of a face and blue hair . Almost the first thing she said to me was that she was seventy-five years old , but she knew she did n't look a day over fifty because everybody told her so , and as a matter of fact she did n't . And then she started to get down to cases . She called me ' Baby '  --  that 's what she called all her patients , or whatever they were  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to try to make you into one of my convertibles , but for your darling Mom 's sake I just want to sound you out a little . ' I remember that business about sounding me out a little because it was a good twenty minutes before I could get a word in edgewise . You 've never heard such a line as she had . You could tell she 'd been using the whole thing completefor the last twenty years or so , and one illustrationp213came spilling out after another with jokes inserted to make you feel at home and know what a good Joe she was , and she kept referring to that guy , ' pointing at a big pencil sketch of Jesus she had hanging on the wall that made Him look like a sick fairy . The gist of it all was that unhappiness and pain do n't really exist because everything is part of the infinite mind of God . She said at different times how she herself had had cancer of the stomach , all the bones in one leg crushed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still going strong because she knew what that guy ' meant when he said the truth would set you free . It was the same for lusts of the flesh as for disease , she said with her eye on me , and then she used her favorite example of all which cropped up a couple more times before she was through . Baby , look at yourself for a minute if you do n't think it 'll make you lose your lunch , ' she 'd say , and then one by one take away all the qualities that make you you  --  beauty , symmetry , strength , vitality , power , ' and I do n't know what all . And what have you got left ? A blob . Nothing . Baby , all you 've got left is a great big blob of nothing , and how is nothing going to be able to go around tomcatting after a bunch of girls , how is nothing ever going to get cancer and pain and die ? Baby , I 'm here to tell you God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , so how is God in us ever going to get sick and die ? It 's all just a bad dream whether you know it or not , and it 's time you woke up , do n't you think ? ' Then she began all over again about take away beauty , symmetry , strength , ' and so on . " I was inspired then . I do n't know where it ever camep214from . I 'd just gone to see her to keep peace in the family , and it did n't make much difference to me whether what she was talking about made sense or not . But , as I told you , it was Easter time , and I suddenly realized this day I was seeing Kitten was Good Friday . My knowledge of the Bible was shaky , to say the least , but at least I knew what had happened on Good Friday so I started trying to ask her how she explained that . You could see she was n't used to being interrupted , and it looked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have to start all the way back at the beginning again , but then she got hold of herselfand went sailing off into whatever she 'd been saying . When you tried to say something yourself , she 'd just keep right on talking , so finally I really yelled at her and asked if she knew what day it was . She said of course she did and started to go back to where she 'd been when I yelled again and asked her how she explained that guy ' dying on a cross , with nails through Him . Baby , ' she said , Ile did n't die . That 's what Easter 's all about . ' So I said if He had n't died , He 'd at least put on a damned good imitation of it  --  sweating blood beforehand , nailed up by His feet and hands , at the last minute yelling out that this all-in-all God had left Him holding the bag . If He had n't died , I asked her , what was all this hocus-pocus about being risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buried . ' I knew that much . And I could see she was starting to get mad , although she kept on calling me Baby , and she said she could see I was the kind of person who loved to dwell on the ugly and unpleasant . Then I started getting madp215myself . I said I did n't like to dwell on them particularly , but I knew for sure they were real as hell and no dream . That was right , she said . They were n't a dream . They were a nightmare  --  lust , suffering , death , all of them . I told her if they were n't real , nothing was real and she damned well knew it , but then she went through the take away beauty , symmetry , strength ' routine again , and that was when I really blew my top . God knows why . It was n't a subject I 'd ever gotten excited about before , but I told her that if you took away the beauty , power , vitality , strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left was what was sitting there in front of me now  --  an old woman with blue hair who , no matter how many cancers and crushed bones she 'd managed to live through so far on plain guts , in a few years was going to be dead . I remember pointing my finger at her and saying two or three times in a row , You 're going to die , Kitten . You 're going to be dead as the day before yesterday . ' " I thought now I 'd have a real fight on my hands , but the next thing I knew she was crying . She asked me how I could say such a thing after all she 'd done for my darling Mom . I could n't believe it . I thought she must be kidding me . But they were tears all right , and I beat it out of there as fast as I could . I 've never felt like such an absolute heel . Whether you agreed with her or not , she was a brave old bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother a lot of good , and who was I anyway to tell her what religion was all about ? It was just that I could n't let her get by with saying that the lusts and sufferings and deaths in thep216world were n't real , and if this Jesus of hers did n't suffer and die like everybody else , then He was never really one of us , and Christianity 's based on a masquerade . But do n't think what I said had any permanent effect on Kitten . She was back on the job bright and early the next morning . I was the only one who came close to being permanently affected . " I even began to think that my mother had come close to something like the truth . Maybe it was not having any religion in their lives that had had something to do with all my fathers being dead , with my running around like a stud bull . If either one of us had ever believed that there could be a God who had somehow , ahead of us and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have made a difference , and I even started trying to pray sometimes . But my praying was really a mess . I could never figure out what sin was except that in my case I decided it must have something to do with sex . So when I prayed ... I do n't know . Just praying about sex , sex would start swelling up like a wave trying to drown out the prayer I was making . Right in the middle of it , all sorts of pictures would begin drifting through my mind  --  dirty pictures , I mean ; pictures of what used to go on in the locker rooms and lots of other places  --  till I figured out the prayer God was getting must look like the kind of photographs they pass around at stag dinners and I 'd better give the whole thing up . But then I decided if He was going to take a look at me at all , He might as well know the worst and probably knew it already , so I 'd barge ahead with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't exactly one of the great conversions , and I do n't suppose I 've been to church more than a half-dozen times in the years since , but some things got easier after that , and the monkey on my back started taking longer and longer vacations . In a way Kitten was wrong and in a way she was right . There 's no point dwelling on the ugly and unpleasant things of the world , as she said , but before you can beat them you 've got to know how real they are . Then maybe they get less real . So there you have the complicated religious scene , " Tripp said , " and now you know about Kitten Dory . " " Have you ever seen her again ? " Anne asked . " I ran into her on the street down there once not so long ago . She pulled me into a doorway and with her big , nurse 's hand tight around my wrist recited a poem she 'd made up  --  all about sunlight and God and a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you ever told him any of this ? " " Only you , " Tripp said . " There 's nothing I can say to it all , " Anne said . " I mean I can only just listen or ask questions . There 's nothing I can contribute . You do n't mind , do you ? " " How about you ? " he asked . " Do you mind what you 've had to listen to ? " " No , except that it seems awfully far away . I can seeyou in all these situations , but you 'd act so differently now . Kinder , " she said , " more honest , and less complicated . " " Success , " Tripp said . " Money and fame and a name inthe world . All the things that are supposed to make youp218cold and unapproachable , conceited , phony . Do n't believe a word of it . When a man 's got money , he can afford to be kind . That 's not supposed to sound cynical . It just happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's easy for him to be himself  --  as honest and uncomplicated as he wants . It 's not only skin-deep with him either . It 's more than just a part . He really starts to become honest and kind and uncomplicated . Comparatively , of course . It 's all comparative . But it 's true . The best thing in the world for a man is to succeed . " " My successful Tripp , " Anne said . " My honest and kind and uncomplicated Tripp . " " I have n't even worked my way up to being just twofacedyet . I 've still got three dozen of them at least . But I still may get there . Especially if you stick with me . " " But why did n't you ask me to stick with you before ? " she asked . " Why did it finally have to be me who broke down  --  this afternoon , with water all over your face , being wrecked there , till I could n't stand it any longer ? I 'd sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I 'd never have gone today if I 'd known Kuykendall had asked you . Why , Tripp ? " She sat there on the couch beside him , turned around to face him with her bare feet tucked beneath her , a glass of milk forgotten in one hand . " Because I did n't know which of us was after you , " he said , " or what he was after you for . I 've been talking your ear off to show you who you were up against without knowingit  --  all three dozen of me , and my fathers . "  | " Was my father mixed up in it , too , somehow ? " Anne asked . " Oh yes , " he said . " Of course , he was . I was dying to meet Ansel Gibbs 's daughter just to see what she was like , and then for the drama of it , too . I was n't one to miss that . . . the next generation meeting , friends , long after the shooting was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun with God smiling down . Then when the daughter turned out to be you , I saw there was going to be more drama than I 'd bargained for . " " You saw it right away ? " she asked . " The first time ? " " On the beach that time . My birthday . I told you that . " " Yes , but I wanted to hear it again . But Tripp , " she said , all this excitedly , her smile blurred , " tell me .. . why did you suddenly stop after that , as if you 'd never said anything at all ? " " I was afraid maybe I was just making the most of a dramatic situation , that both of us were -- thinking we were in love because it would give such a bang-up ending to the whole thing . Thinking  --  oh , there 's never any end to it , you know  --  that in the long run you 'd probably be miserable with me , and being afraid that maybe in some queer way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dramaticjustice to pass . This was all the actor , the part-playing , in me , because when you came right down to it , I never blamed Ansel Gibbs . My father lost his job , but so what ? He 'd lost plenty already , lost them or left them . A man does n't shoot himself for any one reason . I do n't thinkp220reason enters into it at all . He just does what he had to do , that 's all . Your father had no more to do with it than a hundred other people . Less , for that matter . " " Then you were n't out to get him or anything ? " " Of course I was n't . But  --  " " What ? " " The first time I met him  --  that afternoon in your house  --  he told me more or less that he blamed himself . He asked me if I blamed him , and I told him the truth , which was that I did n't , but even as I was telling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a terrific possibility . I mean , I thought what a great scene it would have been if I had blamed him . So though it was n't real , it kept on existingas a possibility , a kind of dream , do you follow me ? A dream he and I had both dreamed together . And I could feel it doing something queer to the air between us just the way it had already done something queer to the air between you and me . " " Was that why you asked him to be on your program then  --  as part of the dream ? " " No , " Tripp said . " I just knew it would be a real feather in my cap if I could manage to get him , especially with Farwell . And my God , he was fine , Annie ! You know that , do n't you ? " " I did n't think so at the time , I know that , " she said . " I thought you 'd made a fool of him , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time I got through with him , I think he thought so , too . I made a terrible scene in the kitchen afterward , that same night . "  | " Well , you 're wrong , " Tripp said . " You know he came over here to see me still later , do n't you ? After your scene , I guess . " " No ! He never said he did . I thought he went to bed . " " I was n't here , but , of all people , Mother was . She left a note that he 'd come and they 'd had a wonderful talk about the good old days . He left a note , too . I just picked it up this morning on my way in from the country  --  sweet as a rose , not a word of reproach in it . I think I 've still got it somewhere if you want proof . " " Then why , " Anne asked , " why , will you tell me , did he do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of paper balls , he 'd have still thrown them . He wanted to kill you . I thought he 'd lost his mind . Or that I had . It was uncanny , awful . . . " " If you asked him now , " Tripp said , " I 'll bet he could n't tell you himself . The whole thing down there was a nightmareanyway . And God knows he 's on the spot . What he said Friday night was magnificent , but Farwell 's out to get him for it . The newspapers are after him . I think for a minute something just broke in two , and he had to beat hell out of somebody . I was the nearest , so he tried to beat hell out of me . That 's all it was , ' , and I only hope he feels better for it . " " I think it 's much worse than that . I told him you were out to ruin him , and he thinks you are . For the first time in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then there 's this verdict of yours . How does he know it 's not going to be Guilty and that all your adoring fans wo n't go rushing offp22to Western Union to wire their Senators ? Porter Hoye tells me some have already . Tripp , tell me something , " she said , " honestly , no two faces , no dreams  --  what 's your verdict ? " " That 's simple , " he said , and he took her chin in his hand as he spoke , holding her face before him . " I think in his own way he 's seen what Hell looks like , and he 's survivedto tell the tale . Not everybody does . I admire him as much as any man I know . " " And is that what you 're going to say when the time comes ? " Tears had come to her eyes , and one of them touched Tripp 's hand as he held her there . " Yes , " he said , and perhaps for the first time in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time was precisely right , then taking advantage of it , but all in one instant willed and moved together so that literallybefore he knew it , he was lying there close to her , his mouth discovering her face and hair . He had told her of all the people who he had been and was and of all the parts he had played and was playing still , and if in conscience he could not go on to claim that with her he played no part at all , he could say at least that with her he was able to play so many parts at once that perhaps they added up to himself . He could say that each of them was just sufficiently true so that , taken together , they made truth enough even to love with.  |p223THE  TWO days following Tripp 's broadcast were for Porter Hoye a period of such gloom that he positively welcomed as diversion the few distasteful tasks that he became involved in on Gibbs 's behalf . Having persuaded him to leave for Connecticut early Saturday morning , Hoye called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep him informed of events in the city and roared into the telephone with as much conviction and cheer as he could muster that all was going well and the worst was already over . In turn , he himself received a number of calls from the papers asking him if he could enlighten them as to Mr. Gibbs 's present whereabouts , or identify for them the suicide who had come up in the discussion with Senator Farwell , and to both of these questions he repeatedly declared that he had no statement to make whatever . He also tried at intervals all Saturday to get hold of Tripp , but finally decided that , like Gibbs , the young man had fled the city , undoubtedly not to return until the turmoil which he had caused had somewhat subsided . Louise von Louwe'sp224butler , Walter , further complicated matters by calling him up after each fresh sally with the reporters who continued to hover near the house in hopes of catching Gibbs on his return , and asking with increasing excitement whether there was n't something he could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace . " Just stick to your guns , man ! " Hoye had again and again told him . " You 're only the butler , and you do n't know a damned thing . " He conducted all these affairs from his law office , to which he had proceeded after breakfast Saturday morning not because he had any pressing work to attend to there , but in the belief that those familiar surroundings , that atmosphere of the legal and precise , would serve to make more tolerable the hopelessly disorganized activities in which he was engaged . None of the other partners was there , only two of the younger associates who were clearly delighted to be found working overtime by a senior member of the firm ; and between telephone conversations he found numerous excuses to call on them for this and that , taking considerable comfort in the deference with which they did his bidding . He went even so far as to take them to lunch with him at Fraunces Tavern and over his eggs benedict discoursed at some length on the rewards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the days of his own apprenticeship in the office of Mr. Justice Holmes . By late afternoon the telephone had stopped ringing , the companionship of the two young associateshad begun to pall , and it was only then that hep225decided to leave the office and seek release from the tensionsof the day elsewhere . Porter Hoye did not often have recourse to what he considered to be the depraved self-indulgence of a Turkish bath , and when on occasion he did so , it was a mission which he would embark upon with all the devious precautionsof a thief . Instead of going to the Racquet Club or the University Club , where he would inevitably meet men of his acquaintance , he went instead to the Hotel Taft , where , although there was always the possibility of being recognized , there was no chance at all of being recognized , he felt confident , by anyone whose good opinion he valued . Furthermore , at the desk of the bath itself where you depositedyour valuables and signed the register , he never gave his own name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had originally devoted considerable thought . Refusing to pass himself off as merely Mr. Brown or Mr. Green from some undistinguished locality , he became for the length of those clandestine visits P. H. Mortimer of Tuxedo Park , a name and title which secured for him , he felt , no more and no less than the same degree of attentive respect to which his own identity would have entitled him had he been willing to disclose it . It was as Mr. Mortimer that the attendants all knew and addressed him , and his secret pleasure in this was no small part of the bath 's therapy . Thus it was to the Hotel Taft that he made his way this late winter afternoon of Gibbs 's absence in the country , and within a short time of arriving there sat in
