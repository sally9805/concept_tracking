In the lowering fog that shrouded the cliffs of Dover one morning last week , an unseen foghorn moaned . As if summoned by the echoes , 178 sallow-faced workmen , each carrying a brown paper parcel or a battered cardboard suitcase , trudged along the quay of Dover Marine Station and straggled up the gangplank of a trim Belgian steamer , the S.S. Koenig Albert . The men were Italian miners , recruited to dig coal in fuel-hungry Britain ; they were being sent away because British miners refused to work with foreigners ( TIME , May 26 ) . Most will find jobs in Belgian pits . <P> Britain 's economic health depends on so small and crucial a thing as a 10% increase in its annual coal production . To help dig that extra coal , the National Coal Board last year invited 5,000 unemployed Italian miners to work in the pits . They were to be given the dirtiest and lowest-paid jobs ; they would be the first to be fired in hard times . But 18 months and $615,000 later , only 2,200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to down tools unless the " Eyeties " were thrown out . <P> What was wrong with the Italians ? " They wave their ' ands when they talk , " groused one Englishman . " They wink at the women and shampoo their ' air . " Worst of all , said a squat Yorkshire digger , " They ' ave n't larnt to talk English proper . " Back of this pettiness was an unreasoning fear of unemployment that discourages hard work in all of Britain 's heavy industries . Haunted by depression memories of dole and idleness and " bread and drip " ( a diet of bread spread with cooking grease ) , British coal miners expect to safeguard their now-well-paid jobs by keeping coal in short supply . " They do n't want coal , " said a bitter Italian . " For them , la mancanza fa la forza-power through shortage . " <P> The S.S. Koenig Albert cast off from Dover . Leaning on the taffrail , the Italians reflected on the months of wasted time . Some were bitter : " The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could we ? They do n't do any . " Others grieved . " They would n't talk to us , " cried Giovanni Ovino . " I said to myself : ' Maybe they do n't like my black hair . ' In a funny way , I felt ashamed of my hair . But how could I change it ? " Domenico Loi saw it in a wider context . " They were n't Communists . . . But if they had been Communists , they could n't willfully have damaged their nation more . " As if in agreement , the unseen foghorn moaned .
