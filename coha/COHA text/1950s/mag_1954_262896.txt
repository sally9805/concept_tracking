Geologists find coral atolls as fascinating as detective stories . The clues lie strung through the earth 's warm seas in festoons of ringlike islands , like Wake Island in the Pacific ( see cut ) . And for more than a century the geologists have been debating what the clues really mean . The most familiar theory is that atolls started as coral reefs fringing a small island . When the island sank ( or the sea rose ) , the ring of coral kept growing upward , eventually forming an atoll with a lagoon where the island used to be . <P> In the latest American Journal of Science , F. Stearns MacNeil of the U.S. Geological Survey adds up the old clues to get a new theory : the rings were formed on dry land and later sank below the sea . He believes that coral and other sea organisms , growing on a shallow bottom , will build up a flat-topped reef ( like many that exist today ) . In some cases , he says , such reefs were raised above the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , to become full-fledged islands . Then furious tropical rain went to work on the porous coral , dissolving it . The center of the island eroded faster than the rim , particularly if it had picked up a layer of soil . Reason : the soil contributed acids that attacked the limestone . <P> The soft coral of the rim , by alternate solution and recrystallization , was " casehardened " into solid rock that eventually stood in a high wall around most of the island . Then after the once-flat coral reef had eroded into a saucer , MacNeil believes , the sea rose again and flooded the low center . When the sea rose high enough , more coral grew on the high rim , building it up and forming the familiar shape of an atoll . <P> Geologist MacNeil is prepared to offer two kinds of evidence to support his stand . First , there are actually many islands , standing well above sea level , whose high rims and comparatively low centers could very well have been formed by the process he describes . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realistic laboratory test . A block of limestone , he reports , sprayed with dilute hydrochloric acid to approximate the effect of long-continued rain , erodes into a shallow saucer with a raised rim .
