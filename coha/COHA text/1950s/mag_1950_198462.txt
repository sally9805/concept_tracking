Like every other U.S. community , New York City fell behind in school construction during the war , now has to catch up at a time when wartime births have rocketed school enrollments . Last week the New York City Board of Education had figured out what it would need to house the peak number of 1,050,000 pupils it expects between now and 1956 : 165 new elementary and junior high schools , 31 senior high schools , 103 additions to existing buildings . Estimated cost of catching up : $511,607,630.
