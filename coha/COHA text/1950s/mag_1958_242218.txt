When Jean T. , 35 , mother of two children , went to the doctor 's office in Philadelphia , she had only a few little pimples and wheals on her face , arms and legs , but she complained that she had been driven almost crazy every night for eight weeks by unbearable itching . She could identify the places where the itching started by small black spots . A host of specialists in internal medicine and skin diseases had subjected her to examinations , plus blood-sugar , blood-count , urine and liver tests-not to mention a syphilis test . Unable to find any cause , they dismissed the patient as a neurotic , gave her tranquilizers , which did no good . <P> Drs . Milton M. Cahn and Fred R. Shechter admit , in the A.M.A. Journal , that they also might have failed to solve the mystery , but they happened to see something moving on the patient 's skin . It proved to be an eight-legged critter , little more than one-fiftieth of an inch long , later identified as the northern fowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. had noticed proved to be the mites ' droppings . Evidently the mites caused the itching , and the fact that Mrs. T. 's husband , a clothing salesman , was not affected , though he slept in the same room , was probably a matter of individual sensitivity . But how did the mites get into the bedroom of a Philadelphia suburban home ? The medical detectives tracked them to an unlikely source - the window air conditioner . The machine 's intake , on the street side , was obstructed by two nests of the common starling . The mites had attached themselves to the starlings , but when the machine was switched on , they were vacuumed out of the plumage , into the bedroom and onto Jean T. 's sensitive skin .
