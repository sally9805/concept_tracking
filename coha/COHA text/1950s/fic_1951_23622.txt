Sawing the Lady in Half A Story by Nigel Balchin Drawings by Bob Cato T HE older I get , the surer I am that it does n't pay to try to understand women . You only make a fool of your-self . The only thing to do is to treat the whole business as though it were a conjuring performance  --  sit back and watch , get any fun out of it that there is going , but do n't be the sort of bore who always knows how it 's done . You 'll probably be wrong anyhow , and if you 're not it only spoils the game . But if you 've seen enough conjuring performances you begin to recognize certain tricks as old friends , and to know how they will end , even if you do n't know how it 's done . When you get to my age there is a certain satisfaction in being able to say , almost as soon as the show begins , " Oh , this is that thing , and it ends with the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery . " And then you sit back feeling superior and watch the audience being surprised . That 's the great advantage of experience . You do n't need any intelligence to acquire it . If you can go on not being run over by a bus for long enough , it 's bound to come . Yet however experienced you are , you may sometimes be sure you know what 's coming and still get it all wrong . The lady may be still in the trunk and the conjuror in the gallery  --  or in the trunk too , or some such nonsense . " Witness the business of my niece Ursula . Ursula is now nearly thirty , and an uncommonly pretty woman . She got married bright and early when she was twenty-one , and got unmarried again when she was ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , , SAWING THE twenty-five . That was four years ago , and since then she has been living in a rather nice flat in Devonshire Street and not marrying anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whenever I do she is so bright and having such a good time with it all that it nearly breaks my heart . Because young ex-wives who live by themselves and have such a good time are one of the conjuring tricks I 've been looking at now for about forty years . W ELL , about six months ago Ursula rang me up and asked me to take her out to dinner the next night . This was surprising , because on the very rare occasions that I 've asked her out , I 've had to make an appointment for three weeks ahead , just as though she were a fashionable dentist . Anyhow , out we went , and right from the start I could see that there was something wrong . In fact I was afraid at one time that she would start telling me all about it over the cocktails , and if there 's one thing that annoys me it is being told all about it when I 'm ordering a meal or trying to eat it . But she hung on very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food for all the world as though she was eating , and even remembering to ask me what the claret was . It happened to be a rather nasty bottle so I told her what I thought it must be and she laughed exactly as though she had heard what I said . But I knew this was too good to last , and when they brought the coffee I sat back and said , " Well now my dear-2 " and she started straight in and said , in so many words , " I ca n't go on like this . " I said , " I was afraid you could n't . " She looked a bit startled and said , " Why ? Do you know about it ? " I said , " No my dear . I do n't know anything about it at all . But I 'm pretty sure you ca n't go on like this , whatever it is . " She thought for a bit and said , " It 's a bit mean to spill it all over you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And anyhow we 're rather alike  --  black sheep and no good and so on . So you may understand better than  --  than Daddy , say . " I said , " I 'd never presume to understand anything better than your father . I was brought up to believe that that was quite impossible . But if you 've been a bad girl and want to explain to somebody that you 've really acted very well , you 'll probably get on better with me . Your father believes in the truth . I only believe in trying to make things pleasant . " Ursula said , " I 'm not saying I 've acted very well but  --  I 've really tried ? " " I get the general position . What exactly have you done ? Robbed a bank ? Or poisoned a rival ? " She said , " No . Just got myself and  --  and some other people into rather a mess . " y ou do n't want it all . It took from 9:30 P.M. to about 3:00 A.M. At about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables and look reproachful . But Ursula was in full swing , and so we went back to her flat and had another three hours of it . And in the end all it added up to was that Ursula was in love with Derek Porterman , who was n't in love with her , and Leslie Wayer was in love with Ursula , who was n't in love with him . Apart from that the only items that seemed to me relevant were ( a ) that Porterman was more or less married already and ( b ) that both of them were members of clubs of mine . I put it to Ursula like this but she could n't see it in the simplified form . There was no doubt that she had got it very badly over Porterman . All the usual symptoms were apparent in extreme form  --  and amongst them the usual female inability to believe that you can be as much in love with a person as that without their being in love with you . Moreover , it was equally clear that the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual female inability to get rid of anything as flattering as that . Anyhow , she was determined that it should all be very difficult , and it was no business of mine to stop her . She had clearly been having an agonizingly enjoyable time running them in double harness , being abjectly humilitated by Mr. Porterman ( who did n't appear to be a very kindly type ) at the same time that Mr. Wayer was constantly threatening to commit suicide if she could n't be kinder to him . In fact as time went on I became more and more puzzled to know why she wanted to do anything about it . It seemed to me that everybody was having a full and interesting life  --  and particularly Ursula . So about two o'clock I quietly began to move the closure , and when she said for the forty-seventh time that she could n't go on like this I just said , " Why not ? " She looked surprised and said " Because it is n't right . " For a moment I was startled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is her father 's daughter . So I just said , " There 's that of course . " " Of course . I ca n't possibly go on doing this to poor Leslie . " " You 're afraid lie will commit suicide ? " " I do n't suppose he will actually do that . But he 's utterly miserable and drinking and so on . And he 's one of the nicest people I know . And anyhow Derek 's married and got two children . Even if he would get a divorce and marry me , it would mean an awful mess . I should never be able to live with myself . " I nodded . The thing was beginning to have a horrifying fascination . There is always something awe-inspiring about a woman in love when she starts to talk about other people 's interests in this sort of way . After all , Ursula was nearly thirty , moderately experienced , and in most ways quite intelligent . I reminded myself again that she was her father 's daughter and said , " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She raised her head and said firmly , " I shall give up seeing Derek and  --  and probably marry Leslie . " I nodded . I had been expecting it . Ursula said rather challengingly , " Is n't that the only decent thing I can do ? " I said pretty hurriedly , " Oh come my dear ? you do n't come to me to be told what is the decent thing . I should n't know the decent thing if I met it in the street . " " But does n't it make sense to you ? I should like to marry Derek  --  I 'll be quite frank about it . But I ca n't , so why not face it ? And Leslie is in love with me and I 'm very fond of him . So is n't it the sensible thing ? ? " I said , " It all sounds very sensible indeed . " And I give you my word that that grown woman looked relieved . W ELL there it was  --  as familiar a conjuring trick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be two possible alternative endings . Of course she would go after Porterman with her teeth bared ; and of course , wanting anything as much as that she would get it  --  up to a point . But would she be able to get him to marry her , thereby clinching - the female victory ? Or would he just stick to having her on his terms , in which case he would have won ? Per-SAWING THE LADY IN HALT sonally I was backing Porter-man . He was a handsome , successful , thoroughly nasty piece of work with a hide an inch thick , and no woman really ever has a chance with one of those . I could n't imagine Porterman giving anybody anything that would inconvenience him in the slightest , let alone getting himself into the divorce court because some girl had fallen in love with him . I decided that Ursula was in for a bad time , and I was sorry because I like Ursula . But if women insist on having all the fun of kidding themselves to quite that extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reasoned it out . I submit with all humbleness , that no sane man would have expected anything else . And yet what happens ? Three days later I am in the club  --  the one Porterman belongs to ? and he comes into the bar , looking as black as thunder , orders himself a double whiskey , downs it , orders another , downs that , barely answers when a couple of people speak to him , and then goes and flops down in a chair and starts looking at the Economist as though he did n't like what was in it . I naturally thought , " Aha . He 's got Ursula on his tail and he 's finding it very uncomfortable , because he likes her just enough not to slap her down and be clone with it . " But that evening Ursula rang up and her first words were , " Unc . Chas. , I 've done it . " I said , " Done what ? " " I 've broken with Derek . I 've told him and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , but not as tough as I thought it would be . " I had some difficulty over my next line , but in the end I just said , " Well done , my dear . " And then I went away kicking myself for not having remembered that Ursula is her father 's daughter , and that nobody could be brought up by my brother Nevil without being pretty odd . Heaven knows I was glad enough for her to be rid of Porterman . But if it meant she would marry somebody who was **45;1036;TOOLONG , it would be out of the frying pan into the fire . So I went on being sorry for Ursula for about another week ; and then I went into my other club and there was the party of the third part  --  Leslie . He was leaning against the bar and looked as though he had been leaning against it for a long time . A friend was suggesting that they should go away , and the barman was looking as though if he had n't been so well trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would n't go away because there was no object in it  --  nor , I gathered , in anything else . I heard later that in the end he got quarrelsome and hit the friend and was generally a nuisance , and I think the committee asked him to resign . Anyhow I 've never seen him in the place since . But I did n't see this development because after one careful look at him , an idea crossed my mind and I went and rang up Ursula and asked her to come and have a drink . She seemed pleased to be asked , and was very pretty and bright and cheerful . After a while I said , " How did all your complications work out ? " She said , " You mean about Derek ? Oh , I did it . I cut the whole thing out . Do n't you remember I rang you up and told you so ? " " So you did . And you 've stuck to it ? " " Oh yes . It 's taken a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . As a matter of fact you know , I 'm well out of that in some ways . Derek was madly attractive but he was n't very  --  very nice , if you see what I mean . " I took an olive and said , " I do see what you mean . Now the other chap  --  Leslie Wayer  --  seems a very nice person . When sober . Ursula said , " Yes . " And there was a rather long pause . After a while she said , " Do you ever see him ? " " I saw him this evening . " " Was he drunk ? " " Very . Frankly , Ursula , I wondered why . I mean , he did n't look like a man whom somebody had started to be nicer to . " She said , " Nobody has . " " But I thought you were going to ? Surely that was the whole idea ? Was n't that why you gave up Derek ? " Ursula took an olive and rolled it across the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . She said . " Yes , But it did n't work out . " " Why not ? " She turned and looked at me very seriously with those lovely big hazel eyes . " Well you see , Unc . Chas. , Leslie was one of the very nicest people I had ever known , but there 's no denying that the poor dear was a bit  --  a hit wet . " " True . But you knew that before . " " Yes . But as long as I was running around with Derek and getting my face trodden on a lot , I somehow did n't mind Leslie being a poor fish . It was a  --  a sort of relief . Derek would be filthy to me and I could go and take Leslie 's head out of the gas oven and some-MAGAZINE how  --  somehow it all balanced . But as soon as I had n't got Derek  --  well , I just could n't take it . Does that make any sense at all to you ? " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because I 'm fond of you and I 'm always alarmed for people when things make sense . So now you have n't got any young men ? " She smiled and said , " No . No young men Sad , is n't it ? " " Not very . It 's a thing that will probably right itself . " " Oh yes , " said Ursula . And I knew from the way she said it that it had started to right itself already . S o THERE we are . Do n't tell me it was all quite obvious and what you would have expected . If you were watching the trick in which the lady is sawed in half and you found at the end that she was in half , that would be pretty obvious too . But you would n't have expected it . Because you know that one of the things about ladies is that they do n't get sawed in half . They get themselves into position and the saw comes down through where they seem to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you know that in the end she 'll come bounding out in tights and a smile , without a feather out of place . And if you 're a man the best thing to do is to say it 's all done with mirrors , and reach under the seat for your hat .
