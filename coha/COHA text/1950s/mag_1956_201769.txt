From Wilshire Boulevard to Wall Street , stockholders in the world 's biggest moviemaking company chose up sides in the most colossal management fight in Hollywood history . The prize : control of Loew 's Inc. , which encompasses Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , M-G-M Records , some 170 U.S. and foreign theaters , plus a $33 million funded debt . To head off the battle , Joseph Vogel , Loew 's president of three weeks , flew from his Manhattan office to Hollywood , hustled through the first leg of a monthlong , no-martini inspection , promised to find out what was wrong . <P> In New York a spokesman for Wall Street 's Lehman Bros , and Lazard Freres claimed that together they can control 3,000,000 of Loew 's 5,142,615 shares and throw out the board at the next annual meeting on Feb. 28 . If it takes over Loew 's , the Lehman-Lazard group would probably keep Vogel in charge of Loew 's Theaters division , which he headed until last month , and hire a president who would drastically cut MGM 's staff , replace Movie Production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters , and possibly consolidate MGM 's high-overhead moviemaking facilities with Warner Bros . <P> " Best Studio , Worst Production . " Lehman and Lazard Freres own 150,000 shares of Loew 's stock outright , reckon they can count on the stock support of several hundred thousand shares held by their customers and friends , 144,000 shares held by Affiliated Fund Investment Trust , 262,000 held by Manhattan Brokers Thomson &; McKinnon for an unidentified Canadian group , some 150,000 shares claimed to be represented by Manhattan Attorney Ben Javits ( brother of New York 's Attorney-General Jacob Javits ) , more than 200,000 shares held by customers and associates of Manhattan Broker Arthur Wiesenberger , about 90,000 more owned by French and Swiss interests . <P> <P> The investment houses feel that Loew 's " has the best assets of any company in the business-fine theaters all over the world , a record company , a fine music company . It has the finest studio in the U.S. and the finest in England , plus the greatest film library of all . Yet it is doing worse in production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M-G-M studio , geared to make 45 to 50 pictures a year , made only 25 , lost money . The movie losses , say the dissidents , were made up by Loew 's generally profitable theater operations , The re-release of several old films ( Gone With the Wind , The Wizard of Oz. ) , the leasing of MGM 's film library to TV ( returns to date : $26 million ) . Loew 's overall 1955 profits amounted to $5,311.733 , or just 16% of the total profits of Hollywood 's Big Six moviemakers , v. Loew 's 32% slice in 1950 , when profits were $7,854,454 . <P> In all , the Lehman-Lazard interests charge that the M-G-M movies made during the tenure of MGM 's Production Boss Dore Schary , which dates from 1948 , have lost an estimated $25 million . ( Schary claims that he went in the red only two years . ) The dissidents note that MGM 's successful box-office movies , such as The Blackboard Jungle and Trial , have been outnumbered by the flops-The Prodigal , Jupiter 's Darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc.
