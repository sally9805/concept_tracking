( See Cover ) <P> On a mild morning last April , a band of dignitaries gathered before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery . In the place of honor stood a tall old man whose somber mask of a face looked stiffly ahead . Before him , stretching to the hilltop , was an array of granite pillars , blocks and crosses - the graves of Americans who had died in two wars with Germany . Behind him fluttered the black , red and gold flag of the Federal Republic of Germany . <P> The U.S. Army band sounded The Star-Spangled Banner . Then it broke into the measured strains of Deutschland ber Alles . " This , " murmured the old man , " is a turning point in history . " <P> More dramatically than headline or speech or essay , the music symbolized an amazing story . In 1953 , only eight years after the shame , horror and impotence of defeat in mankind 's bloodiest war , Germany came back . It was a world power once more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about was the stolid old man who stood in Arlington , visibly moved by the strains of his national anthem echoing among the tombstones . He was Konrad Adenauer , Chancellor of the West German Republic , apostle of United Europe , 1953 's Man of the Year . <P> Konrad Adenauer had already guided the hated land of the Hun and the Nazi back to moral respectability and had earned himself a seat in the highest councils of the Western powers . Though she still lacked a formal peace treaty , and the Iron Curtain fenced her off from half her land and from 18 million countrymen , Konrad Adenauer 's West Germany last year emerged as the strongest country on the Continent save Soviet Russia . <P> Her conquerors wooed her for her favors . Neighbors who had helped defeat her so short a time ago talked fearfully once more of her new strength and her even greater potential . Her economy glowed with health . Her products cascaded into the world 's markets . In September came an election which the whole world nervously watched , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of German authoritarianism . The West German voters swept all their Communists and Nazis out of national office and overwhelmingly put their faith in the dedicated , firm-handed democrat , Konrad Adenauer . No longer the passive object of other forces , Germany in 1953 was again one of the formidable forces of history and Konrad Adenauer one of history 's makers . <P> " This year , " said the Man of the Year , " is the year in which the re-emergence of Germany . . . changed the world picture .
