txt WASHINGTON , March 2 ? President Truman declared today that the defenses of the United States were in better shape than they had ever been when the country was not at war . He said he did not believe criticisms that economies in the Defense Department had weakened the nation 's fighting strength . The Chief Executive 's observations were given on the same day that Louis Johnson , Secretary of Defense , predicted that the armed forces would cost the taxpayers of the country $13,000,000,000 a year for at least the next two fiscal years . Budget estimates for that amount for the coming fiscal year , starting July 1 , 1950 , are now before Congress . Mr. Johnson predicted , however , that an increasing percentage of the total would be spent on combat personnel . and equipment and // a decreasing percentage on overhead . He said that the armed services must " get in condition " after their " costly war-born spending habits . " His remarks were made on release of one chapter of his annual report , which was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of this chapter , entitled " Savings , Absorbed Costs and Reductions , " was made at this time on request of the chairmen of the Congressional Armed Services Committees , he explained . The whole report will be delayed four or five weeks for printing . Budget Dubbed " Ike III " Mr. Johnson disclosed that the departmental code name for the Current defense budget was Ike III , in honor of General of the ' Army Dwight D. Eisenhower . For several weeks in the spring and summer of 1949 , General EisenH hower acted as unofficial chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when the *military estimates were being prepared . The experiment , initiated by the late James Forrestal as Secretary of Defense , was considered so successful that the post of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was established by law later in the year and Gen. Omar N. Bradley was appointed to fill it . When General Eisenhower took hold of the project , the total of estimates by the three armed services and the Marine Corps came to something like $18,000,000,000 . This version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a ceiling of $14,200,000,000 . It was whittled to that level and dubbed Ike IL By last August , Mr. Johnson said , it was apparent that further economies could be effected , partly because of lower procurement costs , and the present spending level of $13,000,000,000 ( which is likely to continue for another two years ) became Ike III . Current spending was brought down from President Truman 's original estimates to Congress by savings , absorbed costs and reductions amounting to $1,592,000,000 , the Secretary 's report stated . The areas of saving , some permanent and some transitory , were itemized as follows : Military personnel costs , $377 , - 000,000 ; maintenance and operation , $508,000,000 ; major procurement , $435,000,000 ; public works construction , $242,000,000 ; reserve forces , $56,000,000 , and other military requirements ; $74,000,000 . From the lessons learned in these reductions , the Secretary said , it will be possible to " plow the savings into hardware " in coming years . By this he meant that economies in overhead expenses could be devoted to , ombat requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of this has already been done , saying : " Navy strength has been increased by three attack carriers , three carrier air groups , one cruiser and one battleship in reduced commission . There will be two Marine divisions instead of six battalion landing teams . The Army will be organized into ten divisions rather than nine , and will , also have two additional anti-aircraft battalions . The Air Force will increase the number of planes per group hi three additional bomber groups . 150 Millions for Aircraft " Also , since Aug. 1 , 1949 , $150 , - 000,000 was added to aircraft procurement for the Air Force and $50,000,000 for the Navy . In addition to a 200 per cent increase in the allocation for anti-submarine warfare equipment , 700,000 hours were added for flying in combattype units in the Navy , and Army civilian component allocations were increased by $6,000,000 to rebuild and modernize equipment for the National Guard and $16,000,000 for armories for the organized reserve . " Army materiel procurement was increased by $41,000,000 , including $10,000,000 for new type signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $17 , - 500,000 for heavy ordnance , including special prime movers , and $7,800,000 for modern portable bridges and other new engineer equipment . " Asked about the effect of projected aircraft production in maintaining an aircraft industry capable of rapid expansion to wartime strength , Secretary Johnson said he believed projected expenditures would accomplish this for the next year or two . After that , he expects military spending for airplanes to level off at about $4,500,000,000 a year , and he estimated it would take $5,000 , - 000,000 a year to keep the industry at the peak desired for efficiency in peacetime . He emphasized that the reductions in expenditures had been initiated by the armed services themselves , and said there was no need of any coercion from the office of the Secretary of Defense .
