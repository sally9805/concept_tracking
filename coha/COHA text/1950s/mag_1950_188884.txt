The script had been carefully polished , as a major production should be , and Director Aly Khan had rehearsed the Lausanne police and the Lausanne-Palace Hotel staff time &; again . As soon as Leading Lady Rita Hayworth felt the first labor pains , Aly was to pick up a phone on a private wire and simply breathe the secret password : " Malbrough s'en va-t-en guerre Maryborough-is going to war . " At the other end , a police functionary would flash the word to the motorized cops who were standing eagerly by to escort the couple to the Mont-Choisi Clinic . Then , after Aly and Rita slipped out , the concierge would lock every exit of the hotel , thus trap the impatient representatives of the world press . <P> The Chase . Shortly before 3 o'clock one morning last week , just seven months and a day after their wedding near Cannes , Rita gave Aly his cue , and Aly , in his own words , " blew up completely . " Throwing away the script , he stopped long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat over her pajamas . Then he hustled her out of the four-room suite , through one of the hotel 's side exits and into a black Buick . Aly took the wheel himself and roared off to the clinic two miles away . <P> Like an old trouper , the concierge locked the hotel doors , but the 20 journalists on the job ( awakened by inside tipsters ) soon got them open and were off in pop-eyed pursuit . Catching word that something was up , two carloads of police screeched up to the clinic , a poor third behind Aly and the press . After that , 20 cops in uniform and plain clothes joined the newsmen in an eight-hour vigil outside the building . Excited Swiss who lived across from the clinic fed the newsmen hot tea .

" <P> In her lilac-strewn clinic . suite overlooking Lake Geneva , Rita slept , woke to a happy world which poured messages of congratulation , flowers and presents upon her . On New Year 's Day a Swiss photographer was admitted to the Mont-Choisi Clinic to take pictures of a radiant Rita with Princess Yasmin on the pillow beside her , sound asleep . Ahead of Rita lay a sojourn in Aly 's 15-room chalet at Gstaad , the winter sports resort , where she would rest and recuperate under the care of a special masseur and the fond eyes , of course , of Aly , his pressagent and anybody who could read a newspaper . <P> And after that ? Hollywood still beckoned , and millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign up little Yasmin ( as David O. Selznick once bid for the services of Shirley Temple 's baby daughter ) . But thus far , the **35;6790;TOOLONG script from true life had been a howling romantic success .
