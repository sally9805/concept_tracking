IN Iris Murdoch 's novel The Bell there is an adolescent boy who one clay learns the word " rebarbative " and thereafter not only finds an extraordinary number of opportunities to use it but wonders how in the world he had ever managed to get along without it before . ( Since " rebarbative " means repulsive it is obviously of particular usefulness in adolescence . ) But I feel much the same way about the word " endotic , " which I have just encountered for the first time in Fosco Maraini 's Meeting with Japan ( Viking , $10 ) . The dictionaries at my disposal ? anti naturally we men who read dictionaries have some good ones around the house ? do not record the word , but apparently it derives from the Greek endon , meaning " in , within , at home " ( if that etymological guess is correct it must be related , at a few removes , to the word " indigenous " ) , and Maraini uses it , or at least his gifted translator , Eric Mosbacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maraini 's point in contrasting the exotic and the endotic is that if we want to understand a culture fundamentally different from ours , we must learn where the endotic leaves off and the exotic begins ; we must not attempt to translate what is genuinely strange into the familiar ( the certain failure of such an enterprise he convincingly illustrates in a discussion of why a line of Dante can not be translated into Japanese and why a saying of Confucius can not be translated into a Western language ) : we must rather learn to " relive from the inside the mental universes " of people who come to the experience of life with a set of expectations very different from our own . There is nothing very new in such a warning , of course ; it is a commonplace of cultural anthropology . But Maraini does an uncommonly fine job of helping the reader to relive the mental universe of the Japanese from the inside . He has seen the Japanese at their best and at their worst ? before the war he was lecturer in Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant opportunities to indulge his interest in Japanese history , art , religion , and daily life ; since the war he has traveled widely in thecountry , renewing and enlarging his acquaintance with its charms ; but during the war he and his family were interned for two years and experienced the Japanese capacity for brutality at very nearly its worst . ( The account of his internment , with which the book closes , is among the best sections . ) The beauty of Meeting with Japan lies in its lavishness of fascinating detail . Though Maraini does not hesitate to generalize , and his generalizations are often very useful indeed , they are also at times less fresh than the details that illustrate them , and very occasionally they seem to be contradictory . For instance , he reproaches the Westerner for trying to impose dualism on Japanese art , yet elsewhere , in a discussiun of the Japanese theater , he speaks of its " characteristic dualism . " But that hardly matters . For page after page Maraini tells about one aspect of Japanese life after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflicting views of eminent dragonologists on the nature of dragons or describing the intricacies of the Japanese language , telling how a tip should he presented in a Japanese restaurant ( it should always be wrapped , preferably in a special kind of envelope ) or distinguishing between the behavior expected of a first and second son ( second sons arc supposed to have amorous adventures but first sons should behave themselves ) , he is always lively , observant , absorbing . Maraini essentially sees the Japanese as a people with a marvelous power to assimilate the trappings of other societies without really changing themselves . Japanese history records repeated massive encounters with other civilizations ? with Korea and China in earlier epochs , with Catholic Portugal in the Renaissance , with the industrialized West in the later nineteenth century , with America since 1945 . Yet Maraini thinks that none of these confrontations has greatly changed the Japanese beneath the surface . Their approach to life remains aesthetic rather than rational , with a capacity for great sensitivity and refinement of taste at one extreme and for gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese Maraini illustrates by pointing to their gods . In spite of the beauty of the Japanese landscape , nature in the archipelago can be very fierce ? earthquakes , typhoons , and so on are far from rare . ( According to one formulation , the four terrors of Japan are earthquakes , fire , thunder , and father . ) Yet the Japanese gods are kindly and beneficent . Maraini believes that these gentle gods go back to a period before recorded history , when the ancestors of the modern Japanese lived further south , in a more clement climate . Maraini thinks that the Japanese encounter with America has been an almost total failure except for some love affairs . The Americanized Japanese he finds vulgar and shoddy , with an ignorant distaste for their own culture and with a passion for all that is tawdriest among the victors . He thinks that the Japanese have no real grasp of the concept of individualism , that they continue . to see a man as the position he occupies in society and to calculate his worth on that basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their brilliant ability to adopt the technology , medicine , and chewing gum of the West . ( In speaking of the failure of the Japanese-American encounter Maraini is thinking only of its effect on the Japanese . What its effect has been on the thousands of young Americans who have been stationed in Japan at one time or another since the war is another . ? matter . My impression is that for many of these young men it has been a major educational experience , and I have rarely talked to anyone with Japanese service behind him who did not hope to go back some day . ) Meeting with Japan is a handsome book , illustrated with many drawings by Japanese artists and over 150 fine photographs , many in color , by the author . The pictures demonstrate what the : ext suggests ? that ? Maraini has a fine eye for beauty in landscape , art , and the female form . ALSO IN ASIA Segaki by David Stacton ( Pantheon , $3.50 ) is a novel set in feudal Japan , and the two main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtitle " A Zen Novel " ) and his brother , a painter . They have various adventures too tenuous and elusive to summarize ? in fact , I am not . dways certain which characters are real and which are ghosts ? and in the end they meet violent deaths . The book is elegantly written and many of the observations about man and nature are far from stupid ; occasionally they illustrate points that Maraini makes about the Japanese and Zen , as when Stacton speaks of the " unique ability of the Japanese to he primitive and sophisticated at the same time . " Yet Segaki strikes me as a thin and pretentious little book . The voice of the author makes a curtain of sound between the reader and the action ; it goes on and on , always graceful , sometimes witty , but a little too well pleased with itself . Here , for instance , is a paragraph describing a garden : " And of course , in the moonlight , one could not see very much , but was only aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrubs , and the colorless presence of sleeping flowers . It was like an imaginary garden with real toads in it . But then , perhaps all gardens are imaginary . The more we love them , the more assiduously we tend them , the more they show us the world as we would like to be able to believe it to be , and if there are real toads in it , perhaps that is only testimony to the willful na ? vet ? with which we insist upon the goodness of things , at the price even of self-protection , as though we were to cry out to the fairy dying of disbelief , whom we know not to exist : yes , we do believe in you , we do . And just because we deny reason and favor love , the fairy revives and does exist . " The phrase about " an imaginary garden with real toads in it " is borrowed From Marianne Moore ; the fairy " dying of disbelief " is obviously our old friend Tinker Bell in Peter Pan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a novel about medieval Japan is a little hard to say . Nor am I sure that the words always make sense : does n't the author mean that we insist on the goodness of things even at the price of selfdaccption rather than self-protection ? I hope that other readers may find the passage quoted sufficiently entrancing to lead them to read the whole book , but I find it languid and mannered . I N Yesterday ( Simon K : Schuster , $3 ) Maria Der-moat recalls a kind of life in Asia that has now vanished . Mme. Dermoitt is a Dutchwoman who was born of a colonial family in Java in 1888 , and Yesterday is an account of a girl 's life on a large tropical-plantation before and around the turn of the century . Mme. Dermoilt writes from the point of view of the young girl she once was , with no attempt to explain or account for the puzzling or alien aspects of her story . It is ( in Maraini 's terms ) a mixture of the endotic and exotic . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden , a faithful servant who confesses without hesitation that he had eaten human flesh and Found it very good too , an old Dutch gentleman absorbed in Javanese religion . But at bottom Mme. Dermoiles story is a story of youth anywhere - ZI girl 's discovery that the kind of people she has been brought up to respect are capable of brutal and violent behavior , that the world of adult emotion is full of unexpected turnings and sudden abysses , and that she must in the end leave the walled garden of her parents ' love . Yesterday is a book completely free of fake THE NEW BOOKS pretensions . It is a brief book , and its subject is slight , but it never strikes a false note . I Shall Not Hear the Nightingale ( Grove , 53.95 , paper $1.95 ) , a novel by a young Indian writer named Khnshwant Singh , is another mixture of the exotic and endotic . The story chiefly concerns the conflict between the generations , which is certainly a universal subject for fiction and presumably a universal aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sikhs of the Punjab and the time is 1942-43 , when many Indians were divided over how to carry on their campaign for independence during the war , the universal situation takes on some distinctly local color . The father in the story comes from a Sikh family that has served the British raj for several generations , and through longevity and diligence he has become senior magistrate , the highest officer under the English deputy commissioner of the district . He is very much a " company man " who accepts British rule without question and knows how to snake the most of whatever opportunities it presents to an Indian . In the early 1940s he has been especially successful in winning British approval because he has raised a Iot of money among prosperous Indians to aid the British war effort . But the son takes another tack . He is a weak young man , by nature as toadying as his father and considerably less able , but in an effort to justify himself in the eyes of his oversexed young wife and to mark himself as a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of youthful terrorists whose object is immediate independence for India . Out of the conflict between the two , Khushwant Singh makes a mild but moderately entertaining story . Most of the characters have such paltry motives that they can not he taken very seriously , though the mother , a traditional Sikh woman whose life contains her family and her religion and nothing else , is beautifully portrayed . Many of the best passages in the book are in effect brief essays on one aspect or another of Indian life , as when Singh points out that shadows , which in the temperate West are usually taken to be THE NEW BOOKS of sinister import , suggest something kind and welcome in a country as hot as the Indian plain ; or when he discusses how the lack of privacy affects Indian life . ( Incidentally , he destroys the popular idea that Indians are great lovers ; love requires more privacy than most Indian couples can achieve , according to Singh . ) CHIPPER GADABOUT JOHN GODLEY , Lord Kilbracken , is a sprightly gentleman who a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a post-Victorian title in England , and who supports the former by exploiting the latter . Three or four years ago he drove from England to New Zealand and wrote a book about it , and now he has written another about his travels in Russia ? Moscow Gatecrash ( Houghton Mifflin , S3.50 ) . In a day when so much is written about Russia that we are solemnly told we all must read , I am pleased to report that no one really needs to read Moscow Gatecrash . It is competent journalism , full of unobjectionable padding , frequently amusing , and pretty trivial . A good deal of the material might well have come to its final rest in the British tabloid for which it was originally written . An occasional remark has point , and one passage , a detailed description of Khrushchev 's physical appearance , is brilliantly observed . Don Chato Knopf , $4 ) is a novel set in a small Spanish town and written by an American woman who was born in the Philippines , married a Persian , and now lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a book of unparalleled exoticism , and Mrs. Mehdevi certainly makes telling use of her setting , but her main character , the Don Chato of the title , is a man of a sort that occurs in every society . Perhaps he even occurs , to some extent , in every man . Don Chato is a physician in a provincial town . Badly trained for his work , he stumbles through his professional duties in terror of doing something that will reveal his incompetence . His patients are poor people who wo n't or ca n't pay even his modest fees , and lie is always in want of money to maintain his sisterTHE NEW BOOKS housekeeper and himself in the shabby-genteel style he thinks appropriate to his station . He soothes his vanity , always rubbed raw by his encounters with the crass townspeople , with a long amorphous daydream of leaving the village and entering a more opulent society where he will suddenly become more successful with women , more skilled in medicine , and generally more glamorous . Then tragedy strikes ; Don Chato meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is the kind of woman he has always dreamed of meeting , or at least he thinks that she is ; and when , on a characteristically uncireurnspect evening , he reveals his dream to her , she briskly works out a way for him to make it all come true . It is as if a Chekhov character who has spent his life dreaming of going to Moscow suddenly had a ticket thrust into his hand , and the threat of testing his dreams against reality simply undoes Don Chato . The character is of course a kind of Spanish provincial Walter Mitty. but Mitty is almost entirely pathetic , whereas Don Chato is both more ridiculous and more grand . Everything about him is slightly phony except his suffering , but that is enough to make him terribly real . When he cries out , " My soul is like a corkscrew and 1 ca n't ? straighten it out , " or , " Whole days go by when I do not have a thought worthy of a marl , " he has a stature Mitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a first novel by an Englishman named A. E. Ellis , is an account of a young man 's life in a tuberculosis sanitarium in the French Alps . Almost inevitably a novel set in that part of the world and occupied with the subject of tuberculosis leads to comparisons with The Magic Mountain , and I for one think that The Rack can survive the comparisons without apology . But the method of the two books is so different that apart from the subject they bear little resemblance to one another , and which a reader prefers will depend in part on what he thinks fiction should do . Mann 's method in The Magic Mountain is symbolic , at least after the fine opening chapters concerned with Castorp 's career before the sani tarium : his characters " stand for " something besides themselves , and their illness " stands for " something besides itself . Ellis 's method is whatever the opposite of symbolic may be ? his characters are simply themselves , wonderfully or horribly themselves , as the case may be ; and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse because it has no symbolic value , no discernible meaning beyond itself . Most novels that depict the details of illness seem to play upon the hypochondria of the reader in a rather unhealthy way , but The Rack does not . The cold chaste style that Ellis uses enables him to record the cruelest operations without exploiting them ; it is often painful reading but never lugubrious or sensational . ( The time seems to be the late 1940s , before the recent advances in treatment of tuberculosis by drugs . ) Similarly , the love affair between the young Englishman who is the central character and a seventeenyear-old Belgian girl ( another patient ) is flawlessly depicted to bring out both its beauty and its pain . The Rack hardly has anything that could be called a plot or story ; that is the point -- it is an account of people who have surrendered the pretense of controlling their own destinies , of making decisions , of acting . A mysterious force has taken over their lives , laid them flat on their hacks , and brutally deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temperature is an event for them , and so it has to be an event in an account of them . But if the book has no plot it has marvelous characters , not only among the patients but also among the doctors and nurses , the lesser attendants , and the magnificently imperturbable gentleman who is responsible for the execrable food . It is hard to imagine what kind of future Ellis may have as a writer , since The Rack must have been written out of extended personal experience , but he has certainly managed to write a first novel of uncommon power and distinction . ELSEWHERE IN FRANCE Warrior 's Rest by the French writer Christian Rochefort and translated by Lowell Bair ( David McKay , $3.75 ) 33 , Mass . THE NEW BOOKS is a novel told in the first person by a girl named Genevitl.ve Le Theil . In the course of a business trip to see about a small inheritance Genevieve quite accidentally prevents a young man named Renaud from committing suicide , and when she returns to Paris he returns with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unawakened bourgeois girl , who has idealistically planned to devote her life and her inheritance to the welfare of children . Renaud is nihilistic , self-destructive. alcoholic , utterly without any virtue recognized in the Boy Scout oath or in polite society . He shocks Genevieve , sponges off of her , makes no attempt to justify his life with her , yet all his outrageous behavior only increases her passion for him . Finally she becomes pregnant and they marry ; exhausted by his excesses , Renaud enters an institution for alcoholics . No doubt this sounds pretty dismal , and in a sense it is , it surely is . But the character of Renaud is drawn with a good deal of force and carries a certain appalling conviction . I suspect that his literary ancestry goes back to the libertines in the Marquis de Sade , but he is also very much a contemporary . If he were an American he would be beat ; if he were English he would be angry ; since he is French I suppose he must be some kind of existentialist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels that I propose to tliscuss in ending this column ought , for the sake of symmetry , to bring us back from such exotic places as Japan and the French Alps to the triumphant endoticism of the supermarket and the diaper service , but in fact both deal with parts of America and aspects of American life that are hardly more familiar to use than Fujiyama . The first ? Men Die by H. L. Humes ( Random House , $3.50 ) ? concerns an American naval construction battalion engaged in making an arsenal of a Caribbean island on the eve of the second world war . There are three white officers supervising the work , and all the rest arc Negroes . In the first paragraph the island either influence as much as might he wished . The Finished Man concerns a Senatorial campaign in Florida , and most of the action takes place in a part of Florida the tourist never sees ? the small towns inland , away from the resplendent coast . The contest lies between an experienced old hand with many years ' experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be his successor but does n't want to succeed him quite yet . The main character , through whose eyes the action is seen , is an aimless and uncommitted young man reminiscent of the man who plays a similar part in All the King 's Men . Garrett 's book is overintellectualized ? the characters tend to be too obvious in serving their allegorical function . But in spite of this flaw , and in spite of the influence of Faulkner and Warren , The Finished Man tells a lively story with a good deal of dramatic flair . There are several scenes written with great skill . Garrett can handle language effectively ; he has both intelligence and wit , and when lie is surer of his own voice as a novelist ( he is already an assured and individual writer of short stories ) , he should produce excellent fiction . Meanwhile , The Finished Man , his first novel , is well worth reading .
