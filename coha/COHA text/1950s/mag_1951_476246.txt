In the preceding articles of this series Fred Hoyle has described the Earth and nearby space , the Sun , and the stars in terms of the new cosmology which is in the process of exploration by many of the younger astrophysicists . The bold ideas which he advances in this installment lead directly to his concluding article next month , in which he will describe the expanding universe and his personal view of man 's place in it . Mr. Hoyle is fellow of St. John 's College and lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge University . His articles were originally prepared as radio talks for the BBC ; they wilt be published in book form by Harper &; Brothers later this month. ? The Editors . I AM now going to tell a story . I hope you will find it an interesting story , perhaps even a fascinating one . It is the story of how the Earth itself was born , how it came into being along with the other planets that go to form the retinue of the Sun . The origin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmology . It affects our whole outlook on life . For instance , the question of whether life is rare or commonplace in the Universe depends essentially on this issue . I suppose that it is because of its cosmological importance that many people are given so strongly to asserting that the planets originated as bits of material that were torn out of the Sun . For some reason or other this idea has a deep-rooted appeal . So perhaps I had better begin by outlining some of the arguments that show why it must be wrong . The origin of the solar system can only be understood if we appreciate its scale . As I have said before , this can best be done by thinking of it as a model in which the Sun is represented by a ball about the size of a largegrapefruit . On this model the great bulk of the planetary material lies at a hundred yards or more from the Sun . In other words , nearly all the planetary material lies very far out . This simple fact is already the death blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets in the Sun itself . For how could the material have been flung out so far ? It was proved for instance by H. N. Russell that if Jeans ' well-known tidal theory were right , the planets would have to move around the Sun at distances on our model of not more than a few feet . This notion of Jeans ' , which still seems to be very widely believed , was that the planets were torn out of the Sun by the gravitational pull of a star that passed close by . Once this difficulty was appreciated , people attached to the planets-from-the-Sun idea shifted their ground . The planets , they said , were not formed with the Sun in a state as it is at present , but at a time when the Sun had a vastly greater size , as it must have had when it was condensing out of the interstellar gas . But it is hard to see how this can help . To make it work at all it would be necessary to demonstrate that a blob of primeval gas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the great bulk of it went to form a massive inner body ? that is to say , the Sun ? surrounded at vast distances by a wisp of planetary material . And I do not think that this can be done . At any rate all the attempts that have so far been made to cope with the difficulty seem to me to fall very far short of the mark . Also there is another and perhaps more important reason why our Earth and the planets can not have originated with the Sun . I have tried to bring out the dominating cosmic role played by hydrogen , the simplest of the elements . Helium , the next simplest , is produced in appreciable quantities in the inner regions of normal stars like the Sun . But , apart from hydrogen and helium , all other elements are extremely rare , all over the Universe . In the Sun they amount to only about 1 per cent of the total mass . Contrast this with the Earth and the other planets where hydrogen and helium make only about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silicon , magnesium , and aluminum . This contrast brings out two important points . First , we see that material torn from the Sun would not be at all suitable for the formation of the planets as we know them . Its composition would be hopelessly wrong . And our second point in this contrast is that it is the Sun that is normal and the Earth that is the freak . The interstellar gas and most of the stars are composed of material like the Sun , not like the Earth . You must understand that , cosmically speaking , the room you are now sitting in is made of the wrong stuff . You , yourself , are a rarity . You are a cosmic collector 's piece . II H ERE then is a way to approach the problem of the origin of the planets . We must find a source of the strangely complicated rare material out of which the Earth and the planets are made . I will begin by telling you the answer in two sentences . There was once another star moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great was the explosion that all the remnants were blown a long way from the Sun into space with the exception of a tinywisp of gas out of which the Earth and the planets have condensed . So the first point to get clear is that the Sun was not always a single star . Before the Earth was born it was one of a pair of stars . As we said last month , such a pair is called a binary system . Now if you pick a star at random the chance that it will be a separate star by itself , as the Sun is at present , is no greater than the chance that it will be a member of a binary system . Let us see what can happen if we suppose that the Sun was at one time a component in such a double system . First we make a choice for the distance between the Sun and the companion star it used to have . It is important to realize that there is practically no restriction on our freedom of choice here , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the component stars in a binary may be anywhere in the enormous range from a tenth of a light-year down to a fraction of a light-minute . The required distance apart of the Sun and its companion star is intermediate between these extremes , being about one light-hour . That is to say , on a plan with the Sun represented by our grapefruit the companion star would be about 100 yards away . This value will give you a clue as to how the choice of separation is made ; namely , so that in the final outcome the bigger planets will be found to lie at the right sort of distances from the Sun . T HE next step is to draw up a set of specifications for the companion star . It must have been appreciably more massive than the Sun . It must have been a very special star . It must have been a star that exploded with extreme violence . It must have been a supernova . Thanks largely to the work of the two Mount Wilson astronomers , Baade and Minkowski , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When one explodes , most of the material ? that is to say , considerably more material than there is inside the whole of the Sun ? gets blown out into space as a tremendous cloud of fiercely incandescent gas moving at a speed of several million miles an hour . For a few days the accompanying blaze of light is as great as the total radiation by all the 10,000,000,000 or so stars in the Galaxy . It was out of such a holocaust that the Earth and planets were born , and it happened in this way . Not all of a supernova is blown away as gas in such an explosion . But the dense stellar nucleus that was left over after the explosion of the Sun 's companion star did not stay with the Sun . One of the effects of the explosion was to give this stellar nucleus a recoil that broke its gravitational connection with the Sun . It moved off , and is now some unrecognized star lying in some distant part of the Galaxy . But before it left the Sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it puffed out a cloud of gas that the Sun managed to hold onto . In as little as a few centuries this cloud of gas spread out around the Sun and took on the form of a rotating circular disk . As we shall see later , the planets condensed out of the material in this disk . So the real parent of the Earth is not the Sun at all , but some star that is probably unnamed and unseen . According to the results of Baade and Minkowski the temperature inside a supernova is about three hundred times greater than it is at the center of the Sun . At such a temperature all manner of nuclear transmutations occur with great rapidity . The helium-hydrogen reactions which are so important in the Sun are no longer important here . Instead , helium becomes transmuted to elements of what is called high atomic weight ; for example , magnesium , aluminum , silicon , iron , lead , and uranium , to name only a few . The importance of this is obvious . It means that the companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gas with just the right kind of composition necessary to account for the constitution of the Earth and the planets . Before we go on to discuss the condensation of the planets , perhaps I might mention how this general picture of the origin of the planets has arisen . It is really the outcome of developments that started with Jeans ' tidal theory . First this was modified and improved by Jeffreys . Then H. N. Russell overthrew both these theories with the sort of criticism referred to earlier . Lyttleton was the next to take up the problem about fifteen years ago . He was the first to realize for certain that the planetary material can not havecome out of the Sun , and it is to him that we owe the development of the double star idea . Once this stage was reached the remaining steps were more or less inevitably . They arose for the most part through an attempt to put the theory on a firm observational footing . The final stages in the formation of the planets after the tremendous explosion were comparatively tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun 's companion star must have moved far away from the Sun , or at any rate far enough for its effect on the wisp of gas that was captured by the Sun to be unimportant . This wisp of gas then settled down into a fiat circular disk that rotated around the Sun ? that is to say , it spread out around the Sun and then it settled down into the disk . The main part of the gas must have been distributed in the regions where the orbits of the great planets , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune , now lie . This means that on the model we are using with a grapefruit sun the main part of the disk must have had a diameter of several hundred yards . At its edges the gas would have trailed away very gradually . B UT I must now explain how such a rotating disk of gas condensed into the planets as we know them . Once the supernova remnant had receded to an appreciable distance , the temperature of the main bulk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing point of water . Many sorts of molecules must then have been formed and , as was pointed out in 1944 by Professor Jeffreys and A. L. Parsons , these molecules must have collected into a swarm of solid bodies by a process very similar to the formation of water drops in the clouds of our own terrestrial atmosphere . But this condensation into solid particles must have been offset to some extent by collisions between the particles themselves , which tend to return material to the gaseous state . At any particular time there must have been a rough balance between condensation from gas into solid bodies and evaporation that converted solid material back into gas .. You might think that this stalemate would have had to go on forever , and it probably would have done so if the raindrop form of condensation were the whole story . But in a situation like this if any particular condensation should ever happen to grow to a certain critical size , which is about a hundred miles across , the gravitational pull of the condensation itself would begin to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , able to reach out into the surrounding gas and drag it into the condensation . When this happens the rate of condensation is greatly increased . It is this that ensures that such a cloud of gas would form into a few comparatively large bodies rather than into a swarm of much smaller particles . The essential point is that although the chance that a particular body ever grows to the critical size is very small , given sufficient time it will certainly happen in a few cases . The fewer the number of cases the fewer the number of planets into which the material finally condenses . For once the gravitational field of a growing body comes into operation the rate of acquisition of material becomes so large that the first few bodies to attain the critical size then go on to snatch up practically all the material of the disk . P ERHAPs you will see this best if I quote one or two of the results calculated for our solar system . The first condensations to grow large are believed to have taken about 1,000,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this stage only about 100,000 years was needed for such a primordial planet to increase its mass up to the same order as those of the great planets , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune . This shows you the tremendous accelerating effect of this condensation by gravitation . Now this has an important consequence . It means that the Earth can hardly have been formed as a primordial condensation . For a condensation would hardly stop short after taking 1,000,000,000 years to reach the mass of the Earth if it only needed a further 100 , - 000 years to go on and become a great planet . It could , of course , be argued that a condensation stopped short at the mass of the Earth simply because all the gas in its neighborhood had become exhausted . This might be a reasonable argument if we had only one case to explain , but there are five planets ? Mercury , Venus , Mars , Pluto , and the Earth ? and also about thirty satellites to be accounted for . It would be stretching coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cessation of growth in all these cases . Besides , there is another argument that shows the same thing . None of the present planets can have been primordial condensations , not even the great planets . For owing to the rotation of the disk around the Sun , the primordial planets must have acquired axial rotations ? that is to say , rotations like the rotation of the Earth around its polar axis . Once the primordial planets had formed into a compact state , their times of rotation must have become less than about seven hours , and as Lyttleton showed in 1938 , a solid planet rotating as rapidly as this must break up under the power of its own rotation . The great planets , then , must be the main chunks arising from these processes of breakup . Now in the breakup it is also to be expected that a number of comparatively small blobs become detached from the main bodies as they separate from each other . For the most part , these blobs remained circling around the great planets ? and these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them . But a few of the larger blobs seem to have escaped , and these are the five small planets ? Venus , Mercury , Mars , Pluto , and the Earth . Very probably the Moon was an adjacent blob that became detached along with the Earth . So , to sum up , there were a number of big primordial planets that broke up about 2,500,000,000 years ago , and one of the bits of the debris was our Earth and another the Moon . III T HIS picture of the way the Earth came into being is I think very important to our studies of the interior of the Earth . It affects our views on the probable temperature of the deep interior , suggesting that it may be much less than was formerly believed . It provides interesting possibilities regarding the origin of the Earth 's magnetism . It leads to a plausible explanation of the origin of the surface rocks . For the Earth must have originally moved along a highly flattened path that took it into the inner parts of the gaseous disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the primordial condensations , which were formed much farther out from the Sun . So the Earth moved through a medium consisting partly of gas and partly of comparatively small solid bodies . This had two effects : one was to round up the Earth 's motion into a nearly circular path that lies well inside the orbits of the great planets , and the other was to modify the surface features of the Earth through the acquisition of various gases and solid bodies . The rocks of the Earth 's crust may well have originated in this way . In particular , it is possible that the Earth acquired its radioactive materials during this final stage . Among the gases acquired were probably nitrogen , water , oxygen , and carbon dioxide . The histories of Venus , Mercury , and Mars must have been somewhat different because their orbits took them through different parts of the disk . In particular , Venus seems to have obtained little or no water but very large quantities of carbon dioxide and also possibly nitrogen . Mars , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water as the Earth . The fate of Pluto we do not know . By now we 've covered enough ground for us to refer back to the end of my first article when I said that there are about 1,000,000 planetary systems in the Milky Way in which life may exist . I should like now to tell you how I made this estimate . It must depend , as you will see , on the frequency of supernova explosions within our Galaxy . No supernova outburst is visible in the Milky Way at the present time . But the gases hurled into space by the supernova observed by the Chinese in A. D. 1054 actually can be seen . It was these gases that furnished Baade and Minkowski with the information I mentioned above . Since A. D. 1054 two other supernovae have also blazed out in the Milky Way , one in 1572 and the other in 1604 . On this basis it is to he expected that , on the average , one supernova occurs every two or three hundred years . This estimate , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supernovae in galaxies other than our own . At this rate there must have been more than 10,000,000 supernova explosions since the oldest stars were born ? which was about 4,000,000,000 years ago . Now something like a half of all these supernovae must have been components in binary systems , and must accordingly have given right chemical substances occur on the Earth . A long list of this sort of statement could be compiled , and to some people it looks as if there is indeed something very strange and odd about our particular home in the Universe . But I think that this outlook arises from a misunderstanding of the situation . Because if everything was not just right we should not be here . We should be somewhere else .
