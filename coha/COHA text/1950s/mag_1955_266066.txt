With one announced candidate off and running and some active inactive candidates shuffling about , U.S. Democrats began to maneuver toward the national convention of 1956 . Adlai Stevenson had barely started to run , officially , before some fellow Democrats began to elbow him at the turns and throw clods at him . <P> If they could trip him , they would ; if they could n't they might change his style of running . <P> At the Democratic National Committee 's $100-a-plate dinner in Chicago ( TIME , Nov. 28 ) , Stevenson had borrowed a word from the Eisenhower Administration 's lexicon to say that " moderation is the spirit of the times .

It seems to me you fall into the Republican vernacular when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Party is not moderately for labor , not moderately for the small businessman , not moderately for any one such group .

At a Colorado Young Democrats dinner in Denver , Michigan 's ambitious , bow-tied Governor G. Mennen ( " Soapy " ) Williams devoted nearly all of a bitterly worded speech to an attack on moderation .

I would be ashamed to harken to the counsels of those who have proposed , in effect , that this is an ideal time for a national coffee break . "                 @ @ @ @
