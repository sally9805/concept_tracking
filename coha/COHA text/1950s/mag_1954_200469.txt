Stephen Mitchell decided that he has troubles enough as chairman of the Democratic National Committee without taking on the special problems of two California Democrats running for Congress : 1 ) Robert L. Condon , the Congressman who was barred-as a " security risk " - from witnessing atom-bomb tests in Nevada last year ; and 2 ) James Roosevelt , whose wife-now seeking separation-has accused him of adultery with a dozen women . <P> " Both of these candidates have taken the view that our primaries may be used for personal vindication , " wrote Mitchell last week . " We will exercise our right to withhold support . ' ' Roosevelt promptly protested that such a policy " would , if generally accepted , open the door to political blackmail ... I shall not campaign for vindication , " he said . " I shall campaign on the issues and my qualifications for the office . "
