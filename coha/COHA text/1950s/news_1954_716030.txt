txt The West swiftly accepted today the order of procedure proposed at the opening session of the four-power conference by Vyacheslav M. Molotov , Soviet Foreign Minister . Many observers had expected a sharp debate on the first item of the schedule offered by Mr. Molotov : " Measures for reducing tension in international relations and the convening of a meeting of the ministers for foreign affairs of France , Britain , the U. S. A. , the Soviet Union and the Chinese People 's Republic . " Western spokesmen emphasized that the mere fact of annroval of Mr. Molotov 's topical time table did not in any sense commit the democracies to agreement with his views on the matters mentioned in the Soviet agenda or to the phraseology chosen to describe the issues . In accepting the Soviet order of discussion , John Foster Dulles , United States Secretary of State , made it clear that the United States would deal with Communist China " when the occasion requires , " as on the Korean question , but would not agree to including Peiping in a five-power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulles said-that , neverti less , he was prepared to deag with and dispose of Mr. Molotov 's agenda so the conferees could get down to the discussion of Germany . " The sooner we can get to it , the better , " Mr. Dulles declared . " Let us get on with our work . Let us truly discharge that responsibility on which the hopes of millions center . " The agenda Mr. Molotov proposed yesterday included : " Measures for reducing tension in international relations and the convening of a meeting of ministers for foreign affairs of France , Britain , the United States , the Soviet Union and the Chinese People 's Republic . " The German question and the problems of insuring European security . " The Austrian state treaty . " Mr. Dulles , who had refrained from making asked opening speech until today , asked for " a fresh start " in negotiating for peace and - warned that " new ideas and new vision " were necessary . He said he regretted the " spirit of vengeance and of hatred " evoked by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wartime spirit of Yalta and on the Versailles conference after World War I. Plan for E. D. C. Defended Mr. Dulles spoke at length about the European Defense Community , which Moscow wishes to block , stressing that it had been conceived precisely to prevent a resurgence of German militarism , ' contrary to the Soviet impression . " No part of the European army can ever be used to serve any national ends in Europe , " Mr. Dulles said . He also declared " there is no known substitute for the E. D. C. " He warned the Russians against the dangers of reviving FrenchGerman hostility . On the issue of Communist China , the Secretary made these points : qThe United States will not agree to participate in any fivepower conference with China " for the purpose of dealing generally with the peace of the world . " gThe United States is prepared to deal with Peiping when the occasion requires it . But Washington thinks no group of five powers has the right to arrogate to itself the authority to determine the destinies of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extemporaneous address confined to observations on Germany , China , and his idea of a five-power conference . Mr. Molotov said he was prepared to seek an accommodation and agreement on Germany and European security . He insisted he was not seeking to promote discord between France and Germany but friendship between those two nations , as well as between them and the Soviet Union . There is no argument that China is a great power , he continued . She has been deprived of her rights to join the United Nations as a result of the change of regime , " a great event in Asia , " which makes it all the more necessary for the four powers to meet with Peiping , he added . " We are told that the Soviet Union wishes to stir up enmity between France and Germany , " Mr. Molotov said . " On the contrary we desire and shall do everything possible to bring about friendly relations between France and Germany between France and the Soviet Union and between the Soviet Union , France and Germany . * * * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to Britain and , I should think , to the United States . " Following Mr. Molotov 's rebuttal , Georges Bidault , French Foreign Minister , and Anthony Eden , British Foreign Secretary , briefly observed that they had made concessions in accepting the Soviet agend so the conferees could discuss with practical things . Mr. Molotov immediately followed up the accord on an agenda by introducing a resolution calling for a meeting of the four ministers represeftted at the 13tlin talks with the Foreign Minister of Communist China next May or June . " In view of the need to strengthen world peace and security and to eliminate the threat of a new war , and in view of the need to create more favorable conditions to develop friendly relations among the nations , in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter , it is deemed necessary that in MayJune , 1954 , a foreign ministers conference of France , Britain , . the U. S. A. , U. S. S. R. and the Chinese People 's Republic be held . " According to Mr. Molotov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate the threat of a new war and to examine urgent measures to reduce international tension . No response to this idea camelI from Western quarters today . The topic will be debated tomorrow . The decision to avoid a sterile argument over an agenda was made at a luncheon meeting at noon by Mr. Dulles , Mr. Eden and M. Bidault , who was chairman of the day 's conference session . The three Western officials made it clear they would have preferred a very different ageida but were determined to avoid an interminable and delaying battle of words . The atmosphere at the day 's talks was quite cordial and the Soviet delegation joined its Western colleagues for refreshments during a recess . At night , M. Bidault and the leaders of his lentourage dined with Mr , Molotov . To counteract Soviet courting of the French , the West is clearly urging M. Bidault to assume a role of leadership in presenting its basically agreed positions . In his speecJi , summarizing the democratic attitude , Mr. Dulles compared " the calm wise words of M. Bidault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid tribute to " the genius of France " and ridiculed " those who would destine France to an humble place in the Soviet world of enforced conformity . " He recalled that the idea of the European Defense Community , as well as other organizations designed to unify Europe , had been conceived by France .
