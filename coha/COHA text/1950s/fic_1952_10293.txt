WERE married in Bruno , a Bohemian town in the rolling country just south of the Platte , four or five miles ' drive from where her father had a big farm . They were married in the church where Ralph Bassett had married her . It sat on the rise , overlooking the town , and as it was June the door stood open and Will Brady could see the buggies drawn up beneath the shade trees out in front . An elderly man was combing sandburs from a dark mare 's tail . It was quiet on the rise , without a leaf stirring , but in the sunny hollow along the tracks a westerly breeze was turning the wheel of a giant windmill . It looked softly blurred , quite a bit the way the heat made everything look in Indian Bow , with the air , like a clear stream of water , flowingup from the hot earth . Near the windmill a '  |p52man  was sinking a post , and the sound of the blows , like jug corks popping , came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fred Blake had to remind him  --  nudging him sharply  --  to kiss the bride . They went to Colorado Springs , where he sat in the lobby , reading the latest Denver papers , and giving her time , as he said to himself , to compose herself . A little after ten o'clock he went up , and as he opened the door he saw her , seated at her dressing-table , her face in the mirror . The eyes were wide and blank , just as they were in the pie case . She did not smile , nor make any sign that she recognizedhim . Could he bring her something , he asked , but when she neither moved nor seemed to hear him , he closed the door and walked to the end of the hall . There was a balcony there , facing the mountains , and maybe he stood there for some time , for when he came back to the room , the lights were off . He did not turn them on , but quietly undressed in the dark . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in bed with a married woman , there were many things , perhaps , that he did n't know much about . That was why he was able to lie there , all night , and think about it . The woman beside him , his wife , was rolled up tight in the sheet . She had used the sheet on top for this purpose so that he was lying next to the blanket , a woolly one , andp53perhaps that helped keep him awake . She seemed to be wrapped from head to foot , as mummies are wrapped . It occurred to him that something like that takes a good deal of practice , just as it took practice to lie , wrapped up like a mummy , all night . It took practice , and it also took something else . It took fear . This woman he had married was scared to death . When a person is scared that bad , what can you do ? You can lie awake , for one thing , in case this person might be lonely , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like men who fell asleep . But it was hard to picture Opal Mason rolled up in a sheet . Or what it was now in this room that frightened this woman . As he had never been married before , he was not as upset as he might have been , for it occurredto him that there might be something he had n't been told . In the marriage of widows , perhaps , a ceremony . A ritual that called for spending one night rolled up in a sheet . He had heard of such things . It was something he could think about . There was also the fact that this woman was a Bohemian , a foreigner , and perhaps she had foreign ways . But nobody had told him . And while he wondered , she fell asleep . In time he fell asleep himself , but not too well beneath the woolly blanket , which may have been why he dreamed as he did , and remembered it . Hep54saw before him Ralph Bassett , standing behind the desk . He had a large paunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest , between the lower buttons , was worn threadbare where he rubbed against the handle of the coin drawer . A strange dream , but Will Brady fathomed it . All these years  --  and it seemed very long  --  Ralph Bassett had rubbed the coin drawer during the day , then he had gone home to rub against his mummy-wrapped wife at night . It did n't strike him as funny . Nor did it strike him as out of this world . If a woman has lived twelve years with a man , and the nights of those years rolled up in a sheet , and this woman was now your wife , it deserved serious thought . And while he thought , this woman , his wife , snored heavily . Their honeymoon room had a view of the mountains , with Pike 's Peak , and a cloud of snow on it , and as it was warm these windows were open on the sky . The glass doors stood open on their balcony . Through these doors he could see the light on the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toward morning the eastern slopes were pink with light . He got out of bed and stood for a while on the balcony . There was a good deal to see and to hear , as the city below him was rising , and in the blue morning light the woman on the bed seemed out of this world . Still wrapped in thep55sheet , she looked prepared for burial . He dressed in the bathroom , and when he came out her white arm lay over her face , shutting out the light , so he closed the doors to the balcony . What did he feel ? What he seemed to feel was concern for her . Neither anger nor dislike , nor the emotions of a man who had been a fool . No , he felt a certain wonder , what you might call pity , for this man once her husband , now dead , and for this woman , his wife , who was still scared to death . He felt it , that is , for both of them . They were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they living ? Greater than his anger , and his disappointment , was the wonder that he felt that there were such people , and that they seemed to live , as he did , in the same world . Their days in the open , but their nights wrapped up in a sheet . Practically speaking , a honeymoon is where you adjust yourself to something , and Will Brady managedthis adjustment in two weeks . He worked at it . He gave it everything he had . He learned to sleep , or to lie awake , indifferent to her . And when he learned these things this woman , his wife , gave up her sheet . There it was , back where it belonged , between Will Brady and the woolly blanket , and let it be said for him that he recognized it for what it was . A compliment . Perhaps the highest he had ever been paid.  |p56The  truth was that he was flattered , and it was her own suggestion , plainly made , that he learn to do the things her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fasten the hooks at the side of her gowns . In the lobby this woman walked at his side , her hip brushing his own , and coming down from carriages she seemed loose in his arms . Another compliment ? Well , he could take that too . He had taken something out of this world , learned to live with it . He had discovered , in this strange way , something about loving , about pity , and a good deal about hooks and eyes and corset strings . He had this concern for her , and she seemed to be proud of him . Her handsome face was blank , with the pleasant vacant look again . They ate a good deal , in rooms overlooking the city , or in cool gardenswith flowering plants , or they rode in buses to look with others at prominent views . It was not necessary , eating or looking , to say anything . Everythingnecessary had already been said . If in three weeks ' time two strangers can manage something like that , working together , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer , might bring ? Who is to say what they might have made of something like that ? But in three weeks ' time he had to help her into her suit , with the hooks at both sides , and kneel on the floor and button her high travelingshoes . Then he held the ladder for her whilep57she climbed into the upper berth . She was wearing a veil , the car was dark , and it might be said that the last he saw of the woman he knew was her high button shoes and the dusty hem of her petticoats . Whatever they had managed , between them , whatever they had made in the long three weeks , went up the ladder and never came down again . It remained , whatever it was , there in the berth . When she started down the next morning , calling for him to steady the ladder , the woman who spoke his name was a stranger again , his wife . " Ethel , " he said , taking her hand , " you 're home again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare room , with the window open , as he could see down the tracks to the semaphore . When the signals changed , this semaphore made a clicking sound . On quiet summer nights he would hear that sound and then roll on his side , rising on his elbow , to watch the coaches make a band of light on the plains . The rails would click , and when the train had passed , there would be little whirlwinds of dust and leaves , and a stranger might think that a storm was blowingup.  |p58Beyond  the semaphore was the cattle loader , the smell strong over the summer , and down the spur to the west , past the sawmill , the house of a man named Schultz . This man lived alone on a ten-acre farm . In his bedroom , along toward morning , a yellow lamp would be burning , and now and then the shadow of this man Schultz would move on the blind . A hard man , a bear for work , it was known that he had married a city girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town also took her away . He kept the lamp burning , it was said , in case she came back . An hour or so after the Flyer went by , the westboundlocal came along from North Platte , and Will Brady had got into the habit of meeting it . Now and then important men stopped in Calloway . Once a month , for example , the local came along with T. P. Luckett , the man who had charge of the U.P . commissary in Omaha . A big man in every way , around two hundred sixty pounds , Mr. Lucketthad his breakfast in the hotel , and while sitting in the lobby , smoking his cigar , he seemed to feel like talking with someone . At that time in the morning Will Brady was the only man there . In T. P. Luckett 's opinion , that of a man who spoke frankly , Calloway was dead and did n't know it  --  a one-horse town with the horse ready for pasture , as he put it . Nebraska had spread itself too thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what future there was , in anything but cattle , lay in the east . Within a day 's ride from Omaha , that is . The whole state was tipped , T. P. Luckett said , low in the east , high in the west , and the best of everything had pretty well run off of it , like a roof . The good land was along the Missouri , near Omaha . The good men , as well , and in T. P. Luckett'sopinion it was high time a young fellow like Will Brady gave it serious thought . Saw which way the wind was blowing , that is , and got off the dime . Calloway might always need a jerkwater hotel to meet the local , but a jerkwater man could take care of it . This fellow Luckett made it clear that a man like Will Brady , with his oversize head , was doing little more than wasting his time . Will Brady had never thought of himself in such terms . Whether he was an up-and-coming man , and ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing or not doing was wastinghis time . He simply did it . That was the end of it . But it does n't take a man long to acquire a taste for the better things . All he needs are these things . The taste comes naturally . No , he had never given it a thought  --  but he did now . Running a hotel was little more than sitting in the lobby , between the potted palms , and facing the large railroad map of the state on the wall.  |p60There  on the map any man could see for himself . There were ten towns in the east for every one in the west . Did it matter ? Well , it did when you thought about it . When you 're married , in a way , and have settled down , and have stopped , in a way , thinking about women , you find you have time now and then to sit and think about something else . Your future , for instance , and whether you 're currently wasting your time . T. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up thinking about women in order to spend all of his time thinking about eggs . He thought about eggs because fresh eggs was one of the big dining-car problems , and T. P. Luckett was the top dining-car man . This problem kept a big man like Luckett awake half the night . Wondering how he could just put his hands on an honest-to-God fresh egg . Eggs were always on this man 's mind , and perhaps it was natural that Will Brady , with nothingmuch on his mind , would get around to thinkingabout them . He made T. P. Luckett 's problem something of his own . Take those eggs he had for breakfast , for instance ; at one time he would have eaten them , that was all , but now he examined the shell , and marked the weight of each egg in his hand . He broke them into a saucer to peer at the yolk , examine it for small rings . He considered the color of the eggs , and one morning he made the ob/servation that the whites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pan . Other eggs , perhaps older ones , had whites like milky water , the yolk poorly centered and slipping off to one side . T. P. Luckett thought this very interesting . His particular problem , T. P. Luckett said , looking at him in a friendly manner , was to determine something like that with the egg in the shell . Then he laughed , but he went on to say that any man who could study like that , his own eggs , that is , might well discover anything . He put his hand on Will Brady 's shoulder , looking him straight in the eye , and forgot himself to the extent of offering him a good cigar . A week or two later , toward morning , a time that Will Brady did most of this thinking , the solution to T. P. Luckett 's problem occurred to him . The way to get grade-A fresh eggs was to lay them , on the spot . Get the chickens , the spot , and let the eggs be laid right there . Day-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be . All T. P. Luckett needed was a man to raise as many chickens as it took to lay the required number of eggs . That might be quite a few . But that 's all he would need . This egg would be white , as the white egg , by and large , looked best in the carton , just as the rich yellow yolk looked best in the pan . And what chicken laid an egg like that ? White Leghorns . Itp62just so happened that a white chicken laid the whitest eggs . T. P. Luckett listened to all of this without a word . A bald-headed man , he took off his straw and wiped the sweat off the top of his head , peered at the handkerchief , then stuffed it back in the pocket of his coat . " All right , Will , " he said , " you 're the man . " " I 'm what man ? " he said . " I 've got five thousand dollars , " T. P. Luckett said , " five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a lot of chickens , that 'll even buy you some nice hens . " Will Brady did n't have an answer to that . " Tell you what I 'll do , " T. P. Luckett said , " I 'll throw in ten acres I 've got near Murdock . Murdock is a lot better chicken country anyhow . " Will Brady had an answer to that . He said : " Mr. Luckett , I 've got a wife and kids to think of . My wife has a home , several pieces of property right here . " " You think it over , " T. P. Luckett said , and wiped his head again , put on his hat . " You think it over  --  right now you could sell all this stuff for what you got in it . Twenty years from now you wo n't be able to give it away . " " In a way , " Will Brady said , " I like it here . " " Tell you what you do , " T. P. Luckett said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggy and some fine day you drive her over to Murdock , show her around . Leave it up to her if she would n't rather live in the east .  --  " I 'll see what she says , " Will Brady said . " I 'm not thinking of eggs . I 'm thinking , " T. P. Luckett said , " of a man of your caliber sitting around in the lobby of a jerkwater hotel . " " I 'll think it over , Mr. Luckett , " he said , and T. P. Luckett took off his hat , wiped his head with the sleeve of his shirt , put his hat on , and went out . As a man could marry only one woman , Will Brady had once brooded over such matters as the several thousand women he would have to do without . As no one woman had everything , in the widest sense of the term , neither did any egg have everything . But he came to the conclusion , after months of consideration , that the Leghorn egg had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how T. P. Luckett referred to those people who were something . What we 've got to keep in mind , he always said , is how the carriage trade will like it . A very neat way of putting things , once you thought about it . Will Brady had seen a good many of such people through the wide windows of the diners , and on occasion he had spoken to some of them . Offering a match , or the time of day , as the case might be . It was very easy to tell such men from those whop64dipped their napkins in their water glasses , then used the napkin to clean their celluloid collars , their false cuffs . With a little experience a man could tell the real carriage trade from that sort of people , as easily as the real carriage trade could tell a good egg . Nine out of ten times it would be a Leghorn . Well , that was the egg , but what about the chicken laying it ? Did it take two , maybe three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a while , die over the winter , or get the croup ? To determine these and like matters , he bought three dozen Leghornhens , kept them in sheds behind the barn , and bought a ledger to keep their record in . This ledger he kept in the basement , and every evening he entered the number of eggs , the amount of grain eaten , and the proportion of large eggs to the case . He compared this with the figures at the local creamery . Every morning he cracked two eggs , peered at the yolks , then fried them , slowly , in butter , or he boiled them and served them in an official dining-car cup . He had never been of much use with his hands , he hurt himself with hammers , cut himself with knives , but it seemed that he could handle an egg with the best of them . He could take five in each hand , right out of the case , and hold them gently , not a shell cracking , or he could take two eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were people who would like to have seenp65that , his wife perhaps , and certainly T. P. Luckett , but he did it alone , just as a matter of course , every morning . He studied eggs , just as a matter of course , every night . As all of his own eggs were fresh and did n't need to be candled , he had a case of coldstorageeggs sent out from Omaha . He mixed them up with his own eggs , then sorted them out . It took him several weeks , but he learned  --  without anyone around to tell him  --  how a fresh egg looked , and about how old a storage egg was . In April he took a Sunday off to drive his wife over to Murdock , a town of several thousand peopleand some big shady trees . Just east of town was a two-way drive with a strip of grass right down the middle , lamps on concrete posts , and a sign welcomingvisitors to town . There was nothing to compare with it in Calloway . T. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town . A nice flat piece of ground , it lay between the new road and the curve of the railroad , and there was plenty room for several thousand laying hens , maybe more . Along the north side of the land was a fine windbreakof young cottonwood trees . They had their dinner in town , at a Japanese restaurant where there were paintings on the walls , and violin music played throughout the meal . They sat in a booth , with a dim light on the table , andp66though his wife had once been in St. Louis , and seen many fine things , it was clear she had seen nothing like this . At the front of the restaurant was a glass case , with a slot at one side for a coin , and on dropping a coin the violin in the case would begin to play . One hand held the bow , the other plucked the strings . As she was very fond of music he walked forward twice and played it for her . At the end of this meal he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much in detail , what T. P. Luckett had told him , and how Calloway , insideof twenty years , would be a dead town . A man of his caliber , he said , quoting T. P. Luckett , had no business wasting his life in a jerkwater hotel . He had meant to say small , not jerkwater , but when he got there the word came out , and he saw that it made quite an impression on her . She had never seen the hotel , or the town , in quite that light before . Perhaps she had n't thought of him , her husband , as a man of caliber . It made a lasting impression on her , and while they sat there a Mr. Tyler , the man who owned the restaurant , presented her , absolutelyfree , with a souvenir . This was a booklet describingthe town of Murdock . There were thirtytwopages , every page with a picture , and at the back of the booklet was a table showing how all the real-estate values were shooting up . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE WORLDand while she glanced through it he walked back to play the magic violin again . IN THE town of Murdock Will Brady bought a house with a room at the front , which he used to sleep in , and a room at the back where he ate his meals . Once a week , however , he would take his family to the Japanese restaurant , sit them in a booth , and give the boys coins to play for their mother the magic violin . His wife , Ethel , liked to sit where she could see the wax hand move the real bow . Will Brady took the seat facing the window where the yokels that stood along the curb would walk back and press their noses to the glass and peer in at them . He had never really thought much about these people , the kids off the farms and the old men still on them , until he sat there in the booth and saw their corn-fed faces grinning at him . Thenp68he knew that they were yokels , corn-fed hicks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the war coming on , things were looking up . Sometimes a farmer with six or seven kids would bring them into town , herd them into the restaurant , but leave his wife in the buggy until she had finished nursing the littleone . Will Brady could see that buggy through the window , and it would be new , the spokes would be red , and there might be a new creaking set of harness on the old horse . The horse would toss his head to get the feed at the bottom of his new feed bag . And the woman in the buggy might have a new hat , a Sears Roebuck print dress , or the high button shoes that he could see when she lifted her skirts from the buggy wheel . And at the edge of town , where there had once been weeds , or maybe nothing at all to speak of , there was now a field of grain or a new crop of beans . Every acre that would grow weeds had been plowed up . And it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Brady himself just read somewherethat the rich Missouri Valley was going to be the bread basket of the world ? The world had to eat something , so it might as well be eggs . Fresh , day-old eggs if possible . Somewhere else he had read , or heard a man say , that there were more than four hundred million Chinamen who had never hadp69a really square meal in their lives . Well , an up-andcomingman like Will Brady would give it to them . All that had to be done was to stop them eating rice , start them eating eggs . In the old country this Kaiser fellow had done a lot of damage and killed a lot of people , but in the new country he seemed to be doing a lot of good . Will Brady could see it on the faces of the men who came into town . This war boom was about the finest thing that had happened to them . Some of the women might feel a little different , but it was hard to complain about a new buggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would separate the milk from the cream . And now and then a tired farm woman liked to eat out . She liked to see her new baby in the red high chairs that came along with the meal , like the cups and plates , and sit there at the table with her own two hands free to eat . Nothing in her lap but the folded napkin and the bones for the dog . Just a year or two before , this same woman came to town in the wagon , with the tailboard down , but now she rode in a tassel-fringed buggy with a spring seat . And having tasted the finer things in life , like Will Brady , she would go on wanting them.  |p70THE  HOUSE Will Brady bought had five other rooms besides those he ate and slept in , but he did n't have much to do with them . The house was usually dark in the morning when he left it , and again in the evening when he got home , and rather than fool around with the lamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp was charred and left an oily smell in the air . Was he all right ? Once a week his wife , Ethel , asked him that . She spoke to him through the bedroomdoor , the lamp shadow at her feet . Yes , he was all right  --  just a little preoccupied . That was it , he was just a little preoccupied . There was a window at the foot of his bed , but he kept the blind drawn because the street light , swinging over the corner , sometimes kept him awake . As the chairs were hard to see in the dark , he kept one of them in the corner , and the other at the side of the bed for his watch and coat . Sometimeshe put his pants there too if he happened to think of it . Otherwise he dropped them on the floor , or folded them over the rail at the foot of the bed , with his collar and tie looped around the brass post . He slept in his socks , but that was not some/thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his feet warm and also saved quite a bit of time . The room was always dark , but if he lay awake he could make out the calendar over the stovepipe hole , the white face of the clock , and the knobs on the dresser from Calloway . But the grain of the bird's-eye maple was lost on him . On the dresser was a bottle of cherry cough syrup , which he took when he had an upset stomach , a comb and a brush , and a very large Leghorn egg . This egg had three yolks , but he could n't decide what to do with it . As it was ten days old , he would soon have to make up his mind . At the foot of the bed , in the creamcoloredwall , he could see the door that he used twice a day , and on hot summer nights he left it open to start a cool draft . The rest of the time he kept it closed , with the key in the lock . It might be going too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he spent his time elsewhere and usually had other things on his mind . But he came back there every night , went away from there every morning , and something like that , if you keep at it , gets to mean something . There were always , for instance , clean shirts in the dresser drawer . There were always socks with the holes mended , and if they had just been washed this woman , his wife , first ran her hand into each one of them.  |p72There  were always collar studs in the cracked saucer beside the clock . When he was sick , or coughed in the night , or was found there in bed the following morning , the woman of the house came to the door of his room and knocked . She would give him hot lemonade and sound advice . The blinds would be raised to let in the sunshine , his coat and pants would be hung on the door , and she would ask him  --  after looking for them  --  for his socks . She always found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . The woman of the house lived at the back , in a large sunny room full of plants and flowers , but the children of the house seemed to live with the neighbors , or under the front porch . They went there to eat candy , drink strawberry pop , and divide up the money they took from his pockets on Sundays , holidays , and any other time he had to change his pants . In the evening Will Brady sometimes stopped to peer under the porch , and wonder about it , as nothing ever seemed to be there but the soft hot dust . The lawnmower and the wooden-runner sled were pushed far to the back . Other evenings Will Brady might stop in the alley and look at the yard , the three white birch trees , and the house that had now been paid for , every cent of it . It looked quite a bit like the neighboringhouses in most respects . It had a porch atp73the front , lightning rods , a peaked roof , panes of colored glass ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinds were always drawn . Homelike ? Well , that was said to be the word for it . And after a certain hour all of the lights in the house would be out . The people in the house would do what they could to go to sleep . By some common agreement , since there was no law saying that they had to , they would turn out the lights , go to bed , and try to sleep . Or they would lie there making out the shape of things on the wall . Why did they do it ? Well , it was simply how things were done . It was one of those habits that turned out to be pretty hard to break . Will Brady often wondered  --  when he did n't sleep  --  what the man in the neighboring house was doing , if he slept well himself , or if he came home and undressed in the dark . This man was a prominentcitizen . He had just installed a new marble fountain in his store . Revolving stools , on white enamel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening his daughter , a large pasty girl , would wipe off the counter and the marble-topped tables , and Mr. Kirby himself would walk around and push the wire-legged chairs back into place . A little stout , in his forties somewhere , Clyde Kirby always spoke to you by name , asked about the missus , and sent you one of his New Year calendars . Hard to say ,  |p74offhand  , whether he undressed in the dark or not . He had raised five sons and was old enough to have learned a thing or two . Will Brady sometimes stood in the alley adjoiningClyde Kirby 's house . The blinds were usually drawn , as they were in his own , but one evening the windows were up and he saw Clyde Kirby , with his sleeves rolled up , standing in the pantry door . He was crumbling hunks of cornbread into a tall drinking glass . He filled this glass to the top with cornbread , then he took a can of milk , punched two holes , and poured the heavy cream over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon , like a soda boy , he slushed it up and down . He seemed to be in a hurry , for some reason , but before he could lift the spoon to his mouth he heard a noise in the house , a door at the front had opened and closed . And like a kid who had got into the jam pot , this Clyde Kirby , a leadingcitizen , took the glass of cornbread he was holding and hid it behind his back . He just stood there , as if he was thinking , while the woman of the house came out of the hallway and carefully drew the blinds clear around the living-room . One by one she drew down all of the blinds on that side of the house . Then she entered the kitchen , walkingpast Mr. Kirby like a propped-up ironing board , and drew the blinds around the kitchen ,  |p75hooked  the screen , then went back the way she had come . All of this without making a gesture , without saying a word . And Clyde Kirby stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door at the front snap closed , then he crossed the dark kitchen and stood at the sink . He poured more canned milk over the cornbread , slushed it up and down with the spoon , then stood there gulping it down as though he was starved to death . If it was the man 's business to eat in the kitchen , it seemed to be the woman 's business to keep the blinds drawn , and to make out of what went on in the house a home . For good or bad , a man seemed to need a woman around the house . And if Will Brady was a father , then this woman he had marriedwas a mother of sorts . Concerning his fatherhood , Will Brady sometimeswalked from the front of the house to the back , tapped on the door , and with a serious face then put in his head . This woman he had married would be sitting there , mending clothes . Will Brady would say what he had to say  --  something about the poisons in penny candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the poisons were there . But the pimples , if that 's what he meant , did n't mean anything . All boys had them . And that was what he wanted to hear . The poisons inp76penny candy were a man 's business , and when he spoke she respected him for it ; but the pimples on the chin were a woman 's business , and he respected her . And it was up to her to make , out of all of this business , something called a home . Well , that was the woman 's business , but what about his own ? If you want to get the feel of the egg business you take an egg in your hand  --  that is , you take thousands of them  --  and from each egg you slowly chip off the hen spots with your thumb . It is n't really necessary to candle the egg or peer around inside . The necessary thing is to get the feel of an egg in your hand . That 's how it is with eggs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard are one thing , but when you take a thousand pullets , say several thousand Leghorn pullets , what you have on your hands is something else . To get the feel of something like that troubled a lot of men . No man would rein in his horse to look at one chicken , but there were sometimes four or five buggies , or a wagonful of kids , drawn off the road just east of the Brady chicken farm . On Sunday afternoons even the women would be there . Five thousand Leghorn pullets was something no man had been able to describe . There was nothing to do but putp77the family in the buggy , let them see it for themselves . They were usually farm people for the most part , people who ought to be sick to death of chickens , but they would get in their buggies and ride for half a day just to look at them . Some of these families brought their lunches and made a picnic out of it . Monday morning the ditch grass would be short where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be scarred where the buggy weights had dragged in the dust . As these people did n't know Will Brady from Adam , he was free to drive his own team right in among them , let his mares graze , and look on with the rest of them . Five thousand Leghorns , five acres of white feathers , if a man could speak in terms like that . And why not ? Somehow he had to describe this thing . Or perhaps a sea of feathers , a lake of whitecaps , when the wind caught them from the back , fanning out their tails and blowing loose feathers along with the dust . Will Brady used the word , though of course he had never seen the sea . Nor had he ever seen a larger body of water than Carter Lake . It was simply that the word came to mind , and Will Brady often spoke of his sea of chickens the way other men would refer to a field of corn . If and when he saw the sea , very likely hep78would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and see five thousand pullets that would soon be hens . There were also some sheds , which seemed to float like so many small boats in the sea of feathers , and there was a bare clearing where he planned to erect a fine city house . But from the buggies men saw just the chickens , the high unpainted cable fence , and the green bank of the railroad like a dam to hold it all in . Different men , of course , saw differentthings , but perhaps the best way to describe it was a remark that T. P. Luckett let drop one day . " How 's your empire , Brady ? " he said , and most people let it go at that . ONCE a month he went to Omaha on business , what you might call a business investment , as he found he worked better if he got away from Murdocknow and then . The life in the city seemed to stimulate him . He always took a room at the WellingtonHotel , where there were fine potted palms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where altogether he felt more or less at home . He would sit between the palms , facing the street , or he wouldp79swing the chair around and face the lobby , the elevatorcage , and the cigar-counter girl . She would usually be rattling the dice in the leather cup , or kidding with the old men . Summer evenings he might walk out on the new bridge and look at the bluffs across the river , or at the swirling brown water , more like mud than water , that he saw below . T. P. Luckett had said that part of the state was washing away . Standing there on the bridge Will Brady could see the truth of that . On his walk back to the hotel he would pick up a jar of hard candy for the boys , and make arrangements for the flowers , the roses , he would take to his wife . " Would the gentleman like to include a card ? " the flower girl always said . " No , " he would say , " no , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the weather was bad he would sit in the lobby facing the girl behind the cigar counter and observingthe way she had learned to handle the men . These men were all older , by and large , being traveling men with a sharp sense of humor , but she had learned to talk right back to them without battingan eye . Most of the men played dice with her for cigars . The dice were held in a leather cup , where they made a hollow rattle like peas in a gourd , and after the rattle she would roll them outp80on a small green pad . The older men liked to do it , it seemed , whether they won or not . The girl would slide back the glass top to the case and the man would reach in , helping himself to a La Paloma or whatever brand he liked . At the side of the counter was a small lamp , in a hood to keep the flame from blowing , and on a chain was a knife with a blade for snipping off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips like a fat hen 's bottom as they moistened the tip . It seemed to give these men a great deal of satisfaction just to rattle the dice , win or lose , and to help themselves to a cigar from the glass case . The hollow sound of the dice could be heard in the lobby , and in his room on the second floor , if the transom was down , Will Brady could hear the game being played . The men usually laughed , a booming manly laugh , if the girl won . Although he neither smoked nor gambled Will Brady seemed to like the sound of the dice , and something or other about the game seemed to interesthim . Perhaps he had a yen to take the leather cup in his hand , shake it himself . To see if he could roll a seven , an eleven , or whatever it was . When the girl won , as she usually did , she would often wink at somebody in the lobby  --  at Will Brady if he happened to be sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at her . It was some/thing she did with all the old men : it did n't mean anything . The day she spoke to him , for example , she was just playing the game with herself , she did n't trouble to wink , she just spoke to him right out of the blue . " Come and have a game on me , " she said . " I do n't play , " he replied , but in a friendly manner . " Come and play for a good cigar , " she said , and rattled the dice . " Three , " she said , " you can surely beat a three . " " Maybe , " he said , " but I do n't smoke . " " You do n't what ? " she said . " I do n't smoke , " he replied . The girl put down the leather cup she was holdingand looked at him . " You 're just kidding , " she said , " what 's your brand ? I 'll bet it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you very much , " he said , " but I do n't smoke . " She looked at him for a while , and he looked back at her . She winked at him , but of course it did n't mean anything . " You do n't play either ? " she said . " No , " he said , " I do n't play . " She rattled the dice in the cup , then said : " You do n't play , you do n't smoke  --  what do you do ? " " I work , " Will Brady replied , as if that explained everything , and maybe it did . He had never put itp82just that way before . " I work , " he repeated , and smiled at the girl , but this time she did n't wink . " If you do n't smoke , why do n't you smoke ? " she said . " I suppose I never started , " he said ; " if you do n't start , maybe you do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I do n't smoke , " he said . " I thought maybe you did n't smoke for your wife , " she said . As he did n't get the point of that right away , Will Brady turned and looked at the lobby . When he got it , he said : " I do n't think my wife cares very much . " " I would , " she said , " I would if I had any choice . " Before he could think of an answer to that another man , about his own age , stepped up to the counter and pushed back the glass top to the case . He helped himself to a cigar , moistened the tip , then went off chewing on it . " You see what I mean ? " the girl said , and made a face . When Will Brady did n't answer , she said : " Just imagine kissing something like that . " Turning to face the lobby Will Brady replied : " Well , I hear that some of them do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , " said the girl , and rattled the dice . He did n't have an answer to that , so she said : "  --  but I guess they do n't havep83much choice . What choice do you have when some men never take a day off ? " " What would a man want to take a day off for ? " he said . " It 's a good thing I do n't take you men seriously , " she replied . As he wanted to be taken seriously , he said : " I 've never had a day off in my life . " " You men ! " she said , and made a clucking sound with her tongue . " A day off  --  " he said , " what for ? " " I like men who wear red ties , " she said . He looked down at his new red tie , then he replied : " Not every man can take a day off , but there 's some men who can if they want to . Men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they like . " " If they do n't smoke , " she said , " I suppose they 've got to do something . " She winked at him , and this time he winked back . " That 's why I wish I was a man , " she said ; " a man can do as he likes , but a woman only has one day a week . " " What day is that ? " he said , and looked her right in the eye . " Friday , " she said , looking right back at him , " I 'm off every Friday at five o'clock . " She rolled the dice out on the pad , and when it turned up ap84four and a three she said : " That means it 's lucky for me . What kind of car does a man like you drive ? " Several years before , listening to T. P. Luckett , something of this sort had come over Will Brady , and he had become , overnight almost , a man of caliber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overland roadster  --  one of the kind that a man like himself might drive . He bought this car in Columbus , where he had to change trains , and the new Willys-Overland dealer had a fine big showroom facing the station and the tracks . In the window was the Overland roadster with the sporty wire wheels . They were red , and about the same color as his tie . As he stood there listening to the powerful motor he let the owner of the shop persuade him that he might as well get into the car and drive it home . On west of Columbus it was wide-open country , there was nothing but horses to worry about , and the only way to learn to drive a car was to get in and drive . Once he got in , and got the car moving , he would find that the Overland drove itself , leavingnothing for the driver to do but sit there and shift the gears . At the railroad crossings he would get a lot of practice in . He got in a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost owing to the fact that he drove along , thirty miles or so , in second gear . The road was so bad that he did n't seem to notice it . Ten miles an hour was pretty good time over most of it . It was just getting dark when he came into Murdock , at the edge of the Chautauqua grounds , where he saw that several boys had built a bonfire near the tracks . One of them , a very spry little fellow , was hoppingaround . Now , boys often behave like that and he might not have thought anything of it if he had n't noticed , in the light from the fire , that he had on no pants . He was hopping up and down , hollering and yelling , without his pants . When Will Brady saw who this spry boy was , and what it was they all seemed to be doing , his hand went forward , in spite of himself , and honked the horn . They jumped up like rabbits , every one of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , and there were maybe ten of them , had on his pants . They ran off like madmen , hooting like Indians , through the scrubby willows along the tracks , and bringing up the rear , his bottom bright in the car lights , was Will Brady 's son . Farther down the tracks they picked up their pants and ran along waving them , like banners , but there was not time , of course , to stop and put them on . Will Brady just sat there till he heard the motor running , and the hooting had passed.  |p86Perha|ps  that was why he went to Omaha again the following week . He had it in mind to walk down lower Douglas , where he knew there were doctors " for men , " and speak to one of these doctorsabout the strange behavior of the boys . He had often seen the signs that were painted on the windowson the second floor . So he walked along this street , he read the signs , but he could n't seem to make up his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady , aged nine , was a man or not . These doctors for men might think that Will Brady was kidding them . He went back and took a seat in the lobby of the Wellington Hotel . It happened to be Saturday , not Friday , but the girl behind the counter had been thinking it over , and she wondered if Sunday would n't be a better time for him . Now that he had a car , and in case he really wanted to take the day off . If there were people in Murdock who had picked up the notion that Will Brady liked other chickens as well as Leghorns , talk like that somehow never got around to him . It could n't , as he seldom talked to anyone . Not that Will Brady was n't friendly  --  everybody remarked how friendly he was  --  but he did n't have the time , or whatever it took , to make friends . Will Brady was what they called a go-getter , a man who not only was up and coming ,  |p87but  in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just north of town , for example , he had a chicken farm with five thousand Leghorns , and on a cold windy day some of the feathers even blew into town . And work had begun on his modernthirteen-room house . As illustrated in Radnor 's Ideal Homes , Will Brady 's house would have a three-story tower , and was listed under " Mansions , " the finest section of the book . Not listed , but to be part of the house , were the diamond-shaped panes of colored glass , imported from Chicago like the marble in Clyde Kirby 's new drugstore . As there were thirty-six windows in this house , including those in the basement and the tower , there would be nothing like it in either Murdock or Calloway . If there was light , it came through a panel of coloredglass . If there was no light , as sometimes could n't be helped , a lantern would be burning in the top of the tower , shining through a green portholelike the semaphore far down the tracks . A man out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . This fellow Brady was a corner , as everybody said , but not many people would have recognized him , or the girl along with him , on certain warm summer nights . Out in the Krug Amusement Park he would sit on a bench , holding her cone of spunp88sugar candy , while she rode the roller coaster and other up-and-down rides that made him sick . Early in the evening she would first go swimming , leavinghim on the beach with her comb and her lipstick , or in the wicker chairs for parents on the balcony behind the diving board . Before diving she would turn and wave to him . Chased by boys , she liked to swim under water , and in his anxiety Will Brady would rise out of the chair and somebody would ask him to please sit down . There were other people who had children to account for , this man would say . Elderly folks , both men and women , often drew up their chairs to speak to Will Brady , ask about his girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed , they would point out youngstersof their own . Most of them were plump , goodlookinggirls , squealing like pigs when the boys edged near them , and Will Brady could see that nearly all parents had the same concern . To be there to wave when the children dived , to tell them when they turned the soft blue color , and to shoo off the boys , like flies , when they sprawled out on the sand . Later would come the Ferris wheel , the Spook House , the balls thrown at something , and if it was hit he would carry the Kewpie doll . He would spend five dollars to win a fifty-cent Ouija board . In the ballroom , with these things in his lap ,  |p89he  would sit on a folding chair in the corner watchingher dance with some young buck who had asked her to . A youngster who thought he was her father , naturally . And they would bring him a hot dog , a bottle of red pop , and stand there before him , trying to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced . " Now , why do n't you kids go and dance , " he would say , and while they did he would eat the hot dog and look at the Ouija board , as the boy would be hugging her . But not too much , as he was her father , and after a while the boy would bring her back , shake Will Brady 's hand , and try to leave a good impression with him . " I 'm very glad to have met you , sir , " these boys would say . But after the swimming , the riding , and the dancing , she would play with him . She would take him for several long rides on the Swanee River , that is . Will Brady found it spooky and unpleasant , the rocking of the boat troubled him , but on the whole he got along without getting sick . And in the dark part of the river , in the mossy wood , where the watersplashed over the mill wheel , she would take his hands in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold them , tight , until they reached the pier where the ride had ended , and everybodyon the pier could see how it was with thep90pair in the boat . That this man with the straw hat was a good deal more than a father to her . He was her lover . A man to be pitied and envied , that is . To make it perfectly clear who Will Brady was , she needed help with her clothes in lobbies and restaurants , and out on the street dust was always blowing into her eyes . She would have to press against him while he saw what the trouble was . In the aisles of big stores she liked to swoon , as the high-class ladies swooned in the movies , and to have him come with her while she shopped for stockings and underclothes . Nobody had taught her how to wear clothes so that she looked covered when she had them on , but she had learned from her mother how to go without them and look all right . Like swimming under water , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the vaudeville circuit , and her father was one of five men , in a ten-minute act , who entered the room and hid underthe bed . Will Brady had once seen her mother , on a poster , on lower Douglas Street . Her daughter looked a good deal like her in most respects . There was little resemblance , certainly , between this girl and sad-eyed Opal Mason , but at night he had the feeling Opal Mason would approve of her . Like Opal Mason , the girl liked to talk . Will Brady often had the feeling that he was there in bed for reasons he had n't really looked into and were not atp91all the reasons that an outsider might think . He never said much himself , as he was too sleepy and felt he was there for fairly obvious reasons , but towardmorning , without her saying anything , he would wake up . Why was that ? It seemed to be because she wanted him to . He could n't really do much for her , somehow , but one thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back , and lie there listening to her . Sometimes he wondered if this might be another form of loving , one that women needed , just as men seemed to need the more obvious kind . But he did n't really know , and the talking never cleared it up . As a matter of fact , the more she talked , the less he understood . Sometimes this girl would begin with the morning and describe everything that had happened ; she would describe , that is , every man who had troubledto follow her . She remembered and described these men so well that Will Brady , who saw very little , would recognize these men as the familiar fops he passed in the street . Every one of them useless , whore-chasing men , with a gold-toothed smile , light-tan button shoes , and a pin in his tie he could buy for fifteen cents . And they were all , she insisted , very fine gentlemen . When he scoffed at this she wanted to know what he would know about men like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she would go on  --  shep92always went on  --  to tell him that a lady knew a gentleman by the oil in his hair and the fancy silk socks that he wore . And the way that he would stand , in the better-class lobbies , shooting his cuffs . Well , there were things that he might have said , but he would have to lie there , his mouth tight shut , as right there on the floor , at the side of the bed , were his own dirty socks . Or worse yet , they might still be on his feet , right there in the bed . What could he say  --  a man like that  --  about fine gentlemen ? Nor could he even ask her where she had picked up such notions . He knew , for one thing  --  he knew she had smelled this hair at close quarters , snapped the cuff links herself , and praised the gentlemen 's taste in socks . He knew , and it was the last thing in the world he cared to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and he liked the word dandy , what in the world did she see in a man like him ? " Your hair , " she had replied . Just like that . That had made him so mad he said what he had on his mind . " And how are these dandies to sleep with ? " he said . " Oh , " she said , " like anybody . " But as he lay back she added : " But what 's that to do with what I like ? "  |p93As  he drove into Omaha every Friday and home again on Sunday evening , he may have picked up the notion that it might go on indefinitely . Now and then he did wonder about the girl , and the five days a week he was n't there to watch her , but he neither wondered nor worried about his wife . She lived in the sunny room at the back of the house , and when she heard him come in , on Sunday evening , she would call out : " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Yes , Ethel , " and hook the screen , turn out the light . Then he would walk through the dark house to his room at the front . The night she did n't call out , his first thought was that she might be asleep . He did n't worry about it until he got into bed , when the quiet of the house , something or other about it , and the creaking street light seemed to keep him awake . The night , he thought , seemed quieter than usual . That might have been because of the noise of the city , where a street car passed right below the window , but it kept him awake like the lull that followsa wind . He sat up in bed at one point and looked out . He could see the gnats and hear the big fat June bugs strike the street light . Turning from the window he noticed the door that led from his room into the boy 's , and on the chair in front of the door were his pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would open the door and take some of the small change from his pants . Was that stealing ? Neither of them had mentioned it . It occurred to Will Brady that it had been some time since the boy had come in to swipe a little money , or since his father had opened the door to question the boy . Not since the week the boy had taken to drinking vinegar . He would take the big vinegar jug to his room , hiding it beneath the bed or inside of his pillow , and when the lights were out he would pull out the cork and take a swig . Later he would be sick and vomit over his Teddy bears . It had been a very strange thing to do  --  like the hooting and howling with his pants off  --  but Dr. Finley had said some boys would surprise you . And they certainly would . At that time Will Brady had suggested that the door between their rooms might be left open , but the boy said his father 's snoring kept him awake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there was no more vinegar trouble and for a while everything seemed all right , until Will Brady came home one night and found the entire house lit up . The boy was propped up in bed with his bears , but his hair was shaved off . He had dipped his head , with all of his lovely curls , in a barrel of hot tar . Several men had been repairing the roof of the church , and while they were up there working onp95it , the boy had sneaked over and dipped his head in their barrel of tar . God knows how he had ever thought of something like that . A crazy thing to do , but he had done it , and the long silken curls that hung below his shoulders were thrown away with the stiff chunks of tar . The top of his small , narrow head had to be shaved . He looked like a bird that had just been hatched , and it upset Ethel , who was not his real mother , a good deal more than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days herself . It might be that Ethel , who already had a boy , had wanted a small pretty girl for a change , as she let his hair grow and liked to dress him in rompers and Fauntleroys . But the tar had put an end to that . With his small head shaved Willy Brady was neither a boy nor a girl . In the evening his father would sometimes open the door and look into the room , where the lamp sat on the table , and the boy would be sitting there in bed with his three brown bears . One of them , the papa bear , almost as big as he was . And always reading , as they had just learned to read . As Will Brady did n't want to disturbthem  --  the three bears had staring glass eyes  --  he would close the door without saying anything . Standing there in the dark , he would hear the boy whisper to one of them . Although he had never done it before , he got out of bed , lit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He first thought the figure propped up in bed was the boy , with his eyes wide open , but it turned out to be the papa bear . The boy was not there in the bed at all . But pinned to the bear 's woolly chest was a piece of note paper , torn from a pad , that seemed to be blank until he came forward with the lamp . It was not signed , nor did it say to whom it was addressed , but Will Brady recognized the writing well enough . His wife , Ethel , wrote a fine Spencerian hand . Willy is with Mrs. Riddlemosherit said , and that was all . That was all he ever heard from Ethel Czerny Bassett , his wife . WITH a small pail of sand containing horsetail hairs that would turn to garter snakes when it rained on them , Will Brady and his son moved from the town of Murdock to the city of Omaha . They took a room on the mezzanine floor of the Wellington Hotel . The pail of sand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub with the potted palm , so that Willy Brady , in case it rained , couldp97run outside with it . Sometimes he did , other times he just let it rain . In the morning the boy would be there in the lobby , sitting near one of the brass spittoons , where he was told he could whittle or spit the black licorice juice . Most of the time he just sat there , with his legs straight out . The women who worked in the hotel restaurant would stop and speak to him . After lunch , with his friend Mr. Wherry , he would play four or five games of checkers , or a game of parcheesi with the cigar-counter girl . It might be that Mr. Wherry , who was fond of children , thought the girl behind the counter was the boy 's sister , as he seemed to think they were both Will Brady 's kids . He bought them bags of candy and took them down the street to the matinee . He was a fine old man , but a little hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , was better left alone , as it might prove hard to explain . If the boy was n't there in the lobby he might be on the mezzanine , in the phone booth , having long conversations with the telephone girl . He would leave word with her to have his father call him when he came in . " This is Willy Brady Jr. , " the voice would say , with the confident tone of a Singer 's midget , and somehow his father , Will Brady , was never pre/pared for it . He would stand there , and the boy would say : " Who is this speaking ? " " This is your father , son , " Will Brady would say , in the sober voice of a father , but he never had the feeling that the boy was impressed . He did n't believe it any more than Willy Brady did himself . Once a week , as a father should , he would borrow the boy from Mr. Wherry and take him to the places a boy would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie Polo , whom they left in some pit , every week , as good as dead , only to come back the next week and find him big as life . The boy was also crazy about Charlie Chaplin , but he had seen everything a good many times , and made a nuisance of himself as he always got the hiccups when he laughed . He would have to be led back to the lobby , many times , for a drink . As Will Brady did n't care for Eddie Polo himself , any more than he did for the roller coaster , he would pass the time eating the popcorn or peanuts he bought for the boy . As he could n't get his hand in the smallsizebag , he had to buy the large-size ones , and near the middle of the movie he usually wanted a drink himself . They would both have a phosphate , usuallycherry , at the drugstore when they got out . Summer evenings , if it was still light after they had got out of the movie , he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Willp99Brady 's place of business faced the west , and if it was n't too late in the evening some light from the sky might be on the new sign he had at the front . This sign cost him three hundred dollars , and featuredtwo roosters , drawn by hand , crowing over a large Leghorn egg . Through a misunderstanding both of the birds were Plymouth Rocks , as well as roosters  --  a point that troubled Will Brady , but the boy never noticed it . He did n't seem to care what color the eggs , or the chickens , were . On the wide glass window , lettered in gold , were the words : WILL BRADYEGGSbut the boy never seemed to realize that name was his own . That one day it would read WILL BRADY &; SON . Any number of times , as they came around the corner , Will Brady meant to bring it up , but when they got there and stood facing the building , nothing was said . There seemed to be no connection . Perhaps that was it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window of their future  --  but it seemed to be Will Brady 's , not the boy 's . He never walked up and pressed his nose to the window , as most boys would do , and he did n't seem to care what went on behind the glass . If Will Brady said : " Now just a minute , son , " and felt around in hisp100pocket for the keys , the boy would stand out on the curbing while he went in . Sometimes he made quite a racket to attract attention , or stood in the candling-room , holding some eggs , but the boy never came back to see what was delaying him . No , the only person that seemed to care , or wonder what it was he was doing , was the old man who sometimes slept in the back of the shop . A drifter , a wreck of a man with a dark bearded face , and one hand missing , he would sometimes get up from where he was lying and come peer at him . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . There he would be , a strange smile on his face , and perhaps a nail in one corner of his mouth , looking in on Will Brady as if he had called for him . Wagging his head , this old man would say : " Mr. Brady , how 's that boy of yours ? " And it had turned out the old man had a boy of his own . Older , of course . Gone off somewhere , that is . A boy who had a mother who had also gone off somewhere . This old man probably did n't understandsome of the words Will Brady fell to using , but he had been a father , and seemed to know the way of boys . He would wag his head as if it was all familiar to him . His own name he never mentioned , but a boy named Gregor , and a girl named Pearl , were very much like their mother , a woman named Belle . At the thought of her hep101would reach for the nail keg , put more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stub of his arm in his pocket , but speaking of war , which he knew at first hand , he would draw it out , like a sword , and point with it . The missing hand seemed to be something , like a glove , that he had left in his coat . He kept a small tin of water on top of the stove , to which he added , when he thought of it , coffee , drinking his own from the can but serving Will Brady in a green tin cup . When he stood near the stove the smell of wet gunny sacks steamed out from his clothes . By himself , he spit into the fire , cocking his head like a robin to hear the juice sizzle , but with Will Brady he would walk to the door , spit into the street . The blue knob of his wrist would wipe the brown stain from his lips . Coming back to the stove , he would take off his hat , look carefully into the crown , then use the stub of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One evening in March , nearly the middle of March , Will Brady stopped the old man at the door to tell him that he could have the next day off . A holiday ? Well yes , in a way it was . He , Will Brady , was taking himself another wife . Taking her , he added , before some other lucky fellow did . The old man seemed to think that was pretty sharp , pressing on his mouth to keep his chew in , and Willp102Brady pressed a crisp new ten-dollar bill into his one hand . " Have yourself a good time , " he said , but perhaps a man who had never had one , never bought one , anyhow , was n't the man to bring the matter up . The old man stood there with the money , looking at it . Somehow it made Will Brady think of the boy , as when he did n't know what else to do he would give the boy money and say : " Go buy yourself something . " The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but when he looked back he saw that the old man was still in the doorway , but his good arm was stretched across his front to his left side . He was trying to put the money in the pocket where he could n't take it out . To get it out of that pocket , as he had once said , he had to take his coat off his back , which was not an easy thing for a one-armed man to do . Money put there was usually still there when he needed it . Will Brady thought of that , oddly enough , when he reached across his front for the girl 's small hand , and it may have been why he had a little trouble with the ring . They were married on the second floor of the City Hall . They stood in the anteroom of the Judge 's office , facing the Judge himself and the green water-cooler , and the four or five people who were waiting to speak to him . A man who is married for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy , and think of the first time that such a thing had happened to him . It seemed , it all seemed , a good while ago . Thinking of that he turned from the window , where a rattytailedpigeon was strutting , and looked at the boy  --  a Western Union boy  --  who stood in the door . On his way somewhere , the boy had stopped to look in . Perhaps he had never seen a man married before . When he saw Will Brady , and Will Brady saw him , the boy took off his uniform cap , held it at his side , and ran his dirty fingers through his mussy hair . His eyes were wide , his lips were parted , and though there were other people in the room , what you call witnesses , it was only the boy who saw something . It was the boy that reminded Will Brady of what was happening to him . That taking a wife , as he had put it , was a serious affair . He wanted to go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him some money , but all he did , of course , was stand there shaking hands with the Judge . The Judge turned from him to the water-cooler , tipping it forward as it was nearly empty , and had several long drinks from a soiled paper cup . Michael Long , his wife 's father , crossed the room to shake Will Brady 's hand and give him a wink , showing the gold caps on his teeth . Mr. Long was a dark-haired , rosy-cheeked man who had once been quite an actor , one of the five men ,  |p104wearing  spats , who tried to hide under a bed on the stage . A little old for that now , he had given it up , and come by bus from Kansas City to see the little girl finally hitched  --  as he said . Mrs. Long herself , a well-preserved woman , was still in considerabledemand as the actress who lay in the bed with the men beneath it . This was why she had not been able to come . She was under contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Brady this as they stood in the lobby , but he left the impression with Will Brady that something else , of far greater importance , was on his mind . In the men 's room , where they went to think it over , he explained himself . He wanted Will Brady to know , he said  --  holding his wig flat while he combed it  --  that he was makingno mistake , no sireee , with this little girl . She was just like her mother , he said , who was as good now as she ever was , and by that he meant something better than thirty-five years . Every bit as good , Michael Long said , and put out his hands on something he saw before him , which might have been a stove , a radiator , or a woman 's hips . Mr. Long had told him that before the ceremony , in case he thought he might change his mind , but his hand was still sticky and smelled of hair oil when he shook Will Brady 's hand . Will Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hisp105pants . He kissed an Aunt Lucille , who offered a cheek like a piece of saddle leather ; then he led his wife down the wrought-iron stairway to the street . They had left the boy with Mr. Wherry , as he was a great stickler for details , knew all about weddings , and might object to one in the City Hall . As they entered the hotel and the smoke-filled lobby , the girl led him forward to meet the boy as if they had been lovers , her lovers , and now had to patch up their quarrel . As xis bride had never been west before , and as Will Brady wanted her to get the feel of the country , they left Omaha early in the morning on a fine spring day . Just west of Fremont he took the flappingside curtains off the car . In the West , as he told her  --  that is , he told them , as the boy had got to be quite a city kid  --  there were no wooded hills as there were along the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rivers were apt to be wide , shallow affairs , as most of the water was somewhere underground . It was what men called open country , where you could see a good ways . When the sun was right  --  that is to say , behind you  --  a man could see from town to town , and his bride , Gertrude Long , seemed to think that this was wonderful . She was so tired of being cooped up in the dirty city , she said . But when the sun was wrong  --  as it was when you were driving west , along toward evening  --  everything that you saw , if you cared to look at it , looked quite a bit alike . Pretty much like the same town , usually , with the same grain elevator along the tracks , and the same gas pump out in front of the same hay and feed store . Through the vibrating windshield , as the roads were pretty bad , the wide empty plain seemed to shimmer , and the telephone poles that slowly crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a locomotive headlight in their eyes . To get away from this sun the girl dozed off with her head bumping on Will Brady 's shoulder , her mouth open , and her tongue black with the licorice she liked to eat . The boy sprawled with his feet on the seat , his head in her lap . A wad of Black Jack chewing gum was being saved on the bridge of his nose . Will Brady drove mechanically , his fingers thick like those of the boy when he roller-skated , his hands gripping the wheel , his tired eyes fixed on the road . Once he stopped the car , as he had come to feel that one more mile would rattle him to pieces , but as he sat there , brooding , neither the boy norp107the girl woke up . A cow tethered in the field near by turned to gaze at him . Her dung-heavy tail made a flapping sound like that of a loose board , wind-rattled , when it thumped , like a bell clapper , on her hollow frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he drove on . A little after sundown he drove into Murdock , an abandoned town on a Sunday evening , with no sign of life anywhere but the revolving barber pole . He drove on through the town , past the piles of cases that were stamped WILL BRADY-EGGS -- MURDOCK , and that had been stacked under the shelter , ready for loading , on the station platform . He drove down the road that led , as they said , to the Brady Egg Empire . He had planned it that way , to arrive about sunset , so that the last rays of the sun , no longer touching the plains , might be seen on the tower of the new house . But from the bridge over the creek , which was just a mile or so from the farm , he saw the tower to the house and it struck him as higher than he thought it would be . And the house itself , the bulk of it , struck him as even larger than he had remembered , and a good deal stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing , but hard to say what it was . It was both larger than he had thought , the tower was higher than he had thought , and somehowor other he had expected a few trees . Perhapsp108he thought the trees came with the house . There had been a small grove around the house he had seen in the catalogue . Still it was his own place , all right , as there in the fields were thousands of chickens , and on the new shingled roof were the lightning rods with the polishedblue balls . He had asked for them , picked that color out himself . It was their place , but he drove on by , neither slowing down nor honking the horn nor doing anything that he figured might wake his family up . What if they should ask him who in the world lived in a place like that ? What if they should want to know , as they would , who in the world had been such a fool as to build , out here in the country , a fine city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine big trees with a hammock or two swingingbetween them , and a birthday party going on clear around the run-around porch . What good was such a house without the city along with it ? That 's what they would ask him , laughing and hooting when they saw that he had no answer , so he drove on by , neither speaking to them nor shiftingthe gears . He followed one of the quiet , grasscoveredroads back into town . When he drew up at the Cornland Hotel he just sat there for a while , with the motor running , reading the sign that asked guests with horses to leave them in the rear . Thenp109he shut off the motor , and the sudden quiet woke them up . He left them there in the car , the girl rubbing her eyes , while he stepped up to the counter of the hotel , where a Mr. Riddlemosher , once a neighbor , shook his hand . He asked about the boy as he handed Will Brady the counter pen . He watched Will Brady sign his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , over his glasses , just what it said . Will Brady , wife &; son . That was what it said . " Well , " Mr. Riddlemosher said , " well , well  --  " then he looked up from the ledger to see the boy , his hands full of tinfoil , run into the lobby of the hotel . It was Mr. Riddlemosher who used to buy it from him at ten cents a pound . TEN or twelve hours a day  --  when he was n't eating , arguing with his family , or sleeping  --  Will Brady uncrated the furniture and drove it out to the farm . He had a freight car on the siding , full of it . While he did this he hired a man from Chapman , a farmer with two husky boys , to dig up some small shade trees and plant them in the yard . Hep110wanted something to be there in the yard when he drove them out . Something besides chickens , that is , as even the full-grown Leghorn hens looked like so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fine big birds , but they looked awfully small . Everything did . Now and then he would wake up at night with the notion that his strange house , like a caboose left on a siding , had somehow drifted away during the night . That he would drive out of town in the morning and find it gone . It was a wonderfully hopeful feeling  --  without it he might not have got up in the morning  --  but it made it that much worse when he saw that it was still there . Bigger than life . That was the hell of it . With still half a car of furniture to unload , he had enough sofas for four or five houses , as they would not fit inside of the rooms he had bought them for . The doors opened wrong , or a window proved to be in the way . Some of the beds would n't fit in the rooms and he asked Mr. Sykes , his hired hand , if his wife might not care for one of them . What Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sykes barn . It was Mrs. Sykes , of course , who asked him , when he came to the door of the kitchen , when he was going to get around to the kitchen stove . An honest man , Will Brady simply said he had n't thought of it.  |p111It  seemed hard to believe , a little weird in fact , that a man like Will Brady , born and raised in a soddy , had spent three thousand dollars without buying himself a kitchen stove . Had he come up too fast ? Mrs. Sykes implied as much . She stood there looking at him , then said : " Well , it 's up to the woman to think of the stove , " and maybe it was . But not every woman . Not one like his wife . He tried to explain , as they drove into town , that the reason his wife had n't thought of the stove was that city-born girls , of a certain type , never cooked anything . They ate in restaurants . The food they ate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was going to bring her food to her in the country ? Well , that was one more thing he had n't got around to thinking about . There had been too many things . There had also been restaurants where they could eat . But he thought of that , among other things , as he watched Mrs. Sykes build a fire in the stove , breaking the stiff pine kindling between her strong hands and over her knee . Tough pieces she leaned on the leg of the stove , then stepped on them . She set the drafts on the pipes , then dipped a corncob into a pail of kerosene , lit it with a match , and used it like a torch to start the fire . As it roared up the chimney she said : " Well , I guess it draws all right . "  |p112Mrs  . Sykes was an angular woman , a little blunt in her ways , and Will Brady felt right at home with her , as his own family treated him the same way . As a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . Not only in the woman 's place , in the kitchen , but if Mrs. Sykes saw him out in the yard she would call to him , put a pail or a shovel into his hand . On a farm , she told him , something alwaysneeded to be done . Would she happen to know a woman , he said , who would like a nice home in the country ? A woman like herself , who would like to do the cooking , look after the house . Mrs. Sykes wiped her hands and stiffened her back at the same time . She held her right hand to her face and picked at a splinter in the palm . Did he know what it was like , she said , to keep a thirteen-room house ? Suppose they just closed off some of the upstairs rooms , he said . Would a woman like herself mind keeping a five- or six-room house ? Did he think , she replied , a woman would call that keeping house ? That was what she said , leavinghim there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smell of the paint rising from the new stove . Then she was back  --  her head in the door but her face turned away from him . She said that she did know a woman , and if she happened top113see her she might bring it up . But she would n't recommend it to any woman  --  not something like that . Then the door slammed behind her in a way that made it clear what she thought . Four or five days later , a Saturday morning , Will Brady thought he saw Mrs. Sykes in the kitchen , but the woman who turned to face him had white hair . She was panning water from the bin on the range , the handle of the pan wrapped in her apron , and he had the feeling that she might be a little deaf . She did n't seem to be surprised to see him standing there . A tall heavy-bodied woman , with a dark skin , she did n't look any too well around the eyes , but to see her working , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're from Mrs. Sykes ? " he said to her , raisinghis voice as she did n't seem to hear him . She stooped for some cobs , then settled the kettle over the plate hole . " Mrs. Sykes said you could use a woman , " she said . " My wife is a city-bred girl , " he said , which was true enough , but strange to hear him say it . " And city girls , " he went on , " are n't really used to countryways . " That was strange kind of talk for him , but the woman seemed to follow it . It did n't seem to strikep114her , as it did Mrs. Sykes , that a city-bred girl was out of place in the country . " To tell you the simple truth , " he said , as he felt an urge to speak on this topic , " I suppose what I 've tried to do is to bring the city out here . " He gesturedwith his arm at the house , then added , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor did this woman seem to see anything strange in that . " My name is Will Brady , " he said , " and I 'm very glad you 've come to help us out . If the house is too big  --  " he waved his hand at the house , " we can shut some of it off . " " I 'm getting on now , " this woman said , " but I can still keep a house . " She did n't seem to feel it necessary to say any more than that . He stood there , and after a moment he realized that the sound that he heard , like a pole humming , was one that she made in her throat . A familiar hymn . She was humming it . " If there 's anything I can do , " he said , " I want you to feel free to call on me . " Then he coughed , took a drink of water , and hurried out . Where had he picked up such a fancy way of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If you want anything , let me know , " but she seemed to be busy again and had her back to him . He crossed the yard to Mr. Sykes , who was mixing up a barrel of layingp115mash , but he stopped when Will Brady walked up to him . " You happen to know this old lady 's name ? " he asked . " Mason , " Mr. Sykes said . " Anna Mason  --  she 's a good sort . " " She strikes me as a pretty fine woman , " Will Brady said . " She 's a good sort , " Sykes said again . But there was something about the woman that Will Brady felt needed some comment . " I 'd say she was a woman a man could depend on , " he said . " Kept house for her brother , " Sykes said , " going on about forty years . He died last year . Guess she misses him . " " She never married ? " Will Brady asked . " No , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and said : " She had her brother , one of her own people , to think of . " In April it was spring out in the yard , where the fat hens made nests in the dust heaps , but the winterstill seemed to be trapped in the house . Mrs. Sykes had finally told him about the stove , but nobody had told him about the furnace , which was supposed to have been in the basement of the house . Now that the house was up , there was no longerp116any way of getting it there . The basement was a big whitewashed room , clean-smelling from the earth , and sometimes even sunny , so he put his desk in the basement and lived down there himself . It was handy to the yard , and getting in and out he did n't trouble anyone . The boy and girl  --  that was what he called them  --  lived , with an oil stove , in the master bedroom on the second floor , where they had their meals unless he drove them into town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machinehe had ordered from Omaha , and when the windows were up he could often hear the music himself . The kind of music that they liked sounded very strange in the chicken yard . Although there was always work to do , and not enough help on the place to do it , he sometimes found himself at the narrow basement windows , peering out . The window on the yard was about chest-high , with a deep sill that he could lean on , and he found that he could see out without Mrs. Sykes being able to see in . Twice a day the local train came down from the north , and even before the bell was ringing , Will Brady would be there at the window , peering out . He liked to watch the smoke pouring from the wide funnel stack . As she came around the curve , the bell wagging , the firemanwould climb out of the cab and crawl backp117over the coal car to the water bin . She took water in Murdock , and he had to be there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while all of this happened , seeing very little from where he stood , but knowing , as an old railroad man , what was taking place . He could hear , on certain days , the water pouring through the chute . He might be able to see a passenger or two get on or off . And all this time the bell would be ringing as there were no guard gates on the Burlington crossing , nothing but kids who would be standing on the cowcatcher , waiting for the brakeman to run up front and shoo them off . Will Brady would stand there , maybe five or ten minutes , until the caboose finally disappeared , and he could hear the whistle , thin and wild , as if the train was calling for help . Was something wrong with him ? Or was it just spring fever , or something like that . A tendency to let the team idle on the bridge , so that he could see , through the cracks , the clear water , or to let them graze in the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins now and then to keep the flies off their spanky rumps . After several years of working day and night , perhaps Will Brady had begun to stop working , to stand as if thinking , as if great thoughts were troublinghis mind . Mr. Sykes often had to repeat everything he said . It was not the proper state ofp118mind for a man who had around five thousand layinghens to think of , and who had often been asked what he intended to do when one hen took sick . Well , he did n't know . No , he did n't even know that . Standing at the basement window he sometimesmarveled at this strange fellow , Will Jennings Brady , known all over the state as an up and comingman of caliber . A man who lived in the basementof his fine new thirteen-room house . On a Sunday morning , on his way into town , he found this woman Anna Mason walking down the road , her skirts pinned up , and her long underwear tucked into her high laced shoes . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way to church . A woman nearly seventy years of age , heavy on her feet and not any too well , on her way to a church that was a good three-mile walk . " Now look here , " he said , but she would n't listen to him . Nor would she get into the car and ride in with him . She would go to church , she let him know , just so long as she could get there ; when she could n't get there any more , why , then she would n't go . She would be dead then , she said , and looked at him . All right , he replied , but he would be there to bring her home . If he just happened to be there in the church ,  |p119she  said , if he happened to be there , and she happened to see him , why , then she supposed he might as well bring her home . He wondered if that was how it happened that most men went to church . There would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a ride home . A woman with white or gray hair , her long underwear tucked into her shoe tops , and spectacles that had got to be the color of flecked isinglass . She would be there in the pew , her hands in her lap , or pushing up to share with somebody her hymnbook , then singing , or humming , in a voice that made little boys wet their pants . He had done just that , anyway , many times . His mother had had such a voice , throbbing like an organ on the chorus , and this throb passed down through her arm into his hand , the one she was holding , and made the small hairs rise on his neck , and his knees rub . And when the hymn was over he usually found that his pants were wet . Now he came late and took a seat near the door , where he had sat that Sunday that the boy had won a Bible , with his name stamped on it , and brought it up the aisle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Bible now ? He had driven them all  --  it was Ethel then  --  out to Nolan 's Lake for the barbecue , the motorboat ride , and the hymn-singing after dark . The choir in their long white robes onp120the platform , the hissing red flares very good on the women , and in the dark like that , out in the open , he could sing himself . It was said that he had a fine baritone voice . Well , that night he had sung many hymns , the fires had made it seem like a gypsy encampment , and the boy , who had eaten too much , fell asleep in his lap . The new Bible , with the cover sticky , had dropped from his hand . Will Brady had picked it up and said : " Ethel , maybe you better take that Bible , " and she had said yes , and that was the last he saw of it . Moving around , as they did , it was hard to keep track of things . From where he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stack of collection plates beside him , he thought he could pick out Anna Mason 's voice . Anna Mason would have his mother 's voice , and with it his mother 's kind of religion , and a man with his voice , and his kind of religion , was not in her class . He did n't belong , if the truth were known , in the same church . But he was there now , he was sure , for a good Christian reason , and he had something like a religious feeling about the choir . They wore black gowns and sat under the golden organ pipes . They rose as one , the women at the front and the men , who were taller , lined up in back , and the sound of their robes was like the clearing of one great throat . They sang , and he closed his eyes and waited for the moment whenp121they would stop and there would be nothing , nothing  --  tillthe first hymnbook closed . That moment always struck him as something like a prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Memorial Day , and in that sense of the word he considered himself a religiousman . Then he would stand by the aisle , his hat in his hand , until Anna Mason came up and walked by him , and he would not step to her side until she reached the street . She was not a woman to stand out in front and talk with someone . But she did think it was pleasant to take a short buggy ride . Not in the car , which made her nervous  --  as she liked the horses out in front , where she could see them , not bottled up , like some sort of genie , under the hood . She liked it off the paving , along the streets where the buggy wheels ran quiet in the dust , and the reins made a soft , lapping sound on the rumps of the mares . As it just happened to be on their way , they usually passed the house where the blinds were drawn , and there were still three birches , a little larger now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had owned that house . He said owned advisedly , as the words lived in struck him as strange , and did not describe , as he remembered , what he had done in the house . But for several years he had come back and gone to bed there . It was in that house he had had erysipelas , a painful , contagiousp122disease , and a woman , his wife at the time , had taken care of him . Lovingly , as the doctor had said . A very strange word , he thought , and he had marveledat it . She had made him well , she had kept him clean , and when he was fit to be seen again , he had made love to a plump cigar-counter girl . How was that ? Time passed . Perhaps that was it . Every morning it was there on his hands , and had to be passed . But if it was Anna Mason that got him to church , and kept him there while the choir was singing , it was a chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . It made a man wonder , and wonder makes a religious man . Some people might say that it was the girl , or the city house he had built out in the country , but he knew in his heart it was neither the house nor his family . It was the chicken . Nobodyneeded to tell him that . Now , a sick chicken is always a problem , but when you put that chicken with five thousand others , all of them Leghorns , your problem is out of hand . The people in Murdock , you might say , had figured on that . They had all looked forward to it , and some men put their families into buggies and drove them out in the country so they could watch Will Brady 's chickens die . All day long he could hear the buggy weights plop in the dust . Justp123by turning and looking at the buggies he could tell which way the wind was blowing , as they were always careful to park away from the smell . Others claimed they could smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he never got out of the yard , and he slept in the basement where Anna Mason brought him his food . He could n't have smelled very much anyhow , as he was covered with smells from head to foot , and dirty Leghorn feathers were said to be tangled in his hair . Even Anna Mason , a pioneer woman , kept out of his draft . In the second week the big hens were dead before he picked them up . It was not necessary to cut their throats or to wring their necks . They were stiff , and yet they seemed very light when he scooped them up on the shovel , as if dying had taken a load off of them . During the third week three experts arrived , at his expense , from Chicago , and took most of one day to tell him there was nothing to be done . Then they went off , after carefully washingtheir hands . Sometimes he stopped long enough to look out at the road , and the rows of buggies , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was something they had picked up during the war . When the flu came along , everyone had run around breathing through a handkerchief . In spite of the smell , they all liked to sit wherep124they could keep their eyes on the house , and the upstairs room where the boy and girl were in quarantine . He had more or less ordered them to stay inside . Now and then he caught sight of the boy with his head at the window , peering at him , and one evening he thought he heard , blown to him , the music of their phonograph . Something about a lover who went away and did not come back . Nothing that he did , or paid to have done , seemed to help . The hens he shipped off died on the railroadplatform overnight . They were left in their crates and shipped back to him for burial . He was advised to keep his sick chickens to himself . Other men had chickens , and what he had started might sweep across the state , across the nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing pretty well . And then it stopped  --  for no more apparent reasonthan it had begun . It left him with one hundred and twenty-seven pullets still alive . He sat around waiting for them to die , but somehow they went on living , they even grew fatter , and early every morning the three young roosters crowed . It was something like the first , and the last , sound that he had ever heard . When he heard them crow he would come to the window , facing the cold morningsky , and look at the young trees that he had planted at the edge of the yard . They were wired top125the ground , which kept them , it was said , from blowing away . It would soon be summer out in the yard , but when he went up the spiralling stairs to their room , he could smell the oil burner that they kept going day and night . They liked the smell of it better than the one out in the yard . There was music playing , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if right there before him , came out of the horn that had the picture of the white dog stamped on it . The boy , the girl , and the dog were all listening to him . The man was singing of the time when the girl was a tulip , and he was a rose . This had been , he seemed to remember , her favorite song . As the man went on singing , the girl took hold of his hand , looking toward the horn where the needle was scratching , and he saw that she had no idea of what had happened to him . Not an inkling . Nor had the boy , who was sniffling through his adenoids . They had lived in this private world together , playing their records , caroms , and dominoes , and sometimes marveling at the strange things they saw in the yard . It seemed hard to believe , but somehow it did n't trouble him . When the music stopped he heard her say : " Will , you remember ? " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put a warm smile on his face . And when they both looked at him , waiting , he knew what he wouldp126say . He had come into the room not knowing , not having the vaguest idea , but now he knew , and he looked through the window as he spoke to them . " How would you two like to go to Omaha ? " he said.  |p129I  N THE middle of life Will Brady bought a house with the roof on sideways , as the boy said , and a yard without grass that he could pay the boy to mow . Under the fenced-in porch were a lawnmower and a cracked garden hose . On the porch were a swing , a hammock rope , and between the stone pillars at the front two wire baskets of dead ferns . In the house were a new player piano and a large box of music rolls . From the swing on the porch , since the ferns were dead , Will Brady could look down the street to the park , the end of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the motormanchanged the trolley , there would be a hot sizzling sound , and flashes of white light , like heat lightning , would fill the air . From where he sat onp130the porch Will Brady could see that the ferns were dead . Beyond the mineral spring , said to be good for you , the green hills were trimmed by mowing machines , and men could be seen playing the new game of golf . They wore breeches quite a bit like those worn by the boy . The hitting of the ball took place near the spring , where the men would stop for a drink of the water while the boys went off with the bags of sticks to hunt for the ball . Will Brady bought the boy a set of the sticks , which he found around the front yard every evening , and a box of the balls , which he often heard rolling around the house . He could n't seem to interest either the boy or the girl in the park . It was too big , too open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be with his family , he would sit in the parlor with the player piano while the boy played some of the rolls backwards , others too fast . The girl would sit on the floor playing card games with herself . On the table at his side were the magazines , the Youth 's Companion and Boys ' Life , that came through the mail once a month for the boy to read . He read them himself , and ordered through the mail such things as the watch with the compass in the winder , and the Official Scout knife , with which a clever boy could do so many things . One of the watches he boughtp131for the boy , the other for himself . In the dark candling-roomhe liked to take it from his pocket and watch the tiny needle waver toward the north , telling him , as nothing else would , about where he was . On top of the magazines , perhaps to keep them from blowing , was a heavy glass ball with a castle inside , and when he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quite a bit the way a farmhouseon the plains would disappear in a storm . He liked to sit there , holding this ball , until the storm had passed , the sky would clear , and he would see that the fairy castle with the waving red flags was still there . Every morning , with the exception of Sunday , Will Brady would get out of bed at six thirty , fry himself two eggs , and eat them while standing on the fenced-in back porch , facing the yard . At that time in the morning a rabbit might be there . He would then leave some money on the kitchen table and drive through the town to his place of work , a long narrow building with a wooden awning out in front . As the owner of this business he wore a soiled jacket , with blue flaps on the pockets , and when he stood in the door there was usually a clipboardon his arm . On it he kept a record of the eggs that came in , the chickens that went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupied air . Inp132the middle of life , with his best years before him , he seemed to have a firm grip on all serious matters , and a pretty young wife who called him once a day on the telephone . She called to let her husband know what movie his wife and son were at . In the morning there was usually ice on the pail where the dung-spotted eggs were floating , and he could see his breath , as if he were smoking , in the candling-room . If he seemed to spend a good deal of time every day looking at one egg and scratching another , perhaps it was the price one had to pay for being a successful man . One whose life was still beforehim , but so much of it already behind him that it seemed that several lives  --  if that was the word for it  --  had already been lived . Had already gone into the limbo , as some men said . He had his noon meal across the street , usually chicken-fried steak and hash-brown potatoes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After eating this meal he would stand on the curbing out in front . As he neither smoked anythingnor chewed , he would usually stand there chewing on a toothpick , and he seemed to have the time to listen to what you had to say . He seldom interrupted to say anything himself . He neither heard anything worth recounting nor said anything worth repeating , but he gave strangers the feeling that one of these days he might . He was highly re/spected and said to be wise in the ways of the world . There were evenings that he sat at the desk in the office , with the Dun &; Bradstreet open before him , and there were other evenings that he spent in the candling-room . He would take a seat on one of his egg cases , using the thick excelsior pad as a cushion , and the light from the candler would fall on the book he held in his hands . Dun &; Bradstreet ? No , this book was called a Journey to the Moon . Written by a foreigner who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read this book , and then he had given it to his father , as he did all of his books , to return to the library . One day Will Brady wondered what it was the boy liked to read . So he had opened the book , read four or five pages himself . He had been standing there , at his candler , but after reading a few more pages he had seated himself on an egg case , adjusted the light . He had gone without his lunch , without food or drink , till he had finished it . The candling-room had turned cold , and when he stepped into the office it was dark outside . That night Will Brady had tried to sleep  --  that is to say , he went to bed as usual  --  but something about having been to the moon kept him awake . He got out of the bed and stepped out on the porch for a look at it . The moon that he saw looked largerp134than usual , and nearer at hand . And the light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There before him lay the city  --  growing , it was said , by leaps and bounds since the last census  --  where many thousands of men , with no thought of the moon , lay asleep . He could cope with the moon , but somehow he could n't cope with a thought like that . It seemed a curious arrangement , he felt , for God to make . By some foolish agreement , made long ago , men and women went into their houses and slept , or tried to sleep , right when there was the most to see . Over the sleeping city the moon was rising , and there in the street were the shady elms , the floweringshrubs , and the sidewalks slippery with maple pods . On the porches were swings , limp , sagging hammocks , roller skates , and wire baskets of ferns , and in the houses the men and women lay asleep . It all seemed to Will Brady , there in the moonlight , a very strange thing . A warm summer night , the windows and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air that he breathed went in and out of all of them . In and out of the lungs , and the lives , of the people who were asleep . They inhaled it deeply , snoring perhaps ; then they blew it on its way again , and he seemed to feel himself sucked into the rooms , blown out again . Without carrying things too far , he felt himself made part of the livesp135of these people , even part of the dreams that they were having , lying there . Was that a very strange thing ? Well , perhaps it was . Perhaps it was stranger , even , than a journey to the Moon . And the thought came to him  --  to Will Jennings Brady , a prominent dealer in eggs  --  that he was a traveler , something of an explorer , himself . That he did even stranger things than the men in books . It was one thing to go to the moon , like this foreigner , a writer of books , but did this man know the man or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the neighbor 's house ? Did he know the woman who was there by the lamp , or the man sitting there in the shadow , a hat on his head as if at any moment he might go out ? Could he explain why there were grass stains on the man 's pants ? That might be stranger , that might be harder to see , than the dark side of the moon . Perhaps it was farther across the street , into that room where the lamp was burning , than it was to the moon , around the moon , and back to the earth . Where was there a traveler to take a voyage like that ? Perhaps it was even farther than twenty thousandleagues under the sea . Men had been there , it was said , and made a thorough report of the matter , but where was the man who had traveled the length of his own house ? Who knew the woman at the back  --  or the boy at the front who lay asleep ?  |p136How  many moons away , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the moon a man might jump many feet , which might be interesting if you went there ; but it was no mystery , a man could explain something like that . But what about the man who stood in the dark eating cornbread and milk ? What about the rooms where the blinds were alwaysdrawn ? If there were men who had been there and knew the answers , he would like to know them ; if they had written about these things he would read the book . If they had n't , perhaps he would write such a book himself . What writer , what traveler , could explain the woman who rolled herself up in the sheet , like a mummy , or the man who came home every night and undressed in the dark ? All one could say was that whatever it was it was there in the house , like a vapor , and it had drawn the blinds , like an invisiblehand , when the lights came on . As a writer of books he would have to say that this vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , and made their minds inert . As if they were poisoned , all of them , by the air they breathed . And such a writer would have to explain why this same air , so fresh and pure in the street , seemed to be poisoned by the people breathing it . So that in a way even stranger than the moon , they poisoned themselves.  |p137Was  it any wonder that men wrote books about other things ? That they traveled to the moon , so to speak , to get away from themselves ? Were they all nearer to the moon , the bottom of the sea , and such strange places than they were to their neighbors , or the woman there in the house ? What the world needed , it seemed , was a traveler who would stay right there in the bedroom , or open the door and walk slowly about his own house . Who would sound a note , perhaps , on the piano , raise the blinds on the front-room windows , and walk with a candle into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman , this stranger , as his wife . But if books would put a man in touch with the moon , perhaps they would put him in touch with a boy  --  a very strange thing , but a lot of people owned up to them . Mothers and fathers alike seemed to be familiar with them . When he returned the Journey to the Moon , he spoke to Mrs. Giles , the librarian , and tried to phrase , for her , some of the thoughts that were troubling him . Had any man taken , he said , a journey around his own house ? Not for public perusal , Mrs. Giles said . That would be a journey , he said , that he would like to take , or , for that matter , a journey around his own son.  |p138That  had been done , Mrs. Giles said , so he could just save himself the trouble . All kinds of men had already done just that . Was that a fact ? he said . Had n't he read Tom Sawyer ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she brought him the book . She also brought him Penrod , by another man , and several books by Ralph Henry Barbour , that would give him a good idea , she said , of what was on a boy 's mind . That was just what he wanted to know , he said , and went off with the books . He read Tom Sawyer , in one sitting , in the candling-room . He took the tin bottom off the candler , so that it cast more light for him , and he used two of the excelsior egg pads to soften the seat . There was a much better light in the office , with a comfortable chair to sit in , but he had hired a girl to sit there at the desk and answer telephone calls . She might not understand a man of his age reading children 's books . He read Tom Sawyer during the morning , and reflected on it while he had his lunch ; then he came back and read the book by Tarkington . By supper time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could believe what he read  --  which he found hard , but not too hard if he put his mind to it  --  boys were not at all as complicated as he had been ledp139to believe . When all was said and done , so to speak , they were just boys . Full of boyish devilment and good clean fun . If neither this Penrod nor Tom Sawyer reminded him very much of Willy Brady , that might be explained in terms of how they lived . Penrod had brothers and sisters , many freckles and friends , and a very loving father and mother . Willy Brady did n't have all of these things . But if his father could believe what he read , all Willy Brady had on his mind was baseball , football , Honor , and something called track . In Ralph Henry Barbour 's opinion , that of a man who really seemed to know , these were the things at the front and the back of a boy 's mind . If he could believe what he read , and Will Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile race that made the difference between a boy and a man . But to lead all the way was to court disaster , as the book made clear . One began with a fine healthy boy like Penrod , who had a real home , a loving father and mother , and perhaps an older sister who brought out the best in him . Then one day , overnight almost , his voice would change . Fuzz would grow on his lip , and his father would send him off to a boarding school . There he would live with other clean-cut boys like himself , eating good food , reading fine books , and talking over the problems of the coming Oglethorpe game . The walls of the room would bep140covered with banners from big Eastern schools . The window would open out on the field where he would throw the javelin , run the race , and pitch the last three innings with a pain in his arm . In the winter he would sit at his desk and study , or go home with his roommate over Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . His roommate 's sister , a dark-haired girl who attendedsome private school in the East , would ask her brother , in a roundabout way , all about him . After that one thing would lead to another until he struck off somewhere on his own , or accepted a position with a promising future in her father 's firm . The only problem would be how long he would have to wait for her . Will Brady hoped it would n't be too long , thinkingover his own experience , as once out of school , like that , life seemed harder to organize . There were many pressures , and not nearly so many lovely girls . Nor were there many things that a father could do to make sure that the boy picked the right one , when the boy still had neither fuzz on his lip nor a voice that had changed . He was twelve , but he looked more like nine or ten . The only hair on his body was there on the top of his head . But with this boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Sundays afternoons he would walk him through thep141park to the baseball diamond , and sit with him in the bleachers behind the sagging fence of chicken wire . Thanks to Ralph Henry Barbour , Will Brady knew the names of the players and the places , and he pointed out to the boy the pitcher 's mound , and the batteries . In his own mind , of course , he saw the boy as a pitcher , pitching the last three innings with his arm sore , but the boy took an interest in the catcher as he wanted the mask . Nobody else on the field seemed to interest him . He wanted to wear what the catcher wore , and peer out through the mask . So he bought the boy a glove , a ball , and a mask , but he put off buying the rest of it until he had a long talk with the man in the Spalding store . This man , a Mr. Lockwood , seemed to take a personal interest in Will Brady 's boy . Mr. Lockwood had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Nebraska he had run the mile in record time , the last thing you would think of , so to speak , when you looked at him . He did n't look any too well , as a matter of fact , and he had grown a little heavy for a man his age . In a separate compartment of his wallet , however , Mr. Lockwood had a bundle of press clippings , some of them with faded pictures showing how he looked at the time . The clippings were now yellow , and hard to read , but Will Brady could make out thatp142the man who stood before him had once run the mile , all the way , in 4:23 . A mile , as Mr. Lockwood reminded him , was fourteen city blocks . With Mr. Lockwood 's expert help , Will Brady bought the boy shoes for running and jumping , shoes for baseball , special shoes for football , and rubber-soled shoes for doing things inside . He also bought him the shirts , pants , and socks to go along with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time , but he would know the smell and the feel of a sweatshirt , and the smell was an important thing . As Mr. Lockwood said , it was a smell that he would never get out of his nose . If there was something about Mr. Lockwood that had gone unmentioned in all of the books , perhaps it was because the author had had no need to bring it up . As a writer of books , Ralph Henry Barbour described what he saw in the newspaper clippings , and the young man that he saw , with his muscles bulging , breasting the tape . He was not concerned with the middle-aged man in the sporting-goodsstore . Everything Mr. Lockwood said about himself , and his wonderful college life at Nebraska , would lead one to believe that Ralph Henry Barbour was absolutely right . Everything that had happened to him , back then , had been wonderful . If he had been a writer , he would have written those books himself . Listening to Mr. Lockwood , and hep143liked to talk , Will Brady often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a modest picture of college life . Everything in the world , it seemed clear , had happened to Mr. Lockwood , the great mile runner , but nothing much had happened to the man in the sporting-goods store . Nothing much had happened since then , that is . He still had the smell of it all in his nose , and some people might say there was something like it , if not worse , on his breath . He reminded Will Brady , at times , of a man very much like himself . A man who might live in one of those houses across the street . He would probably have a wife named Gladys , who slept alone in the bedroomat the back , and a daughter named Mabel , or Eileen , who slept in the room at the front . And perhaps at this point people were saying how much the mother looked like the daughter , and talk like that would be scaring the girl to death . Or maybe it would n't . That would be hard to say . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightbrownhair , his pale-blue eyes , and perhaps the smile that he once had in the photographs . Before he began to die , that is . Before something began to poison him . It was no help , of course , to say so , but the man in the sporting-goods store , the celebrated athlete , looked like a man who was being poisoned to death.  |p144He  smoked too much . Perhaps that was it . The man who was pictured in the press clippings did not smoke . Whatever this thing was , it seemed to be something that he had picked up later ; it was not in the air on the college campus , nor what he breathed on the track . It was not something that Ralph Henry Barbour felt he had to describe . But something had happened . What had it been ? The great mile runner , the baseball star , had accepted an offer from Spalding &; Brothers to go out on the road and sell their guaranteed baseballs , their autographedbats . After a while he had married his childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had kept his paper clippings just loose in his desk , where he could find them ; then one day , one spring day more than likely , he took them out . After mulling them over he put them in his wallet  --  began to carry them around . Some time later maybe he noticed how dry and brittle they were getting , or maybe he did n't  --  maybe it was just a chance remark by his wife . Whatever it was , he made a little pile of the best of them . He put the best picture in the back of his watch , the best clippingin his vest . They were always with him , as if he could n't part with them . Some writer of books might even say that these clippings poisoned him . That they were old , brittle , and fading , like the man himself . People will believe anything that theyp145read , and if they happened to read , in a book somewhere , that a man was poisoned by some newspaper clippings , why they would swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these people were right . But what would this man say of Will Brady 's son ? One that happened to be , as Will Brady seemed to think , the complicated type . A boy that once a week , while his father was shaving , would come to the door of the bathroom and wait for his father to turn from the mirror and look at him . The boy would be wearing his Official Boy Scout uniform . He seemed to wear the shirt more than the pants , as the shirt had faded to a washed-out color , and on his feet were the Official green , chrome leather shoes . They hurt his feet , badly , but he never complained . From his belt hung a flashlight , a compass , a metal canteen in a soft flannelcooler , a key ring with some keys , a medal for swimming , another medal for walking , one for not smoking , and a waterproof kit containing materials for building a fire . This was in case his waterproof matchbox got wet . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a day 's balanced rations , and Dentyne gum , which he chewed for his teeth and to allay the thirst . " Off for the woods , son ? " Will Brady would say ,  |p146but  sometimes the boy was n't . No , strange to say , he might not be off for anywhere . He would just be prepared , in case he felt like being off . He would follow his father back to the bedroom and sit on the bed . He would sit there and watch his father dress , as if there was something very strange about it , or he would take out his maps and spread them on the bed . " Where is the exact center of the U. S. A. ? " the boy might ask . At one time Will Brady thought such a question was put to him . He did n't answer for the simple reason that he did n't know . But the boy was just talking to himself , as first he would put the question , then he would answer : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas . " It was never necessary for Will Brady to say anything . Looking at Omaha the boy would say : " The metal smokestack at the smelting works is the highest metal smokestack in the world , " or " Omaha spaghetti is now sold in Italy . " It was something of an education for Will Brady to listen to him . They seemed to be educating young people better nowadays . As for himself , he had eight years ' schooling , but in so far as he could remember , no one had ever mentioned that Omaha spaghetti was sold in Italy . The boy said it was . And he always seemed to have the Gospel truth . Right out of the blue , without any warning , thep147boy once asked : " Why are you so different ? " Will Brady had been facing the mirror in the men 's room of the Paxton Hotel . He had taken the boy down there before they went to the show . " Kid  --  " he had said , then hearing what he had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a bit he turned it off and said : " Yes , son ? " " I do n't mind kid , " the boy said , " if you want to call me kid that 's all right with me . " " That was a slip , son , " he said . " That was just a slip . " " The name I really like is Spud , " the boy said . " I always say call me Spud but nobody does it . " " What 's wrong with Willy , son ? " he said . " I 've been Willy for a long time , " the boy said , and Will Brady bent over , turned the hot water back on . What in God 's name did the boy mean by that ? With a paper towel Will Brady wiped the steaming mirror so that he could see the boy 's sober face . His eyes , his mother 's eyes , that is , were watching him . What did Will Brady feel ? Not much of anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was just about that . He would take them out to eat , where music was playing , and they would sit there together , in league against him , looking at him from a long wayp148off . Very much as if he were an imposter . A father , one who did n't know what being a father was like , and a lover , one who did n't know much about love . More or less hopeless . For different reasons they both pitied him . So HE would give them money , put them in a show , and drive downtown to his office , where he would take off his coat and sit at his new roll-top desk . Some nights he did that , other nights he might walk around the streets , or out over the river , and on Saturday evenings he often stopped in at BrowningKing . It was Fred Conlen who had got him to wear the soft-collar shirt . In Fred Conlen 's private fitting-room he would see himself in the three-way mirror , and it was there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was talking  --  at no other time . While he talked this man in the mirror had a strange smile on his lips . This smile on his lips and a sly , knowing look about the eyes . Something shrewd he had said ? Well , he never really seemed to say much . Just a good deal implied , so to speak , in what he did say . " What about a pair of pants , " he would say , " that a man never has to take off ? " That was all.  |p149What  did he mean by a remark like that ? Whatever he meant , Fred Conlen often thought it was pretty good . " Brady , " he would say , " you ought to be on the platform . You got a head . " " When I was a boy , " Will Brady had said , " I had the biggest hat on the lowest peg . Seems to me the peg 's lower every time I look at it . " " Bygod , Brady , " Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Had he ? Well , nothing you could put your finger on . You needed mirrors , so to speak , to see a trick like that . To see a man with a big head , narrow shoulders , the new soft-collared shirt , and along with the toothpick that sly smile in the corner of his mouth . About to say something . And when he did , it would be pretty good . " I notice these new twin beds are pretty popular now , " he would say , and Fred Conlen , with the pins in his mouth , would turn to look at him . Will Brady bought his clothes from Fred Conlen  --  Hart Schaffner &; Marx , direct from Chicago  --  and his shoes from Lyman Bryce , who ran the Florsheim store . If he stopped by in the evening Lyman Bryce would take him to the back of the shop , pull up a stool , and show him what they were wearing in Palm Beach . Will Brady would sit there ,  |p150his  shoes off , and this fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest thing in Palm Beach shoes . He would ask him to stand up and walk around in them . People in the street would come to the door and peer in . Bryce had a fine new home in Dundee , and a prominent place in the AkSar-Benparade , but what he really liked to do was sit there on a shoe stool and talk . He was a big fellow , like T. P. Luckett , but he was quite a bit different from Luckett in that he hinted that a good egg business was not the last word . Nor was the shoe business . Nor anything of that stripe . Lyman Bryce seemed to think that Will Brady was meant for more than that . " Forget about the money , " Bryce would say , " I 'll take care of the money . " What he seemed to he looking for , as he said himself , was the right man . What was being done , Bryce wanted to know , down in the deep South , or out in Texas ? Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Could n't a man with a few big tractors start plowing it up ? Instead of fiddling with eggs  --  as Bryce called it  --  why did n't Will Brady take thirty thousand dollars , or fifty if he liked it , and go out there and start something ? " God Almighty , Brady , " he would say , " stop fiddling with eggs . " He seemed to think the country was still wide open for a man with some cash.  |p151When  he talked with Lyman Bryce , Will Brady always had a smile on his face . Was he amused ? No , there was more to his smile than that . It was more like the smile he had when he faced three mirrors with just one face . Or when he sat there with Bryce , and Bryce would say : " Now bygod , Brady , I 'd like to have you home for dinner . But you know the little woman  --  the little woman is fussy as hell . " Did he know the little woman ? From that smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might be led to think that some of these little women were pretty big . Clark Lee , for example , had one of them . Lee ran the Gaiety , and he was one of the big show men in the state . He used the little woman to explain a good many things . " Geez , Brady , " he would say , " I would n't want the little woman to get wind of this , " or " Well , I 'd better get along , Brady , if I 'm going to keep the little woman in line . " Now , both Lee and Bryce were pretty big men , Lee a notch or two above six feet , but the way they talked about these little women made them seem pretty small . You got the idea that the little women were all biggerthan the men . For example , the big thing in Clark Lee 's life , besides the little woman , that is , was something that he called the chalk line . He often drew this line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was stand/ing he would draw this line on the air . The little woman expected him to walk that line , he said . Perhaps he did , as this line always seemed to be with him , either there on his desk , drawn on the thin air , or like a pattern in the rug . A line drawn betweenClark Lee and everything else . " With the little woman , " Lee would say , " I got to toe that line ! " and he would tap on it , putting out his feet to where he saw something on the rug . It would be wrong to say that this line was imaginary . It was there in the lobby , in his office , in the sidewalk when he stepped in the street , and it hung like an invisible clothesline in the air . Ready to trip him or support him , as the case might be . Big man though he was , Clark Lee often seemed to lean on it . Perhaps the little woman was sometimes on Will Brady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at the Paxton to see if Evelyn Fry was there . She sold cigars , but she was no cigarcountergirl . She knew the one Will Brady had married  --  she was a married woman herself  --  and she always asked him how his kids were getting along . Sometimes Evelyn Fry like to go for a ride where they could just sit and look at the river ; other times she would make him a cooling drink of something in her rooms . The fellow she had married had left her a lot of furniture . There were tasseledp153lamps , a grand piano with a shawl and some photographs , and sometimes there was a smell stronger than the incense she liked to burn . A cigar , but that was all right too . That was something they had both come to understand . These things did n't matterso much any more , and perhaps the thing they had in common was the knowledge of what things seemed to matter and what things did not . A cigar or two did n't . Which was why he was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beer she was sure he would like if he would just drink it  --  until the foam was gone , the beer was warm , and she would drink it herself . Other times he had grape juice with lumps of ice in it . He would suck on the ice while she played him records on the gramophone . Perhaps she thought he was homesick , lonely , or something like that . It probably meant she was sometimes lonely herself . He liked to be with Evelyn Fry just to be with her , to sit there in the room , and to stir the ice in what he was drinking with one of her spoons . While the music played , nobody had to talk . He would sit facing the piano with the hanging shawl , the vase with the red paper flowers , and the picture of a gaunt-looking man in his underwear , rowing a boat . Her husband . He had left her , naturally . He had a stiff black beard and it had probably tickled her face.  | " That song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to like , but never knew the name of , " what is it you like about it so much ? " Did he ever answer ? No , he never had to say . He had ice in his mouth , and perhaps he did n't know , anyhow . That was how he liked to put in an evening  --  not too often , just now and then  --  when he had the need of a little woman for himself . Someone to pour him a drink , and ask him simple questions about his kids . And around ten o'clock he would leave , as he had to go and pick them up . If they were at the Empress , but not in the lobby , he would ask the manager , Mr. Youngblood , to run the slide advertisingWill Brady 's Chickens and Eggs . This would let them know that he was in the lobby waiting for them . But if they were at the World , or the Orpheum , where slides like that had gone out of fashion , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People like Tom Mix , Hoot Gibson , and Wallace Reid they liked to see twice , which took a good deal of time if six acts of vaudevillecame in between . In that case he would buy a bag of popcorn , and the usher would let him sit in the lobby as they had all got to know him and knew pretty well what his problem was . But in August he found the boy in the lobby alone . As that usually meant that the girl was in the ladies ' room for a moment , he sat down and waitedp155while the boy finished eating a peanut bar . When the girl did n't come , he said : " Son , where is your mother ? " " She left , " said the boy , " she left before the vaudeville . " " Your mother left ? " he said . " She went off with the Hawayan , " said the boy . " He liked her and she 's going to work for him . " " A Hawayan ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the boy said . " If I could dance I 'd have gone to work for him , too . "  |p159IN  THE suburbs Will Brady owned a fine house with a chain swing on the porch , a playroom in the basement , and a table in the kitchen where he left pocket money for the boy . But both the boy and the man did their living somewhere else . The boy did all of his living next door  --  that is to say , he added one more plate to the table that already numbered three on each side and one at the end . So it was the boy 's plate that evened it up , as Mrs. Ward said . When Will Brady walked over to discuss the matter , there was really nothing that remained to be said , as the boy had been living  --  Mrs. Ward said living  --  with them for some time . If he passed the night at home it was merely to make his father feel all right . Nobody liked to sleep in a big emptyp160house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he did , was recognize what had already happenedand offer to pay , as he did , for the boy 's board . It was agreed that he ate around five dollars ' worth of food a week . He was small , but a small growing boy could somehow stow it away . It was also agreed that his father should continue to buy his clothes . These matters taken care of , Mrs. Ward agreed to let him see the boy , once or twice a week , and give him pocket money so long as it was n't too much . She took away from him sums that she did n't think it wise for a boy to have . In case the boy got sick , or really needed something , or might , for some reason , just want to see his father , Mrs. Ward would leave a message for him at the Paxton Hotel . That was where Will Brady , for the time being , had taken a room . When a man has lost something he would like to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old set of habits , he can walk around the streets of the city looking for it . Or he can stand on a corner , nearly anywhere , and let it look for him . The boys and girls Will Brady found under the street lights , or playingaround the posters in the theater lobbies , did n't know what he had lost but they had learned what he had to give . They could hear the coins that jingled in the pocket of his coat . If he stood on the corner , a well-lighted corner , sooner or later theyp161would gather around him  --  just as the pigeons would gather around him when he sat in the park . They did n't know what he wanted , but they were willing to settle for what he had to give . " Hello there , Harry , " Will Brady would say , as he liked to call all of them Harry . As it was never their name , it gave them something to talk about . " My name ai n't Harry , " they would reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What you going to do with three cents , Harry ? " " My name is n't Harry ! " they would say ; then , getting back : " if I had three cents I could go to a show . " " So you think you 'd like to take in a show , Harry ? " he would say . " You gim me three cents an ' I 'll have ten . " They were smart , these kids , and so they would talk for quite a while . Sometimes it took quite a bit of handling  --  knowing when to stop calling them Harry  --  but with a pocket full of pennies a man like Will Brady could talk for an hour . " Do n't tell me , Harry , " he would say , " I 've got a grown-up boy of my own . I can tell you a thing or two about boys . " " What can you tell ? " they would ask , and of course he could n't tell them much of anything . Nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penrod . They were the only boys , it seemed , that he knew very much about . And as for girls , he knew even less  --  no , he did n't know a thing about girls until the one called Libby  --  Libby something  --  spoke to him . On 18th and Farnam , near the Omaha Bee , somebody ran out from the shadows toward him , and he assumed it was one of the boys , some skinny kid . " Well , Harry , " he had said , " is this a holdup ? " and put his right hand into his pocket before he really knew  --  before he looked , that is  --  at the sharp freckled face . The girl was tall and thin , and the dress she had on was too small for her . " Well , well , " he repeated , " is this a holdup ? " " No , sir , " she said , " it 's not holdup , " but he could n't see her face as she stood between him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his hand  --  in the palm of his hand were coins , most of them pennies  --  and she came around to lean over his arm , look at them too . She put her small head between him and the light . It was narrow , and the long black hair was in braids . The braids were hooked over her ears , like pulleys , and as she peered into his hand she tugged on them , slowly , tolling her head like a bell . " That ai n't enough , " she said . " For a show ? " he said . " For kisses , " she said , " I 'm sellin ' kisses . " Whenp163he did n't speak right up , she said : " I 'm not beggin ' anything , I 'm sellin ' . " " I see , " he said , and raised his head as if someone had called his name . He looked to the corner where swarms of bugs flew in and out of the street light . Passing beneath the light were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded over his arm , and the woman a step or two away from him , as if he were hot . " Twenty-five cents is what I try and get , " she said , " but if that 's all you got , it 's all you got , " and with her dirty brown fingers she removed the coins from his hand . One at a time , pecking at his palm like a bird . When she had them all she stepped forward , putting up her face , rising on her toes , and gave him a noisy peck on the cheek . Then she stepped back , moving out of the light , to see if he was pleased . " That was n't so much , " she said , " but it was fourteen cents ' worth . Was n't it ? " He agreed . " Oh yes , " he said , and wagged his head . " But I can do better , " she said , and lifted her arms as if she were a dancer , letting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From a bench in the park Will Brady had seen little girls drop their jacks , or the doll they were holding , and throw up their arms , their heads back , as if they would fly.  |p164Without  warning , as if some voice had whispered to them . Sometimes it was pretty , other times it was like what he saw now . She leered at him over her left shoulder , her eyelids fluttering , and he knew he had seen it all less than an hour before . On the Orpheum billboards , where two beautiful girls were wrapped in gauze . Maybe he looked unhappy , for she said : " Did I take all your money ? " " Oh no , " he said . " I 'll bet I took your carfare , " she said , and looked at the coins in her hands . The dime she removed , held out to him . " No , no , " he said , " and besides , I walk . I like to walk on nights like this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him , swinging her braids . Still dancing , she said : " And I know what you 're thinking . " " What ? " he said . " That I 'm not old enough . You 're thinking I 'm not old enough to take care of myself . " He shook his head . " Well , that 's what you 're thinkin ' , you men . " You 're quite a big girl , " he said . " I am . I make my own livin ' . I make up to five dollars a week . Is n't that good ? " " That 's a very good living . " " It 's more than my father makes , " she said.  |p165Still  facing the light , he said : " What does your father do ? " " Nothing , " she said , and sang that a bridge was falling down . She danced around him twice , singing , then she stopped singing , hopped up and down , and ran toward the corner , where she suddenly stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down toward her sharp knees . Then she turned to wave at him , her long braids swinging , and was gone . Two , sometimes three or four times a week , she " did business with him . " It was strictly a business proposition , as she said herself . The fact that he seldom had the right amount of money did n't trouble her much . Sometimes she would have newspapersunder her arms , usually old papers , which she would sell him , as she was in business , she told him , for herself . But kisses were a better proposition , as they cost her nothing . All she had to do was find somebody who wanted them . On the week ends , when she specialized in kisses , she wore a large flowered hat with a flapping brim ,  |p166and  in the crown of the hat there were many flowers , some of them real . But what he smelled , as she always had to tell him , was her perfume . It was sometimes so strong that as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , these nights , she wore a brassiere , the pink cups folded over very neatly , and in the one on the right she kept all the money she made . It jingled as she ran off or stood hopping up and down . Week nights she had to be home early , but Saturday nights she had time to talk , if that was what he wanted , or a marshmallow sundae , if he wanted something like that . As her shoes hurt her feet , they usually had the sundae sitting down . In the ice-cream parlor she would take off her hat , as the veil on the hat tickled her face , and sometimes fell in the marshmallow sundae when she closed her eyes . She always closed her eyes , as ice cream tasted better that way . He would have a cherry phosphate , or a root beer , and when her mouth was full , and her eyes were closed , he would sit there looking at her sticky , freckled face . Was he in love with her ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure . He said he did n't know . He ought to make up his mind , she said , because if he was in love with her , really in love , he could kiss her without paying anything.  |p167Was  she in love with him ? She did n't know . No , she did n't know , she said , a whole lot about love . She did n't know if what she felt was what she had heard , or if what she heard was what she felt about it . She did n't know if she had ever loved anybody or not . When she had a baby she would probably love it . Then she would know . Then she would know if what she felt for him was love or not . Eating and talking also made her sleepy , and she would let him walk her home  --  to the corner , that is , where she kissed him for nothing . He could see the rooming house where she lived , the cracked yellow blinds , the old men on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door at the end of the hall . Then he would go home , lying awake in the hot front room across from the boy , watching the flash in the night when the street-car trolley was switched around . When the last car for the night went back into town . During the day he had eggs in his hands , things that he could pick up , that is , and put down , and tell what they were , good or bad , by holding them to the candler . But during the night there was nothinghe could grasp like that with his hands . You ca n't take a notion into your hand , like a Leghorn egg , and judge the grade of it . You ca n't hold it to the light , give it a twist , and see that it is good . Norp168is there any way to tell if it is what you are missing or not . Could a man say , for instance , that what he really needed was a woman 's hat ? A cheap straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the faded paper flowers on the crown . A hat made of yellow straw , shiny with varnish , with dried marshmallow stuck to the veil , and both dark and blond hairs tangled in it . All of its long life it had been just a hat , an inexpensive straw hat no longer in fashion , and then one day , in spite of itself , it was on a new head . It became , overnight almost , something more than a hat . It became a notion  --  something missing , that is , from a man 's life . So that when this girl Libby took off this hat and set it on the marble-topped table beside her , the man seated across from her might put out his fingers and touch the wide brim . He might sniff at the flowers , or take between his fingers a torn piece of the veil . Just as he had once , standing idle on the corner , let his hand rest for a moment on a boy 's knobby head , or let his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when this boy got away some man would say  --  some stranger , that is , would step up and say  --  " If you want to handle the kids , you better get ' em off the street . " And what do you say to that ? Why , you say thank you , thank you very much . Maybe thisp169stranger has what he calls your own interests at heart . Thinks that he is doing you a personal favor to speak like that . But a hat , after all , is just a hat , and if you want to lean over and sniff the paper flowers , or touch a piece of the veil , why that is perfectly all right . Very likely it was something you put up your own good money for . But near the end of the summer he found the girl in a telephone booth at the back of the drugstore , and in the booth with her , sitting there huggingher , a fat blond boy . They had been to Krug 's Park , and the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat , like a lodge button , was a live chameleon . The boy said : " Howdy , Mr. Magee , " as he naturally assumed Will Brady was the girl 's father , but he stayed right there in the telephone booth , with one arm around the girl . She was giggling over the phone about boys to some other girl . Will Brady looked at his watch , put it away , advised them to have a nice time that evening , then walked out into the street before he noticed what he held clasped tight in one hand . A handful of coins : five pennies , two nickels , and one shiny new dime . That was not the last he saw of the girl , but she no longer ran toward him out of the shadows , or wore on her birdlike head a wide flappy-brimmed hat . The braids were gone , and the dirt now showedp170behind her large ears . He would see her in the batteredfront seats at the Empress , sitting there with some boy , or some middle-aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her powder-dirty face . The large mouth open as if to help the eyes drink it all in . And later , like a sleepwalker , she would walk into the luminous glare of the lobby , where , with one finger , she would loosen the wad of gum from her front teeth . Facing , but not seeing him , she would start chewing on it . WELL , that was how it was , and if it sometimes seemed strange , it was hardly any stranger than anything else , and not so strange as the fact that only in hotel lobbies was Will Brady at home . Somehow or other he felt out of place almost everywhereelse . In the houses that he bought , or in the rooms that he rented , and even in the cities where he lived . But in the lobby of a good hotel he felt all right . He belonged , that is  --  there was something about it that appealed to him . He liked to sit in a big armchair at the front  --  inp171a leather-covered chair if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potted palm , in case they had that . He also liked a good view of the cigar counter , and the desk . He liked the sound of the keys when they dropped on the counter , the sound of the mail dropping into the slots , and the sound of the dice  --  though he never gambled  --  in the stiff leather cup . God knows why , but there was something he liked about it . Hearing that sound he immediatelyfelt at home . A curious artificial place , when you think of it , glowing nightlike by day , and daylike by night , with no connection whatsoever with the busy life that went by in the street . And when a man came in through the revolving doors , it was the man that changed . The dim , shaded lights and the thick carpeted floors cast a spell over him . His walk , what you think of as his bearing , the way his arms moved or hung slack from his shoulders , all of these things were not at all what they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who was being fitted for a new suit . A little bigger , wider , taller , and better-looking than he really was . And on his face the look of a man who secs himself in a threewayglass . In the three-way mirror he sees the smile on his face , he sees himself , you might say , both coming and going  --  a man , that is , who wasp172from some place and was going somewhere . Not the man you saw , just a moment before , out there in the street . A man comes into the world , you might say , when he steps into his first lobby , and something of this knowledge brings him there when he expects to depart . If something is missing , the lobby is where he will look for it . And yet no two lobbies are exactly alike , there is a difference in the rugs , or the lighting , in the women at the desk , the price of the cigars , and the number of plants . There will sometimes be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may also be a difference in the marble columns , their thickness through the middle , the height of the ceilings , and the quality of brass  --  if that is what it is  --  in the cuspidors . There will often be a difference in the service , the age of the bellhops , the location of the men 's room , and the size of the carpets at the sagging side of the beds . But the figure in the carpet will be the same . Not merely in the carpet , but worn into the floor . A man seated on the bed could feel it through his socks , recognizeit with his feet . All hotels are alike in this matter , and all the lobbies are more alike than they are different , in that the purpose of every lobby is the same . To be both in , that is , and out of this world . The same things go along with lobbies that gop173along with dreams , great and small love affairs , and other arrangements that never seem quite real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , so to speak . It tips you off , as the closing of the hymnbooks tips you off in church that the song is finished and that it 's time to get set for the prayer . It prepares you for a short flight from one world to a better one . From the real world , where nothing much ever happens , to the unreal world where anythingmight happen  --  and sometimes does . But there is no mystery about it . It is just a matter of rules . Just as there are hard and fast rules in the street that make it impossible for some things to happen , so there are rules in the lobby that make it possible . You can sense that as you come through the door . You can breathe it in the scented air , hear it in the women 's voices , the creak of leather luggage , and the coin dropped on the counter for a good cigar . And the name that is written there in the ledger ? Take a look at it . Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is it perhaps just Will Jennings , as it does n't really matter , for the time being ?  --  you can be whom you like . And as for that young woman there at your side  --  is that your wife ? You hope so . That is the gist of it . For it is the purpose of hotel lobbies to take you out of the life you are living , to a better life , or a braver , more interesting one . More in line with your own real powers , sop174to speak . The porter cries aloud a name in the lobby and you turn , for it might be yours , and perhaps you have never met this stranger before , your betterself . You can see him in the eyes of those who turn and look at you . To size you up , to compare you with their own better selves . Just as there are men who are never lovers until they meet their wives in the lobby , there are women who have never been loved anywhere but in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved . In the rented room is where men exceed themselves . Loversand seducers , prosperous , carefree men of the world . What you find in the lobby , what you hear in the music , what you feel in the air as you saunter across it , is the other man and the other woman in your life . There in the lobby the other life is possible . Perhaps that man at the counter , rolling the dice , is the one who made the Beautyrest mattress possible  --  butnot the sleep . No , you ca n't have everything . You ca n't manufacture the good night 's sleep and sell it with the bed . But , still , it is something to know that the sleep would be a good one , and that the man responsible for it is quite a bit like yourself . Middle-aged , paunchy , and often subject to lying awake . And when you 've lost something you would like to get back , the lobby is where you can look forp175it , sit waiting for it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise . As you probably know , it is smart to advertise . Adam Brady did it when he wanted a wife , Will Brady did it when he wanted an egg , as the only problem is in knowing what you want . Knowing , that is , how to put it in ten or twelve words . But that can be quite a stickler . Take something like this : FATHER AND SON seek matronly woman take charge modest home in suburbs . Was that what he wanted ? Well , he thought it was . But he would have to wait and see what an ad like that turned up . If what he said , so to speak , had covered the ground . On the advice of the girl in the office , he ran that ad in the " Personal " column , as he was looking for something rather special , as she said . He gave his address , of course , as the Paxton Hotel . The lobby would be just the place for a meeting like that . It would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind , as it was there in the ad , and all the woman had to do was answer it . That was what he thought , this fellow Brady , when he took his seat at the front of the lobby , wearing the look of a man who was the father of a homeless boy . That was what he was thinking when a Miss Miriam Ross asked to speak to him.  | " Hello , " she said to him as he came forward . " Where 'll we park ? " With the hat that he held , Will Brady gestured toward the back . " Okey-dokey , " she said , and walked ahead of him with her shoulders back , her hips thrown forward , with the motion of a woman going down a flight of stairs or a steep ramp . From the back Will Brady could see the rolled tops of her stockings , the red jewel clasps , and when she sat down  --  dropped down  --  he saw them at the front . He had never seen a flapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if , over the years , he had fallen out of touch with the motherly type . Miriam Ross lay in the lobby chair , her arms wide , her legs spread as if the room was too hot , and smoked cigarettes while peering at him dreamilyas he talked . What did he say ? Something about himself and a homeless boy . Every now and then he fanned the blue smoke away from his face . Now and then the girl sighed , as if tired , or tipped her head to blow the smoke in her lap , or make little cries , like a puppy , while dusting her cigarette . Later she leaned forward , on her sharp knees , to powder her face . On a piece of gum wrapper she wrote her name , her address , and her telephone number , then she slunk along before him , coughingsoftly , toward the door . " Be seeing you ,  |p177daddy  , " she said , and patted him gently on the chest . When you know what you want , perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FATHER seeks large matronly woman to mother homeless boy . Was that too plain ? He would drop the large . Somehow , when he was a boy , matronly women were all large . FATHER seeks matronly woman as companion growing boy . Perhaps it was best to keep the father out of it . He let a week pass , then he ran this ad in both the Des Moines and the Omaha papers , and in the following week he received eighteen replies . He made appointments with a Miss Lily Schumann , a Miss Vivien Throop , a Bella Hess , and a Mrs. Callie Horst . Mrs. Horst 's letter to him had been very brief : I sometimes get so sick and tired of all of them . How old is yours ? Mrs. Horst also lived on a farm and did n't know whether she could get to town within the month or not . But his first appointment was with Missp178Schumann , who would be wearing , as she said , white feathers , a fur muff , and a red handbag . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumann seated near the phone booths , asleep . She was well dressed , her hands in a fur muff , and her corset hugged her body so that it seemed to prop her upright , like a barrel . Now and then she burped , putting out a pink tongue to lick the film from her lips . She was rather short , with small hands and feet , and from time to time her brows arched up , her face flushed , and her small white teeth would bite down on her lip . She seemed to be digesting , and enjoying it very much . Without opening her eyes she removed from her handbag a small handkerchief , with blue tatting , and wiped her full lips , both inside and out , like a baby 's mouth . Later she dropped a green mint on her tongue . Her small hand , with the fat fingers , rested on her muff like a picked bird , and when she sighed , her breath was scented with wintergreen . He let her sleep . She was still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Throop . Miss Throop lowered herself  --  she did not sit down , nor drop down , she lowered herself  --  as her glasses , on a cord from her throat , swung back and forth beneath her large bust . " Throoooop , " shep179was saying , " old English , " and when she was lowered , her legs crossed at the ankles , she felt about on her front where her glasses had once been . This was on the top of her bust , rather than beneath . " Throoooop , " she repeated , and found her glasses in her lap . Miss Throop had spent the best years of her life as a tutor to the Countess Moroni , companion and tutor to her three lovely children and the Countess herself . This was of course in Italy . During the morning she and the children spoke only Italian and French , during the afternoon they spoke Englishand American . American was the hardest  --  she had been away so long . It bored her to death  --  were they seated in a draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the radiator . Did he mind a woman standing , she asked , and spread her full skirts to catch the heat . She simply felt better standing  --  thatwas what years of lecturing did . As the heat billowed her skirts , she fluffed them out , let them fall , and the sweetish sour smell hung over the lobby , the smell of soiled clothes . She was gettingwarm , and the bangs of her wig , a crisp amber color , stuck to her forehead when she raised her hand , patted them down . " And now tell me , " she said , with her fingers on her eyelids , " about your son . "  |p180While  Will Brady talked , Miss Throop inhaled her own rich smell . She stood with one hand at her back , the other raised to her damp forehead , with the tip of the thumb and the first finger on her lidded eyes . Her glasses had made deep blue bruises at the bridge of her nose . Under her arms the colors had run , the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shiny spears of her corset stays . When he stopped talking , for a moment , she turned to look at the rain . " Rain , rain , rain , rain , rain , rain , " she said , and gave her skirts a toss , like a dancer ; then as they drooped she felt around once more on the top of her bust . But it was not for her glasses . Smiling , she said : " You mind if I smoke ? " Bella Hess said no , no thank you , she 'd just as soon stand up and talk , and looked about her as if the lobby chairs were so many beds , the pillows rumpled and the covers thrown back . Bella Hess had worked for years in Cedar Rapids , and she handed him a letter , several pages long , describing the cooking , the washing , and the hundred extra things Bella Hess had done . She had along with her a small bag of hard rolls , another letter of recommendation , and a wicker case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stood there ,  |p181holding  the letter , until Bella Hess picked up her bag , took the letter from his hands , and walked through the swinging doors into the street . The next woman he met did not even trouble to answer the ad . She just happened to be standing in the lobby when he was speaking to Bella Hess , and while he stood there , wondering , she came up and spoke to him . She had a powder-stained face , bleached hair ; but there was something familiar about her  --  about the walk , and about the way she rolled her eyes . Like the weighted , rolling eyes of a sleeping doll . " You lookin ' for somebody , daddy ? " she said , and stepped so close to him that she touched him , with her head tipped back as if there was something caught in her eye  --  something that he , with the corner of his hanky , would have to remove . " I am interviewing housekeepers , " he said . God knows why , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer looked cold in her red mouth . " You 're doin ' what , daddy ? " she said , and pressed so close to him that he could see the pores in her nose . They had always been large . Yes , he remembered that . " I 'm not so good at keeping house , daddy , " she said , " but there 's other things I can tend to , " and she took his coat by the lapels , drew him down toward her lips . He was unable to move , or top182speak , and when he saw her tongue wagging in her mouth , like a piece of live bait , he closed his eyes and put one hand to his face . At the front of the lobby someone rattled the dice , and he saw , as if cupped in his hand , the face of the girl behind the cigar counter at the Wellington . She had rocked the leather cup and said : " Come have a game on me . " You sick , daddy ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , I 'm all right , " and opened his eyes and looked at this strange missing woman , his wife.  |p185AFTER  putting his wife to bed , Will Brady came downstairs and took a seat in the lobby , facinga railroad poster of a palm-fringed island in a soft blue sea . A glass-bottomed boat , with many bright flags flying , the deck crowded with happy men and women , sailed from a white pier  --  so it seemed to Will Brady  --  toward happiness . The island of waving palms seemed to float in the blue  --  the pale blue of the sky , the deep blue of the sea  --  and to be nothing more than what men were inclined to call a mirage . But the name of this place was Catalina , and it was said to be real . It could be found , like the town of Omaha , on a map somewhere . And according to the message on the poster , this island was just two days away  --  just two days and three nights from where he sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in it at the same time . In Will Brady 's mind what the girl needed , what this strange woman , his wife , needed , was what he had often heard described as a change . It was linked in his mind with white Palm Beach suits , the shoes that Lyman Bryce wanted him to wear , gay beach umbrellas , and a wide view of the sea . Off there , if anywhere , the grease and paint would wash from the girl 's stained face , her dyed hair would grow dark , and in time he would recognize her . And in the meantime he would go through a change himself  --  hardto say in advance just what it would be  --  but they would both begin , as he had read in books , their life over again . So he let it be known that Will Brady and his wife would be away several weeks . That seemed to be the time that it took to effect a real change . Then he stepped up and ordered , from the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a passage to that island advertised on the poster  --  if there was such a place . But two long days and three nights on a train can seem quite a while . He had n't seen this girl , his wife , for some time , but after one good meal in the diner it seemed that he had run out of things to talk about . There was a good deal to see out the wide diner windows , and a good deal to eat , sittingp187there , but when you run out of talk the long days seem to drag . Fast as they were traveling , even the view was slow to change . Was it twelve or fourteen telephone poles to the mile ? Watching the poles file past like wickets , he thought of that . The red and white road markers were faded now , and the bleak frame houses , like bumps on the land , looked as lonely and forgotten as an abandoned caboose . It reminded him of something . He had traveled west with this woman before . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the winter wheat in the shimmering fields was new , and the girl and the boy , there in the seat beside him , were new as well . In a certain way , he must have been fairly new himself . A second-hand label might have looked strange on any of them . But now that new coat of paint was gone , the white band on the poles had faded , and he did n't have to look at himself to know other things had faded as well . Nor did he have to be told that the town down the tracks would be Calloway , a whistle stop now . He saw the fine City Hall was like a birthday cake without the frosting , and a strip of tattered flag was flapping from the stilts on the water tank . The word DOMINOES had been painted on the window of the Merchant 's Hotel . Down the spur of weedy track he saw the lumber mill , with a few weathered boards in the yard , and beyond itp188the frame house with the clapboards peeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaking flight of stairs on the east side . Now they were gone , the lantern was gone , but the rustcoloredscar , like a gash , was there , with the tattered , blowing strips of a Hagenbeck &; Wallace circus poster . The mouth of the rhinoceros , like a great hole in the wall , was still there . The good will prevail , Anna Mason had said , but sometimes a man was led to wonder . Was it possible that a man died just to be dead ? The answer was no  --  if you had to answer a question like that . Will Brady 's father had died , his mother had died , and around five thousand leghorn chickens had died , but certainly not for nothing . No , they died to give him a piece of advice . What was it ? Well , it seemed to have faded a bit as well . Something or other about how , in the long run , the good would prevail . Had n't he , for example , found his wife ? After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as new ? If he sometimes lay awake at night just to look at her face while she was sleeping , it was merely because she looked more like her old self that way . During the day he found it better not to look at her . He did n't know the face . The woman he saw looked like somebody else . For a while it did him good to see her eat  --  thep189rest and the food would do her good , he thought  --  but watching her eat , his own appetite began to fall off . He stopped eating . He settled for a cup of coffee now and then . As this meant there was food left on his plate , she would reach for the toast he did n't eat at breakfast , dip it into his egg , and then finish off his marmalade . She poured his cream into her own coffee , asked for more of it . In the last swallow or two of her coffee she liked to dip the lump sugar , suck out the coffee , then leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between meals she ordered sandwiches from the porter , and if the train stopped at a station she would lean out the window to buy candy bars and fruit . She could n't seem to eat enough , sleep enough , or even see enough out the wide windows , as if every moment that passed might be her last . In the evening he read to her from some movie magazine . In the window that he faced he could see her tongue coming and going as she washed her teeth , explored her gums , or found bits of food in her mouth that she had stored away . There were little pads of fat , like sideburns , in her puffy cheeks . Stage make-up had coarsened her skin and there was a deep-blue stain , like a bruise , that would not wash out from beneath her eyes . It was part of her face , like the distracted baby-roll of her eyes . She used the white tongue to pick her teeth , and everyp190now and then , facing the window , she would stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night she slept with her mouth open , which was normal enough in some ways , except for the change that it brought to her face . Her body , all of this time , remained the same . There seemed to be no connection between this body and the face . This may have been why she could eat all day long and half the night , feeding her face , without her body showing any signs of it . The face had gone off , was going off , that is , somewhere on its own . But the body was faithful  --  put it like that . The body was faithful even though the face seemed to find the world too complicated , the going too rough , and the living too sick at heart . From the Biltmore Hotel , in Los Angeles , in the big red cars chartered for that purpose , they rode down to the sea where there were piers , crowds of people , and amusement parks . Facing the sea there were benches , and seated in the sun , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidebookto her . He kept himself posted in order to point out the interesting things . From a glassbottomedboat they peered into the sea at schools of fish , drifting like birds , and in the evening they would sit on a terrace somewhere , watching young people dance . Now , however , no young man camep191forward and spoke to her . It seemed to be clear that the woman at his side was not his child . Out on the dark sea were the lights of boats , pleasure craft as some people called them , and across the water , sparkling like stars , were the lights of the shore . Very much as if the sky  --  or the world they were now in  --  was upside down . Which was not at all strange as that was how this world really was . There were people who told him that the City of Angels was an unreal city , a glittering mirage , and that the people were as strange , as rootless , and as false as the city itself . That the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured in the movie houses , and that one fine day , like the movie itself , it would disappear . Will Brady could n't tell you whether that talk was true or not . But he could tell you that part of the description was real enough . This unreal city , this mammoth production full of strange , wacky people like himself , was an accurate description of a place Will Brady recognized . Here , bigger than life , was Paradiseon the American Plan . A hotel lobby , that is , as big as the great out-of-doors . Every morning they rode off to look at somethingdescribed in the guidebook or pictured on the cards , or they sat in the lobby , where other people came to look at them . Or they rode out in buses to watch the great lover , John Gilbert , makep192love . They saw him kneel , one knee on the floor , and make love to the woman whose eyes looked bruised and whose armpits were sore where she had just been shaved . In the sun a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cardboard sea great towers fell , and men leaped from the windows of burning buildings to fall into nets held aloft on wooden spears . Half-naked women , in skirts of straw , lay about on a floor sprinkled with sand , their bodies wet from the heat of great smokinglamps . Thick custard pies , suspended on wires , made their way around corners , and curved around poles to catch the man  --  the villain , that is  --  full in the face . Beyond , the mountains rose up to be seen from the valley , and the valley dropped down to be seen from the mountains , and so that nothing might remain unseen the dry air was clear . And one went to bed , in this unreal world , but not to sleep . The eyes were closed , it seemed , the better to look at onself . All that Will Brady saw he kept to himself , perhapslacking the words for it , but what the girl saw when her eyes were closed kept her awake . Lying there in the dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once it had been men that troubled her sleep , but now it was herself . During the day he sometimes wondered if she saw anything very clearly ,  |p193but  during the night she seemed to have eyes like a cat . She saw everything . Even stranger , she had the words for it . There was a Mr. Pulaski  --  or so she said  --  who took her for long buggy rides in the country , where he would fish , with a pole , while she played at rowing the boat . In the afternoon he took naps , lying with the newspaper over his face , and she ate chocolates and shooed the flies off his big hands . They were red on the back , with knobby knuckles , and the nails of one hand were blue from how he had worked in Poland , the old country . He napped with his hands lying at his side , like a dead man . He was good with horses , and they would run without his whipping them . Every week he gave her a five-dollar bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , " but that was n't what she wanted to do . He kept giving her money for something she did n't want to sell . He was very nice , but she stopped seeing him . There was a Hazel Roebuck , who was head cashier at the Moon . Hazel Roebuck knew in advancewhen Wallace Reid or Francis X. Bushman was coming , and she would give her tickets for the mezzanine seats free . Hazel Roebuck had a nice room at the Paxton Hotel and she liked to have help while trying her clothes on , taking a bath , or doing any number of things . There was n't anything thatp194she liked to do alone . She liked to let down her long hair and let someone do it up , or leave it long and try on broad-brimmed summer hats . She showed her what ice would do to the nipples of her breasts . Hazel Roebuck did not give her money , but she left her with the feeling that what she got , she got for nothing , so to speak . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . There was a Mr. Marshall , who was head floorwalkerfor Burgess &; Nash . He wore expensive clothes like an actor , a paper flower on his coat , and , under his vest , buttons that held his shirt pulled down . As he was the last man out of the building , they could use the ladies ' lounge , or the men 's dressing-room on the second floor . He would sit on a chair and patiently watch her take off her clothes . He liked her to undress so that all of her clothes fell in a puddle at her feet , except her black stockings , which he liked her to leave on . Then he would give her all new clothes to put back on . He never once put his hand on her , said anything nasty , or giggled , and everything that she could wear out of the store she could have . In the winter that was quite a bit . He was very shy , and the first man ever to call her Miss Long . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had all of the clothes she could wear , summer and winter , she had stopped seeing him.  |p195Did  she like him ? he had asked . He had interruptedher to ask her that . Like him ? she had said . Oh , she had liked him all right . Did she feel any love for him  --  that was what he meant to say . No , she had replied , she had n't felt anything like that . It was Francis X. Bushman who had awakened her to love . When she recognized it for what it was she sat in the movies eight hours every day , loving him and hating the women that he kissed . That was love . A woman only felt like that just once . What about  --  he said  --  what about himself ? Whatever it was , she said , it was not love at first sight . Maybe it was not what she would call love at all . She might not have even looked at him if it had n't been for the way he looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with himself . He just sat there in the lobby . Or he got up and went for long walks . All the other men she had ever known were able to talk , to smoke , or do something , but he just sat there without doing anything . He had money , wavy brown hair , and strong white teeth like Mr. Pulaski , but the first time she saw him she simply did n't feel anything . The second time maybe she felt sorry for him . Then one day , God knows why , she saw what was wrong . Shep196saw that Will Brady knew how to give , like Mr. Marshall and Mr. Pulaski , but what he did n't know was how to receive anything . Maybe what she felt was love the day that she saw that . Maybe she really loved him , that is , the day that she saw that he was hopeless  --  or maybe what she felt was something else . Getting back  --  he said  --  getting back to other men besides himself , just what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . The other men in her life . What did she feel for the other men in her life ? Sorry , she said , she felt sorry for them . Just what did she mean by that , he said , what did she mean by feeling sorry ? They were moths , she said , that flew away from the flame . And where , he had asked her , where in the world had she picked up that ? It was a line in one of her plays , she said . In this play she would climb out of the bed , or if she was out she would climb in it , and the man in the bed or the room would run away . She would call to him that he was a moth afraid of the flame . Everybodywould laugh . Why did they laugh ? It was the way of men to laugh , he said . That was their way.  |p197Was  he different , then , she said , from other men ? Was he ? Did she mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will Brady , had not run away from the flame ? Did she mean that all the other men had got out of the bed or hid beneath it , or did she mean that all the other men were part of the play ? She liked this play ? he asked . She liked the view from the stage . The what ? he said . She liked the view . From the stage she had a good view of all of them . Them  --  ? he said . The men , she said . It was like a new show for her every night . They came to see her , they paid their good money , but the light from the stage was on their faces and she did n't have to pay a cent to see all of them . And they did n't care  --  they all wanted her to look at them . So she made it a point , lying there in the bed , to look at each man in every row , and if the town was big and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her two or three weeks to see all of them . If the show had a long run , as it often did in the larger places , sooner or later she saw most of the men in town . Five or ten thousand men , some of them single , some of them married with wives and children , some of them rich , some of them poor , some of them good and some of them bad , but every living one of them there to bep198seen , and to look at her . She knew them all , and all of them knew her . But they were all moths , she said , that flew away from the flame . It made him smile , lying there , to hear her talking in terms like that , and to think that of all these men she had picked him out to be burned . When she had held the flame up to him , he had n't run . Some people would say that he had n't even sense enough to do that . But he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she thought he was such a fool as to believe the only men in her life had been under her bed . No , he did n't ask her . He did n't even bring it up . The longer he lived the easier he could believe wild talk like that . He did n't find it hard to believe at night , and it did n't strike him as silly in the morning when he took a seat , with the other old men , on a bench in the park . In the unreal world , talk like that seemed real enough . On the one hand you would say that the old men in the park had either lost or given up something , like the ratty-tailed pigeons that paced up and down on the walk . They had given up the notion of being some fancier kind of bird . They were no longer ashamed to let their feathers drag on the walk . On the one hand you could see they had given it up , on the other hand there was a manp199called Teapot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he picked it up ? Every morning , like the sun itself , he entered the park . To the casual passer-by it might appear that this fellow Teapot had some kind of trouble , bodily trouble , that forced him to walk along with one hand on his hip , the other raised in the air . But those who knew better knew that this fellow Teapot had become a new thing . No longer merely a man , he was a Teapot . He was meant to be poured . " Brother , pour me ! " Teapot would say , and the brother would take Teapot by the arm , as you would kettle , and tip him forward till he poured . Whatever Teapot contained would flow out the long spout of his arm . " Thank you , brother , " he would say , and proceed across the square . Later in the day , several times , he would need to be poured again . Now , there were people who would class Teapot as odd , or even downright wacky , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put it this way : he felt right at home with them . Every day Will Brady saw , on the bench near the fountain , an old man with brown bare feet , his soiled pants legs rolled , and three or four wiry hairs , like watch springs , on his flat , leathery chest . He passed most of the day with a newspaper spread over his face . Morning and evening he fed thep200pigeons , wetting the hard dry bread in his mouth , rolling it into a ball , then feeding this spittle to the birds . Some of the old men in the park sat and wagged their heads over something like that . But not Will Brady . No , he felt very much at home . Was there any man , Will Brady asked himself , who did n't understand something like that ? Who would n't like , that is , to be fed to the birds himself ? Well , there were several men who said the old fool with the bare feet had a brain that was soft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to him . The old man 's hands , lying in his lap , had got to be the color of walnut stain , and if he napped sitting up , the pigeons roosted on his shoulders , dirtied his front . It soon dried in the sun and he chipped it off later , absently . The way Will Brady would chip the hen spots off a Leghorn egg . In one pocket of his coat the old man kept reading matter , in another pocket eating matter , and every hour or so he got himself up and took a long drink . He would peer through the palm trees at the clock to see how much time he had passed . Was this an example of what the sun would do to a man ? Perhaps it was , as Will Brady passed the time that way himself . The great problem in life , as any old fool could tell you , was not so much about love , or the man and the flame , nor did it have much to do , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , the real problem was nothing more than how to pass the time . Every day it was there , somehow it had to be passed . The really great problem in life was merely how to get out of the bed in the morning and put in the time until you went to bed again . The girl solved this problemby lying awake at night , having breakfast in bed , and trying to sleep during the day . Will Brady got up and sat on a bench in the park . In the early evening the girl would get up and they would go out some place for dinner , but one evening , after his walk , she was not there . Neither in the lobby nor up in the room . That usually meant she would be in the ladies ' room , and he took a seat near by in the lobby , across from a tall flat girl who stood in the door chewing gum . This girl seemed to take an interest in him . On the seat beside him was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Will Brady could n't keep his mind on what he read . The girl in the door kept staring and smacking the gum . So he put the magazine back on the seat , took time to look at his watch , but when he walked across the lobby the girl followed him . Before he could make a getaway she said : " You lookin ' for somebody , daddy ? " " I am waiting for my wife , " he replied . " Adds up to the same thing , " she said , and whenp202he looked at her face she smacked the gum she was chewing , sucked in on it . " You got a nice long wait , " she said , and when he did n't answer that , she added : " I 'd just as soon sit down , daddy , " and then she pushed through the swinging door and walked into the street . IIe followed her . She was wearing the kind of clothes that the girl liked to wear . A shabby fox fur hung from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassy eyes , bounced on her hip . He walked behind her to the corner , where she turned and said : " This be all right , daddy ? " and nodded her head toward the corner drugstore . As they went in she called to the waitress : " Make it a double chock-Coke , honey , " and as they sat down at the back she took her gum from her mouth , stuck it to the seat . " You have seen my wife ? " Will Brady said . " Not any too good , " she said , " she was on the floor , and it was hard to see her . " He stared at her , and she said : " Daddy , you want me to begin at the first ? " " Why , yes , " he said , and felt his head nodding . When the girl brought the Coke he asked her for a cup of coffee , black . " First you get a bottle , daddy , " she said , " then you lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty the bottle , and then after while you fall offp203the seat . When you fall off the seat I come along and pick you up . " " Thank you , " he said , " very much . " " Oh , I 'm paid for it , " she said , and tapped a cigarette on her thumbnail . " I 'm paid , " , she said , " but God knows I 've done it for nothin ' enough . " She lit the cigarette and blew the smoke in his face . " She 's all right , then ? " " Daddy , " she said , and closed her eyes . With her eyes closed she let the smoke drift through her nose . " Daddy , " she went on , " a nice man like you makes a bad girl like me feel better . You owe it to a girl  --  where 'd she pick you up ? " " Miss  --  " Will Brady began . " Clinton , " she said , " Flora Clinton . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen my wife  --  " " You a Mr. Metaxas ? " " Brady , " he said , " Will Brady . " " Next time you pick up a little girl , " she said , " say you look in her handbag and see who she is . Say you find out whether you 're a Mr. Metaxas or not . " He looked at her , and she said : " Well , daddy , you asked for it . " He turned from Flora Clinton and looked at the Palms in Pershing Square . The old man with bare feet was feeding the pigeons from a paper bag . Hep204wet the food in his mouth , then spit it out and fed it to them . The flapping of their wings stirred the stringy hair at the back of his head . " You mind a personal question ? " " No , " he said , and wagged his head slowly . " Where 'd she ever find you ? " " Omaha . " " Where is that ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying that , he saw it there before him , a town on the bluffs . He saw the muddy river and the new toll bridge they had put over it . " That must be a great place , " she said , " Omaha , I 'll remember that , " and took from her purse a small card , wrote a number on it . She handed it to him and said : " Next time you feel like a little girl , daddy  --  " " This woman is my wife , " he said . " That makes it even worse , daddy , " she said , and finished her Coke . There was ice in the glass , and she tipped her head back till it spilled into her mouth . Then she patted his arm and said : " I 've got to run along now , daddy , " and stood up from the table , smoothed the wrinkled front of her dress . " You say this kid was your wife ? " she said . " This woman is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get it , " Flora Clinton said , " I do n't see why she did n't talk . " She looked at her face in thep205mirror , then said : " When people do n't talk they think they 're in love . Maybe she was so drunk she thought that she was . " That made her smile , suckingin the air from the side of her mouth , where a tooth was missing . " Well , bye now , daddy , " she said , and he watched her walk away . From the corner , where he stood at the curb , Will Brady watched the old fool who was feeding the pigeons , and saw on his face the rapt gaze of a holy man . A circling flock of pigeons hovered above him , flapping their wings . On the old man 's face was the look that Will Brady had seen , many years before , on one of the calendars at the foot of his mother 's bed . A religious man , it was said , whofed himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , it was a notion of the oldest kind . Very likely this old fool let himself think that in just such a manner he might fly himself , grow wings like an angel , and escape from the city and the world . As the spirit is said to escape from the body , when the body dies . Perhaps he thought that  --  or perhaps all he was doing was making love . There were many ways to make it , after all , and perhaps that was one of them . No voice had ever spoken to Will Brady before  --  or even whispered to him , for that matter  --  but now from out of the sky , above the noise of the pigeons , one spoke to him.  | " Old man , " this voice said , " so you think you are a lover ? " Did Will Brady smile ? No , he kept a sober face . " Speaking of heaven , " the voice went on , though of course they had not been speaking of heaven , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you know that ? " " No lovers in heaven ? " Will Brady replied , but the voice did not answer . Will Brady thought he heard it sigh , but it might have been the wind . " Then why go to heaven ? " Will Brady said . " I do n't know , " said the voice , " I 've often wondered . " Then it added : " But I suppose the small lovers like it . They like it up here . " " And the great lovers ? " Will Brady said . " There 's no need , " said the voice , " for great lovers in heaven . Pity is the great lover , and the great lovers are all on earth . " That was all , that was all that was said , but somehowWill Brady was left with the feeling that this creature in heaven , somehow , envied every old fool on earth . That something was missing in heaven , oddly enough . As it had never occurred to Will Brady that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pigeons wheeling over the park . They were rising , and filled the sky with the sound of their wings . On Will Brady 's face , strangely enough , was the rapt , happy gaze of ap207holy man , like the old fool who stood barefooted in the park . Together they watched the pigeons wheeling until they were gone , the sky was void , and the old man suddenly threw into the air his flabby brown arms . Over his head , for a moment , floated the empty paper bag.  |p211I  I E HAD asked the porter to wake him out of Cheyenne . That was not necessary , however , as he was wide awake , his eyes were open , when the porter rattled the curtains of his berth . With his pajama sleeve he wiped a small hole in the frosted glass . A new fall of snow , like a frozen sea , covered the earth . In the spring and the fall , through the wide diner windows , a man who had felt hemmed in by the city , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , might find relief in the vast emptiness of the plains . He might feel what some men felt when they came on the sea . In the winter , however , there was no haze to soften the sky , blur the far horizon , or lead a man to think that he might , out there , make a go of it . Everythingvisible had the air of being left there , droppedp212perhaps . Every mound or post had the look of cattle frozen upright . Will Brady , for example , had seen such things as a boy . It was strange to find them , after so many years , still vivid in his mind . He could see the winter dawn , a clear ice color , and far out on the desolate plain , like the roof of the world , were two or three swinging lights . He could make out the dry bed of the river , and as the train was stopping for water , he could hear , down the tracks , the beat of the crossing-bell . The rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty corner , seemed to emphasize that this scene , the birthplace of Will Brady , was as remote , and as dead , as a crater on the moon . As the train slowly braked to a stop , he could see the frame of the cattle loader , and then , suddenly , the station along the tracks . A lamp , with a green glass shade , hung inside . It threw an arc of light on the wide desk , the pads of yellow paper , and the hand of the man who sat there , a visor shading his face . The fingers of this hand were poised over the telegraph key . His head was bare , getting bald , and the green celluloid of the visor cast a shadow the color of illness on his face . He was staring , absently , into the windows of the passing cars . On the table before him lay a bamboo rod , curved at one end like a plant flowering , and a sheet of folded paper was inserted at the curvedp213end . Will Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a calendar . Nothing moved , every detail was clear . He could smell the odor of stale tobacco , and the man 's coat , wet with snow , gave off the stench of a wet gunny sack . He could see the wood stove , just back from the light , and he thought he could hear , out there in the silence , the iron ring of the ground where a brakeman stamped his feet . In the man 's dark vest were several red-capped pencils , and as Will Brady gazed at his face he raised his head , suddenly , as if a voice had spoken to him . He gazed into the darkness where Will Brady lay on the berth . And Will Brady fell back , he held his breath , and as his hands gripped the side of the berth he heard again the mechanical throbbing of the crossing-bell . He seemed to see , out there on the horizon , the snout-like mound of the buried noddy , where he had been , even then , the last man in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light came though the window he drew the blind to keep it from his face . He did not rise on his elbowto look at Murdock , or Calloway . Nor did he get off at Omaha , although that was his destination , and the conductor came back through the car to speak to him . Where was he going ? Well , he had n't made up his mind . He was going where the train was going , and when that turned out to bep214Chicago , he implied that that was all right with him . All the roads seemed to lead to Chicago , so there was no reason why Will Brady , who followed the roads , should n't go where they led . To GET to Menomonee Street in Chicago you take a Clark Street car in the Loop and ride north , twenty minutes or so , to Lincoln Park . If you want to get the feel of the city , or if you like to see where it is you 're going , you can stand at the front of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Brady standing there . Not that he cared where he was going , but he liked the look of the street , the clang of the bell , and the smell of the track sand that came up through the floor . He liked to stand with his hands grasping the rail at the motorman 's back . At certain intersections he liked to turn and look  --  when the door at the front opened  --  down the streets to the east where the world seemed to end . It did n't , of course , but perhaps he liked to think that it might . When it did , as one day it would , he wanted to be there . On up the street he could see the park , and in the winter , when the trees were bare , he could make out thep215giant brooding figure of Abraham Lincoln himself . Soft green , like the color of cheap Christmas jewelry , or the fine copper gutters on the homes of the rich . Lincoln Park was right there where the street angled . He could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Brady would step forward and get off . Menomonee was the street that went off like an alley to the west . To get to 218 on this street he would follow the curb on the north side to where this number was nailed on the first door on his right . The second door was the entrance to Plinski 's delicatessen store . The first door was usuallykept shut , even in the summer , to make the rats from the store go around and use the stairs at the rear . But the second door was open until ten or later every night . There was a sign on the door saying as much , but anyone who lived in the room overhead , and who tried to sleep there , did n't need to be told . Will Brady lived in the room at the front , over the screen door that slammed with a bang , in a room that was said to be suitable for Light Housekeeping . To get to this room he walked up the stairs , along the bright-green runner of roach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the door on his left . It opened on a small room with two windowson Menomonee Street . The window on thep216left was cut off by the bed , but over the years and through many tenants one window on the street had proved to be more than enough . On a winter afternoon it might even be warm , as the slanting winter sun got at it , and by leaning far out one could look down the street and see the park . An ore boat might be honking , or the sounds of the ice breaking up on the lake . Inside the room was a small gas plate on a marbletoppedwashstand , a cracked china bowl , a table , two chairs , a chest of drawers , an armless rocker , an imitation fireplace , and an iron frame bed . Over the fireplace was a mirror showing the head of the bed and the yellow folding doors . The bed was in the shape of a shallow pan with a pouring spout at one side , and beneath this spout , as if poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from the stove to the sink it was better to drop the leaf on the table and then lean forward over the back of the rocking-chair . On the shelf over the sink were four plates , three cups and one saucer , a glass sugarbowl , two metal forks , and one bone-handled spoon . On the mantlepiece was a shaving mug with the word SWEETHEART in silver , blue , chipped red , and gold . In the mug were three buttons , a roller-skate key , a needle with a burned point for opening pimples , an Omaha street-car token , and a medal for buying Buster Brown shoes.  |p217At  the back of the room were the folding doors that would not quite close . To get to the bathroom , the old man who lived in this room would open these doors , greet Mrs. Plinski , then proceed to the back of the house . Mrs. Plinski was usually there in a rocker , nursing her twins . In the bathroom , seated on the stool , was her oldest boy , Manny Plinski , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny Plinski was seventeen years old and had the long narrow face of a goat , big wet eyes , and a crown of silky , cornyellowhair . This hair grew forward over his face and he stroked it forward , with a raking motion , as if there was something tangled in it that would not comb out . When he was displeased , Manny Plinski would make a sound like priming a pump . Mrs. Plinski would put down the twin she was nursing and wet her fingers under the tap , then sprinkle Manny Plinski as if she was dampening clothes . That would make him all right , and he would just sit there , staring at his turtles , or he could be led out in case you wanted the bathroom to yourself . That was n't very often , as the old man had got to be fond of the turtles , nor did he seem to mind Manny Plinski just sitting there . He would wink at the boy while the lather was thick on his face . Manny Plinski never laughed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtles , one that he liked ,  |p218and  slip it into the pocket of the old man 's pants . The old man , somehow , never seemed to catch on to this . Later , of course , he would find it there and cry out for help . For a man so fond of turtles it was strange how they nearly scared him to death . Leaving the bathroom , he would come back through the house , nod to Mrs. Plinski , then pass through the folding doors without closing them . He would let them stand open , as if his room was part of the house . He could see out , or any Plinski that cared to could see in . If a turtle was missing , this would be Manny Plinski , raking his hair in an excited manner ; otherwise it might be Mrs. Plinski herself . What did she want ? Well , the old man in the room had spoken to her . He had called out , perhaps , to ask if she had ever heard the likes of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a letter spread out in his lap . So she would get herselfup , this woman , in spite of the twin she was nursing , and brace herself , as she often seemed tired , between the folding doors . One heavy arm she would prop on the door , as if it weighed on her . The old man himself , seated at the table , would have the long sleeves of his underwear rolled , as otherwise they dragged in the food on his plate . He would be eating ; that is , he had been eating , but he had stopped eating in order to examine , as the writing was fading , the letter in his lap . Two sheetsp219of yellow paper , each sheet with widely spaced green stripes . The top sheet spotted with grease like a popcorn bag . The old man had spread the letter in his lap as his own fingers might be greasy , or in order to open , with the bent prong of a fork , the plugged hole in a milk can . The letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there were coffee stains in the margins , but it described in considerable detail an unusual event . How a snake , taken sick at the stomach , threw up a live frog . It described how the boy , the writer of the letter , picked this snake up by the tail , twirled him like a rope , and then watched him whoop up this poor frog . Not many city people would be familiar with anything like that . Mrs. Sigismund Plinski , for example , who had lived for forty-six years in Chicago , had heard the letter many times but could n't seem to get enough of it . She would just stand there , wagging her head , as she did when the world was too much for her , and listen to the old man read parts of it aloud . Sometimeshe just read the last of it , which he thought was particularly clever , and then went on to read how the boy had signed his name . Your son  --  Willy Brady Jr. that was what it said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , put-219p220ting the milk can down on the table , " that a boy who could write a letter like that would write a little oftener . " Not that he meant it , of course , as a smart boy like that had things on his mind . It was enough for him to know that his father was sometimesone of them . " Oh , how he must love you ! " Mrs. Plinski would say . " Oh , how he must love you ! " and that would be all . In some respects that was about all that she ever said . Then she would wag her big head , with the loose flesh on it , and roll the little eyes that were too small for her face . " Oh , how he must love you ! " she would go on , and before ' Will Brady went on with the letter , or read the passage over , he would blow on the coffee that was already cold in his cup . It was never hot , but it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plinski , " he would say , " now you know how boys are , " and indeed Mrs. Plinski did . Both men and boys . If she knew anything , that is , this woman knew that . " How he must love you ! " she would repeat , and shift her great weight as her feet were tired , and whichever twin it was , astride her haunch like a saddle , would be asleep . Once a year this boy wrote to his father , and maybe ten or fifteen times a year Will Bradyp221wrote , but somehow never mailed , a postcard to his son . It would have a picture of the park or the wide blue lake on it . But every month Will Brady expected to move into larger , more homelike quarters , and when he moved  --  the very day that he moved  --  he would mail that card . It was there in his pocket , already stamped and addressed . All he had to do was put his own new address on it . This addresswould be  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be trees and grass when the boy walked to the window and looked out . There would always be a cool summer breeze blowing off the blue lake . Every year he had to write this card many times as the writing would get smudgy from the dirt in his pocket , or even the picture on the front of the card would begin to fade . So he would buy a new one , in the hotel lobby , and seated at the table where the pens were chained , he would write on the back in such a manner that it also showed on the front . It had got so the message was more or less the same . It was always spring on this card , the same robin always caught the same worm . DEAR SONHavemoved . Have nice little place of our own now , two-plate gas . Warm sun in windowsevery morning , nice view of park . Plan to get new Console radio soon now , let youp222pick it out . Plan to pick up car so we can drive out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind plan to send you to Harvard , send you to Yale . Saw robin in park this morning . Saw him catch worm . Sometimes he said radio , sometimes he said coupe , every now and then he put Princeton instead of Yale , but he always held out for a place of their own , a nice view of the park . He always insisted that the robin caught the worm . Perhaps that was why , after three years , he was still in the room over the delicatessen , and why that postcard with the view of the park had not been mailed . It might be wrong to say that Will Brady , an old man in yellow underwear with the sleeves rolled , lived in this room any more than he lived anywhere else . He slept there , or tried to sleep there , and that was enough . It gave him certain habits that he found very hard to break . All during the day the screen door slammed , strange children ran in and out of the hallway , and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in one spot . Will Brady would lie there , listening to the strange cry that he made . He could hear the snails scooped out of the tub , hear the man put his hand in the striped popcorn bags , and then hear the shells when the little boys stepped on them with their heels . Ap223powdered sound , like the track sand , but without the fresh flinty smell . The room in which he lay had folding doors that would not quite close . The boy named Manny Plinski often stood there peering in . He was said to be a mute , that is to say that he could n't speak in the usual manner , nor understand very much , nor do very well at the other boys ' games . But the old man in the bed seemed to understand him pretty well . They had found there was very little that needed talking about . Once a week , in the good weather , the old man and the yellow-haired boy might be seen in the zoo , facing one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looked and sounded like Manny Plinski himself . If there was a difference it was not in the feathers , nor in the cage . The man who came to feed them never stopped to sprinkle water on them . In Will Brady 's room was an iron bed , several chairs , and what a man might need to do a little housekeeping , but these things were not , strictly speaking , inhabitants . Like Brady himself , they might easily be taken away . One morning Mrs. Plinski might peer in and find them gone . But while the room was there , there would always be the smell . It was there in the floor , in the plastered walls , in the draft that stirred but never departed , in the idle curtains , and in whatever clothes hungp224on the back of the door . Day in and day out , winter and summer , this smell was there . A stranger might refer to this smell as a stink , as some of the lodgers were loose in their habits , and another might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee grounds . But only Will Brady knew this smell for what it was . It was the smell of man . And there was something that he liked about it . This smell was in the lining of the brown coat that both the sun and sweat had faded , and everything in the pockets , old or new , had picked up the scent . The money in the wallet , and the letter even before it was read . Once opened , and read , the letter might be said to be full of it . The message might fade , but with every reading the smell increased . " Just listen to this , " Will Brady would say to Bessie Muller , the waitress at the Athens , and read her that part about the boy and the frog-sick snake . She was a farm girl herself , but she had never seen a snake carry on like that . Or get sick at his tummy just like she did . " You would think he liked his father , " Will Brady would say , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Bessie Muller would agree to that , naturally . She would even point out that nobody  --  nobody  --  waswriting letters to her . " That kid sure likes his daddy , " she would say ,  |p225and  take one of the bobby pins from her hair , clean her nails with it , and then bend the point between her chipped front teeth . If the night was warm Will Brady would walk past the moss-green statue of Abraham Lincoln , then on across the tennis courts with their sagging nets and the blurred chalk lines . There would be men with their shoes off padding around in the grass . There might be women with white arms in the shadows , fussing with their hair . Under the sheets of newspaper , with what was left of the food , some child would lie asleep . If there was a moon , or a cool breeze off the lake , Will Brady would walk through the park to the water , where he would stroll along the pilings , or under the trees on the cinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to remember , somewhere before . As he had in the past , he would have to sit down and tap them out of his shoes . In the dusk there would be lights on the Wrigley tower , an airplane beacon would sweep the sky , and at Oak Street beach people would be lying in the warm sand . The drinking fountain would give off a strong chlorine smell . He would wet his face at the fountain , then take his seat among those people who had come to the beach but did n't care to take off their clothes ; who had been hot in their rooms ,  |p226and  perhaps lonely in their minds . In the dark they could speak what they had on their minds without troubling about their faces , the sound of their voices , or who their neighbor was . Will Brady was their neighbor . He sat with his coat folded in his lap , his shirtsleeves rolled . All over the wide beach he could see the white legs of the men , the white arms of the women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matches would flare , cigarettes would glow like fireflies . He could hear someone wading , and see the water foam at their feet . When the excursion boat left the North Pier there would be a lull in the beach murmur , and men would rise on their elbows , as if awakened , to watch it go by . They would crane their necks as if they feared to miss something . The red and green boat lights would swing on the water , the music blow in , then out again , and later the long white wave would draw a line on the beach . And after the wave , if there was a breeze , the music again . " I see by the paper , " Will Brady would say , and smooth the sleeve of the coat he was holding , " that it was over a hundred in western Kansas to-day . " To whom was he talking ? Perhaps the murmuringair . It had come , one might say , from Kansasp227itself . Many things had . Perhaps the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's hot ! " this old man says , and rubs the balls of his eyes with his knuckles , as if he could see  --  could look back to Kansas and see for himself . He stares at the night , cranes his head , then makes a blowing noise and says : " Kansas  --  what part of Kansas you from ? " " I 'm from Nebraska , " Will Brady says , " I 'm a Nebraska boy myself "  --  though God only knows why he calls himself a boy . An old man more or less at the end of his run . " Born and bred in Nebraska , " he says , as if talk like that would revive him . " Got a boy out there now . He writes me that it 's pretty hot . " " You do n't say , " the old man replies , and wets his lips . It would probably turn out that he had a boy somewhere himself . Or if he did n't , that he was small-town boy himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from ? It might surprise you how many men are small-town boys at heart , and how many small towns it takes to make a big one . Make it go , that is . " The city 's no place for a boy , " Will Brady says , and gets to his feet as if that would end it . As if he did n't want to hear what the place for a boy was . " No , the city 's no place for a boy , " he would say ,  |p228and  then he would turn , look at the clock on the tower , and see that it was time for one old man to get back to work . Another day he might not walk in the park at all , or even stop in at the Athens to see Bessie Muller , but he would go down Clark Street to the Gold Coast Cafe . He would sit at the counter and order one of their chicken-fried steaks . " And how is your boy ? " Mildred Weigall would say as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted that he would always order a chickenfriedsteak . " Is he feeling his oats yet ? " she would say , as she liked to think that he probably was , for she was young and feeling her oats herself . " He 's the outdoor type , " Will Brady would reply , though it was hard to say what he meant by that . Did he mean that outdoor types did n't feel their oats ? Probably not . Hard to say what he meant . It just so happened that one day Will Brady had sat there , reading a letter , when a snapshot of the boy had dropped out of the letter onto his plate . Mildred Weigall had wanted to know , naturally , who in the world it was . " Just a snap of the boy , " Will Brady had said , and showed her that snapshot of the boy , without a stitch on , holding up one end of a canoe . But he was turned from the camera , so it did n't matter very much.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mildred Weigall had said . " Why do n't you bring him around ? " " You think I 'd try an ' raise a boy like that back here ? " Will Brady had said , and waved his hand , with the letter he was holding , toward the street . It had been snowing that day , and the street was full of slush . " Not on your tintype , " he had said ; " kid 's out in the country where he belongs . " " He 's a nice-lookin ' kid , " Mildred Weigall had said , " he 's got nice legs . " " Got his father 's brains , " Will Brady had replied , " and his mother 's looks . " That was pretty good . Somehow , it was always good for a laugh . " Thought I might bring him back , " he had said , " just to show him what this place is like . But he would n't like it . He likes nature . Just take a look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frog and the snake . Like Mrs. Plinski , Mildred Weigall could n't seem to get enough of it . " He 's a nice-lookin ' kid , " she had said . " when he comes , you bring him around . " On the left side of Clark Street , near Division , he passed a small movie house . Sometimes , just in idling by , he would see through the lobby doors , through the darkness behind , to the glowing silver screen . As if there was a crack in his world and hep230could see into another one . For a moment he might see , as if in a dream , men leaping from trains , trains leaping from bridges , lovers embracing , or the flash of guns in a battle scene . Or he might hear a song  --  hear it , that is , from the lover 's lips . One night he had stopped , turning like a man who had been softly tapped on the shoulder , to hear the love song that came through the crack in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover was singing it . This was something new , and , an old lover himself , he surrendered to it . He became a young man more or less without clothes , his strong tanned legs washed by South Sea water , and with the sunset behind him he sang this love song to his mate . " Come with me , " the pagan lover would sing , and Will Brady would , he came gladly , transporting himself to the land of White Shadows , to the land of true love . There he stood ankle-deep in the warm green water , sometimesspearing fish , sometimes singing love songs , and sometimes , on the palm-fringed islands , making pagan love . What kind of love was it ? The doors usually closed before he found out . He might have bought a ticket , but perhaps he did n't want to know . It was enough for him to know that the young lover was there , still doing what he could . Sometimes , standing there in the street , Will Brady felt that perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man this side of heaven , hadp231not closed his eyes . So he stood there , a dead man in most ways , but with his eyes looking out . Eyes that seemed to look backwards and forwards at the same time . An old sorter of waybills and a pagan lover at the same time . Was he  --  or was that just a way of putting things ? Perhaps he was in his mind , the one place that was more or less his own . For instance , just a block or so up the street was a library , with a desk near the door , and a friendly gray-haired woman sat there in charge of things . He had walked up to this woman and said : " What I have in mind is something on education , something on leading colleges , institutes of learning  --  " " You have something in mind ? " she replied . " I have a boy , " he said . " Well now , " she said , " that makes it interesting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , to show her he had thought quite a little about it , " is in the West , but the place to educate him is in the East . " Now , that was sharp . He had read that in a book that she had given him . " Boy is also quite a writer for his age , " he told her ; " think he might become a writer of books himself . " " In that case , " she had said , " he will need the very best this country affords , " and that statement had come to mean a good deal to him . He had never really thought about it before , in just that way.  | " That 's just what I figure , " he had said . " Right now I 'm thinking of Harvard , thinking of Yale . Boy has a mind of his own , but I guess his father can think of these things . " " Yes , indeedy , " this woman had said , which was a favorite expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get back to work . He went without dessert at the Gold Coast Cafe in order to stop for a bite at Thompson 's , where the coffee was good and there was a wider range of pie . The chimes would ring when he pulled his check from the checking machine . Mrs. Beach , the cashier , would smile at him , and if she was not too busy counting change , she would swing her chair around so they could talk while he had a bite to eat . " And how is our boy ? " Mrs. Beach would say , as she was a mother with four boys of her own , so there was nothing you needed to tell her about boys . When a picture of the boy had stuck to one of his bills  --  he carried it in the wallet along with his money -- Mrs . Beach had insisted on knowing who this fine-looking boy was . Luckily , it was not the picture of the boy without his clothes . It was just his head , showing his mother 's wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will Brady would say , and to that Mrs. Beach always answered :  | " She must have been a very lovely girl  --  she certainly was that . " " Out of this world , " Will Brady would say , and turn to blow on his hot cup of coffee . He would sip it , then add : " Died no sooner than the boy was born . " " You do n't mean to say , " Mrs. Beach would reply , " that that boy of yours has never had a mother ? " " Just me and the kid , " Will Brady would say , and blow on his cup . " Why , I just think you 've done wonders , Mr. Brady , " and it was clear that Mrs. Beach did . She could n't imagine a boy without a mother like herself . " I just wish , " she would sometimes say , " that she could come back for just an hour , just be with us for an hour , to see what a wonderful father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to that , Will Brady would turn to his pie . It was hard for him to straighten out the many things he thought . Rather than get into all of that , which might require quite an explanation , he would go back to the counter for another cup of coffee , drink it standing up . There were things that a mother like Mrs. Beach might find it hard to understand.  |p234From  Thompson 's he went on down to Chicago , and some nights , there at the end of the street , he found the drawbridge rising on the sky , like a wall . The guard bell would be clanging , and the red lights blinking at the top of the span . In the bridge tower room , on warm summer nights , the man in the tower might lean out the window , the visor shadow on his face , and his shirtsleeves rolled on his thin white arms . He liked to spit in the street , and use a tenpenny nail to tamp down his pipe . If the span was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time in the evening Mrs. LaMonica would be cleaning up . On a sultry summernight she might be out in front , sitting there on a chair with her little girl Sophie , or in the back of the store cooking up tomorrow 's hamburgers . She left the front door open as the back of the store would get pretty hot . When he asked for coffee , Mr. LaMonica would say : " What the hell 'd we do without a hot cup of Java ? " and Will Brady , for the life of him , never seemed to knew . It seemed a simple question , but he never had an answer to it . Into his own cup of Java he would pour some of the cream from the milk can on the counter , a small can with two holes punched in the top , and the picture of a cow onp235the side . But Mrs. LaMonica , who had never seen a cow , liked her coffee black . " When you know what I know , " Mrs. LaMonica would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you know what I know , you drink your coffee black . " No doubt she knew a good deal , but it was never clear what she had against cows . She had never seen one . Perhaps that was it . But she had often lain awake at night and heard the moos they made going by in the trucks , and she smelled the empty trucks the next morning , on their way back . It was enough , anyhow , to make her drink her coffee black . " Maybe a new prideswinna ? " Mrs. LaMonica would say , and all because Will Brady , having nothing else to do , happened to mention that the boy had won a prize . " Oh , nothing much , " Will Brady had said , and showed Mrs. LaMonica the picture of the boy that had appeared in the Omaha Bee . The name was clear , but his face did n't come out very well . " Tech student writes prizewinning letter , " it read . " You would think , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizewinning letters would find the time to write a few more of them to his dad . " " They 're all of them no goddam good , " Mr.p236LaMonica said . He stopped frying hamburgers to say : " You start out all alone , and that 's how you end up . You live long enough and bygod you 're right back where you start up from . " " They 're a comfort at the breast , " Mrs. LaMonicasaid . " A lotta good that does a man , " Mr. LaMonica said , and slapped himself on the chest . " A hell of a lotta good ! " " A prideswinna is a comfort ! " she had said , and there was no use in arguing the matter . Mr. LaMonicahad tried . It was better to fry hamburgers . " Well , I better get to work , " Will Brady would say , " Or I 'll never get him to college . " " Oh , Mike ! " Mrs. LaMonica would say . " Collitch  --  youhear ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady would say , when Mr. LaMonica turned to admire him , " we would n't be here . No sir , we 'd be over on the Gold Coast . " " Now bygod you 're right , " Mr. LaMonica would say , and look to the east , where it was said to be . Will Brady would take a toothpick from the bowl and say : " If the kid 's going to do better than his dad , he 's going to need the best this country affords . He 's going to need the finest education money can buy . "  | " You hear that , Mike ? " Mrs. LaMonica would say , but before Mike would answer Will Brady would get up , drop his nickel on the counter , and walk out into the street . Talk like that always made him excited , and he would be out on the bridge , over the water , looking down at scum , wide and green as a meadow , before he knew where he was . But the sight of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool him down . Something about that smell was like a good whiff of salts , the way it cleared his mind . But like the salts , it left him a little wobbly , walking along with his head in the air , and he usually tripped as he crossed the tracks in the cinder-coveredyard . It would remind him to put away the letter , or the snapshot , that he still held in his hand . IF THE old man who sorted waybills in the freight yards felt himself more alive there than anywhere else , it had something to do with the tower room where he worked . On one side of the room was a large bay window that faced the east . A man standingat this window  --  like the man on the canal who let the drawbridge up and down  --  felt himself in charge of the flow of traffic , of the city itself . Allp238that he saw seemed to be in his province , under his control . He stood above the sprawling freight yards , the sluggish canal , the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look beyond all of these things , beyond the city itself , toward the lake . He could n't see this lake , of course , but he knew that it was there . And when the window stood open he thought he could detect the smell of it . Between Will Brady and this lake were thousands of people , what one might call a city in itself ; people lived there , that is , without the need of living anywhere else . They were born there , and sooner or later they died . Mrs. LaMonica had lived there for forty-eight years , hating all cows and loving pagan lovers , nor had she ever found it necessary to go anywhere else . It was only necessary to have the money and to pay the price . The bay window in the tower room was a frame around this picture . It hung there on the wall . The man in the room could stand there , at his leisure , and examine it . He would come to know , after a time , just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of the bridge , like a cloud , moved up and down the street . If he was more alive there than anywhere else  --  if he seemed to come to life when he faced this picture  --  it had something to do with the fact that he was cut offp239from it . Which was a very strange thing , since what the tower room made him feel was part of it . During the long day there were trains in the yard , and a great coming and going over the bridges ; whistles were blown , and the tower room trembled when a train went past . But at night this old man , Will Brady , was alone in it . When the drawbridge went up he was on an island , cut off from the shore . Without carrying things too far it might be said that this tower was the old man 's castle , that the canal was his moat , and that at night he defended it against the world . That is to say , that he felt himself the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that he was back  --  where he had started from . In the windows along the canal the blinds were usually drawn , and behind the blinds , when the lights came on , he could see the people in the rooms moving around . Nearly all of them ate at the back of the house , then moved to the front . There they would talk , or sit and play cards , or wander about from room to room until it was time , as the saying goes , to go to bed . Then the front lights would go off , other lights come on . A woman would stand facing the mirror , and a man , scratching himself , would sit on the edge of a sagging bed , holding one shoe . Peering into it as if his foot was still there . Or letting it fall so that it was heard in the room below.  |p240In  all of this there was nothing unusual  --  every night it happened everywhere  --  except that the people in these rooms were not alone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , was there with them . He had his meals with them in the back , wandered with all of them to the front , listened to the talk , and then saw by his watch what time it was . With them all he made his way through the house to bed . He sat there on the edge , looking at his feet or the hole in the rug . It seemed to Will Brady that he knew these people , that he had lived in these rooms behind the windows , and that he could walk about in the dark as if the house was his own . The life and habits of the house were not strange to him . No stranger , you might say , than that house down the tracks in Calloway , where a man named Schultz was said to have lived with a city girl . To have lost her , that was the gist of it . Quite a bit like what another old man , Will Brady , had done himself . As so many men seem to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something  --  and to end up sitting at the edge of a bed , holding one shoe . Or to lie awake until the shoe upstairs has dropped . From the tower room Will Brady could see all these people at their work , what they called their play , and the hours that they spent at what they called their sleep . Lying sprawled on wrinkledp241sheets on hot summer nights . Thinking . What else was it that charged the night air ? That gave it that hum , that flinty smell like the sand crushed under the car wheels , until he felt that the lid to the city was about to blow off . And that the city itself , with a puff of sound , would disappear . And then there were times  --  there were times toward morning when the city itself was as real as a picture , but the people who had lived in the city all seemed to be gone . Every man , woman , and child had disappeared . The lights still burned , the curtains still moved in the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a young cock crowing , an alarm went off . But there was something or other missing from the damp night air . The smell . of man  --  as Will Brady could tell you  --  was gone from it . What had happened ? It seemed that the inhabitantshad up and fled during the night . As if a new Pied Piper , or some such wonder , had passed in the street . Hearing this sound , they had rolled out of bed , or raised on one elbow as if the siren , the voice of the city , had leaned in the window and spoken to them . Beckoned , whispered to them , that the time had come . Nor were they surprised , as every man knew that it would . So they had risen , soundlessly , and gone into the streets . Still there on the floor were their socks and shoes ,  |p242on  the bedpost their ties , on the chair their pants , and on the dresser , still ticking , the watches they could do without . Time  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had marched off in the manner of sleepwalkers  --  and perhaps they were . They had moved in a procession , with the strong helping the weak , the old the younger , and what they saw  --  or thought they saw  --  out on the water , cast a spell over them . Perhaps it had been the bright lights on a steamer , or the white flash of a sail . But whatever it was , whether true or false , whether in their mind 's eye or far out on the water , they had followed this Piper , followed him into the water , and disappeared . They had waded through the cool morning sand still littered with cigarettes , pop bottles , and rubbish , and without hesitation , like sea creatures , they disappeared . Nor was there any sound , none but the water lapping their feet . So it was with those who had the faith ; but there were others , even thousands of them , who wanted to leave , but they wanted to take the world along . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : magazines and newspapers , chewing gum and tobacco , radios and phonographs , small tins of aspirin , laxative chocolate , and rubber exercisers to strengthen the grip . Decks of playing cards , and devices to promotep243birth control . They had brought these things along , but the water would not put up with them . As they entered , it washed them back upon the sand . There it all lay , body and booty , like the wreckage of the world they had been departing , as if a great flood had washed it down to the sea ahead of them . In the pale morning light their bodies looked blue , as if they had been long dead , though living , and a child walked among them spreading sheets of newspaperover each face . As if that much , but no more , could be done for them . How live in this world ? They simply had n't figured it out . Nor how to leave it and go to live in another one . Sunday morning Will Brady would walk through these streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake where the faithful had disappeared . He was not one of them , but it was a thing he could understand . He had his own way for departing one world , entering another one . On these Sunday mornings he wore his Florsheim shoes , his Stetson hat with the sewn brim , and both the pants and coat to his Hart Schaffner &; Marx suit . He did not walk in the sand , but in the grass at the edge of the bridle path . The Stetson hat , level on his head , he would tip to the ladies on the well-bred horses , their long tails braided , and a sudsy white lather between their hams . The ladiesp244in turn would tip their heads , or lift their leather riding crops in a friendly gesture , as any man out for a walk , at that time in the morning , was one of themselves . One who preferred to walk rather than ride , but who was up like them to breathe the morningair before three million other people were breathing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Men who had n't the time , during the busy week , to idle and play like normal people , but who could make the time early Sunday morning , while normal people slept . Most of these men liked to ride , but there were others , like Will Brady , who were known to walk . Both these men and women came down from the north , in the big cars with the very small seats , or they lived in the apartments overlooking the lake , along the Gold Coast . In these windows the blinds were always drawn against the morning sun . Uniformedmen stood at the doors to these apartments , as they did before the fancy theater lobbies , but a man with Florsheim shoes , and the pants to go with them , could walk past . A man who knew when to a-la-carte , when to table-d'hote . Such a man could walk into these lobbies , seat himself in a chair , examinethe potted plants , or step to the desk and ask to speak to Mr. So-and-so . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A big egg man from Texas , friendly , rather elderly.  |p245So  he would take a comfy seat in the lobby while the bellhop , or the secretary , or the manager himselfwould see that this matter was looked into . When he wore his Stetson hat , his soft leather gloves , and the hair combed back from his high forehead , quite a fuss might be made as to who this Will Jennings Brady might be . He would be paged in the lobby , and his name would stop the music in the dining-room . Words would be exchanged between himself and the management . Important gray-haired men , with their young wives , or perhaps it was their lovely flaxen-haired daughters , would pass in front of him with their thoroughbred dogs on a leash . Some of these dogs would stop and sniff at Will Brady 's feet . They knew , these dogs , but they said nothing . Between the old man and the dogs there was quite an understanding , and they both needed it . Sometimes Will Brady 's fine voice would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a little strained , and that habit he had , when laughing , of cuffing himself on the knee , as if nailing that leg to the floor . Quite a performance , when you consider who this old man was . An old fool with one suit of underwear to his name . Just one pair of pants that he could cross at the knee like that . Naturally , Will Jennings Brady was never on hand , but one day an Ivy Brady , from South Carolina , spoke to himp246over the house phone and asked him to come right up . Hell , a Brady is a Brady , Ivy Brady said . But Will Brady asked to be excused as he had , he said , an important engagement with a big out-of-town man in the Loop . But all of this took time  --  the sitting and the waiting , the patting of other people 's dogs in strange lobbies , and the reading of papers left on the bench along the walk . The morning traffic would flow toward the city from the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the park life would begin all over again . Candy and peanuts were sold , men would roll the sleeves on white arms , put away for the winter , and women would sit fanning the flies away from baskets of food . Games would be played , young men would run and fall , others would stand in a row behind chicken-wire fences , and others would run toward Will Brady himself , waving him away . Crying that he should look up , or down , asking if he had eyes in his head . So he would make his way north , careful to avoid the deceptive clearing , where the unseen might be falling , or the games of young men who would suddenly turn and chase him away . The papers he found here and there he carried under his arm . It gave him the feeling that along with other people there was something in the park for him to do ; also , he could sit on them in some places , inp247others he could read . It seemed to be the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later he would find himself a seat facing the strange big birds , or the melancholy bears , with an elderly man , about his own age , seated on his right . Not on his left , as that side of his face did n't feel right . There was an opening there that talking would n't fill up . He would take this seat , sighing , then say : " Kid writes me that there 's bear where he is in the woods . Hardly a day , I guess , he does n't stumble on a bear of some kind . " " You do n't say ! " That was what this man at his side would say . If he did n't , Will Brady would get up , sighing again , and try another bench . Sooner or later he would find a man who knew what was what . " Only thing that worries me , " Will Brady would go on , " is how a kid like that , a boy who loves nature , is going to like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to like it in some quiet place like that . " It might surprise you how many men knew all about Harvard and Yale . Had a definite opinion , one way or another , on a subject like that . Had a boy there themselves , or a friend , or the son of a friend , or a brother , or some member of the family who had passed through there , going somewhere else . Who had seen it anyhow and knew what itp248was like . Nine out of ten men , you might say , seemed to have given either Harvard or Yale , or both of them together , more thought than Will Brady managed to . Their opinions , anyhow , were stronger than his own . They were either all for Harvard , without a quibble , or all for Yale . None of these men had been to college themselves  --  being tied up at the time with something or other  --  but they seemed to have a clear idea what they were talking about . They were glad to advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who had a boy who was n't tangled up , as yet , with some damn girl . The general consensus seemed to be , in so far as Will Brady could order the matter , that great scholars went to Harvard and great athletes went to Yale . Albie Booth , for instance , he was going to Yale right now . But what about a boy who was showing signs of being both of them , an athlete and a great letter-writer at the same time ? The first in his class , if it had n't been for five or six girls . The place for a boy like that , one man told him in a confidential manner , was neither Harvard nor was it a place like Yale . It was Princeton , a place he had seen himself . He was a big man , with a beard , reduced to selling flags on pins for a living , but who nevertheless spoke with authority . As a boy he had passed  --  and he remembered it well  --  within a few miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind seemed to take as much time as a real one  --  and it would be midafternoon and the air would be hot when he started for the house . He would carry his coat folded over his arm and walk in the grass . His collar would be open and the Stetson hat pushed back on his head . Wherever tennis was being played he would sometimes stop and watch it , as the boy was said to be a coming tennis man . It helped him to see with his own eyes what the boy was . If one of the white balls came his way he would stop it , pounce on it , then hurry to where he could toss it to the players underhand . He had never learned to throw anything the other way . Tossing the ball , he would say : " I 've got a boy who plays for Harvard , " and then he might stand , if they would let him , close to the net . Some of them played very well , but it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons snails were sold on MenomoneeStreet . They were sold by a man who drove a small wagon , wearing on his own head nothing at all , but with three , sometimes four straw hats on the head of his horse . This was to make , as he said himself , the children laugh . He was a sad man and never laughed himself . He kept the snails in large tubs of water , and when he counted them into the bags , they made a sound like lead coins dropped on a slab . It was hard to tell the good snails from thep250bad . Most of them were bought by Nino Scarlatti , a boy with wild eyes and a curling harelip , and by Manny Plinski , who stood there with his money in his mouth . He would keep it there until he held the snails in his own hand . After eating the snails , Manny Plinski liked to put the empty shells back in the bag , twist it at the top , and then make a fool out of somebody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five cents . He would make himself a fool at the foot of the stairs , where the whole world could see him , and Manny Plinski would cry like a bird for his mother to come and look . So Mrs. Plinski would come , leaning over the railing , and Will Brady would stand there , a smile on his face , and with the nickel Manny Plinski would buy himself another bag of snails . " Oh , how he will love you ! " Mrs. Plinski would say , and wag her big head . On a hot summer day a big woman like that would not have much on . She would be in her bathrobe , or maybe her slip , with a damp towel thrown around her big shoulders , and she might have to stand there with her bosom gathered in her arms . In the winter she would be in the bone corset that made her arms stand out , as if she was crowing , and made it hard for her to scratch her back , pick her teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corset she would always stand up rather than risk sittingp251down . She would stand between the folding doors , as if propped there , with her arms half raised . " A new letter ? " she would say . " A new winner ? " And the old man there in the room , with his elbows on the table , would hold up the sheet of paper that he held in one hand . New ? Well , hardly  --  the pages were torn at the folds . The light came through where bacon grease had been dropped on it . " I was just wondering , " the old man would go on , " what a boy like that "  --  he would wave the letter  --  " what a boy like that is going to do in a place like Harvard , or Yale ? " " Oh , how he will love you ! " she would say , which it was hard , offhand , to picture the boy doing . But Mrs. Plinski was like that . A big , friendly woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found in the park on Sundaymornings , Will Brady always read the want ads , as a man who was n't quite sure what it was he wanted might find it there . Perhaps somebody , some man or woman , was looking for him . Perhaps a man like Insull had a position for him top252fill . Perhaps  --  anyhow , Will Brady read the ads . And one Sunday morning-a cool November morning  --  became on something that made him chuckle , made him put down the paper , rub his eyes with his knuckles , and wag his head . He looked around for someone to share it with , but he was alone on the bench . " Well , well , " he said aloud , as he did with Mrs. Plinski ; then he read it again . MAN wanted for Santa Claus . Now , that made him smile  --  he could feel the tightness at the corners of his mouth . It was enough to make him wonder , an ad like that  --  but he tore it out . He slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy . Having it there in his pocket , as well as on his mind , he naturally showed it to Mrs. Plinski , asking her if she knew where they might dig up a good Santa Claus . Where MontgomeryWard  --  for that was who it was  --  could lay their hands on a man like that : a man big enough , fat enough , and of course out of this world . And then , just by way of a joke , asking her what she thought of a man like himself  --  a man like himself , that is , as Santa Claus . But this woman would surprise you . This woman did n't think it was a joke at all . " How they will love you ! " was all she said , as she seemed to have the idea that something like thatp253was all you needed for a Santa Claus . It did n't seem to cross her mind that his cheeks , for one thing , were n't rosy enough . As he had that ad right there in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if she thought he was jolly enough for a Santa Claus . As a joke , of course , but she did n't take it that way . " Why , you 'd make a honey of a Santa Claus , pop . " That was what she said . " I do n't know as I 'm plump enough , " he said . " Oh , they put a pillow in you , " said Bessie Muller , " you 'd be all right . You 'd make a honey of a Santa Claus . " Mildred Weigall thought the same thing . He did n't even show her the ad , he just happened to say that the one thing he missed , around Christmas time , was the right kind of Santa Claus . One that was , so to speak , really fond of the kids . Mildred Weigall had interrupted to say that she had known of kids , friends of hers , who had been pinched while they were sitting on the lap of Santa Claus . By the old bastard himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like kids  --  " Will Brady had begun . " You 'd make a good Santa Claus , " she had said.  | " What they need is a man like yourself for Santa Claus . " Mrs. Beach said , holding the want ad close to her face , as she was nearsighted : " Why , Mr. Brady , all you need is just a touch of color on your cheeks . " Then she looked at him as if she was the person to put it there . When Mr. Beach was alive , she went on , there was not a single Christmas that passed , in those happy days , that Mr. Beach himself was n't Santa Claus . A big man  --  perhaps a little too big  --  he was especially good with other people 's children , his own , of course , knowing him just too well . He had been turning it over , Will Brady said , just turning it over in his mind , that he might at least stop by and look into it . He was alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . It would at least be better than being alone at Christmastime . " I think you 'll find , " Mrs. Beach said , " that they do n't pay much . " " I just thought I 'd ask , " Will Brady said , and then put some toothpicks in his vest before going on to say that the pay was n't what he had in mind . He had a job . The pay was n't so important to him . " I just thought I 'd inquire , " he said , as , if the honest truth were known , it had n't crossed his mind thatp255a man would be paid for something like that . Was it possible they paid a man to be Santa Claus ? Perhapsit was . It seemed that anything was possible . His first thought had been that he would have to pay for that himself . " It just so happens , " Will Brady said , " that I 'm more or less alone at Christmas . " " I can understand that , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom came around , as they all had children of their own . Nor was there any chance of her , plump as she was , of pretending she was Santa Claus . She was simply not the type  --  whatever that might be . The retail store of Montgomery Ward &; Co. , where they were looking for a Santa Claus , was right where the drawbridge crossed the sewage canal . So it was not any trouble for Will Brady to just stop by , as he said . To inquire what it was they had in mind for a Santa Claus . But as he entered the store the main aisle was obstructed by ten or twelve people , gathered in an arc , facing a corner with a well-lighted display . There was a comfortable chair , of the reclining type , several lamps with large aluminum shades , and a young man with taffy-colored hair and a deeply tanned face . He wore a clean white jacket of the type Will Brady had seen on dentists and doctors , and held in hisp256tanned right hand a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pointed at the statements on a large poster , which included a detailed , cut-away picture of one of the lamps . The name of the lamp was NU-VITA , which meant new life . The voice of the young man was pleasant , and he had that healthy outdoor look that city people , like Will Brady himself , liked to gaze upon . It might be that Will Brady was reminded of his son . Not that there was any particular resemblance  --  this boy was older , larger , and blond  --  but Will Brady saw the boy whenever he saw the outdoor type . The athlete who still wore his study glasses , so to speak . As the young man talked , in his persuasivevoice , Will Brady read the statements on the poster and discovered that the lamp he saw on the platform was a marvelous thing , a lamp that trapped the sun , so to speak . That gave off the same life-giving rays of light . These rays gave plants the color of green , and man the life-giving coat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , lived little better than the life of a mole , but science had now discovered how to bring the sun right into his room . Right into his attic , if that was where he lived . With this wonderful lamp he could sit at home  --  reading a book , or just resting with his clothes off  --  and absorb the mysterious life-giving rays of the sun . Without the sun there would bep257nothing on earth  --  nothing but cold rocks and fishlessseas . But with the sun there was light , plants , and creatures like themselves . And with this lamp a man could have the sun with him anywhere . Perhaps it was the sun-tanned face of the young man  --  the very picture of life , if Will Brady had ever seen it  --  that led the old man in the aisle to gaze at him in a certain way . Perhaps it was this gaze , somehow , that attracted the young man . Whatever it was , he suddenly stopped talking , turned the wand he was holding from the poster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front . Pointed it , that is , at Will Brady himself . " Will the gentleman , " the young man said , " be so kind as to please step forward ? Will the gentlemanallow me , without cost or the slightest obligation , to demonstrate ? " It would be wrong to say that Will Brady followedall of this . He saw the pointer , he heard the young man 's voice , he felt the eyes of those assembledupon him , and when those at the front made way , why , he stepped to the front . He took a seat in the reclining chair that was prepared for him . A white bib , like a barber 's cloth , was placed upon his front . Then his head was raised  --  through it all he heard the clear , calm voice of the attendant  --  and a pair of dark glasses was placed over hisp258eyes , tied at the back . For a moment he saw all before him darkly , as if submerged in muddy water ; then he was tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet went up . Over his head appeared the wide shade , he watched the adjustment of the black carbons , heard the hum of the current , then the crackling as the flame leaped the arc . A burning smell , perhaps the breath of life itself , made him wrinkle his nose . " If the gentleman will kindly lid his eyes , " said the voice , and as the crackling spread into a glow , Will Brady felt himself in a warm , colorless bath of light . The odor of the carbon was strong in his nose , and the flavor in his mouth . But he felt no fear ; in the words of the voice , now disembodied , that he heard above him , he felt himself " cleansed of pollutions and invigorated from head to toe . " The life-giving rays , as the voice went on to say , were mingling with his blood . He felt suspended  --  out of this world , as he describedit to Bessie Muller  --  and then , just as he was reborn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own worldly system had come to a stop . He made as if to rise , he gasped for air , but the young man 's firm hand pressed him back , removed the white cloth , and then slipped the glasses from his head . As he sat up , blinking , the young man said : " You will notice the healthy touch of colorp259that the life-giving rays have given to the gentleman'sface . " And so they did , as he saw them nodding , their eyes filled with wonder , as they gazed on what it had done to him . For himself , he could feel the tightness in his cheeks . " That was but a moment , " the young man was saying . " If the gentleman could spare me more of his time  --  just a few moments a day  --  he would soon be as sun-tanned as myself . " So saying , he rolled up his sleeve , showed the brown arm . He smiled , showing in his dark face the firm white teeth . Then he assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , as he did so , a wide selection of charts concerned with what the Nu-Vita would do for him . It could also be purchased , as he pointed out , on the easy-payment plan . His own brown hand on Will Brady 's shoulder , he called everyone 's attention to his fine , healthy look , and asked him , when he found the time , to drop by again . A few more treatments , as he said , and he would n't recognize himself . In this rejuvenated condition Will Brady found himself in the aisle , and he wandered about , from counter to counter , for some time . He seemed to have forgotten why he had entered the store . He stopped to gaze , wherever it was reflected , at his own new face . It was different . There was no doubt about that . Around the eyes he was whiter , but thep260warm cheeks were pink . Rosy ? Well , there was even a touch of that . His own yellow teeth seemed to look whiter when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of the store  --  a Mr. Nash  --  and inquired of him what they had in mind for Santa Claus . Mr. Nash , looking at him soberly , begged him to have a seat . What they had in mind , Mr. Nash said , speaking to him very frankly , was no monkey business . They had to be sure of that . While he was on the job he had to be Santa Claus , nobody else . Having said this , Mr. Nash looked at him , and what he saw in the new pink face before him seemed to be what he wanted , seemed to be a Santa Claus that he could trust . One that he could turn over , as he said , their reputation to . He had on file other applications , but if Will Brady wanted the job he would take him upstairs and show him the setup , give him the suit . All that he would have to dig up himself was a kid to blow the balloons . " To blow what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow the balloons . He would give away balloons , but he would need some kid to blow them up . The kid sat under the throne , under the seat , that is , where Santa Claus would be sitting , and after blowing up the balloon he would pass it between his legs . That was how they did it . He would have to find the kid to do that himself.  |p261Will  Brady said that he would think it over  --  if he could find the right boy , he would surely think it over  --  and on his way through the store he passed a new crowd of people around the sun lamp . The young man with the pointer , seeing him pass , waved the wand at him . " There goes a satisfied user , right there , " he said , " it has made that gentleman look years younger , " and everyone in the crowd , half the people in the aisle , turned to look at him . He smiled , he felt the strain of trying to throw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge , he made his way through the freight yards and into the tower room , before he noticed that he still held the literature in his hand . " Plug in at home or office , " it said , and he read that the small model in question , meant to sit on a table , could be had for just four dollars a month . On the first Monday in December , following another successful free trial , Will Brady purchased a desk-model sun lamp , carrying it along with him , in its carton , as he left the store . The warm glow of the lamp , in the crisp night air , was still there on his face . Mrs. Plinski had remarked the new look to his face , which she thought was due to the brisk fall weather , and after thinking it over he decided to let it go at that . Woman that she was , she mightp262find it hard to understand something like the NuVita , a marvel that brought the sun , so to speak , right into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the crisp frying smell . As he could plug it in either at home or at the office , he decided on the office as he could be alone , day or night , in the tower room . He could give himself a treatment , as it was called , any time that he got around to it , which turned out to be two or three times a night . Once when he arrived , as a rule , and then again when he left . He would clear one corner of the table of waybills , take off his vest , his tie , and his shirt , then open his underwear so that some of the rays fell on his chest . The only problem he faced was in keeping the time , as it passed very fast . Five to seven minutes were supposed to be enough . But seated there in the glow , like a warm bath , it was hard to keep from dozing off , or thinking thoughts that he could time or bring to a stop . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . So he may have slipped over now and then , but not that it mattered , as he had only five days to prepare himself as Santa Claus . As Santa Claus he wore a red cotton flannel suit , loose in the seat and very long in the arms , a pair of black rubber boots , and a soiled , strong-smelling beard . He sat on a throne , which in turn was on ap263platform , between two large cardboard reindeer , one of them with electric eyes that sparked on and off . At the back of the throne was the room where he dressed , hung up his clothes , and walked out on the fire escape , now and then , for a breath of fresh air . Under the throne was Manny Plinski , seated on a stool . In his lap he held a large bag of Christmas balloons , and at his side , in a glass jar , the baby turtles he had brought along to keep him company . When Santa Claus wanted a balloon he would tap with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one up and pass it to him . Sometimes , however , he handed Santa Claus a baby turtle instead . As you ca n't risk passing out live turtles to little city boys who had never seen one , Santa Claus would have to slip these turtles into the pocket of his coat . Toward the end of the day he might have more than his pockets would hold . He would have to get up and take out the sign reading : MAKING DELIVERYSanta Claus Back Soonand go through the side door and speak to Manny Plinski , personally . There were times when Manny Plinski was ashamed and took it all right . There were other times when he giggled , ran his hands like a rake through his yellow hair , and passed up another turtle as soon as he laid his hands on one.  |p264These  times Santa Claus would have to rap his knuckles , or sprinkle him with some water from the empty turtle jug on the floor . That sometimes did it ; other times it did n't work out too well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth . Another thing that Manny Plinski liked to do was take the brown tweed suit that belonged to Will Brady and fill the pockets with turtles and balloons . He seemed to like the brown suit better than he liked Santa Claus . He liked to take the brown suit and go off alone somewhere and sit with it . Santa Claus would have to stop and hunt him down , as he could n't blow balloons for himself , but this was n't too often , and Manny Plinski was never far . He was usually out on the fire escape , just sitting there . He like to watch the trains shifting around in the freight yards , and the boats on the canal . He would blow Christmas balloons , like bubbles , and let them drift away . Not that it seemed to matter , as there were plenty of balloons , plenty of time to stop and look for him , and the old man in the Santa Claus suit seemed to like his work . He would have paid Montgomery Ward &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street an old man can not hold hands with children , bounce them on his knee , or tell them lies that he will not be responsible for . Nor can he bend hisp265head and let them whisper into his ear . Very much as if he , this old man , could do something for them . Very much as if he knew , like the children before him , that there was only one man in this world  --  one man still living  --  who was prepared to do certain things . To live in this world , so to speak , and yet somehow be out of it . To be himself without children , without friends or relations , without a woman of his own or a past or a future , and yet to be mortal , and immortal , at the same time . Only one man in the world could answer an ad worded like that . Only one man , that is , and get away with it . For in the world it is evil for an old man to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the old man is Santa Claus . But for this old man these things are all right , they are recognized to be the things that count ; and the children , as they do in such cases , all believe in him . Some men will put up with a good deal , from certain quarters , for a job like that . " Oh , how they will love you ! " Mrs. Plinski said , and every day his cheeks seemed a little redder , his smile a little brighter , and the face in the mirror no longer his own . It had become , it seemed to him , the face of Santa Claus . Only the eyes , with the white circles around them , were still his own . They were there because of the goggles , and the darker his face seemed to get , the redder his checks , the more pale and sallow his eyes . So he began to **25;6484;TOOLONG that he had written Ghosts there so we hastened to discover which had been his room and the manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your room . May 's mistake . " " Yes . Silly of me , was n't it ? I never seem able to follow directions . It was so interesting , though , seeing the room . I asked the manager all about Mr Ibsen and he said that he remembered seeinghim years ago when he was a little boy , when the manager was a little boy . " " Tell Mr Warren what he said about him . " " He said that he had whiskers and that he refused to eat pasta ... is n't that interesting ? " ' " It certainly is , " agreed Philip . " Will you be here long ? " " About two weeks , " said Philip , imagining those two weeks : A sun-scorched time of dazzling sea , of restless nights until Regina came , when his loneliness would quite possibly increase . " Dies irae , " he murmured to himself as he was told what to see in Amalfi , which churches were lovely and which were tacky , which stores were expensive and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameos , old and rare . Would he like to see one ? Yes ? He was shown a large yellow cameo of Minerva , or was it the goddess of liberty ? No , more likely Minerva . " I mean , after all in those days the Goddess of Liberty was rather de trop , as the French say . Not at all proper to reproduce in a monarchy like Italy , " which reminded him again of his mission and , thinking of it , he shuddered suddenly in the hot sun , afraid of what might happen . " And then he was killed by the Count 's servants and eaten by wolves . " What on earth was she talking about ? he wondered , aware that he 'd missed an entire anecdote . " How terrible ! " he exclaimed . Then , to show interest : " Where did the wolves come from ? " " The forest , naturally . The castle was surrounded by a forest in those days and there were wolves everywhere . Certainly proves the legend , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " Philip was now ready to go swimming but they had other plans for him : they wanted to take his picture . So he posed for them against a rock , looking out to sea like a tired Hermes prepared for flight . " Thanks so much . That 's our hobby , you know , taking pictures . We have seventeen scrapbooks now . " " That 's a lot . " " It certainly is . Of course we travel a great deal . This is our fourth trip to Europe . . . the first since the war . " " Bella likes Italy . I like France . " Their views were presented to him and he passed judgment as tactfully as possible and then , before they could draw him out , he rose and excused himself and with some style dove into the warm sea , narrowly missing a sharp rock which might have split his head , providing the sisters Washingtonwith an unusual snapshot . He left the hotel through a back door , wondering whether or not he should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a safety pin , was the document which he was to deliver to the " organization . " But before he could meet the " organization " he would first have to present himself at midnight at a certain antiqueshop where the proprietor , according to Glenellen 's verbal instructions , would receive him warmly if he remembered to say " O lente , lente curite noctis equi . " He had been drilled in this one sentence by Clyde Norman and as he walked down the narrow street he murmured it over and over to himself . The street fascinated him : steep and only a few feet wide , a cobbled path between the windowless facades of buildings , broken here and there by deep-set bolted doors . The only light came from the fragment of moon overhead and from the lights of the town at the foot of the street . Feeling disembodied and faintly unreal , he walked like a ghost through the warm wineodoreddarkness , the stale heat of the day lingering in the quiet air and he wondered what would happen if , irrationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal-studded doors.  |p102His  mood changed when he stepped into the circle of dim electriclight which illuminated the level part of the town , the stage of the amphitheater . Men and youths stood about on the wharves in groups talking , their shadows long upon the sea . In the open cafes men and women were singing loudly and , Philip thought , rather well , on pitch and melodiously . He was aware of curious glances as he walked in front of the main cafe . . foreigners , tourists rather , were still a curiosity in this country so recently conquered by the foreign armies , and he knew that his appearance and , in even greater detail , his clothes were being discussed as he strolled the way conquerors have strolled for a thousand years through the cities of this much shattered land . In front of a pool hall he asked a policeman where the antique shop he vvanted was and the policeman , an affable man , was able to tell him , in English . After thanking the man , he strolled up the main street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea the narrower the streets became , while the long dark shapes of the mountains on either side grew more oppressive by moonlight as they converged and the town in irregular ranks continued on up the hillside , almost to the castle-crowned summits . Near the fast and narrow river , contained by masonry and spanned by medieval bridges , was his goal , the shop of Signor Alberto Guiscardo . A sign in Gothic script announced Signor Guiscardo 's name and business . Philip pulled the bell ; there was a loud jangling . After a long wait the door was opened by a young boy who spoke rapid Italian until , seeing that Philip did not understand him , he stopped abruptly and made a motion for Philip to come into the house . The first room was the shop , large and musty , crowded with furniture and mirrors and paintings all jumbled together like a looted museum . The next room they entered was a comfortablemodern drawing room , small , well-lighted and airless . The windows were all shut and Philip wondered if he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which burdened they torpid air . He was invited to sit down ; then the boy disappeared.  |p103Phili|p  had just picked up a book which someone had left open on a coffee table when the tinkling noise of a Mozart quartette filled the room . He put the book down nervously and looked about for some sign of life ; there was none . The phonograph was in another room . He was about to pick up the book again when it appeared . Philip started with dismay . Then , controlling himself , he got to his feet . It was a fat middle-aged Italian in a Sulka dressing gown ( mulberry with gold figurings ) who wore over his face a rubber mask like the ones sold in American drugstores . This particular mask depicted , in the most lifelike manner , the rosy features of a plump somewhat vacuous hog . " Flow do you do . How do you do . Please do n't get up . Sherry ? Yes ? I always drink sherry , too . . . late as it is . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sherry was produced from the sideboard . Philip took it , still staring at the pig 's face of his host . " Now let us chat , " said Signor Guiscardo , settling comfortably into an armchair . " You wonder at how well I speak English ? So do I. I have never had a single lesson . I 've never been out of Italy , in spite of my numerous . . . I repeat , numerous . . . friendshipswith Americans and English people . You are American ? " " Yes . . . just visiting . " " Have you been to Capri ? " " No . " " Do you plan to go there soon ? " " No . I shall probably go back to Rome when I leave here . " " You must under no circumstances miss Capri , " said the Pig solemnly , taking the sherry through a slit under the snout . " If it 's so very interesting , perhaps I will go there . " " Do , by all means . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweated in the heat and looked longingly at the sealed windows . It did no good , however , for his host obviously had no intention of opening them . Finally , when the silence got too oppressive for him to bear , Philip said the magic words Ayre had drilled him in before leaving Rome . " 0 lente , lente curite noctis equi . " No sooner had he pronounced the incantation than the Pigp104stood up abruptly , spilling sherry all over its mulberry dressing gown . Hands to its head , as though the piggish jowls might burst , it rushed from the room leaving Philip bewildered and a little frightened . He was nearly ready to make a run for it himself when his host reappeared . This time the dressing gown was of stiff brocade , dark green with a mille-fleurs design . On his face he wore a new mask , that of a goat , a pale astonished-looking goat with haggard features and unhealthy red little eyes . " I think this is more becoming , " said the Goat quietly , returning to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half expected to see cloven hoofs instead of hands . " Sodo I , " said Philip , refusing to betray the very real alarm he felt . " So much more in keeping with the tone of our discussion . " " I could n't agree more . " " What were we discussing ? " " I had made a Latin reference . I had quoted a line of Ovid . " " Of course . In the excitement it had slipped my mind . Do you like the classics ? " " Very much . Especially Horace . " " Superb , superb poet . But I must say Catullus is more me . " " I 'm not surprised . " " You 're not despised ? " " No . I said that I am not surprised . " " Oh . " There was a pause . The Goat looked at him thoughtfully ; then it said : " How is milord Glenellen ? " " Very well . He sends you his regards . " " Send him mine . . . when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suddenly relieved that the conversation had , for the first time , taken an anticipated turn . " Shall I give you the papers now ? " The Goat threw up its hands as though in terror . " Under no circumstances , my dear young man , are you to give me anything . Ever ! Do you understand ? " " But I thought . . . " " I do n't care what you thought . You are not to give me any/thing . Do you realize that I am watched every minute ? I can take no chances . There are a number of people who await with eagernessmy downfall . I wish to disappoint them . " " Well , of course , if you . . . . " The Goat had rushed to the window and was looking out into the darkened street , presenting , Philip thought , a dreadful vision to any passer-by , civilian or spy . " I can advise , however , " said the Goat suavely , satisfied that at the moment the street was empty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will , with your permission , suggest . " He looked inquiringly at Philip who nodded gravely . " In five days the moon will be full . You will proceed to the ruined church of St Elmo on the slope above the St Elmo bridge . . . you ca n't miss it . . . and there ( you must arrive at midnight precisely , not earlier not later ) the committee will await you in front of what was formerly the high altar . Deliver your papers to them . " Are you sure you do n't want them ? " " As sure as I am that the House of Savoy will return to its proper place among us , " said the Goat with an intense piety , in keeping with its sacerdotal features . " In that case , I had better go . I had n't planned to stay in Amalfi quite so long . " " You 're not going to leave without delivering the papers ? " The Goat was anxious . " No , I am going to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to imposemyself on you any longer tonight . You have been very kind . " " Not at all . I 'm only sorry I could n't have been of more help to you . But I 'm sure that you appreciate my position in all of this . " " Of course . You must be careful . " " Not for myself , either , " said the Goat with dignity , like a martyrdiscussing an auto-da- f e , " but for Italy and for our king . " The silence that followed this pronouncement was so long , so reverent , that Philip was tempted to steal quietly away . The Goat , however , was not finished . " Are you by any chance interested in antiques ? " he asked in a different voice.  | " No , " said Philip cruelly , " not at all . " The Goat appeared to be depressed . " That 's a pity . I have some exciting bits and pieces , you know . " " You see , I have no place to put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regretting his own harshness . " I know how it is . In case you know of anyone who might care for some rather unusual items , do send him to me . " " I certainly will . " " I am sure you will enjoy yourself in Amalfi , " said the Goat . " We have everything a gentleman needs . " " I have n't been well , " said Philip . " I plan to rest here , to get some sun . " " We have quite a number of fairhaired people in this section ... where do they come from ? Ah , who knows ? From those great barbarian armies which once ranged up and down this ancientrealm , taking their pleasure where they chose , clothed in the rough skins of beasts like so many golden forest gods . Then , later , the Normans came , from whom I am descended on both sides , the blood of Plantagenets like some heady tide in my veins , pulled this way and that by the waxing and the waning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infused the old stock , and the kingdom of the Two Sicilies flourished for many years until it came under foreign dominion and corrupt houses reigned ; at last , under a mongrel Bonaparte , God willed that it cease to be and Italy accepted Savoy , as I do , although only temporarily . . . until that glad day when my own nation is free again and I , my dear sir , am restored to my rightful place as the first prince of Europe , as the rightful king of Naples . " The Goat stopped , one arm stretched out before him , upraised as though awaiting the anointing and the orb . " May that day be soon , " said Philip quietly , now very alarmed . " It will come , " said the Goat , arising and peering once again out the sealed window at the dark street . " It will come . In the meantime , I devote my days to the restoration of Savoy , knowing that once they have returned the task of Plantagenet will be more easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now I must really go , sir , " he said , adding the " sir " as he 'd always been told one must with royalty . The GoatKinggot to its feet , too . " We 've enjoyed your visit . You must come back to see us soon , by daylight , on a mission of less state . " " I will , if I may . " " And should you perhaps want an interesting object or two , or know of a friend who does , why , bear my little shop in mind . " " I will , sir , I will indeed . " " I shall show you out myself . " He led Philip down the dark hall of the dimly lit shop . Here they paused for a moment and the Goat rummaged through an antique Renaissance chest . At last he found what he wanted . " It is from Pompeii , " he said . " Keep it as a little memento of our agreeable meeting . " " Thank you very much . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was quite heavy for its size and obviously made of metal . Then he was led to the door , which was opened after a good deal of unbolting and unchaining , like a fortress Philip thought ; he turned to say good night to his host who had , in the meantime , somehow managed , between the shop and the front door , one final metamorphosis : this time the altogether too realisticface of a gray wolf stared at Philip , its red eyes glowing luminouslyin the dark . " We must meet again . Until that day , however , do not forget your rendezvous : the church of St Elmo the first night of the full moon . " " It has been a great pleasure , " said Philip , backing out into the street with an agility which would have done credit to little Red Riding Hood . Two days later , at lunch with Bella and May Washington , he felt in his back pocket for a handkerchief ( the day was hot , the meal was a heavy one and all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the present from the king of the Two Sicilies was . . . he 'd forgotten all about it , had notp108worn these trousers since that night . While the two ladies were devouring chunks of hot fried veal , he examined the object . Then he tried unsuccessfully to hide it under his napkin but he was not quick enough for the beady eyes of Bella Washington , like an eager raven 's , had caught the glitter of metal and she swooped figuratively upon it ( the width of the table and the plates of hot veal kept her from literally seizing it ) . " What is that , Mr War-ren ? " " A present someone gave me the other night . Nothing of importance , " he said unhappily . " Oh , do let us see it . " And there was nothing for him to do but hand them the small bronze phallus , executed in perfect detail by some long-dead Roman , an amulet to inspire fertility or perhapsjust an object of no significance , fashioned for the sheer fun of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck ( there was a hole at the base through which a chain could go ) . " What on earth is it ? " asked Bella . " Is it very old ? " " Very . Roman . . . or so I was told . " " Let me see . " May took it and after a quick glance she blushed , betraying a knowledge of mysteries denied the virgin . She looked at Philip accusingly , as though he had done this on purpose to reveal her secret , to taunt her with memories , no doubt still vivid , of past events never to be repeated in this bleak world . She gave it back to Bella who asked what it was . " An amulet , dear , " said her sister , recovering her composure . " Is n't it meant to be anything at all ? It looks like something . " " A tree , " said Philip helpfully . Bella glared at him , still suspectingtreachery , her expression suddenly so intimate that it made him uneasy , conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bella returned to him with the remark that she thought it very nice . " Do you know the church of St Elmo ? " asked Philip quickly , changing the subject , guiltily avoiding May 's eyes . " Oh yes , " said Bella . " We loved it . So ruined . " " One of the more interesting examples of Romanesque , " saidp109May , her manner still constrained . " We recommend it very highly . Or have you already seen it ? " " No , not yet . Someone told me it was quite interesting . An antique dealer , a man named Guiscardo . Have you met him yet ? " Bella nodded . " We liked him , " she said . " He sold us some marvelouscameos , like the one you saw your first day here . I thought it was a real bargain . " " Did he seem in any way unusual ? " " Oh heavens , no . . . " " Of course , he did , " said May . " His English  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct English . He was a most Anent conversationalist and his grasp of the idiom was firm . His remarks , too , were cogent and well-expressed on nearly every topic we discussed . " " On every topic , " said Bella benignly . " You are correct , Bella , as always . On every topic . And he kissed our hands when we left . " " Both hands ? " asked Philip , willing to play the grammar game as long as possible ; he was an avowed anti-semanticist . " Her right hand and my right hand , " said May Washington coolly , making it very clear that only good manners had preventedher from declaring open war on him and , through him , on all men for his earlier revelation of that ancient shape of all betrayal . The sisters Washington charged off to a near-by castle after lunch and Philip , left to himself , wandered disconsolately about the hotel bowing gravely to the other guests , a dozen or so Europeansfrom the prosperous north of the continent , red-faced and long-haired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked the town and the glittering , tiresomely , monotonously vivid sea , he decided that this was not at all what he had expected Europe to be like . He had imagined himself moving comfortably and decorously through an unusual landscapecontaining various examples of celebrated architecture inp110whose historic shadows he would sit with lovely young girls who spoke English with charming accents and drink Pernod and Dubonnetwith him while he discussed literature and politics with intellectuals who had gathered about him for his pleasure and instruction . But , of course , it had n't been like that at all . He had been naive , he decided , sitting on a bench in a shady corner of the terrace , to think that the world would arrange ' itself so neatly for him . Actually he was aware already of a lengthening present curving from one mystery to yet another , composed of unexpected happeningsthat were affected always ( subjectively at least ) by the irrelevant demands of the irritable flesh . Yet one day he would know . He was confident of that . Then Regina , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here I am , " she said . " At exactly the right moment , too , " said Philip , standing up , but not taking her hand or kissing her . " I was just this moment thinking of the flesh . " " Flow flattering ! A woman my age always enjoys being thought of as flesh , a decorative cushion for the lust of men . I knew that it was wise of me to come before I was expected . " He pulled up a chair for her and they both sat down . She was extraordinarily handsome , he thought . . . her face darkened by the sun and her hair beginning to bleach . " Has anything happened ? " asked Philip , wondering how long it would take to reconstruct their affair . . . since the days that had separated them had provided each with a different memory of what had been at other meetings ; memories which had been further distorted by separate ponderings : what one forgot the other treasured until at last they met on a hotel terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this late-romantic age is considered to be one of the more disagreeable aspects of man 's nature , to be ranked somewhere between murder and grand larceny . Those men and women who overindulge their senses in this regard are ,  |p111at  best , considered weak and , at worst , villainous , quite capable of the other two misdemeanors . Yet nature , finally , is the master and even the most bigoted must admit that moral attitudes change from generation to generation , as dramatically as women 's clothes . Both murder and grand larceny , if conducted on a large enough scale , are universallyapplauded , blessed by all our institutions ; while even the laws governing sexual behavior vary from time to time , though never to the same extent as murder does , for instance , since obviouslyno man or woman is so constituted as to be able to show through personal example and on a sufficiently impressive scale what nature is capable of in the way of variety . Then , too , our sexual lives are hopelessly dominated , according to the mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no wonder then that we have as many different ways of love-making as we have people in the world . . . and this in an age which desperatelyneeds at least one rock on which to set a dogma , one single constant , one standard for all . It has been suggested that most of the suffering mankind has undergone so far has originated with the same impulse which , simultaneously and paradoxically , has given us civilization : the insistent need to proselyte . The vegetarian must convince all mankind that vegetables are the way not only to health but to grace , while in the sphere of religion and politics should any of the zealots be given a church or a state or a mob or a foundation with some cash to use as they please , it will go hard indeed for those unorganized civilians who like meat , representative government , state control , capitalism , hot baths and extramarital sexual relationships conducted with dignity in hotel rooms downtown . The zealots must reform their neighbors , even if they find it necessary to kill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds are capable of and with a truly heroic sense of symmetry they go about their ancient mission , holding committee meetings , instituting pogroms and inquisitions . Does Philip believe these things ? Should this digression be at/tributed to him or to his author ? Both , I think . All in all , since he is mine , he had better come around to my way of thinking .. . you see ? Even in this small instance , power has gone to my own level head ; I insist upon agreement . But now since the point I began with seems to have enlarged into a denunciation of the proselytizers , I must return to the original suggestion that there is a popular mistrust of those who have sex without love , or withoutthe sanction of the various institutions , secular and religious , which guard mankind against pleasure . Philip does not love Regina . . . in the sense that love means to venerate , to prefer to the exclusion of all else . And Regina ? Does she love Philip ? Who knows ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we choose to give only Philip 's side , her attitude must remain , as the attitudes of strangers always remain , enigmatic . I can only report that a few minutes after their conversation began on the terrace it ended in his bedroom , a room with a view of the bright sea and the blinding sky . She had come away from Rome sooner than planned for Rex had suddenly been sent on a tour of factories in western Austria and she had used this trip of his as an excuse to get away , to come to the seaside for a little bathing , to escape the heat of Rome which reminded her , she said , of that famous hymn by St Francis written during a terrible medieval summer and bedecked with sun-images still vivid centuries later . They spent the long days together ; on the rocks , bathing in the warm salt water , boating , exploring caverns and listening to legends as old as the gods and as remote . At night , avoiding Bella and May Washington who watched with eyes too interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waterfrontcafes , drinking with the sailors and whores until , tired at last , they returned to the hotel and made love with an intensity which diminished as the moon grew great until , by the time the moon was full Philip found his passion succeeded by a solicitous/ness which was more good manners than tenderness . Yet they needed one another and both knew that although there would soon be a change , this was not the time . He tried not to consider the future , unlike one of his idols , Stendhal , who always imagined the end of every love affair even before it began . The afternoon of the day he was to go to the church of St Elmo to fulfill his mission , he and Regina rented a rowboat from a red-haired sailor and they rowed from the town to a grotto which could only be approached from the sea . They moored the boat to a large flat rock at the grotto 's mouth ; then they took off their clothes and swam nude into the cool dark blue of the cavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water was warm and the air cool . For a time they paddled in and out among the stalactites which supported , church fashion , a central nave from which dark forbidding-looking passagewaysextended into a watery darkness , sacred to old forgotten deities , terrible and proud . Finally , bored with swimming , they climbed up on a rock off to one side of the central nave and lay side by side together in the dim blue light and stared at the groined odd ceilings and Philip wondered if there were bats here , hanging like furry fruit from stone branches , asleep , fearful of even this pale light . Regina took off her bathing cap and let her long dark hair fall free upon the stone . " It 's lovely , is n't it ? " she said at last , her words echoing through the nave , repeated endlessly from wall to wall like the talk of gossips . They both laughed ; they talked in whispers , not wishing to be overheard by the guardians of the grotto . " If one could only prolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something more spontaneous , less trite . But insincerityseemed more and more to be his way in love affairs as he tried always to please the other , to say what the other expected him to say , his own true feelings sacrificed in the process : perhaps because I do not feel at all , he thought gloomily , turning on his side to face Regina , esthetically pleased by the sight of their bodies side by side , prototypical of their sex , the first man andp114the first woman . . . or the last . He wondered what it would be like to have no consciousness , to be just that , a half with no other function than to become , easily and blissfully , a whole . " But we can , " she said , still on her back , her eyes shut and her dark hair gathered under her head like a cushion . " You can come on to Paris with us next month . We could see each other every day . .. " " What about Rex ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " I thought you said he was n't interested in such things . " " No . . . or at least I should have said he is n't interested in me any more . He likes young silly creatures and I 'm just as pleased with the arrangement . I have no false pride about my role in his life . You see , we 're very happily married . We have the same interests . We enjoy politics . He 'd be quite helpless without me , professionally at least . " " Does he know about me ? " Philip , like all young men , was eager to know everything everyone thought of him , the more uncomplimentarythe better . He liked to think of himself as a ruthless buccaneer who strode across the world shattering sensibilitiesand conventions with the fury of his progress but he knew , of course , at the same time , that most people thought him rather a lamb . . . a conception based on his small nose and his babyishlisp . " Of course not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss our infidelities . As a matter of fact , he thinks you 're a promising young man . " " Promising what ? " Philip was disappointed . " A great career . " " In politics ? " " What else ? Is there any other ? " " Of course , but since I probably wo n't pursue any of them either , I ca n't imperiously throw an easel or a violin at you . I can only deny what you say with the uneasy authority of a theore-tician . " " Well , desert theory long enough to think of what you mightp115be able to do in actual fact , if you chose . What you might be-come . " " But I do n't choose ; they choose . . . the others , the voters . " " If you choose now I can promise they will select you at the proper time . " " A machine ? " " Deus ex machina . Whatever you want to call it . " " Give me time , " he said , suddenly serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and looked at him . Her body upon the dark rock was smooth and fine as the white marble statue of that girl-saint who lies sprawled on the floor of the catacombsnear Rome , martyred beneath the cross and the fish .

" Then , feeling the tug of sex , he took her and they made love on the hard rough surface as lovers before them had done since the days when the gods in human form wandered about the earth seducing mortals and rewarding them with curious gifts , with crowns and genius , with constellations in their image spangled across the black fields of the night or , if the mortals refused to yield to these passionate gods , they were struck down , destroyed , transformed to winter shadows or to summer flowers , their belovedforms becoming green laurel on the slopes of hills or wildflowersin the fields where the thunder sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would . I promised Glenellen . " " But you promised me you would n't . " " I did n't really promise . I said I would try to get out of it . But it was too late . Besides , what harm can come of it ? They are all perfectly harmless lunatics . " " I 'm sure they are but you do n't want to get into any trouble with the police . " " Why not ? You can get me out . "  | " That 's no reason to do anything foolish . Suppose they shoot you . " " Oh , for God 's sake ! and suppose I get run over by a taxicab ? There 's more danger of that happening , you know . " " Do as you please , " she said . And he did . He left her at eleven o'clock that night . They had dined with Bella and May Washington whose curiosity had finally got the best of them . . . May especially ( the one who had suffered ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormity of their sin . Regina handled her beautifully , however , and , when dinner was over and Philip excused himself , the sisters Washingtonwere fawning on Mrs Durham , eager to win her favor . In the middle of the sky the white moon rode among black and silver clouds , blown north by a south wind . .. hot and gusty . .. the dry desert wind of Africa tempered with the sea 's salt but not much cooled from the long journey . The townspeople seemed more exuberant tonight than usual , as though celebrating unconsciously some old festival of the moon 's fullness . Philip paused a moment before the largest waterfront cafe . Inside men and women were singing and dancing . One tigerish , black frizzy-haired woman ( descendant of some Moorish or Carthaginiansailor ) was doing a wild dance for the men , her skirt pulled up to her fat thighs , her legs moving like fleshy pistons in time to the music . Philip , as unobtrusively as possible , slipped into the cafe and watched until , amid laughter and curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laments were wrung stickily from the fiddle and the accordion . Everyone was hot , sweating , flimsily dressed and happy , all that he 'd ever imagined the joyful peasant to be . Yet he knew that if he looked closely he would see what the outsider never saw : fear , antagonisms , envy . . . all the usual human characteristics accentuated by this summer land , the violence checked by pleasure in the evening , by piety and labor during the bedazzled day . A young Scandinavian , thin and horse-faced , so blond thatp117his face seemed eyebrowless , lashless beneath its straw-like hair , appeared and asked in English if Philip were an American . " I thought so . I can always tell . Have a drink . " " No , I can only stay a moment . " " It is very gay here tonight . " Philip nodded , looking past the other at the revelers who were now singing opera , loudly and without shame . " Do you like Europe ? " persisted the Scandinavian in his prim heavily accented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " said Philip , inspired , " I do n't " " But why not ? " " Because it is dead , finished . . . and the roads are bad . The trains are not on time . The various conveniences , such as they are , are not sanitary and the women are lewd , immoral and , I 'm told , diseased . But I want to thank you for asking me that question . .. I now know what I want to do , where I want to go . I 'm goingto return immediately to Waco , Texas , where I belong . Good night . " And feeling much better , Philip left the cafe and turned into the street which led to the Bridge of St Elmo . Even these ordinarily dark streets were well-lighted for the doors that were usually sealed against the night were open and townspeople sat on their own doorsteps or lounged about the cobbled streets beneath the full moon which hung , rich and golden , swollen with summer , among its clouds , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridge , however , all was quiet . A few houses were set back against the hill on terraces above the town , accessible only by foot . Set apart from these houses was the ruin of the church of St Elmo , surrounded by olive trees and ilex , by giant cypresses , all black and mourning in the moon 's light . But before he could get to the church he first had to climb many steps , each , it seemed to him , more steep than the one before and he was thankful for the south wind when he finally ar/rived , breathing heavily , at the top of the steps where he paused a moment to rest . Amalfi was below him , its yellow light gleamingin a pattern as inscrutable as that of the white stars which shone everywhere , one behind another , in the midnight sky . Far out to sea , a ship with blinking lights was making its way to Africa and , as he stared at the ship on the dark horizon , a star fell in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and walked slowly down a narrow flagstone path to the grove of trees where the church , black and silver in the light of the full moon , stood like a ship wrecked on a sandbar , roofless , its windows like idiot 's eyes and its towers gone . He stood for a moment looking up at the cracked stone towers ; insectswhirred drily in the trees and , far far away , he heard the faint tinkle of music , the echo of laughter in the town below . Conscious of his danger , dreading ghosts more than police or communists , he entered the church and stood in the roofless nave surveying the shattered arch beneath which the high altar , now a mound of rubble , had once been . As he moved down the nave the noise of the cicadas abruptly ceased . he stopped then , waiting for the ordinary sounds of the night to resume , but they did not ; the silence persisted . He looked up at the moon , now bonewhite , no longer golden , sailing through the black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antiqueshawl from Spain thrown over that one-half world beneath the moon . He waited , trembling , before the mound where the altar had been . Minutes , hours , years , eras passed and still he waited , frozen by moonlight into a pallid facsimile of his living self . He saw the church as it was : stained glass , wine red and cerulean blue , filled the empty windows and translated clear sunlight into rainbows , while figures in vivid costumes moved about in ritual attitude and celebrated the ancient Mass . Then windows shattered and the roof fell ; the towers crashed down the hillside and , as he stood there , even the walls which still stood buttressed all around him fell at last and he was alone in the dust , the burnt stumps of cy/press and ilex and olive around him , and the sea where the town was . He moved . The cicadas resumed their monotonous whirring and the moon was hidden by clouds . He looked at his watch and saw by its luminous dial that he had been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve and no one was there , neither conspirator nor policeman had shared with him the ghosts and the constant shadows . " Hello ! " he said in a loud voice , which frightened him ; but no one answered . Resolutely he explored the church , pushing his way past the fallen masonry into chapels where wild grapes grew . . . he went everywhere except down into the dark hole behind the high altar where , he knew , the illustrious dead had once been buried in ice-cold crypts , the earth of their bodies now holding , indiscriminately , nests of scorpions and the roots of flowers . . . in decay , as in life , the fine balance between good and evil kept , continuity maintained . Then , satisfied that no one was in the church , he left . As he stepped across the stone threshold he noticed something gleaming on the lintel . He picked it up , but since the moon was hidden he could not identify it in the dark . . . it felt like an empty balloon or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went down the steps to the world again , his vision lost already . . . the materialworld , as the Cathari once maintained to their regret , being the work of Satan , while the spirit was God . Regina listened with amusement to his story of the empty church and his moment of vision . " Then your time was n't entirely wasted . . . you at least had a revelation . " " But of what ? " Philip was irritable , conscious obscurely that lie had been made a fool of in a way he did not understand . " It would seem obvious from your description . I 've always suspected , though , that revelations are valuable only in them/selves , not for what , if anything in particular , they reveal . It would seem that you saw the life of one building from its beginning , centuries ago , to its end , when not only the ruin will be destroyedbut Amalfi as well . Nothing remarkable about that . Since nothing endures it 's quite logical to conclude that Amalfi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a bay of what is now a town . . . . Since the exact date of this phenomenon was withheld , you do not qualify as a prophet . " " It all seems quite pointless , including your analysis , " said Philip , tired and angry . " I 'd like to get my hands on that antique dealer . " " Forget about it , darling . Why bother ? Now we can go back to Rome . You 've had your moment as a courier , a conspira-torPhilip , remembering something , reached in his pocket and pulled out the rubber bag which , upon examination , proved to be a mask of a gray wolf 's head , quite realistic , with red eyes which reflected light the way the taillights of automobiles do . " This must have been Guiscardo 's , " said Philip . " Do you think he was there all the time ? " " Perhaps . I wonder why he did n't speak to me , though .. . if he was . " " He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did happen ? " " You will never know now . " " I suppose not . Shall I return the mask to him ? " " No , keep it as a souvenir . " " Of what ? " " Of your monarchist days . " He snorted and shoved the mask into a wastebasket . They were in his room , seated in front of a tall window which overlooked the sea . " Shall we go back to Rome ? " asked Regina at last . " I suppose so . I would like to see more of this country first . " " We can drive slowly . " We might even go to Capri , " suggested Philip.  |p121She  nodded . " It 's lovely there this time of year . Crowded , though . " " I do n't mind . " " You will see nothing but Americans . " " I 've a feeling the best way to get to know them is to see them in Europe . " " You 're very right . . . but do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a budding politician I thought it the right thing to say . " They laughed at one another . Then he took his jacket off . As he did , he noticed the safety pin which fastened Glenellen 's documents to his inside pocket . He undid the pin and held the plain white envelope under the lamp . " Do you think I should open it ? " " Of course . How will you ever know what 's inside ? " " But I should n't really . " " Why not ? Your mission is over . You 'll have to destroy it anyway . Open it . I ca n't wait . " He tore the envelope open and took out a single sheet of paper on which had been written one word in letters which he recognizedto be Greek , a language he had not studied in school . " What on earth does it mean ? " he asked , bewildered . " Let me see . " Regina took the paper for a moment ; then she handed it back to him , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really read Greek ? " " Oh yes . . . there 's no end to my talents , " she smiled . " What does it say ? . .. " " I can only tell you what the word means . You 'll have to interpretit . " " Why ? " " Because it 's a message , for you I think . " " But that 's ridiculous . I was supposed to deliver it to the royalistshere . " " Then perhaps it was n't intended for you . In any case , you must decide . The word is Asebia . " " And it means ? " " Failure to worship the gods ... a capital crime in ancientp122Greece . It was the principal charge brought against Socrates . " " I am very confused , " said Philip . " A confusing age , " said Regina with a sigh . " How lucky none of us knows what will happen . " The vulgarity of Mrs Helotius was one of the few really perfect , unruined things in Europe ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never a disappointment to the eager tourist who ( properly sponsored ) had got himself into any one of those five villas which decorated the spas of fashionable Europe like rough diamonds , bases for her considerable operations . There was about her a completeness lacking in more human , more frail beings who , though dedicated like herself to the achievement of a major social position , might , from time to time , make an exception here and there , squeeze in a cousin or an old friend at a luncheon for some Cabinet Minister or a reception for one of those exiled kings who , at this period in the world 's stormy history , were gloomily making the rounds : Venice , Lausanne , Rome , Paris , Cairo , Capri . . . all the pleasanter places where they would be in demand , where dinners would be given for them by the vigorous hostesses , thus delaying the moment when the gold bars , the tiaras , necklaces ( even the crowns ! ) would have to be converted into currency to support their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tender if ruthless hospitality of Mrs Helotius who never let up , who never missed a trick . She might have really got away with it if she had been better born ( officially she had never been born at all for that area of the world where she had first appeared fifty-two years ago had changed nationality so many times that all records had long since disappeared ) , or had married less richly . But , as she freely admitted to her intimates ( those creatures to whom she accorded precedence either because of birth or well-rewarded talent ) , she had started from scratch , as had Helotius , a Greek who had made more money than any honest man should out of figs in Asiap123Minor . Later , when he became British , he married Mrs Helotius whose family name had never been revealed to her intimates though all of them called her by her first name , Zoe . . . she liked of course to be addressed as Countess since once , having been carried away by a stunning dinner party she 'd given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope , she had presented a great deal of hard cash to that solemn institution , the Roman Church , for which , in due course , she had been created a Countessand given a decoration . This had all happened some years ago ; the Cardinal and she had since drifted apart for , as it turned out , someone else got to be Pope and her time was now more and more taken up by the royal waifs who gravitated to her like flames to a crafty moth ; so the loss of the Church had been the gain of the Blood . Helotius was dead . He 'd been thirty-seven years older than Zoe at the time of their marriage and , presumably , during the twenty years they 'd spent together he had grown no younger . He died leaving her the figs and a lust for position which , until that moment , had gnawed secretly at her vitals ever since , as a child , she had scrubbed the floors of her underprivileged home in that part of the world which , even then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another . Money was really not important to her ; clothes and servants and houses had , in themselves , no charm for her . She always said that a bit of horsemeat and a cold boiled potato was the best meal in the world and little did her fine friends know that she meant what she said . But Position was something else and fortunately she now had the money to achieve it . Her career began two months after Helotius died . She had gone to the finest couturier in Paris and she ordered the couturier to make her a wardrobe which would knock everybody 's eyes out . He did . There were those , of course , who laughed and thought her in had taste but everyone else followed her activities in Vogue and The Tatler with feverish interest , aware that money was being spent and that something must be done about it . She was vulgar , of course . But then she was rich , and the villasp124were being bought at the rate of one a year . At the end of five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully displayed across the ravaged old world of Europe as everyonecame to her lunches , her dinners , her ballet parties and her fetes . The birthday of the British king was always the occasion of her greatest effort : it usually took place at night on the Eiffel Tower which was acquired for the occasion ; unkind people said that her observation of this particular day was because George VI was the last holdout . She had never been presented at his Court . The time she had invaded the royal yacht club at Cowes with a bouquet of roses , thistles , shamrocks and leeks was not considered cricket , although she did get one glimpse of terrified majesty before the guards led her away . But even her enemies were now forced to admit that she had won through and that , very likely , her vulgarity had been more of an asset than not . Had she been more sensitive she could never have endured the contempt of the established figures of this world ; the fact that she had ignored their hostility in the end gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really so sure of herself , they reasoned , perhaps there was something to her after all and , certainly , she entertained richly . So , finally , almost everyone came around ; the ones who did not were consideredstuffy and not in the fashion . Yet despite these triumphs she was , in her own estimation at least , a long way from her goal ; and in this she was fortunate . A lawyer gets to the Supreme Court and that is that . A politician gets to the Senate or to the Presidency and that is that : there is no place left to go . But for Mrs Helotius the world was an enormousjungle full of lions to be bagged and no one , not even a woman as well-equipped and devoted as herself , could hope to assemble more than a fraction of them under her roof . To add to her frustration new lions appeared every season , and how was she to know if they were to reign for a number of seasons and become legitimate or be devoured in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cubs except as back-ground. )  |p125All  in all , however , she did not make many mistakes . She never read contemporary books but she was able to skim reviews and study the authors ' biographies on the dust jackets and determinewith remarkable accuracy whether the gentleman in question was " there " or nearly there , or gone . She did not handle lionesses unless they were either royal or very noble . In science she was guided by Time Magazine and the various selections of the Nobel Prize Committee . In politics and religion she was infallibleand , as for society , she had every Register , every Peerage and Almanac available while her secretary-companion , Lady Julia Keen , an impoverished daughter of a bankrupt Earl , was in complete charge of a portable filing case where everyone was neatly indexed according to age , general appearance , income , connections . . . all recorded with comments on the number of times they had been entertained at the five villas and the number of times they had entertained her at their villas . She was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second time to her house remarked , the Havelock Ellis of the social world . As for her stratagems ; well , you know as well as I do how she wrote Bernard Shaw whom she 'd never met that H. G. Wells , whom she 'd never met either , would be at her house on a certain day ; then she wrote Mr Wells that Mr Shaw would be at her house eager to make his acquaintance . And that is how the two great men met one another , and Mrs Helotius , for the first time .. . or so they say . Now she was in residence at Capri , and Regina and Philip , just up from Amalfi , were lunching on the terrace of her house in the company of twenty brilliant creatures , the best to be had on Capri at that moment : a British Field Marshal , a Spanish Marquis , four American novelists ( they were everywhere that season ) , a number of politicians , and a dozen men and women whose names are known to everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and the terrace , the day and the island were , Philip thought , marvelous . He 'd never seen such vivid colors : burning green and blinding blue , flashes of flame-red and flame-yellowp126flowers among the green , stirred gently by the south wind , and by the more drunken guests who wandered off the flagstone terraceto look down the steep rock cliff at the sea below , the town off to the left , white and powder-pink . The house itself was not large : a dozen bedrooms , half as many baths , and the usual offices . Nothing more . Of the five villas it was the smallest but , because of its setting , Mrs Helotius always spoke of it as her " jewel . " " You will so enjoy meeting the Field Marshal , Mrs Durham ... and there are a number of people from your Embassy whom you must know . They will know you , certainly , and be so thrilled to meet you if they have n't already . Do come to lunch , both of you . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Philip . " The Field Marshal is so sweet . " And so they came to the lunch and the Field Marshal looked exactly like his famous self , not sweet at all , and Regina knew a number of the Americans and all the Italians . It was a good way to spend his first day on Capri , thought Philip , who was thoroughlyimpressed by now , much more so than he 'd been that morning in the main square of the town when Zoe Helotius , dressed in a Swiss dirndl and wearing dark harlequin-shaped glasses , swooped down on Regina , a hairy-legged Italian Duke in tow . She was more elegant now , however . She wore one of her couturier'screations , a gossamer gray affair with emeralds the size of egg yolks at her raddled throat . Her hair was a dark red , streakily dyed to give it the illusion of authenticity which succeeded very well , in the sense at least that all the women present were profoundlyaware of the expense such hairdressing entailed . She was a short lean woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features were tiny , except for the chin which was slightly undershot . She was always carefully painted and her face was lifted once a year until now it was almost totally expressionless , as though fixed for all time by some Medusa , in a mood midway between surprise and doubt . Her voice was harsh , very English , seldom betraying her obscure foreign birth.  |p127They  had dined at a buffet . Then , drinking champagne , the guests moved about a dainty gazebo which , banked by flowers , overlooked the sea below . " Shall you be here long , Mrs Durham ? " inquired Mrs Helotius , gazing over Regina 's shoulder at the Field Marshal who was grimly tearing one of her finest yellow roses apart . " I 'm going back to Rome tomorrow . Then on to Paris . " " With your husband ? " " Oh yes . He has a job to do , you know . " " Indeed I do . All Europe knows . All Europe awaits his report with bated breath , " she said dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now heading purposefully toward a bush of white roses with much the same expression he 'd undoubtedlyworn on his face the day he had ordered one of his divisions into the worst ambush of the last European war , for which he had been raised to the peerage and sent to New Zealand to mobilizethe Maoris in defense of that island . " I am sure his report is n't that earthshaking , " smiled Regina . " Nonsense . He has the President 's ear , " said Mrs Helotius intensely , betraying her near-Oriental origin by an exotic overemphasiswhich was very unBritish and certainly not American . " You must let me give a party for you next month in Paris , " she said at last , gracefully accepting the fact that she would learn nothing of Durham 's mission from his wife , no minor state secret that she could whisper to some interested statesman to make this visit to her seem worth while in a political as well as in a social sense . " We should like that very much . " " You come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip , who was wondering just how Regina was going to explain him. . . met him just yesterday in Naples . His father is one of my husband 's very good friends ... a judge . . . " " Ah , the law , " intoned Mrs Helotius , surveying the gazebo , wondering who was drunk and who was not . Lady Julia marked a minus after each name in the filing cabinet to denote one in/stance of drunkenness or bad behavior . Three minuses excluded all but the most eminent from the hospitality of the villas and the Eiffel Tower . " Well , what do you think of her ? " asked Regina as Mrs Helotiushurried away to defend her rosebush from the Marshal . " Much better than I 'd imagined . " " She is wonderful . " " Quite up to expectations . I 'm glad we came . " " To Capri ? Or here ? " " Both . . . are n't you ? " " I think so . I must go back to Rome soon . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a week now they had been together growing dark in the sun and easy in one another 's arms . Neither had referred to her plans or to his or to whether those plans would , after this week , coincide or not . It had been his idea to visit Capri . They had connecting rooms at the hotel and , as she had predicted , everyone she knew was on the island . There were no secrets here , which did not disturb Philip much . He had nothing to lose and , all in all , he was more proud than not to be Regina'slover . Her attitude was , as usual , unknown to him , disguisedby that serenity which he 'd come to value far more than intensity or passion , preferring this Regina to the one he had known in Rome , the one who had tried to appeal for some reason of her own to his ambition . " Will you stay on here ? " she asked , not looking at him , smiling pleasantly as a young American presented himself to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome before you go , " said Philip quickly ; then he said how-do-you-do to the young man whom Regina introduced to him as Robert Holton , of the State Department . The three chatted amiably . Holton was one of those smooth well-educated youths Philip particularly disliked , not objecting to their smoothness or the fact they had gone to Harvard as he himself had , but rather to the way they mixed opportunism , charm and earnestness in such a fashion as to render ( to him atp129least ) their every remark suspect . Young men dupe older and wiser men but never their own contemporaries with whom they must compete for the good places of this world . And Holton , carefully dressed , beginning to go bald , cautious , no doubt sensed the other 's hostility for presently he went away . " He used to be in Wall Street , " said Regina , as though anxious not to talk of themselves now that , in a moment , a plan had been made for the next meeting , a promise exacted , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to see him at Mrs Stevanson'sin New York . You know her , do n't you ? Blue hair . . . that one . He had an affair with a charming Italian girl whose name I can never remember . He treated her badly . . . or she treated him badly . I 've forgotten which . Oh , here comes the Field Marshal . . . the dullest man in Europe . " And , smelling of all the roses he had that afternoon destroyed , the warrior bored them for twenty minutes until Lady Julia Keen , under orders from their hostess , led him away . " It seemed that Mrs Helotius was staying at Antibes many years ago at the house of some very grand friends , when some less grand friends at Cannes invited her to lunch soon after she arrived . She wired them she could n't possibly get over . . . that she was exhausted from the trip . She then received a card from them saying how sorry they were that she could n't make it for lunch since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly over , when Zoe arrived , dusty and disheveled , her Daimler boiling in the hot sun . Where is he ? ' she said to the startled host . Where is who ? ' Who ? Why the Prince of Wales , of course . " Oh , the Prince is n't here . Just us , and the Provost of Worcester . ' " Robert Holton was full of stories about Mrs Helotius and Philip enjoyed them . Since Holton was staying at his hotel they saw a great deal of one another after Regina 's departure and Philip 's first unfavorable impression had been soon succeeded by an amused neutrality . He did not like young men . He 'd never had a. close friend among his contemporaries and he thought it unlikelyp130that he would begin to care for one of them now . He enjoyed the company of older men if they were civilized ( his standards were precise ) and he liked pretty women . Young men , however , always brought out the worst in him , made him irritable and competitive . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , have had a fling at pederasty if it had not been for his dislike of those aggressive masculine traits which inevitably kept him at a distance from his contemporaries ; although , and this paradox was , he knew , quite logical , his few friends at Harvard and in the Navy had either been gaudily effeminate and amusing , or else masculine but understanding , interested in him for reasons which were , whether declared or not , distasteful yet flattering . He had known an intimacy with such men that he realized he would never know with ordinary men whose line was straight , less comprehending . At first Holton seemed to him to be like these others he had known in school , but after several days in one another 's company , he struck up at last against that familiar density , the sudden wall which he recognized as being similar to that which guarded the area of his central interest from invasion ; and Philip was relieved even though he realized that their alikeness would prevent any sort of relationship , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cause hostility , even violence , like two young bulls in a field together . But after all the problem , as he considered it one afternoon on the rocks where they swam , was academic . They were companionsfor a week or so and nothing more . Only because he liked insoluble problems did he examine as dispassionately as possible his attitude toward Robert Holton and toward all men of a certainage and quality who , no matter how pleasing their character , how admirable their many virtues , constituted a threat to his own integrity , to that love and pride of self which was both the charm and the vice of his own youth , as it was of theirs . Holton , however , was very nearly as neutral as he himself and they were able to spend the days together blandly , eating and drinking and bathing in the sea . At night there were various par/ties , expeditions to bordellos where everything was handled blithely and gracefully , with all the Italian pleasure in the natural communicating itself to these two Puritan boys who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , all pleasure , was evil and that only pain was good ; consequently neither could exact more than a temporary physical satisfaction from any act , while both would far more likely ( though this would not be easy to prove ) have been exalted spiritually to ecstatic heights by some calculated frustration and its attendant anguish . But the young and the unengaged in these fiery last days of the Christian era of which I write were not allowed the excuse of faith or the rare delight of conscious martyrdom . . . rather , they were allowed to play any game they wanted , to invent the rules as they went along , to do exactly what they pleased as their culture , more brilliant , more fine than ever , approached its diffuse end and they themselves , liberated as they were from the arbitrary ways of the old church , from its superstition and dogma and bloody intolerance , had not yet managed , at this point in time at least , to exorcisethe mean devil of guilt , the sense of sin which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two thousand years . Now , though the churches themselves had died of their own victory long before the last of the wars of religion began , the fear of pleasure and the hate of loving persisted , a withering frost at the heart of summer , and all the martyrs , clinging upside down like bats from the rafters of heaven , no doubt felt that their work had survived the vicissitudes of knowledge much better than even they might reasonably have suspected . Perhaps , though one must not look too far into the irrelevancies of the future , their great monument , that core of gleaming ice in each man 's heart , might vet become once more the focal point of a new , more fatuous orthodoxy in which the dream of the martyrs would at last be fulfilled in the vast design of some dogma from which there could be no deviation since the mind , as the late Christian scientists have discovered , can now be controlled : drugs will extract a truth or a fact from any man and , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with apparent calm , while virtue becomesp132the monopoly of the state and the hero vanishes  --  the happy citizens , identical in quality , going about their assigned tasks , eating , thinking , dreaming all alike , the ice within so much heaver than the mountains around them or the continents beneath their feet , a weight which anchors them securely and for all time to the dull earth . Does Philip know this ? All men know it or rather feel it , in different ways . Were he examined he would say perhaps that he disliked the cold but whether he would choose the fire is doubtful ; yet neutrality bores him and , unconsciously , he does await the thawing of that spirit which was frozen by a long accretion of laws of conduct , empiric and mystical . . . to be unfrozen , if at all , by some act of loving outside the jungle that the flesh is , that the mind is , too ; the beloved shrine of the saints shattered at last by some central force , the glacier exploding into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fire outside , as the flow resumes , like a wide river in the spring or like those myriad galaxiesof burning stars which , they tell us , are eternally flowing outward from some dark cold center to the void where nothing was before . " I had a talk with Julia Keen the other day , " said Holton thoughtfully , " and she told me some wonderful stories . But best of all , when she 'd finished , she leaned forward , her face close to mine , and whispered , You know the most important thing in the world ? ' I shook my head , expecting to hear something quite unusual . Tipping ! It does wonders . ' " Philip chuckled . " I should n't be at all surprised if she were n't right . I suppose women like her need service more than anything else . " " Mrs Helotius is less well-organized , as far as I can tell . She can get people together but I do n't think she has ever stopped to considerwhy she has brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible vagueness . " " Does she really make those funny remarks people say ? " " I only heard her make one . She was at a dinner and Serena Bondi , the bitch of all time , turned to her and said , Zoe , have youp133heard that extraordinary story about your friend General X ? They say he 's homosexual . ' And Zoe , with her best **41;6511;TOOLONG , said , Poor thing , but they tell me it 's not dangerous now . They 've found a cure . A cousin of the king of Spain nearly died of it until finally they gave him this new drug and the bleeding stopped immediately . " Holton told story after story and Philip listened , drifting off from time to time , his eye following the curving flight of gulls above the sea and his mind now pleasantly unfocused , untroubledin the bright sunshine . When Holton suggested they have a drink he refused gently , softly , for he was like the soft day , bemusedand passive . And so Holton , with an amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nearest bar . Philip closed his eyes and dozed in the sun.  |p134He  ARRIVED in Rome on a hot gray day , windless and enervating . The Via Veneto was crowded with tourists who seemed very nearly as depressed as he himself ; the chatter at Doney 's was more subdued than usual and , from time to time , anxious glances were turned skyward as though a storm or the Second Coming was imminent . Far away , beyond the Alban hills , thunder rolled . Ile told Clyde Norman that he wished it would rain . Mr Norman had been sitting alone at a table gloomily chewing a meringue glace , the whites of his eyes a liverish gold . He had greeted Philip cordially but without enthusiasm . He , too , wished It would rain . " I have n't been well , " he observed briefly as Philip sat down . " What 's the matter ? " Philip tried not to sound as unsympatheticas he felt . The Amalfi adventure still rankled . " Liver . And , for some reason , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong things . A demon drives me to larger and larger meringues , more and more curries and heavy veal . . . until at lust I 'm forced to go to the hospital for a few days , or even weeks , and live on bread and water . The body ! How I loathe it . " " I 'm sure that mess you 're eating will do the trick . " " Send me to the hospital ? Very likely . But I ca n't stop . I just ca n't stop . By the way , have you tried the nougat here ? It 's splen/did , but be sure to take the little bits of paper off  --  otherwise it has rather a nasty taste . Will you have something to eat ? " " I do n't think so . A drink , perhaps . " A drink was ordered . A thin middle-aged lady nodded to Mr Norman , who bowed deeply into his meringue as she passed , her expensive high heels clattering on the sidewalk . " That , " said Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleech . " " And who is Daisy Fleech ? " Philip regarded each digression as a personal affront , since obviously Mr Norman must have known about the Amalfi fiasco . . . if he had not been responsible for it , which was not unlikely considering the general confusion in which the conspirators moved . " She was one of Mussolini 's mistresses . " " Is every woman in Rome an ex-mistress of Mussolini ? " " Of course not , " said Mr Norman , a little sharply in his turn , fixing his golden orbs upon Philip . " I thought everyone knew who Daisy Fleech was . " " I 'm afraid . . . " She was a portrait painter of some renown . She specialized in politicians and , being of a romantic nature , she had affairs with as many of her subjects as possible . It was her expressed ideal to have a child by every major head of state in Europe . . . or rather , the head of each major state , which would , theoretically , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six children , no more . Unfortunately , nature , as you can see , neglected to make her very attractive ; yet in spite of that handicap her success in her chosen field was quite high . She failed with Lenin , one hears , but most of the others capitulated and , of them all , Mussolini was the one who made the most profound impression on her for , just below the elbow , she has two little scars where he bit her arm through to the bone . She is quite proud of them and will show them to you anytime you like . She has even had a rather curious bracelet made of gold and amethysts so arranged that they set off the scars . " " Did she have any children ? "  | " No , alas . It seems that she was like our great queen . . . of barren stock . ' But she had an interesting time . " " I went to Amalfi . " " I wondered . I did n't want to ask . " " Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to . I 'm only a small cog in the organization . Did you enjoy Amalfi ? " " I liked the bathing . . . " Excellent water . . . so warm . I should n't mind going down there myself but the sun is the worst thing in the world for a liver complaint . " " Everything else went wrong , though . " " Wrong ? In what sense ? " " In every sense . I was n't able to deliver the message . " " Oh . " Mr Norman sighed and looked distractedly about , as though for succor . " And Guiscardo was no help at all . " " " I do n't know him . " " You know who he is . " " Who who is ? " " Guiscardo . " " Oh . . . I do wish you 'd talk to Ayre about all this . I 'm sure he 'll make much more sense than I will . " " I can hardly believe that , " said Philip , growing angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the one who had consistentlymade no sense at all ... " " Hobbies , " murmured Mr Norman depreciatingly . " What are they , by the way ? " asked Philip , deflected for a momentfrom his calculated denunciation . " Oh , one thing and another . . . " Such as ? " " Ca n't you tell ? " " The young men ? " Mr Norman blushed . " That too , of course . No , I meant the vagueness you referred to . " " What about it ? "  | " Narcotics , my boy . . . he takes heroin at the moment . But do n't ever think he is n't making sense . He is . The difficulty is that when he 's under the influence his tempo is somewhat different from that of a . . . civilian , and consequently he tends to skip certain details in a conversation which , were they supplied , would make him very easily understood , even admired , for he has an excellent mind , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no point in dissipating his wrath on Mr Norman who was not , so far as he knew , directly involved in the Guiscardo business . " I suppose I 'd better report to him , then . " " I think it would be a good idea . " " I shall also tell him that the House of Savoy can be restored without my assistance . " " Oh . . . I 'm sorry . " Mr Norman looked as concerned as it is possible for anyone to look with a mouth full of meringue . He swallowed noisily and repeated , " I am sorry . I had so looked forward to our working together . " " My connection with the movement was n't intended to continueafter Amalfi anyway . " " What about Mrs Durham , though ? " " Mrs Durham ? " " Yes . I thought you were going to approach her about our cause . I thought that was why she went to Amalfi . " " How did you know she was there ? " " One hears things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk once or twice about your party and she was all against it . " " I was afraid of that . You were n't able to change her mind at all ? " " Not at all . As a matter of fact , I never tried . We only talked about it . " " Oh dear . This is discouraging . Well , I suppose everything will work out properly in the end . By the way , how did you like Zoe Helotius ? " " How did you know I met her ? "  | " Someone saw you at a party she gave on Capri . " " You know everything . " " If only I did ! But how did you like her ? " " She was pleasant enough , I suppose . I only talked to her once . .. briefly . " " Fabulous woman . I remember such a funny story they used to tell about her . It seems she was staying with some rather distinguishedpeople at Antibes . . . Philip listened for the third time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awarding finally the prize for recitation to Mr Norman . When they had done laughing , an appointment was made for Philip to wait upon the Lord Glenellen at his palace on the following day , to report the failure of his missionin the south . Refusing nougat and another Helotius story , Philip left Doney 's and , walking quickly , he got to his hotel before the rain in quick warm drops fell on the dusty streets , while thunder clapped above the gardens of the Villa Borghese . Raindrops were in her hair and on her face . She had worn no hat . " Why wear a hat when the rain will ruin it ? " " I 'll dry you off . " He took a towel and partly dried her hair and face , liking the familiar scent of rain on woman 's hair , recalling once how he had made love on the banks of the Hudson during a summer storm and how , when the moment came , lightning had struck a near-by tree revealing an unsuspected truth in its sudden white glare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , when he had finished and they lay side by side on the bed . " I got tired of Capri . " " I thought you would . " " I do n't like that sort of thing . " " What sort of thing ? " " People who are interested only in people ... or is that what I mean ? "  | " I do n't know , my darling . You must know what you mean , though . " " Yes , I suppose I do . It 's not that I object to malice and gossip . I 'm capable of both myself , I know , but it is n't my principal in-terest . " " What is ? " He grunted . " Here we go again . " He arranged the pillow behind his head . " Myself , " he said at last , " but it sounds so awful to admit . " " No one else ? " He paused . Then he repeated , not looking at her , No one else . " " Sad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be someone else ? " " That 's not what I mean , Philip , " she said . " I 'm not really very romantic either . I 've had affairs . I have a husband . I 've liked some men , adored others . But I will admit to you now that I have never loved anyone either , nor have I ever once put someone else 's interest before my own . " She laughed softly . " We 're a fine pair of lovers , are n't we ? " Illogically , this hurt him . He did not care a great deal about her , of course , but for either to admit this truth to the other when their bodies had so recently been joined was a form of brutality which he had never before encountered . Seeing his momentary dismay , she kissed his hand . " But I adore you , " she said lightly . " Do n't look at me as though I 'd done you a frightful injury . " He recovered . " I was just startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't think I 'm ordinarily frank ? " " No . . . it 's just that I 've never known a woman to say anything like that , so soon after making love . " " Perhaps I merely said what you were thinking . " " No . That would have been childish . But then I 'm not so sure anyone ever really sacrifices his comfort for another person .. . which is , I suppose , the ultimate test and definition of love . " " Oh , many people do . "  | " What do you want from me , then ? " Regina sat up and faced him . " A great deal . " " But not love . " " Not what we usually call love , no . I do n't want self-sacrifice , no grand adolescent gestures or frenzies . What I want is something else again . " " I do n't know what you mean . " " You will . " " When ? " " Soon , I think . Part of it has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how could all that help you or , should I say , gratify you ? " " That is my business . " She spoke more sharply than she had intended and for an instant Philip had a glimpse of another Regina , one like her name , cold , unfeeling , indifferent to everythingbut power and its impersonal logic ; but the vision was brief . She was herself again . She apologized for the sharpness with which she had spoken but , as she resumed her early role , he sensed with some uneasiness that the Regina he had seen so briefly might be , after all , the real one ; and so , in that one instantof doubt , the affair ended . What might come after would perhaps seem unchanged and though they could still make love , talk intimately , affectionately , he was withdrawn , no longer committedor sympathetic , a stranger with all the privileges but none of the demands of the lover . Regina , if she was aware of his withdrawal , did not show it . She talked of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you left Capri ? " " A quick and poignant meeting in the square , " he said , selectinga number of artificial phrases to disguise his confusion , to give him time to recover . " She was guiding the Field Marshal about the town with a look of terrible triumph . I believe she thought I had written a book for when I said hello to her she told the warriorthat he should read it . Unfortunately the book , whatever it was , must not have sold very well because , before I could iden-t ify myself , they were gone . "  | " So like her . " " Why does everyone say so like her ' ? " " Philip . " He looked at her then . " What 's the matter ? " She seemed puzzled , even defensive . " Nothing 's the matter , " he said weakly . " Nothing at all . I 'm just rather put out by the whole damned trip . " " I thought you enjoyed it . " " I did , parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to hear . He went off in another direction . " It got on my nerves , that 's all . " " Have you seen Glenellen ? " " I go tomorrow for dinner . " " What will you tell him ? " " What happened , what I think of the whole thing . " " Do be careful . " Then she got up and dressed . Philip put on a dressing gown and sat down in an armchair by the open window . Monotonously the rain fell . " Where 's your husband ? " asked Philip suddenly . " Rex ? " She paused , his hairbrush in one hand . " He 's gone to Florence for a few days . I have to meet him there . " She brushed her dark hair back , her eyes watching not her own reflection in the mirror but his . " How does he feel about your . . . trip ? " " We never discuss those things . " " Have there been so many ? " She turned around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some reason you want to quarrel with me . Heaven knows why . . . but I 'm not going to quarrel with you . If I 've done something you do n't like , then tell me what it is . But please do n't be disagreeable . " Since there is never any way to handle reasonableness when one is in a bad temper , Philip was forced , rather foolishly , to apologize , to say a number of things he did n't mean while Regina , the calm mistress of the situation , continued to arrange her hair . " The rain is almost over , " he said at last , examining the brokenp143lines the drizzle made , as it slanted palely against the dark wet trees across the street . " Would you like to drive with me to Florence next week ? " " I thought you said Rex was there . " " That 's right . I 'm joining him . We 're going on to Paris the first of next week . " " I do n't think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Why not ? He likes you . " " But . . . well , after all . . . " Do n't be silly . Besides , it 's no concern of his what I do when I take a trip . I thought I 'd explained all that to you . In any case , should he have been suspicious , he would n't be if he saw us together . Obviously I would not travel to Florence with my lover . " " I do n't understand . " " Oh . . . " She came over to him where he sat and looked down at him for a moment , smiling ; then she said , " It 's my plot , do n't you see ? Our going to Florence is part of it , the most important part . Do humor me . It 's for you , after all . " " For me ? " " And for me too , in a way . But that 's my problem . " " I 'm not sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , having always found it easier to conceive than to sustain an attitude . . . the thought of hurting anyone 's feelings distressed him , more from cowardice , he knew , then from any regard for the sensibility of others even though he was able , when he chose , to identify himself with their problems . In fact , he had a tendency not only to see the other person 's side in a discussion but , often as not , perversely , to see more good in it than in his own . And , on occasion , he had ended by warmly agreeing with an antagonist even though , a second later , outside the other 's aura , he would revert to his former position , having earned ( unjustly , he always thought ) a reputation for being a faux bon homme . But for once he was not sure how to approach the situation since , very simply , he did not understand Regina . There was an elusiveness which he could not define , a continuous suggestion of mysteries whichp144she never chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could not comprehend . It made their discussions remarkably onesidedand now , since that moment early in the afternoon when he had glimpsed the hidden image , impersonal as cold marble , he was more at a loss than ever . . . not sure of anything , he parriedwith her , discussed the trip to Florence in all its aspects , ignoringof course any mention of the real reason which he could not guess and which she obviously was in no mood to reveal . " I still think there 's something awfully indelicate about my driving to Florence with you when your husband is there on political business . Perhaps he does n't care but others will . And since he does represent the United States it would be rather tactlessof us to give the gossips something to talk about . " The piety of these remarks , the sudden reverent mention of their homeland rather sickened him , but he was too busy making a point to worry about his own fraudulency . She took his remarks seriously , thereby reducing considerably her moral dominion over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotism back and forth , each hitting it higher and higher until , as so often happens , it quite disappeared in the star-spangled red , white and blue heaven . And Regina , having demonstrated a surprising lack of humor , repeated a few of her old arguments almost word for word , pleading with him , exhorting him for a reason never given , to come to Florence , not only to be her lover but to ingratiate himself with her husbandfor the sake of a political career which he had already , in one way or another , declined . When the rain had stopped she left . He had given her no definite answer and he had been , he realized sadly , childish and hostile ; this depressed him as all weakness in himself did for , as a rule , he was at ease with everyone , especially lovers . But Regina was different . . . how different he could not tell and because she puzzled him he felt , quite correctly , that he was at a disadvantageand he was undecided as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and for good or to go to Florenceand examine the mystery close-to.  |p145He  stood in the tall window looking down in the street . He saw Regina get into a taxicab and drive away . The boys who bought and sold black market money were reappearing in the street , busy as ever , while overhead the gray broke and the sun shone . " You will find Ayre somewhat changed , " said Mr Norman , as they crossed the dusty parquet of the great hall and Philip noticed for the first time the threadbare ensigns of ancient battles which hung from the walls at regular intervals , between portraits which , cracked and flaking , stared darkly at him ; the Mettellii in solemn conclave expressed their contempt for the dust and the new age . " I always find him changed , " said Philip . " Each time I see him he 's a different person . " " Yet always the same Ayre , devoted ... " " To what ? " " Life , " said Mr Norman grandly . The Mettellii looked aghast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster ( or a body ) fell crashing to the floor . Philip started , but the servant who was their guide smiled reassuringly and showed them into Ayre 's study , the same room in which Philip had been received before . A table had been set for lunch . Four places , Philip noticed , wondering if the fourth was for Evan the secretary . Ayre greeted him effusively . " So good to see you again , young man . We 've missed you here in Rome . Missed you very much . Just the other day at the baths turned to Clyde and said , Where could that nice young Americanbe ? ' " " I was in Amalfi , part of the time , " said Philip precisely . " I remember , " said Ayre , and an expression which could only be called furtive passed over his lizard face . " We 'll go into that in good time . But now let us dine , my dears . " Fussing and chattering , he put first Clyde then Philip on his right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down.  | " Is Mr Morgan coming ? " asked Philip , indicating the empty place across from Glenellen . " Of course not . He 's in Wales , where I hope he 'll stay . " " He did leave ? " asked Mr Norman , interested . " Yes , several days ago . I must say , too , that I feel well out of it . When I think of the sacrifices I 've made , I could do someone an injury . " He looked balefully at Philip as though he were an accompliceof the villainous Morgan . Then , collecting himself , he smiled , revealing the bad teeth and nasty gums . " You must excuse the outburst . I 've been on edge lately . Very . Very on edge . But now here comes dinner . " A white-jacketed boy brought them caviar and blinis . A feast , Philip decided ; his resolve to be stern and intractable wavered . Vodka was served in small chilled carafes and it was not until he 'd finished the blinis and two glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunic without pockets or tie . He was allowed no opportunity , however , to comment , for between them Mr Norman and Glenellen controlled the conversation , moved easily if eccentrically through history , literature , medicine and finally politics . He was forced to wait until both Glenellen and Clyde were out of breath . Then , quickly , taking advantage of this unusual hiatus , he said , " I saw Guiscardo . " Glenellen stared at him , his pale eyes glassy in the candle-light and his face red and shining from the vodka . " Oh . " He looked at Mr Norman , who looked away , worrying a pickled beet with his fork . " Guiscardo , eh ? " Glenellen cleared his throat . " Charming , did n't you think ? " " No . " " Trouble of some kind ? " " Yes . I was n't able to deliver the papers . " " The papers ? Oh . " Glenellen looked puzzled . " I was under the impression that you did deliver the papers . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a message to me by a mutual friend , a man of the highest integrity . "  | " I went to the antique shop and Guiscardo was wearing a mask ... " Glenellen chuckled . " Just like the old days , Clyde , is n't it ? " Clyde agreed . " He told me to take the papers to a certain church a few nights later . He refused to touch them . " Glenellen 's eyes opened very wide at this . He blinked furiously and a tear glittered in the corner of one eye . " But he said that you gave them to him . " " Are you positive ? " " Of course I 'm positive . Not only do I have his word for it , but later events , unhappily , proved that he had received my message . . . you see he gave it to the police . " " The police ? " Philip was frightened . " I thought he was one of your most important people . " " He entertained Republican sentiments in secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did the police do ? " " They sold me the papers . What else ? Is n't all business done that way ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't know . " Philip hardly knew what to say or do . " You . . . did n't have any trouble , did you ? With the police , I mean ? " " Of course I did . You do n't think I enjoy giving them money do you ? I denounced the police captain to his face , told him a thing or two , but in the end I paid . One must , after all . " " And Guiscardo ? " " I am no longer in communication with him . I felt he 'd let me down . " " I should think so . " " He sold me a bronze which he swore he 'd authenticated , an Augustan piece . Well , of course , he had n't . I do n't know how well you know him but he is very nearly the laziest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business matters . I sent him a wire saying that one of the Vatican curators had proved this piece ap148forgery . . . would he give me my money back ? No . He sent me another bronze , a companion piece which was also fake . The man 's perfidy is endless . " " But you are still fond of him , " said Clyde sweetly . " Of course I am . It 's not his fault he is badly organized . " " But how did he get the papers ? " Philip was dogged . " You gave them to him . " " I did not give them to him . " " Then how did he get them ? " Glenellen 's voice was growing irritable . " I do n't know , " said Philip , wondering if perhaps he had drunk too much vodka . " What makes you think you did n't give them to him ? " asked Clyde suddenly . " First , because I did n't . I still can remember most things that have happened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I broke the seal and read the message . " " You should not have done that , " said Glenellen , unexpectedly mild . " It would have been much better to have dropped the whole business . After all , Guiscardo did have the real message . " " Which I could not deliver and so , having failed , I read what you had written . " " And what was that ? " " One word , " said Philip , astonished at his own boldness . " A Greek word , Asebia . " " I do n't know a word of Greek , " said Glenellen flatly . " It would seem , " said Clyde , " that you either delivered the message and forgot it ( somewhat farfetched but possible ) or Guiscardo got it from you without your knowledge . " " Since you say he knew the contents , then that was probably what happened . But , if it was , why did he send me off on a crazy errand to that church , at midnight , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his voice strained as he attempted , unsuccessfully , to hold back a belch . " Asebia was n't your message . "  |p149Glenellen  shook his head , his eyes bulging with indigestion , his hand on his stomach . " It looks as though someone were playing a joke on you , " said Clyde with his usual reasonableness . " Perhaps Guiscardo had a servant at the hotel substitute his message for the one Ayre intendedyou to deliver . There are any number of possibilities ... ' ' " And none quite plausible , " said Philip . " Let 's forget about it , shall we ? " Glenellen motioned to the boy to take the plates away , to bring in the dessert . " I have a good reason for not wanting to remember . " " A very good reason , " agreed Mr Norman . " Things are not as they were in Italy , " said Glenellen . " Situationis fluid . . . how fluid , none can say . There have been certainrealignments which I believe you should know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come as a surprise to you , " added Mr Norman uneasily . " You see , Ayre has .. . " Seen the light ! I have abandoned the House of Savoy to its fate . Yes , I have made the plunge . It was n't easy , believe me . I weighed the pros and I weighed the cons . I went through the entire section on Italy in the Encyclopedia Britannica and when I finished I knew that I had been wrong these many years , lulled to sleep by the decadent music of a dying order . The awakeningcame , however ; and not a moment too soon , for I can see that had I continued much longer to wander in the morass of reactionaryismI might have ended by losing all touch with the People , who are , we will all admit , the only reason for political action , both here and abroad . On a Wednesday morning I realizedwith horror what I had so narrowly missed becoming . By afternoon I had acted . I canceled all my engagements for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintances , giving them fair warning of the change , allowing them , if they chose , to sever their relations with me . Many did . Some few did not , among them Clyde . Others I have not heard from . Their silence I interpret as a tacit disapproval , and so I have been forced to accept , stoically I hope , an abrupt yet necessary end top150involvements which , in this perilous and exacting time , did afford me some pleasure . The Pope , among others less illustrious , did not acknowledge my letter , to my great surprise considering all that I 've done for the Church . But I will not be petty . I want no one ever to say that Ayre Glenellen was petty in good times or bad . Which reminds me , Clyde , I am resigning my seat in the House of Lords . " " Do you think that wise ? " Mr Norman seemed quite concerned . " What is wisdom ? " philosophized the peer . Seeing that there was no satisfactory answer to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to the point : that if one took a certain stand , then one 's other deeds must of necessity be consistent with that central attitude . What then was the stand he had taken ? asked Philip , confused , wondering when he might politely excuse himself . " Ayre became a member of the Communist Party last Wednesday , " said Mr Norman in a voice which betrayed not only melancholybut a certain pride in his friend 's ability to do the unexpected . " Sweet Jesus ! " said Philip . " It involves something higher than politics , " said Glenellen carefully . " You see , my faith in the essential goodness of man has been reaffirmed by those members of the party with whom I have talked . In any event , you can understand now my somewhat rude lack of interest in your mission to Amalfi . . . a mission which you carried out superbly , I may add . But please do n't think me frivolous . My change is not only a matter of logic . It is a spiritual one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer now . Death to the deviationists ! " He drank a long toast to this sentiment , a toast in which neither Philip nor Mr Norman took part . They were just getting up from the table when a youth in a checkered shirt and corduroy trousers , with tangled black hair and the bright eyes of an animal , entered the room . With a glad cry Ayre greeted him and for a long silly moment they pounded each other here and there in an excess of manly party spirit . Atp151last , both of them breathless , Glenellen introduced his dinner guests to Ferdinando , a Communist , a worker from Trasteveri , who shook hands vigorously . As he spoke only Italian , Philip was unable to follow the intricacies of his conversation but from the expression on Glenellen 's face he decided that dialectic was not the young man 's forte . " Selfless , " said Glenellen , as they sat down in front of the empty fireplace . " Absolutely selfless . " " Who ? " asked Philip , watching the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hand for a moment lingering on the box itself , as though assessing with his fingertips its value . " Ferdinando . He left his wife and two children for the sake of the party . Not since the early Christian martyrs have there been such men among us . I kiss the hem of his garment . " And for one embarrassing moment Philip was afraid he was going to do exactlythat , but the arrival of brandy thwarted his gesture and they drank a toast instead to the current International . The young man was obviously onto a good thing , Philip decided , watching him gulp the brandy . " I speak English , " he said , turning to Philip , prepared to charm him , suspecting that he might be a rival . " So do I , " said Philip ; he was not understood . Glenellen then spoke to the youth in Italian and Mr Norman turned to Philip and exclaimed , " The subleties of politics !

Both of them then looked at Mr Norman and Philip ; Glenellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Break your glasses . " With a pained expression , Mr Norman tossed his glass into the fireplace . It did not break . Philip said , " I have n't finished yet . " Ferdinando got to his feet and broke Mr Norman 's glass on the hearthstone with the heel of his worn G.I. boot . " I gather , " said Mr Norman when more glasses had been brought , more brandy drunk , and Glenellen and his political mentor had withdrawn to the other end of the room to discuss revolution , " that you are not sympathetic to all of this . " " No , I 'm not . " " You must be tolerant . " " I used to think that I must be , too . But as I grow older I find more and more things intolerable . " " Yet in his way he 's a fine person .

" " Oh to travel again , wherever one chooses , to be young ! " Mr Norman was about to slip off again . But , getting to his feet , Philip pulled him back to the mundane moment . " I must say good night . "  |p153The  farewells were affectionate . Ferdinando hit him on the back and Glenellen wept a little . " It has been a fine friendship . One that has meant more to me than you have perhaps realized . It must end , though , as everythingmust , sooner or later . Never think though that my love for Him separated us . It did not . Caesar and God , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . . . the Spirit . Were n't you aware of it at dinner ? His spirit . The empty place at the table . " " Whose spirit ? " " Nikolai Lenin 's , " said Lord Glenellen . " Who else ? " In one of the tall towers a thousand candles gleamed and flickered in the soft wind , as though alive , in contrast to the fixed constellations of electric lights which circled this old tower and defined the limits of the hill-rimmed city of Florence , crossed by a winding gray river in which were reflected city lights and many stars . He stood alone in the window looking down on the city , wondering whether the pleasant scent of the warm night was from orange or from lemon , from mimosa or from the rich gardens which had been carved in terraces out of the hills of Fiesole where he was now , in a villa at a party , shortly before the moonrise and the end of the green summer , the beginning of the burning autumn , bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aware of the date but not of the fact , and he quoted to himself that line of Herrick 's which has to do with rosebuds and their proper place . " I thought I 'd lost you , " said Regina , crossing the darkened I ibrary and coming out onto the balcony where Philip stood . " Oh , it is lovely . Look , the tower ! They 've lit all the candles . I wonder why ? It must be some saint 's day or rather the day of one of the old gods . People are still faithful , you know . . . quite un-changed. "  | " They gave the gods new names ? " " Names change from age to age but the gods are constant ... I think . Do n't you ? " " I have n't thought of it . " " Are you a Christian ? " This shattered him . He lived in a period where it was not polite for well-bred people to discuss their spiritual convictions or speculations and for Regina , the great materialist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official religion of his culture was almost as shocking as it would have been , a generation earlier , for her to have asked him if he had ever enjoyedsexual congress . He laughed nervously and wondered what to answer . To say he was an agnostic sounded too much like everyone else and to say that he was an atheist would place him , socially , in the same class with undergraduates who 'd only just discovered to their horror that the rules of conduct they had always been taught were heavenly inspired were , after all , only a makeshift convenience , broken by everyone including their stern guardians . Yet the truth was somewhere between those two worn words . He had thought a great deal about death and he 'd long ago come to the conclusion that it would be the end of that enchantingcreature Philip Warren who , in the present , moved about with such grace and vitality , entertaining marvelous dreams , more marvelous than those of anyone else who had ever lived , dreams which would be set free again in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move , no longer able to hold even one dream within that shell of bone where now , on the edge of Florence in the ever-lengthening eternal present , he boldly exercisedthis whole knowledge , including in itself the dream , Regina and all the earth , the tower with its thousand candles and the sky with its endless meaningless display of stars , arranged by chance or , worse yet , not arranged at all , timeless , with neither beginning nor end ; a fact which he would only partly comprehend : a structure whose origin was irrelevant and whose end wasp155not . . . since how could there be an end to that which was timeless ? Needless to say , this majestic vision had very little to do , directly at least , with Regina 's question and Philip , controlling an impulse to declare , instruct , preach ( he 'd given up his literary ambitions , obviously ) , said that he was not a Christian , that he usually found himself quarreling with their morality , while their dogma had always impressed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So many people feel that now , " said Regina , leaning against the railing of the balcony , the party within forgotten . " Something will happen soon . " " What ? A new messiah ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " Has he already come , do you think ? Marx ? Freud ? Lenin ? " " I do n't think so ; but I feel it in my bones and I 'm never wrong about such things . " Philip laughed . " You could hardly have had much experience . It 's been a long time since the last one , you know . " " That is n't what I mean . I . . . but it 's too hard to explain . I hope the new one will respect the old gods , though . " " You love them , do n't you ? " She nodded . The moon rose from behind the hills , red as blood , like a cold sun in the east . " They are different , you know , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are facts . Some are simple : the sea , the sun , the air . Some are more complex : violence , love , the mother , the father . It makes no real difference which is Queen of I-leaven , Mary or Isis or Juno , as long as the idea of the mother exists , as it always will . Sometimes the mother dominates . Sometimes she does not and her son reigns . There are periods when war is regnant , or justice . . . . " Or love ? " " Can you see to the end of it already ? " She looked at him oddly , as though he had frightened her , but she had no reason to bep156alarmed for he had not understood ; he shook his head in bewilderment . " I see nothing . Do you mean ... " " I meant only that there 's a conflict between the natural gods who are , for the race at least , constant , and the messiahs who wish to rearrange the hierarchy of heaven , banishing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , or attempting murder , for in the end it is the messiah who dies , a victim of the same forces he attempted to govern . No matter how appealing or ruthless his dogma , the old gods defeat him in the end ; they change their names . . . Saint This-One , pray for me , give me wealth . Saint That-One , pray for me , give me strength ... Hail Mary , full of grace . . . as indeed she was , and is . " He nearly saw the design , but a shadow before the moon hid the pale face beside him and the warm flower-burdened wind lulled him and he forgot what in an instant he had almost known . " We 'd better go in to the party . Your husband . . . " " Is indifferent . But we 'll go in anyway . Are you enjoying your-self ? " " Yes , I think so . It 's the first really Italian party I 've been to . 0 Something of a novelty . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes . Rex says that when he wants anything done he goes to him rather than to the ministers . " In the drawing room , Philip stared a long time at this powerful man , wondering what it was that made him so different from other men ; he could come to no conclusion , though . He was a man like any other : rather short , partly bald , middle-aged and , in spite of the company , bored and distracted-looking . Philip gave it up . The problem was insoluble , as he had already discoveredthis last week in Florence in constant attendance upon Rex Durham who had , during all that time , not made an original or profound observation on any subject . A suspicion was beginning to form in Philip 's mind that a certain type of energetic mediocrity might , after all , be politically more useful in a republicansociety than brilliance or wit or passion . The fact that noth/ing Mr Durham ever said gave him away was , no doubt , a positivevirtue and although he was not capable of inspiring he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , make enemies for himselfor party . Pondering the nature of power and earthly dominion from one age to the next , Philip sat down in a chair between two sofas which contained a number of decorative ladies and gentlemen . Several turned to him and , shifting easily from Italian to English , included him in their discussion . " We were discussing the Church , " said one gentleman , with a brilliant smile , glossy mustache , and sporting in his buttonhole ( as the late E. Phillips Oppenheim used to say ) the discreet ribbonof some knightly order . " And we were being so anti-American , " said a thick vivacious lady . " You were . Not I. " " We were talking Church gossip . " " What is the gossip ? " asked Philip politely , pretending to listen , his eyes on Regina . " The Roman hierarchy has come to a secret decision . I have this on the best authority . If the Russians conquer Europe they will make an agreement with Stalin that if he leaves the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Romans feel , would be far more terrible . " " Alternative ? What do you mean ? " asked Philip , his eyes shiftingfrom Regina to the white teeth and gleaming black mustache . " Flight . The removal of the Church to America and an AmericanPope . The Irish-American hierarchy is considered boorish by the Romans , more dangerous to the faith than an open tyrant who will fall , in time . . . the Church has survived worse catastrophesthan communism . She might not , the Romans feel , survive the Irish-Americans . " " Suppose Stalin persecuted the Church ? " " Then there would be new catacombs and more saints in I leaven . " Philip listened a little longer , drank brandy and then , getting it signal from Regina , he excused himself and joined her and Rex beneath an age-darkened painting of those sharp , shrewd featuresp158the remarkable Cosimo had , with such triumph , displayed to an earlier , more vivid age . " Enjoying yourself , Mr Warren ? " " Very much , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we get back home . " Philip could never determine whether his continual omission of the pronoun " I " was the result of modesty or merely a trick to make himself seem precise , direct , a time-saver without fuss or frills . " Regina , here , tells me you might want to take a fling at the great game . Think you 'd like it ? " " Why . . . yes . " He tried to get Regina 's eye but she was smilingat someone across the room . " You 're your father 's son all right . " Rex chuckled deeply and Philip recalled , rather sourly , his father 's contempt for politics . " We 've enjoyed seeing you these last few days . Glad to find someone Regina likes . Most people bore her to death and , of course , I 'm tied up all the time . " " I 've enjoyed . . . " " She 's shrewd . Never makes a mistake . Always take her advice when it comes to people . Thinks you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . Unmarried . That 's good at this point . You 're a lawyer ; a veteran ; a judge 's son . Can you make a good speech ? " " I " It 's a trick . You 'll pick it up . Remember to tell them only what they want to hear . " In short staccato sentences Durham outlined a political career for him . Philip watched him , fascinated , with growing respect . The man might lack inspiration and brilliance but he was a thorough craftsman : like a mechanic taking apart a car , he dismantled the ship of state in a few plain sentences and then , this done , he put it back together again , describing all the while the fundamentals of navigation , the direction and velocity of prevailing winds . When he finished , he stared at Philip with his small gray eyes , bloodshot beneath heavy brows . " Give it a whirl ? " . " I think so , " said Philip , trapped.  | " Leaving tomorrow , you know . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Farewell party tonight as you gathered . Off to Paris first . Salt mines . Do n't look forward to it . Ca n't do business with the French . Talk all the time about la Patrie , think all the time about money . Americans just the opposite . Will you be in Paris ? " " Not right away . " " Regina may stay over for the fall . I 'm going back to Washingtonin a few weeks . Probably wo n't see you till the fall . " " Or winter , more likely . " " That 's right . Your year . Come see me in Washington , or on the river if we 're there . " " I will . " " Good boy . " Politicians swept him away from Philip and , for the moment , he and Regina were alone together . " You see , " she said , " how easy it will be ? " " Why did you tell him I was interested ? " " Because you are . " " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why ? " He looked at her frowning . " I ca n't see why it should concern you so . " " But it does , " she said lightly . " So there . " " And what do you want from me in exchange for all this ? " " Nothing , " she said evasively , not looking at him . " I ca n't believe that . " " Is it so strange ? Must every motive be selfish ? " " Yes and no . The word means nothing . I only feel . . " What ? " " That you are not candid . " " When you tell me that you want a career I will tell you what you want to know . " " And name your price ? " " And name my price . " She laughed . " Now I 've confused you and I did n't mean to . I hate people who are mysterious , do n't you ?  --  " I wo n't be able to answer you until my year is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . "  | " Where shall we meet ? " " Any place you like . " Addresses were exchanged and various geographical positio charted as they compared itineraries ; then the party ended . 1 . guests went home , carrying with them all the anxieties of the age a beleaguered church , intellectuals in search of dogmas , a ba barian horde poised upon the eastern marches , a materialisti. giant beyond the western sea , neither civilized nor barbarian .. each age has its tyrants , thought Philip , preparing for bed ; and h was soothed by this knowledge as all properly educated Amidcanboys are when they come to Europe and visit ancient rooms in which all the fears of other days have been resolved by ti or superseded by equivalent crises . He turned out the light and thought of what Regina had said about the old gods , and he wondered if she were right : were they constant after all ? Would they reappear now that the last messiah 's work had been corruptod and undone . . . the son giving way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped so , knowing that when men are wise they love the natural more than dogma , more than revelation . For an instant Philip was nearly convinced , as he hovered betweenwaking and sleep : they were alive again , for him at least ; but then he recalled the solemn humorless religion of the barbarians , both Eastern and Western , and he saw with Virgilian clarity a new , more monstrous figure appear , furiously denouncing the body and the spirit , refashioning history , casting a long shadow upon the future , imposing an arbitrary orthodoxy with a fanatic vehemence which , if observed in a lesser man , would have led to exile or imprisonment , murder or therapy , certainly not to glory . The moon set and the stars were drowning in the pale dawn when finally he slept ; near by the wind put out those of the tower 's candles which had burned all the night.  |p161AT  THis point , the bank of the river was some twenty yards above the muddy water , a steep incline scattered with rocks and sun-withered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwindled in the heat , withdrawing perceptibly from its winter banks , uncovering , here and there , sandbars and islands which would grow larger , support life , until the rains began again and , like so many miniature Atlantises , the islands would again vanish . He stood on the river bank looking down at the water gliding from south to north through the dry land . A solemn bloody sun was setting opposite him , its circle bisected already by the chalky mountains across the river . As he watched , it sank quickly , pulling the day after it , bleeding the sky of light until , when the sun was gone , the day was , too . There was no time of twilight in this season , only day and night . He lit a cigarette ; the familiar brief glow of match fire reassuredhim as he turned away from the river and walked toward the colonnade beyond the row of dark palms . He wondered , as he walked , if those dead worshipers had felt the same wonder in the presence of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same temples , cluttered still with all the debris of faith and glory . He decided not , for , discounting their official preoccupation with death and the attendant details of dying , theyp164must have been , all in all , more cheerful than not . And those few who had the leisure and the learning to speculate were , no doubt , too much preoccupied with family life , with the neverendingstruggle for political preferment , to brood too much upon that last journey from the east bank to the west bank of the river . He thought of his own river , cold and broad , stately in summer , gleaming with ice fragments in the winter , as unlike this muddy turgid river as possible and yet , like it , a source of life . It soothed him to walk by a river , made him feel less strange , more at home , as if he were closer to the center of the world . He entered the roofless temple and stood between two thick high columns , like Samson and , since there was no moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out , indistinctly , variousshrines , some still roofed , others shattered by weather and the wars . He stepped down onto the old pavement of the temple and , walking carefully , he proceeded to the center of the main court where he stood , a little frightened by the dark and by the immensityof those acanthus-crowned columns , black against the blue night , which surrounded him in unbroken ranks on every side . Then , far away , he heard the sound of automobiles , the shouts of street vendors and , thinking of dinner , he left the temple , crossed a field and walked several blocks down a palm-edged road to the hotel where he was staying , a rambling stucco building on the edge of that town whose lights he could now see , dim and yellowalong the river bank , a town of whitewashed mud with tall striped minarets and cupolas , with narrow haphazard streets , a small town oppressed , obsessed by the ruins which surrounded it , on which it perched , like a living weed in a bone heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quais , of what had been the greatest city in the world three thousand years before . Too long a time , thought Philip wearily , with a sense of having , without warning , strolled out of time altogether . The manager of the hotel , fortunately , recalled him to the present for , as Philip had discovered the day of his arrival , he was fascinated by America and his English , which was good , wasp165decorated with colloquialisms either so new or so old that Philip often had trouble understanding them . Needless to say , the manager , a Mr Koyoumdjian from Armenia , got not only his Iil conversation but his love of America from the movies which he attended zealously , reverently , often seeing , he confessed , the same movie four or five times , learning something new each time , some detail of American life which he had not known before , some expression he could add to his ever-lengthening American line . No sooner had Philip entered the lobby than Mr Koyoumdjianwas upon him , his face scarlet with crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out . Just after you left . " " Who has done what ? " " Your friend Mr Willys . . . with a gat . He tried to take his life . Such a caper ! " " What happened ? You mean he really ... " " Shot himself . Except that he missed . . . just nicked the top of one ear . The sawbones came and gave him something to makehim sleep . " I'Il " But that 's terrible . " " Real excitement , though ; you can bet your life . I 've got the rod in my safe . Want to see it ? " " No thanks . Is he awake now do you think ? " " Yes , I sent one of the bozos in with some tea and toast . Though why a man has just shot himself should be fed tea and toast I could n't know . Maybe you 'd better see him . Cheer him , gyp . " I think I will . " Philip went to his own room first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . He always moved slowly during the day , careful not to exert himself , to keep from sweating . The nights ights bothered him more than the days with its canopy of mosquito netting . He dressed , putting on khaki trousers and a polo shirt . Then , ordering dinner from one of the servants , he went into Mr Willys 's room.  |p166The  would-be suicide lay inert , a mountain of flesh behind the white mosquito netting ; purple pajamas with white piping contained those rolls of flesh which composed the wretched Briggs Willys . A bed lamp was turned on and the night table was cluttered with medicine bottles . There was a strong odor of iodine in the room . " I hear you 've had an accident , " said Philip , attempting cheeriness . " How do you feel ? " " It was not an accident , " said a thin voice , emerging from the still , fat center of the large iron bed . But I thought ... ' " I tried to kill myself and I failed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hand pushed aside the netting and the bandagedhead and shoulders of Mr Willys were revealed . FIe was not an ugly man nor was he old ; he was just very fat . His features were small and rather indistinct , since one 's examination of them was invariably distracted by the full shining cheeks , the ripe tier of chins , the splendid ruddy coloring which the white bandage emphasized . " Nov that 's no way to talk , " said Philip , sitting down in a chair near the bed . " It may be no way to talk but it 's the way I feel . Next time I wo n't fail . " " You 're not going to try to shoot yourself again ? " A crafty expression rippled across the vast face and the tiny eyes disappeared altogether , until they resembled twin navels . " No , not shoot . Poison may be my next weapon . " " Surely you do n't really want to die . " " And why not ? " " You have so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " There was no immediate answer to this . Looking at the matter dispassionately , Philip could see very little reason for Mr Willys to continue living with such an outlandish body , one that not only set him apart from the rest of mankind but one which gave him continual anxiety ; for him to walk across a room was a phys/ical effort not unlike a decathlon for someone of more ordinary proportions . But Philip was conscience-bound to be life 's advocate . " Any number of things . I do n't know you well enough to be able to mention your pleasures ... " " Sleep , " sighed the thin voice . " I love only sleep . " " Food , perhaps , " hazarded Philip , tactlessly . " Certainly not . I eat like a bird . I loathe food . A cup of consommeand a cracker is all I ever need . Just because . . . " I was only making a guess , " said Philip , quickly ; Mr Willys fell back against his five pillows with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Philip could tell , shut . " Still , there are so many things to do when you 're alive that you ca n't do dead , " he continued , becoming more and more inane ; it made no difference , however , for Mr Willys was not listening . " You can travel , for instance . You have an income , I gather . You do n't have to work for a living . Think how other peopleenvy you . . . being able to travel anywhere you like . . . " I came to Egypt to die , " said Mr Willys suddenly . " I was afraidI would n't have the courage to kill myself so I decided to come lip the Nile to the hottest town with a decent hotel and there , if I failed to kill myself , I should die of the heat . I ca n't stand the heat . My heart is not strong . My kidneys are bad . My liver is swollen out of shape . Yet I have been here in Luxor in this hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . And now I 'm unable even to shoot myself for , at the last moment , my handlook and I only scratched my ear . Oh , it 's too terrible . " Sobs convulsed the purple mountain like an earthquake . The bed creaked . " There now , " said Philip over and over again until the crisis Ilad passed . " What you should do is go on a nice trip to the mountains , someplace where it is cool , like Switzerland , and there , perhaps , take a cure . . . " Altitudes make me dizzy , and there is no cure . None at all . It 's either wait until the heat kills me or else take poison . " " When ? "  | " When what ? " " When do you plan to take poison ? " " Well , I have n't picked a date yet . Soon , though , very soon . Then it will be over . " " Have you thought what sort of poison you would take ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't . Something with a pleasant taste , however . Something quick . " " Will you do it sober or drunk ? " " Well , I 'd planned it sober but now that you mention it , it might be easier to do if I had been drinking . Yes , that is a good plan . Thanks very much for the idea . I 'd probably never have thought of it . " " That 's all right . I just want to make it easy for you . " " I appreciate that , Mr Warren . " " Do you know much about poisons ? " " Not a thing . I did consider swallowing some iodine this eveningbut I 'm sure it would burn like fire . " " No , iodine is out . What you need is something like strychnine . " How do you happen to know so much about these things ? " " I used to read a great many detective stories , " said Philip , quite carried away by the situation . He was alarmed , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him some strychninethe next morning . " I suppose you can get it without a doctor 's prescription ? " " Oh , I doubt that , " said Philip . " I 'll see what I can do though . " " That will be splendid : to be out of this mess for good ! By the way , I shall want to be cremated . " " Awful mess for the hotel , though , do n't you think ? I mean , your taking poison in one of their rooms . " " Wo n't do them a bit of harm . The legal end of it should n't take more than a few hours . Besides , it will give that despicable manager something to talk about . He took my gun away , you know . " " You could hardly blame him . " " But I do . " A barefoot servant appeared at the door and in/formed Philip his dinner was ready . After promising to go first thing in the morning to buy poison , Philip said good night and went downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . French doors opened onto a darkened garden . Flies buzzed about the electric light and fans suspended from the ceiling slowly twirled , idly disturbing the hot air . A white-coated Negro , wearing a dirty fez , brought him a number of dispiriting courses of simple food , badly cooked . The manager came by for a little chat as he was drinking the thick muddy black coffee . " Did you see him ? Was he green about the gills ? " " No , he was in the pink , " said Philip , getting into the spirit of the manager 's conversation the way he had Mr Willys 's . " Why do you think he did it ? " " He seems to be tired of life and so he tried to kick . . " " The bucket , " finished Mr Koyoumdjian with a smile of one Mason meeting another in the Libyan desert . " I suppose it never occurred to him how disagreeable it would be for us if he killed himself . " " It was my impression that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own problems . " " Problems ! " exploded Mr Koyoumdjian . " He has money , has n't he ? " " A great deal , I think . " " Then what problems does he have ? He can go anywhere he likes . . . do anything he wants . Buy any doll . . . " The managerpaused . " He is n't impotent , is he ? " " I did n't ask ; but I would n't be at all surprised , with that weight . " " Weight has nothing to do with it . There 's an old man about in the town here who weighs twenty stone and he 's the busiest man in Luxor in regard to the frails . He has a couch specially tilted so . . . " I do n't think that would help our Mr Willys , " said Philip , not wanting to hear any more details.  | " Perhaps not . I wonder if I should have him moved to the Missionhospital . . . it 'd be their lookout then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is n't much he can do without a gun and I do n't suppose he has a knife . . . even if he did , it would have to be a long one to penetrate those layers of flesh . " Mr Koyoumdjian laughed heartily at this grim conceit . " Perhapsyou 're right . " " Are there any more guests coming this month ? " The last party , a group of cotton scientists from the United States , had left that morning and there was no one in the hotel but Mr Willys and Philip . " Not for ten days . " " How on earth do you make enough in summer to keep a place like this running ? " " We do n't . But the owner decided not to shut up this year . We usually close in May . Of course , during the winter , our big season , we 're crowded all the time . " " Do you like having to stay here in this heat ? " Mr Koyoumdjian shrugged . " It 's a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for when , after an early breakfast , Philip took a stroll in the garden the next morning he discovered that another guest had arrived in the night . She was seated on an iron bench at the end of a lane of magnolias or what Philip took to be magnolia trees : this garden was a strange one with flowers and trees he had never seen before , mysteriously set out in cabalistic designs with paths which led nowhere , a maze of heavily scented green , decorated with white and red and yellow blossoms . " Lovely morning , " he said , approaching her . " Yes . The only cool time of the day . " " May I sit down ? " " Certainly . " She moved over and he sat beside her , conscious of the green world all about them ; there was a hedge behind the bench and a sudden right-angled turn of the path in front of themp171gave the illusion of a roofless green-walled room , oblong and carpeted with grass , while flowers still damp with night broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . For some reason he found himself thinking of a kindergarten he 'd once attended , one with grass-green walls on which , in the spring , to celebrate the sickening Flora , the children had hung untidy paper flowers of their own manufacture . Looking down this natural room he almost expected to see a sandbox in one corner . " Did you just arrive in Luxor ? " he asked . " This morning . " He liked her voice , which was cool and even , an educated American or perhaps British voice . He moved about on the bench so that he could see her more clearly . She was handsome , though not pretty in a contemporary sense for her nose was large , like a Julian portrait bust , and her skin was white , unpainted . Yet her eyes were extraordinary , pale gray with long dark lashes , and her hair was a fine auburn , drawn softly back from her face and gathered in a bun at the back . Her figure was good , but he could not tell if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , though not young , not old either . . . no gray in her undyed hair , no deep lines in her smooth face . Thirty-five , he decided , noticing that she wore no wedding ring . " Not the best time of year to visit Egypt , " he commented . " I like Egypt any time of year , " she said . " You 've been here before ? " " Many , many times . In fact , my father 's family used to live here a long time ago . " " Then it must be like home . " " Yes , like home . Have you been here long ? " The question was so politely stated , like the stylized inquiriesinto one 's health people make on meeting one another the firsttime , that he very nearly did n't answer her at all : then , recallinghimself , he told her he had been in Egypt for a month , that he'dbeen in Luxor five or six days and that he was seeing everythingthere was to see in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , coming to it fresh like this . . . even in the heat . " " I do n't mind the hot weather . The rest , of course , is wonder/ful . I 've never felt so relaxed before . For the first time , nothing matters . . . no anxiety , no memory . . . nothing but the presentand the past . " " The ruins , " she said . " That 's what does it , of course . It 's very hard to dream of the future when the past is all around one , remindingone that what is has been before and will be again , over and over and over . . . . " " Proving , perhaps , that individual acts are nothing in themselves , except to the doer at the moment he acts . " " Yet human beings love the idea of posterity . " She smiled . " It makes us feel important . Think how confident Thutmose , the great king in these parts , must have been that his name would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that Egypt under his descendants would remain unchanged , very much as it had been for the thousands of years that preceded his own reign . One consolation , of course , is that he does n't know his corpse has been dug up , the wrappings removed , the bones X-rayed , the skull measured and compared with his portraits , his diseases duly noted , as though he were some prehistoric Java man instead of a successful soldier and politician . There 's no long fame for mortals . None at all . " " As Thomas Browne once said , " smiled Philip , wondering how they had got off onto this particular tack . As the reader has noticed , Philip has a tendency to drift off into abstract discussions which makes him , in many ways , the perfect protagonist for a novel since he can be counted on to get himself , at a moment 's notice , into deep waters , or what are to him deep waters : the dangerousshallows of the vast sea of philosophy where many a young man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has run aground on the shoals of dialectic . " Are you staying here ? " asked Philip . She nodded . " I always stay here when I am in Luxor . " " The manager told me he was expecting no one for a few days . " " We 're old friends , Mr Koyoumdjian and I. He 's never surprised when I appear without notice . " " Have you some business here ? " asked Philip tentatively , real/izing it was none of his business and that she appeared to be quite capable of reminding him that it was not . But she only smiled and said there was something she wanted to see , that she was interested in archeology : " Disproving , perhaps , my own theory that all is forgotten since I for one am devoted to seeing that nothing is forgotten , that every second of history is accounted for . " " History or , rather , legend is seldom wholly forgotten , " said Philip with the careful diffidence of a man making an epigram . " Men always are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common assent , almost reverently , they both rose and walked silently down the green path to the hotel. 4* " I see you 've met Miss Oliver , " said the manager , coming over to their table later that day at lunch , where Philip was toying with a number of vivid stewed fruits , all poisonous-looking and tasteless . " Yes , we met in the garden , " said Miss Oliver whose first name Philip had already been informed was Sophia . " A surprise visitor , " said Mr Koyoumdjian . " You could have knocked me over with a feather when she walked in the hotel this morning as cool as a cucumber and asked for her old room . More investigations , eh ? " " Just one more , " she said , removing a half-drowned fly from her coffee . " I may have to go out to the desert for a few days . I 'm not sure . " " What 's the desert like ? " asked Philip , hoping this would lead to an invitation ; it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the desert and , by the time she finished an interesting account of the Arab method of divining the presence of water , the fly , which had been moribund , pulled itself together and flew away , heading directly , Philip noticed , for a coil of flypaper alreadynasty with the corpses of its fellows . He pondered the possiblemeaning of this omen , coming at last to the conclusion that it meant nothing at all.  | " Have you seen Mr Willys this morning ? " he asked suddenly , when Miss Oliver had concluded her remarks and was thoughtfullysipping coffee , her thoughts far away , no doubt in some distant wadi , her eyes narrowed as though against the glare of bright sun on sand . The manager had indeed seen Mr Willys . " He seems in good spirits , keeping his pecker up . I think he 'll be all right now . He spoke of coming down to dinner tonight . He asked to see you by the way . Said you had something for him . " " Who is this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirage , as Philip explained the details of Mr Willys 's obsession . She had , however , no comment to make on the situation other than a conventional word or two and a perfunctory expression of sympathy for the trouble the manager had been put to . Then she turned to Philip and , discovering that he was to go to Karnak that afternoon with his dragoman , asked if she might go along . Making a date for five o'clock when the sun would be less violent , they parted . Philip found Mr Willys still in bed , but now quite nude , without even a mosquito netting to diffuse the horror . " Good morning , " said Philip from the door , giving the other a chance to cover himself but Mr Willys did not have the energy or the desire . Instead he pulled himself up so that his stomach with its mottled pink flesh covered his genitals , giving him the curiously sexless look of a celluloid Kewpie doll . Philip found it difficult not to stare fascinatedly at this unusual display of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you bring it ? " " Bring what ? " " The poison . You promised . " " Ah , the poison . " Philip had no lie ready , however . " I . . T have n't been to town yet . " " You will remember it , though ? " " I 'll see what I can do . I 'll have to get a doctor 's prescription , you know ; and that may be difficult . "  | " You 're not trying to get out of this , are you ? " Mr Willys was suspicious . " I 'll do my best . . . but now I have to go out . I 'll see you tonight . Mr Koyoumdjian said you were coming down to dinner . " " I have no intention of ever leaving this room alive . I only said I 'd get up to put him off the scent . I was afraid they might try to move me to the Mission hospital . But now , if you 'll do as you promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever ! " And with a gusty sigh , Mr Willys began to turn over ; the bed creaked ; he groaned ; the flesh sagged alarmingly and Philip fled. 4 ' " Yonder wall , " said the dragoman , in his Biblical English , " was builded by the children of Israel before their liberation by Moses . You see , some of the bricks are made with straw ; others with-out . " " This tree was brought back from the land of Punt by Queen Hatshepsut 's fleet , " said Miss Oliver . Philip was bombarded with information from all sides ; some of it he absorbed , most of it he did not hear for he was too occupied with his own reactions . Like a man feeling his own pulse , he tried to define what he felt as he walked through the rooms and dusty gardens of three thousand years before . When they came to the small Temple of Pthah , they sat down in its shade , out of the terrible light of the sun which scorched the temple walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid gold in the harsh blue sky . It is so difficult to know how to deal with well-known landscapeswhen one is writing a novel . There is an impulse to describeeverything literally , enthusiastically , giving dimensions , dates , distances and other pertinent information ; this is the guidebookapproach and the dangers are numerous : for instance , should one care to describe the Sphinx , one would have to record those dimensions which are available to any owner of an encyclopedia . Should one rely on memory there will inevitably be angryp176comments to the effect that the left paw is not worn away , that one haunch is higher than the other , that the bridge of the nose is still intact if one observes the face from the east , and so on . The impressionistic manner is somewhat better : to use the celebrated object as a point of departure , like Pater describing the Mona Lisa , or Henry James describing the capitol at Washington , or rather Henry James describing Henry James describing the capitolat Washington . Then there is the contemporary fashion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , if it concerns artists , will all take place within a few blocks of the rue du Bac or if of high life , around the Crillion and the Ritz . While in a book about Egypt most of the action will take place either in a wealthy suburb of Cairo or else in a squalid desert village with goats and lice-infested children running about , ! eating dates and drinking stagnant water . It would be pleasant to make some sort of compromise , to be able to give a thorough instructive tour of Karnak , the Valley of the Kings , and so forth , soaring every now and then , with burnished wings , into a paradiseof lyric metaphor , getting around the object , as it were , translating its aura into a few balanced melodious sentences . But , reader , you will be spared even this . The movies have already made us so familiar with foreign countries that the novel , for its own good I am sure , can no longer be usefully employed in cataloguingdetails of well-known landscapes and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that , travelogues and the monthly Geographic must still be our source material . It might , however , be of some relevance to quote at this point what a well-known authority on Egypt had to say in 1887 of the country in general . After first remarking on the monotony of the scenery , the authority adds : " The monotony is relieved , however , in two ways , and by two causes . Nature herself does something to relieve it . Twice a day , in the morning and in the evening , the sky and the landscape are lit up by hues so bright and so delicate , that the homely features of this prospect are at once transformed as by magic , and wear an aspect of exquisite beauty . . . The orb of night walks in brightness through a fir/mament of sapphire ; or , if the moon is below the horizon , then the purple vault is lit up with many colored stars . Silence profound reigns around . A phase of beauty wholly different from that of daytime smites the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , while generalities are always treacherous for as we have seen only the night before , the sun set quickly without one single bright hue in evidence . Philip , nevertheless , has found this authoritya great comfort . " The Arab women bring their babies here to bless them , " said Miss Oliver , as they stood in the close dark room , a life-sized statue of a woman with a lion 's head in front of them , partly lighted by a shaft of light coming from a square opening directly overhead . " She has great power , " intoned the dragoman , an untidy old man with a grizzled beard and wearing the national sheet-like robe , a fez on his head , sandals on his feet . He was a true Egyptian , he assured Philip when they first met , one of the last , not like those god-damned Arabs in the north . And he was not a Moslem either ; proudly he had shown Philip a curious cross tattooed on his arm . " I am a Christian . A Coptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods , if one believes in them , " said Miss Oliver firmly . Philip , though he liked her , found her positive assertions a little trying ; she never spoke tentatively , advanced an opinion as merely an opinion and not a fact of nature . Yet , in general , he agreed with what she had to say and , in any case , he had not yet been in a position to contradict her with a superior knowledge on any subject . The dragoman , however , feeling his own position as an Egyptologist to be secure , had spent most of the morning attempting politely but tenaciously to disprove her observations and theories . She , in her turn , was far more direct ; she contradictedhim flatly until Philip was afraid there might be trouble but they got through the day without any unpleasantness , and it was in a friendly mood that they went back together to the hotel in a horse-drawn carriage , the top up against the evening sun.  |p178Men  sat sleepily in doorways as they drove into Luxor . EN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fly-buzzing shade of acacias , hardly moving . Only the women worked , maintaining the ancient patterns of life , preparing food , bringing water from the fountains , nursing the children and cursing the men and the flies in their deep harsh voices , cursing the fine dust which the foreigners ' carriage turned up in clouds as Philip and Sophia drove through the dusty streets of the village to the highway which led to their hotel , to fine modem bathrooms and cool rooms . " You failed me . " " But I tell you the doctor refused to give me a prescription . " " I counted on you . All day I 've been happy . Happier than I 've ever been before , thinking that never again would I have to open my eyes to see the morning , to look at this aching wreck and to realize that I must endure it for yet another day . . . . Oh , it 's too terrible ! " And he groaned piteously , the sheet which covered him rippling like a sea effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Philip firmly . " It 's up to you from now on . " And , having divorced himself from Mr Willys 's project , he left the room , ignoring the pleas , the anguished entreaties from behind the mosquito netting : " Oh , come hack ! I 'm sorry ; I did n't mean it . You must help me ! " In the lobby , Mr Koyoumdjian met him . " We have a surprise for you ! " he said , smiling , his face breaking into a number of geometricshapes none of which revealed character . " Another lady has just arrived . . . an American from New York City . You probably know her , Mrs Fay Peabody . " " No , I do n't think I 've met her . You see . . . " New York 's a big town , I know . Babylon on the Subway , that 's what they call it . I 'm not green . What I meant is you probably know her books . She writes detective stories . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no time to read . " " Where is Miss Oliver ? "  | " In the dining room with Mrs Peabody . They 're waiting for you . " Sophia was stately and cool in a pale blue evening dress which flattered her well-formed body and yet , recognizing dispassionatelyall her physical attractions , he was in no way attracted to her ; she was like one of those voluptuous figures carved in ice at a winter carnival in New England . Usually he had a difficult time explaining to himself why this person or that person appealed to him but now he was amused to find himself wondering why he was not attracted to this handsome , apparently available woman . When he tried to think of her in erotic terms , he experiencedthe same sort of embarrassment when , as an adolescent , he had speculated on the private behavior of his parents . He had concluded that it was the enervating heat which had done this to him , heat combined with the mood of the place and a new knowledge of the ebb and flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surrounded that garden which he now glimpsed , pale and shadowy , through the French windows of the dining room . Sophia introduced him to Mrs Fay Peabody . The famous mystery-storywriter was plump and soft , elderly , and though she had a slight speech defect ( the result of ill-fitting dentures ) she managed , nevertheless , to speak with very nearly as much authority as Sophia herself , though , unlike Sophia , she was limited to fewer fields : the underworld , publishing and the law . " Well , here we all are , " she observed , after the introductions had been made and an American canned fruit cocktail was set before them . " Probably the only Americans in upper Egypt . " " No , there are quite a few over at the Ponsoonah Laboratories outside of town . " " I mean , not counting professional people , " clicked Mrs Peabody . " Although , perhaps , I do n't quite mean that either since I , too , am professional , on a job . " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to ask Mrs Peabody who she was , did so , neatly . She told him that she was Fay Peabody and he told herp180that he enjoyed her books . Sophia remained silent , as though she 'd been through all this before he had joined them . " I believe in doing my research on the spot , Mr Warren . None of this secondhand business for me . . . . Looking things up is all very well for most writers but , if I say so myself , I have quite a large body of readers who look to me for the real thing .. . and that 's what I give them . When I describe the inside of Leavenworth it means that I have been inside Leavenworth , as a prisoner . " " You must be joking , " said Sophia mildly . " I never joke about my work , Miss Oliver . Yes , I arranged with the warden and he allowed me to reside three days in a cell , just like any other prisoner , wearing , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Red , White and Blue Murder . . . well , those are authentic scenes based upon my personal experience . " There was an awed silence after these remarks . Philip , toying with a bit of cold fried fish , wondered what to say next . He glanced at Sophia . She was no help ; she asked Mrs Peabody what she was doing in Egypt . " I believe , Miss Oliver , that a change of pace is good for all of us . Even the best . I was never one to rely on formula , although the Fay Peabody method may be considered , perhaps , to be a kind of formula . Yet I have been aware for some time now that there were certain limitations to the method . Not that I lack readers ! No , bless them ! each book sells more than its predecessor . Yet , in spite of such encouragement , one does have a duty to oneself and though I have written exclusively of crime in Philadelphiawith , of course , related minor scenes elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , and tackled a really big job elsewhere . " " Like Agatha Christie , " said Philip innocently . The storm broke . t Mrs Christie was flayed before their eyes and her corpse , like Hector 's , pulled after Mrs Peabody 's triumphal car from one end of publishers ' row to the other . Sales were compared down to the last twenty-five-cent copy sold . Mrs Peabody had at her tongue'stip the exact sales of every mystery novel published since Conan 1IIp181Doyle and , while they ate the dry gray flesh of some mysterious beast , it became apparent to them that not only in quality but in sales , too , Mrs Peabody was tops . No , she was not going to do the Christie sort of thing in Egypt . She was going to do the Fay Peabody sort of thing in Egypt and , her jaw set , she looked from one to the other of her companions , challenging them to compare her with anyone , living or dead . Philip was impressed . " Will it have J. R. Snaffles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her detective , an ex-prizefighter with an aquiline profile and an appeal which reputedly drove women wild , not only in fiction but the ones in life who bought every book about Snaffles Mrs Peabody was good enough to write for them . " Yes , Snaffles will be in it . I ca n't make too large a break with my fans . I mean , if you buy a Fay Peabody mystery you expect Snaffles . Is n't that right , Miss Oliver ? " Sophia nodded and the denture-clicking words of Mrs Peabody continued , a thin trickle of saliva glistening at the corner of her mouth . " I can only give you the barest hint of my plot . . . To do more would be unfair to my other fans . Suffice it to say , Snaffles has been hired by the wealthy Greta Preston of the Main Line to accompany her and her brother on a tour of Egypt to ascertain , if possible , the whereabouts of her father who disappeared in Twenty-nine with most of his bank 's available cash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , he did not take the cash . . . . " By the time coffee was brought , they knew a good deal more about the next adventure of Snaffles than any Fay Peabody fan in the world , or at least in upper Egypt . " What a nasty taste ! " exclaimed the authoress , after swallowingwith difficulty one sip of the thick Turkish coffee . " Oh , it 's wonderful , " lied Philip . " You must get used to it , " said Sophia . " Everyone drinks it here . Even your Mr Snaffles will have to drink it , " she added maliciously . Mrs Peabody sighed . " In that case , I 'd better swallow it all , like medicine . Research ! Never let anyone tell you it 's easy . Take my word for it . "  |p182It  was not until they were seated on the screened-in porch overlooking the garden , that Philip had his marvelous idea . " Tell me , Mrs Peabody , have you ever known a man who wanted to be murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole point to mystery stories is that people do not want to be murdered . " " Perhaps I should put it another way . A man wants to kill himself but he 's afraid to . " " I presume you are speaking of suicide . I do not wish to sound intolerant , Mr Warren , but I do not approve of suicide . It is unfair to the reader . I know , of course , that you are a great admirer of Mrs Christie . . . . " And that poor lady 's body was once more dragged the length of publishers ' row . " All I meant , " said Philip , when she had stopped for breath , " is that there 's a man staying here who wants to kill himself but has n't the nerve . He tried to shoot himself a few days ago , but missed . Now he 's been begging me to get him some poison . " " Good heavens ! " exclaimed Mrs Peabody , for the first time interested in anything either Philip or Sophia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why does n't he buy his own lethal dose ? " " He is very fat . He can hardly get out of bed . " " I see . You refused , of course , to do as he requested ? " " Yes , as a matter of fact I did , but I thought you might be able to help him . " " How could I help him ? " " I thought perhaps you might murder him , Mrs Peabody , " said Philip blandly . Mrs Peabody snorted dangerously . " If that is your idea of a joke , Mr Warren , then I must tell you I think it in poor taste . " " But you said yourself that you are always authentic , " remarkedSophia , joining the game . " How can you write about murders if you 've never committed one ? " Mrs Peabody glared at her . " I do n't think that follows at all . Besides , my novels are primarily concerned with the detection of the murderer , not the murder itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give him some advice onp183what poison to take . . . you know , some of the little tricks of the trade a layman might not know . " " But I would n't dream of such a thing ! " She was outraged . " I can only hope that you 're not serious , that this is some sort of private joke between you and Miss Oliver . " " I 'm afraid he means what he says , " said Sophia . " I have n't seen Mr Willys but I 've heard all about his attempts at suicide not only from Mr Warren but also from the manager who took his gun away from him . " " What sort of weapon was it ? " asked Mrs Peabody , in a voice suddenly precise and businesslike . " A revolver , " said Philip . " You have no idea what make ? Type bore ? " " I suppose Mr Koyoumadjian will let you look at it if you want to . " " No . It 's not important . I 'm always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book I had a murder committed with a sashweightattached to a medieval crossbow . Rather an original touch , I thought , since the murderer was able to prove be was next door at a party when the victim 's skull was crushed by the weight . Fay Peabody books are noted , if I say so myself , for their unusual weapons . " " I think you should meet Mr Willys , " said Philip , taking advantage of the authoress 's change of mood . " I mean , it 's really an interesting case . " " But I 'm quite sure that in his present state he would n't want to meet me . . . . " Nonsense . In his present state he 'd be thrilled to meet you . " Philip put his head in the door to make sure that Mr Willys was still covered by the sheet ; he was . The would-be suicide was propped up in bed , modestly tented , drinking Scotch and doing a crossword puzzle . Philip introduced him to the ladies . " I 've read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Willys . " I 've a great deal of time on my hands , you know , and since I 've nothingbetter to do , I read . "  | " Many great men read books , " said Mrs Peabody gently , her ruthless material-gathering eye taking in everything : the whalelikebody , the whisky , the bottles of medicine . " As a matter of fact , my most prized possession is a letter from the late Presidentof the United States of America , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , saying that he thought Red , White and Blue Murder a swell yarn , ' to use his expression . " She talked on hypnotically , her eyes narrowed as though estimating a bullet 's trajectory from different angles of the room , as well as places where a crossbow might be secreted , a sashweight dropped . " And I 've heard that Mr Churchillalso enjoys an occasional tale of detection when his mind is not occupied with the multifarious activities of state in which his high offices involve him , not to mention his own not inconsiderableliterary activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and , as though against her will , picking up the bottles and reading their labels as she talked . She was still talking , when Philip and Sophia tiptoed out of the room . " I wonder if I should have done that , " said Philip , as they stepped out of the French windows and into the warm moonlit garden . " I do n't think much harm will be done . If what you say about Mr Willys is true , they have a great deal in common . " " You do n't think she 'll murder him ? " He was half serious . Sophia laughed . " Do n't be absurd . She 's an old idiot and he is a neurotic who 'll never kill himself as long as he has someone to talk suicide to . " Philip had almost forgotten about people who used such words as " neurotic " in conversation ; he 'd been under the impression that the ugly private language of the mental therapistswas becoming unfashionable , that the cleverest people no longer talked about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fashionable ; she would use whatever words she chose to make her point . He often felt that he was with a foreigner when he was with her , someone who used the language intelligently but with no great facility or , rather , personal color : no tone , no habits ofp185speech , no peculiar phrases or repetitions . It was all so clear and direct . For the first time , he asked her where she lived . " I live in Paris now , most of the time . But I travel a great deal " " Why ? Any purpose ? " " I like it . No other purpose . I have means , ' as Mrs Peabody would say . " " That monster . " Philip chuckled . They sat down on the tile edge of a small fountain . The light in Mr Willys 's second-floor room burned brightly , a warm and yellow oblong in the dark wall of the hotel . " Were you born in Paris ? " She shook her head but then , instead of answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it trickle back into the fountain . Water struck water with an unmusical sound . " Why are you in Egypt ? " he asked . " You ask so many questions , " she said . . . an observation , not a complaint . " Why are you in Egypt ? " " To see it . I 've never been here . " He explained to her about his year . " Well , I 'm here to see it , too . " " You 've been here before . " " I like the ruins , " she confessed . " I 'm interested in archeology and I 've occasionally put a little money into expeditions . " " Is there an expedition on now , one of yours ? " " Yes , in a way . I 'm vaguely involved in the digging over at El Farhar . " " What are they digging ? " " They seem undecided . As far as I know it 's a small temple built in the time of Seti the Second , an amiable young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the son of Menephthah , the unfortunate creature who followed Moses into the Red Sea . " " How far away is this place ? " " About sixty miles to the south . We might go over there , if you care to . "  |p186'Td  like to very much . Is there a town near by ? " " El Farhar is a good-sized town , with a native hotel where one can stay . The excavations are near by . . . a group from the Universityof Berne are doing the work . . . thankless , of course , since the Egyptian government confiscates nearly everything of value but then it 's a mania , like any other , a passion for knowledge . . . much more admirable I think than a passion for money or for position . I actually know of people whose principal interest it is to interfere in the lives of others . . . for their own good , of course . " Philip felt very close to her at that moment . She was the first intelligent woman he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed some sort of plot whereby through birth control , Christian Science , capitalism or enlightened deviationism the world might be saved ; all opposition to the grand formula being ruthlessly abolished . Of course he did not know her well ; she might perhaps have some secret dream of teaching Esperanto to every child in the world . But , for the moment , he felt in marvelous accord with her : two pure non-interventionists , seated in the jasminescenteddarkness of an Egyptian garden , each pursuing his own solitary way , paragons of human virtue and as just as gods . He could not help but compare her with Regina . He even asked her if she had met Mrs Durham . " Regina ? Of course . I 've known her for years . When did you meet her ? " " A few months ago when I was in Rome . " " Did you like her ? " This was a dangerous question obviously : Sophia , though she lacked the womanly trait of interference , was , after all , quite feminineenough to know rivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip , deserting policy for a relative truth . " But I think , of course , that she does answer your description : she 's one of those people who want to govern other people for their own good , but I do like one thing about her : she 's not simple-minded enough to have a program . She does n't believe in any abstract set of rules which can be applied rigorously top187every situation . Power is just her particular element . She enjoys it for its own sake . . . the Disraeli approach rather than the reformer 's or the mystic 's . " " I do n't like her , " said Sophia flatly . " But I do agree that if one is to be interested in the world her attitude is the least absurd ; yet the result of her chicanery can be every bit as dangerous as the crusade of some fool with a four-year plan . " Discussing the way of the world , they strolled about the garden and Philip was sad that he experienced no desire . In any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move she would be very surprised , as well as amused , and indifferent . He wondered if she had had lovers . The thought that she might be a Lesbian had crossed his mind , though she was not masculine . . . which proved nothing , of course . Like most American men of his century he was fascinated by the whole idea of Lesbianismand his fund of information , accurate and inaccurate , was tremendous . He decided that when he knew her better he would bring the subject up to see what her reaction might be . But they spoke now of the expedition to El Farhar . " There 's another reason for going there , " she said ; then she stopped suddenly , as though she 'd been indiscreet . " Another reason ? What ? " " I 'm not sure I should tell you yet . I 'm not sure myself what it is or , rather , if the rumor I 've heard is true or not true . We 'll find out soon enough . " " But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sun had been veryhot that day , that perhaps they should go in . As he passed the door to Mr Willys 's room , Philip looked in to say good night . Mrs Peabody had drawn her chair close to the bed and was saying excitedly , " There are four methods of making a hangman 's noose . I have always favored the traditional double coil and slip ' noose . . . " Neither Mr Willys nor Mrs Peabody heard Philip 's good night.  |p189THE  car that they hired to take them to El Farhar ran out of water first , then oil , then gasoline . . . all of which Sophia patientlypaid for , although the price for the services of the car was to have included everything . Fortunately none of the tires blew out and they arrived at El Farhar in the late afternoon ; they were taken to the only brick building , the Fuad I Hotel and here they signed a register which was printed in French and were welcomed by a manager who addressed Sophia in Italian , a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glare of the day where not one sign implored them to drink Coca-Cola . There was not even a single movie house with lurid posters predicting the thrill some old movie with bobbed-haired girls of another generation had in store for them . One battered jeep parked before the house of the local administrator provided the only contemporary note in this lot dusty world of whitewashed mud houses and minarets with wooden balconies from which the faithful were summoned to regard the northeast and to contemplate the mercy of Allah and his dead Prophet 's wisdom . The long-robed people stared at the two foreigners as they crossed the dung-littered market place where animals and their owners milled about , kicking dust intop190market stalls which were sheltered from the sun by a candy-pink and white striped arcade . " I do n't think they 're very friendly , " said Philip uneasily as they finally got through to the far side of the square , displacing a group of villainous-looking fellahin . " No , I do n't suppose they are , " said Sophia , quite composed , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sycamore-linedstreet . " But why ? What have the Americans done to them ? " " A great deal . . . but they do n't know we 're Americans . All they know is that we 're white and from the north . that we have money and eat pork . They do n't dislike us enough to be dangerous . . . yet , " she added , comfortably . The half-uncovered temple was at the end of a lane on the town 's edge , not far from the dull snake-green river . To the west Philip could see the limestone mountains which separated the Nile Valley from the Libyan Desert , dead-white lunar mountains without water or vegetation . To the east , open country , dusty green where it had been irrigated and , where it had not , only dust and stone , broken here and there by clusters of slender date palms grown up about desert wells or , as Philip 's authority would say , the Victorian George Rawlinson M.A. , Camden professor of AncientHistory in the University of Oxford and corresponding member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Gillman , M.A. : " Egypt is a land of tranquil monotony . The eye commonly travels over a waste of waters , or over a green plane unbroken by elevations . The sky is generally cloudless . No fog or mist enwraps the distance in mystery ; no rainstorm sweeps across the scene ; no rainbow spans the empyrean ; no shadows chase each other over the landscape . There is an entire absence of picturesque scenery . " Egypt was not much like England and Mr Rawlinson missed the gray damp days , the homely pleasures of the common cold , the soft dampness which , as Mrs Woolf 's Orlando discovered , stole over England shortly after Prinny 's death , diffusing the bright sun of a more heroic age with veilsp191of coal-smoke and fog , while high spirits gave way to probity and all the poets departed , following the sun to Italy . But Philip , a child of the sun , was perversely attracted to Mr Rawlinson , to good form , narrow-shouldered suits , understatementand lyric poetry , not to mention gray damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , sweating on the banks of Ilapi , of the Nile , more than ever did the foggy tones of Mr Rawlinsoncome to him as a breath of cool northern air and he could almost hear a phlegm-ridden voice intone that one bright sentencein The Story of Ancient Egypt , " Silence profound reigns around . " But there was no silence here , profound or superficial . The workmen chatted noisily as they went about their various jobs : some digging , others dusting blocks of stone with brooms . Sophia and Philip walked slowly about the pit . The top of the temple just appeared above the surface of the ground . The excavatorshad dug down to the original level in front of the main colonnade . They were now engaged in completing a wide trench about the entire building . The roof of the temple had long since fallen in but the pillared facade was unbroken and , though it lacked the familiar grace of Greek columns , it still had a fineness of its own , he thought critically , in spite of the squat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bas-reliefs inside , hiddenby earth and sand , he experienced some of the excitement which he knew archeologists must feel when they finally enter rooms where no one for centuries has been . Between two palms , a quonset hut had been erected and here they found Dr Praeger of the University of Berne , head of the expedition . " Miss Oliver ! This is a surprise . We thought you were in Europe . Come in . Come in . " Introductions were made and they all sat down in wicker chairs . The room was businesslike , with a clock , a filing cabinet , a water cooler and fragments of pottery and stone carving arranged on the floor , some with little white stickers , others unclassified . Dr Praeger was a **32;6554;TOOLONG , red-faced , stout and earnest . He spoke English fluently but with an unusually disagreeable accent , as though he were singing the words to some atonal melody . " We are making great progress , Miss Oliver , as you can see . In about two weeks we will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved for us , " he sang blithely , the young Lohengrin setting forth . " Have you found the cartouche ? " " Seti the First . . . no one else so far . But we shall see what we shall see . You are interested in archeology ? " Philip , very modestly , allowed that he was . " Then you should be interested in certain aspects of our little temple . " He led them outside where they stood in the shade of the quonset , looking down into the pit . " It was erected , we now know , to the god Thoth . .. " " As I told you , " said Miss Oliver . " As you did , indeed . Thoth was the scribe of the gods . . . the wise man and the recorder . " And now , like a priest chanting service , Dr Praeger told them about the temple , accepting Miss Oliver 's occasional comments with a tolerant smile . " But our greatest surprise you will never guess , Miss Oliver , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newcomers to ponder this solemn prediction . " What is it ? " asked Sophia . " Alexander ! " said Dr Praeger . And cymbals crashed in Philip 's head as he remembered Lohengrin 's magnificent declaration . " You mean . . . . " Sophia looked very interested . Dr Praeger grinned happily and nodded , his forget-me-not blue eyes glistening with emotion . " Alexander , " he repeated softly , gently , " Alexander was here . " " An inscription ? " " Better yet . A frieze . . . only a fragment but come , look . In back of the house . We found it just inside the colonnade . " He led them in back of the house where a section of stone several feet square lay with a tarpaulin over it . He removed the covering and Philip saw a delicate drawing of a young manp193standing before a priapic god . Hieroglyphs declared , according to Dr Praeger , that this was the divine Alexander , the sun 's relativeand Egypt 's Pharaoh . " Yes , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dark glasses , running her fingers gently over the stone . " I 've often wondered why Egyptians so often showed him doing homage to the Priapus . " " A form of satire ? " suggested Philip . " Perhaps . Look how accurate they were , by the way . See , they show his slightly hunched shoulder and the small chin ? " " You mean these figures really look like the originals ? " You see ? Quite against one 's will the gray shadow of Professor Rawlinson falls across this discussion of Egyptian ways , making one almost agree with that contemporary English poet who once remarked that Hoboken not only has an evocative name but that just as interesting things happen there as in more exotic locales . Nevertheless , Philip has come to Egypt and there is a good reason not only for his sightseeing among the ruins but for this uncomfortablevisit to El Farhar in the middle of the summer as well . however , Alexander admittedly has nothing to do with it and so , after an hour of trudging about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophia and Philip walked back to the hotel where they were joined a few hours later by Dr Praeger and his assistant , Dr ieverini . They had dinner in the dining room of the hotel . They drank whisky during the meal , to disguise the horror of what they were eating ; by the time the black sandy coffee came they were all good friends and in an excellent mood . Dr Peverini was a swarthy young Italian-Swiss , a Protestant , intolerant and rather prim while Dr Praeger , the German-Swiss , was a devout Catholic , soft and warm . Over coffee they talked of religion , to Philip 's great surprise since he could not recall havingoften discussed anything so intangible or so abstract since he had left college : most Americans , he knew , become profoundly embarrassed in the presence of any abstraction , murmuring that , Nvell , they thought it was probably better to do good than bad . . . dividing about equally between those who know deep inp194their visceras that there is a God floating about somewhere , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a God but think religion is very nice for the other people , even though the devout have a rude awakening ahead of them , presuming one could know nothing when one is nothing , a semantical impossibility of course but perhaps not a mystical one . " The most interesting aspect of Mohammed 's god , " chanted Dr Praeger , " was that he knew from the very beginning of the world who was to be saved and who was to be damned and there was no quarreling with God 's appointment . As incredible as it may seem , the Koran , referring to the unbelievers , says , more or less : ' We have thrown veils over their hearts , lest they should understand the Koran , and into their ears a heaviness ; and if thou led them to the guidance yet even then they would never be guided . ' " " A good way of explaining the actions of one 's enemies , " said Philip , recalling the same omniscience of St Augustine 's deity . " According to Mohammed , Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men might have been saved but that such had not been his pleasure and that he preferred to furnish hell with men as well as demons , " said Dr Peverini . " I wonder why ? " asked Philip . " One does not wonder in matters of faith , " said Sophia , smiling . " One believes . One either accepts all the messiah 's revelations or none of them . Should it seem inscrutable or illogical then one lacks faith . When one believes , all is clear . " " Indeed it is , " exclaimed Dr Praeger joyously , unaware of the intended mockery . " Who are we to question the great men of our ' faith ? Wise men have spent their lives studying the mysteries and interpreting the revelations . .. . " It should be remembered , " interrupted Dr Peverini dryly , " that Mohammedans rejected European Christianity because they thought it polytheistic . The idea of God as three persons seemed ludicrous to them and the importance of the Mother of God ' an impertinence and a sacrilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a certain level , poly/theistic . Even the Moslems have Iblis , the fallen angel , the evil one , and various minor figures who do the work of heaven , " remindedSophia . " The people are always personalizing emotions and elements while the scholars and mystics are trying to measure and to comprehend some central power or idea from which all life comes . Even here in Egypt , with all the hundreds of gods , there was a central deity , a source of light whose name was known only to a few . . . so terrible was his name it was never pronounced . And , as always , it was the poets who discovered or rather revealed his existence . His commencement is from the beginning ; he is the god who has existed from old time ; there is no god without him ; no mother bore him ; no father hath begotten him ; he is a god-goddess created from himself ; all gods came into existence when he began . ' " " On a more human level , a primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Philip . " The uneducated , the intellectually inadequate man will never be able to conceive of anything not in human terms . God must have a beard and must be jealous , irritable , vain , susceptible to flattery , stern and intolerant .. . in other words , a model earthly ruler . Catholics have gone far to propagate this nonsense , giving the people not only minor deities but a great soaring mother as well , from whose womb God fell one day , turning the male doctrine of the Jews into a female doctrine , supplanting the classic love of virtue with a meekness which only the politicians of the Church could righteously disregard in the war on heretics . " Dr Praeger laughed loudly at this fierce attack on his faith and when he answered he did so easily , complacently , like a man who has the truth and can survey the errors of others with a geniality unknown to the insecure . " I think you 're a little hard on our Church , " he hummed softly . " After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have introduced some paganism into our rituals . Since we are all intelligent men without superstition , we can ignore the deviations of our less enlightened co-religionists and go to the center of belief , to ... " Sophia and Philip seemed to agree that there was no continua/lion of personality after death while the two doctors , if they avoided hell , as they piously hoped they would , believed in an eternity of comfort , each in a separate establishment , however : one clean and severe and filled with the austere music of fugues and oratorios ; the other innocent and rich , like a mural by Fm Angelico . " Mohammed was perhaps the most explicit biographer of heaven , " said Dr Peverini . " He located it as being above the seventhastronomic heaven , an enormous garden where everyone is well taken care of by handsome mamelukes and where each man will have seventy-two beautiful houris to serve his lust . " " I wonder what the women will have ? " asked Philip . " The sense of virtue , " said Sophia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except , of course , they had no souls in those days . " " Also , for some curious reason , " remarked Dr Pzz eger , " everyonewill be allowed to drink the wine which on earth was forbiddenwhile , as a final attraction , the prophet assures us that there will be no speeches given after the numerous banquets the blessed will attend . " " In the meantime , " said Dr Peverini , " before the good reach heaven , they will have slept until Judgment Day when , after three blasts on the trumpet by Israfel , the dead come alive again and are judged , passing over the bridge Al-sirat which spans hell , the good getting safely across , the bad and the unbelievers per-ishing . " " Who defines good and bad ? " asked Philip . " No one . All that matters is whether one believes or not . The orthodox are good ; the unbelievers or the nonconformists are bad . " " It makes it very simple , " said Philip . " Oh , the pagans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egyptians especially had many of the instincts which we associate with goodness . They thought the three cardinal requirementswere a love of God , a love of virtue and a love of man . " And Yeats had a theory the soul left the body at a certainp197fixed angle , in every case , " said Philip , wanting to make some comment . " Who ? " asked Dr Praeger . And by the time Philip had done justice to the memory of William Butler Yeats , the conversation had ceased to be general and had become particular , as Sophia and the archeologists gossiped about other expeditions , various other diggings in Europe , the possible location of the lost tombs in the Valley of the Kings . Then the doctors excused themselves ' and went to their rooms , leaving Sophia and Philip alone in the small empty dining room , illuminated by a single electric bulb which emphasized its squalor , revealed the crumbs on the floor which long caravans of ants were taking away . " I wonder , " said Philip thoughtfully , " why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Speak for yourself , Philip . " " Do you believe that the entire universe is built around human beings ? that the deeds of billions of unimportant men and women are carefully recorded and judged ? that on the final date the whole structure will be dismantled and prizes given out ? " Of course not . But I believe in the f act of the universe , that we are part of a structure which never changes though its componentparts continually change . That , of course , is the ultimate level . Closer to man , however , I believe in our desires and the elements which shape those desires and I think that each person knows his own balance and I resent the messiahs who try to rearrangethe elements of each man 's nature to conform with some particular private vision of excellence . " But every society does precisely that , for its own protection . " " To a degree . But some are less absurd and less tyrannical than others while a messiah is always a fanatic and his single visionmust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted out violently . The laws of a society , on the other hand , though invariably illogical , are fortunately more complex and often more lenient , since they are the work of many men and many ages , not the product of the divine madness of one lunatic and his politicalparty "  | " Yet they keep appearing , do n't they ? " Philip sighed . " I 've often thought what a pleasant place the world would be if there were no great enthusiasts . How nice to have lived in the eighteenth century where , in a certain society at least , one could consider almost any problem without having continually to make reference to a doctrine . But there 's nothing to be done about it . Free inquiry is unfashionable . Faith is the order of the day : Freud , Marx , Stalin , Jesus . . . every man can now wear a complete suit of doctrinaire armor . . . . " Getting rather drunk , he continued to denounce the new dark age until he had said all that he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of , all selfless leaders and , far worse , of those vacuous professional followers who scurry like terrified sheep from pillar to post , from Communism to Catholicism , moaning softly , ecstatically , like rutting sheep in the spring , kept always in line by a sharp-toothed dog whose brutal presence is more than compensated for by the divine , aloof yet watchful presence of some good shepherd with his crook . " And yet , " he said , growing more calm , " I find myself continuallyvacillating between anger at the stupidity of the world and a desire to do something about it , on the one hand , and , on the other , a knowledge that man is small , of no concern , that all is forgotten , that life is brief , that pain is bad and pleasure good ; and so , why act at all if action makes these short years unpleasantones ? If one loathes humanity , as I do , then is n't it illogical for one ever to want reputation , to accept the detestable world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love virtue for its own sake is vain , for virtue can not exist except in relation to something else . Virtue alone at the bottom of a well is like a work of art never executed . And I want virtue more than anything : to be just , to serve , to be admired . . . yet I find men unbearable and I feel like a stranger when I walk the streets of their cities , hardly believing I have any relation to this race or to any member of it . I have loved no one . I have admired excellence but not men , as much as the two can be disassociated . For in/stance , I venerate the work of Dante but I would have hated the sweating , defecating , harassed , melancholy man  --  would have been unable to put up with his politics , his moods , his vanity . . . ' Sophia looked at him strangely . " I am surprised , " she said . Il Philip , drunk now , laughed and said , " Listening to music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed in the main . Who is constant ? I never know from one minute to the next what I truly think of anything or anyone and what I just described in such noisy terms is only what I occasionally feel . " " Then you must stop being a man . " It took him several minutes to consider this statement . After several false starts , he said , " You mean I should die ? " " That 's one way , of course . The surest . " She smiled . " But I did n't mean that for you . I meant that you should withdraw from what repels you , turn to something that does please you . Music . Ideas . Excellence . Perhaps even the vain schoolboy hunt for first principles ' or , better yet , you like the poetry , not the poet .. . then love the idea which is real , more real than the man who made it , who invented the stories long ago , almost before there were sufficient words to describe the sun and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wisdom . That 's why I have spent my life among the ruins , reading history , learning , avoiding always men and women . . . not that I 'm a recluse : far from it , but I never touch them and they never touch me . " " But why do you tell me this ? " said Philip perversely , deserting his own position to attack hers . " Why do you try and touch me now ? " She flushed and looked away ; but when she spoke her voice was as cool and impersonal as ever , " Since I am mortal I must entertain policy to survive . To touch you may serve that policy . " She smiled . " That was difficult to say . I was forced either to contradictwhat I had just told you , what I believe , or else risk offendingyou . " You do n't offend me , " murmured Philip.  | " I 'm glad because , as you say , I tried to touch you for reasons which may not be entirely clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different voice : " But we have an adventure ahead of us . " " What is that ? " " Something I wish to find out , to see . A rumor I have heard , and the real reason for my coming to El Farhar . " " A new ruin ? " " No , an old prophet . " " What does he say ? " " The coming of the messiah , " said Sophia . " And I should n't be at all surprised if he were n't right . This is the time . I feel it .. . 1 &e; a sudden silence in a room full of people . " " That would be the end , " said Philip softly . The next day he was ill and the hot sun made his head ache . Several times while they were wandering about the excavation , he thought that he might be sick to his stomach and , recollecting now some of the things he had said in last night 's exalted alcoholic mood , he writhed inwardly , wondering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shade of the quonset hut with Dr Peverini , in the stifling but , happily , dark room while Sophia and Dr Praegermingled with the workmen in the trench in front of the colonnade . " Would you like a little something to drink ? " asked Dr Peverini sympathetically . " Just water , " said Philip in a weak voice . Unsteadily he went over to the water cooler and helped himself . " Everybody drinks too much in the tropics , " said the Swiss sternly . " All the old BritishColonial people used to preach heavy drinking . . . said it killed the bacteria . It may have killed a few bugs but their livers rotted in the heat and they all died young . " " I drink very little , " protested Philip . " You should n't drink at all in the heat , " Peverini continued.  | " Have you found anything new today ? " asked Philip , who would not have cared if they had found the Grail but wanted , rather , not to think of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd done himself . " Nothing to compare with our Alexander . A few scarabs , but no royal cartouche yet . " A scorpion suddenly clattered across the floor . Before Peverini could get to it the creature was gone into the blazing day . " I hate bugs , " said Peverini . " Oh , have you heard the rumor ? " " What rumor ? " " About the prophet here in El Farhar ? " Peverini nodded . " There 's always some nonsense like that going on in an Arab town . I remember once , when we were digging in Syria , an old gentleman took it into his head that he was Mohammed , come to judge the world . " " What happened to him ? " " He was crushed under his house when the townspeople pulled it down one night , while he was sleeping . " Philip sighed . " Perhaps he was . " " Was what ? " " Mohammed come again . " " In that case he would not have been killed so early in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of the world madnessusually takes a messianic turn . In our country people become Napoleon or the Pope or St Joan . Here they become the agent of Allah . " " But this man is only a prophet . " " So they tell me . I have n't seen him . Some of our boys have , though . They 're very excited , of course . Most of them believe him and they 're practically counting the minutes till the day of judgment when all the infidels are sent to hell where they belong ... hell being a place where the white men do their own dig-ging " " You have n't seen him . "  |p202Peverini  shook his head . " We 've been too busy for that sort of thing . Except for our own people here , we have very little contact with the natives . " " I think Miss Oliver and I are going to pay him a call tonight . " " That should be interesting , " and Peverini smiled . After dinner , accompanied by a guide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eccentrically twisted streets of the town . The moon had not yet risen but the stars were large and bright and in the open doorways lanterns shone , dull and yellow , flickering in the darkness ; the high noise of Arab talk was in the streets as the sun-oppressed village of the day became secret and living and vital in the warm darkness when lovers met and thieves fell out , and murderers went about their bloody business , more like the slim shadows of palm trees than men by starlight and moonlight , near that shrunken summerriver which was parent to them all . Several children were playing a game of tag in the Street of the Date Palm . They stopped their game and stood back in the shadows , silent , as the three strangers passed them . Then , in the Street of the Dead Camel , they paused before a tearoom where the men sat about inside , smoking water pipes , chewing hasheesh and drinking numerous hot cups of tea . But then one looked up and saw the foreigners standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foreigners moved on , walking more quickly . " I always have a sense of danger when I walk about an Arab town at night , " said Philip in a low voice to Sophia , not wanting their grim-faced , elderly interpreter to hear . " It is dangerous , I suppose , " she said equably , betraying no anxiety . " But I always feel nothing will happen to me . " " And I always feel something will happen to me , " said Philip , realizing unhappily that the traditional attitudes of the two sexes were being reversed . " I am more frightened in New York at night than I am here , " she said.  | " I 'm not . I know the danger there . ' " I know it here . But they wo n't bother us . They have no reason to . Besides , one is safer in a small town than a large one . " " I have the white man 's guilt , " said Philip nervously , as a man suddenly crossed the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise as he vanished into a dark doorway . " Wait here , " said their guide , stopping suddenly before a buildingno different than any of the others in the Street of the Dead Camel . He knocked on the door . After a long wait it was opened by a small boy who stared suspiciously at them . The guide asked him a question in a low voice and the boy , impressed by his manner and the presence of the two white people in the street , opened the door and told them to enter . They were left alone in a long room with an earth floor , lit by a single dim lantern . Piles of sandals were all about . . . some carefully arranged in pairs on crude racks , others piled haphazardlyat either end of the room which was filled with the unpleasantodor of imperfectly tanned leather . " Is the prophet a cobbler ? " asked Philip . " I do n't think so , " said Sophia , puzzled . " I ca n't think where we are . " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy returned with a message that the prophet would see them , t that he lived next door , that they were in the house of his brothern-law , Marouf the cobbler . The boy was then paid off and they followed the guide across a slovenly courtyard where a goat was tethered , a rank , still figure i the yard . Behind the goat was a door through which they passed into a room where several silent veiled women sat playingdice . They did not look up as the strangers walked through t I Heir quarters to the next room , a bare , empty place . Here they sat cross-legged on a worn dirty rug , the only furniture in the rutom except for a battered lantern which sputtered and flickered , threatening to go out . " He will join you shortly , " said the guide , sitting a few feet away from his temporary employers , as though to disassociate himself from them.  |p204But  he did not join them and , as always , Philip began to lose track of time . Had he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white hair , like the man who thought he 'd been in a time machine for fifty years , only to discover that what had seemed fifty years was only five days . " I hope he puts on a good show , " said Philip , with a spurious casualness . " I do , too . I 'm very curious about him . His claims , or so I 've heard , are the most rational , the least suspect of them all . " " And how many others have you visited like this ? " " A dozen . Some were Christ come again . Others were Israfel , trumpet and all . Still others were without precedent . All were quite insane . . . not that insanity ever gave a mystic pause . But their madness was of such an obvious kind that they all lacked plausibility , even for the illiterate , for the most superstitious . " " Do you seriously believe a man can predict the future ? " " No . That would be granting too great an importance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , but I think there 's a significance in the fact of a prophecy . One often knows intuitively when one is in personal danger . . . or one often knows that there is something seriously wrong with the body even when there 's no pain , when a doctor has found no trace of disease , has not located the cancer whose presence the body instinctivelyknows . Well , I have a theory it is the same with prophecy . Some men feel more sensitively than others that some great event is pending . Usually the less educated , more simple man is better able to divine what the world wants than the educated man who relies too much upon logic , upon an empirical method , missing the often quite simple need of the race which creates the messiah or the leader as . . " " Tolstoy would say , " said Philip smiling , amused by the nonsense , willing to be impressed ; it was like having a horoscope cast . He did n't believe but , for several moments at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remark Santayana had recently made to a friend of his in Rome : " I have never been a mystic but I can imagine what it must be like . "  | '  --  Tolstoy or not , " said Sophia severely , " every great event has been preceded by omens and prophecy and I believe that if one studies the portents the general shape of the immediate future becomes clear . If , all of a sudden , enough men are suddenly inspiredwith messianic visions then , very likely , there is one standing in the wings , ready to make his entrance at the proper time , a creation not of God 's but of the old need of the race . " Before Philip could dispute this , the prophet entered the room . He was a small wiry little man dressed in desert rather than town fashion , his head bare and his beard wild and tangled . His dark gray-streaked hair was long and uncombed . His face was more Arabic than Egyptian , with a large beak of a nose and black eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch to this Biblical austerity was a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles through which the bright black eyes , somewhat magnified , stared at the visitors . His name was Abu Bekr . " The prophet greets you , " said the guide , equaling the gravity of their host , who made a salaam and then seated himself before them on the rug , in the center , Philip noticed with some interest , of a cabalistic design on the carpet . At first he was not sure if this was intentional or not but , when the prophet carefully pulled his robe within the circle , Philip was quite prepared for the carpet to ascend gently with all of them on it and float out the door to the land of Oz . " We would like to hear the exact prophecy Abu Bekr has made , " said Sophia firmly to the interpreter , who repeated this sentence with various ceremonial flourishes to the old man who mumbled a brief reply . " Abu Bekr would like to know which prophecy you want to hear . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interpreter . " Certainly not . He is a holy man , inspired by Allah . " " I was n't sure . Ask him what prophecies he has made . " The holy man 's answer was a little longer than the precedingp206response . " He wants to know why you 've come to see him and what you want to hear . " " We want to hear the truth and we have come to him to know the future . We have been told that he has had a revelation , that a new teacher is born . " The prophet answered at length , his voice growing louder , more excited as he talked , gesturing with his hands , molding the air as though creating out of nothing the figure of a divine child . When he finished , the interpreter began his translation , haltingly , confusedly . The world is an evil place today , more evil than ever before . The men kill each other with machines and the women go withoutveils and act like men in the streets and bazaars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angel of Allah stands at the gate of heaven looking down upon the earth , ready to blow the trumpet which will put out the sun and shake the stars out of the night and level the mountains , the cities in a sea of flame . But the angel 's moment has not come for a new token of Allah 's mercy has appeared in a land to the west , a village by the sea . He will grow up a holy man and he will teach the word of Allah to all the world . The people shall hold him in reverence and call him saviour for he will teach them not to fear death . " The interpreter stopped and looked expectantly at Sophia . " Why will they not fear death ? " she asked , looking directly at Abu Bekr , ignoring the interpreter . " What will he teach the people that will make them unafraid ? " The older man 's answer to this was mumbled and he stared at the design in the rug while he talked , one hand wound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , that he is not the saviourbut only a man to whom part of the future has been revealed . He adds , from the Koran , that a true believer need not fear hell . " " When was the saviour born ? " The answer was prompt : " Two months and nine days ago when the moon rose he was born and , the same night , an angel came to Abu Bekr in a dream and told him what had happenedp207so that he might prepare himself and the men of his tribe for the cleansing . " " Will he be a king or a warrior or a priest ? " asked Sophia . " He will be a man , " said Abu Bekr rising ; the audience was over . All the way back to the hotel Sophia and Philip quarreled ; the interpreter was silent as he led the way down the Street of the Dead Camel to the town 's center and their hotel . " You do n't really believe such nonsense , " said Philip , obscurely angry at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But how can you ? He 's just an ignorant old man living in a godforsaken village on the Nile . He obviously knows the New Testament and he 's made up his mind that it might lessen the monotony of daily life if he were to become John the Baptist and attract as much attention as possible , which he seems to have done . " " He knows the Koran , too , " said Sophia mildly . " The first speech he made us was a paraphrase of Mohammed . " " I 'm still not impressed . I think it amusing and all that , like palmistry , but I refuse to take any of it seriously . " " But he gave us an opportunity to check what he had said . He told us the exact day of the birth . " " But did n't mention the place . " " We can find out easily enough . I do n't think he knew himself where the place was . " " How can you find out ? " " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon rose in a country to the west , on the sea , on a day that we know . " " A line of longitude is several thousand miles long . I 'm sure that a town on that line will be easy to find . Yet even if you should discover that the old man meant Tacoma , Washington , it will probably be thirty years or more before the mission becomes known . "  | " It 's something to look forward to in our old age , " said Sophia , laughing softly in the dark . " Why do you care so much ? " asked Philip suddenly . " Even if every word the old man said were true , what difference would it make ? " " A great deal to everyone . " " There 's nothing you can do to affect it , is there ? " " No . Of course not . " " What would you do , if you could do something ? " " I would kill the child at birth , " said Sophia . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail . These things happen . No one can stop them from happening . We can only endure . "  | " WELCOME home , young man , " said Mr Willys cheerily . " How were the ruins ? Hot work , is n't it ? Archeology , I mean . " He was sitting up in bed , his thin gray hair combed , the head bandage removed and the torn ear nearly healed . He wore a Chinesedressing gown of white silk with a blue dragon picked out in it . " Very hot , and Fm glad to be back : the food was terrible . How have you been ? " " On top of the world . " Mr Willys beamed . " I can never thank you enough for introducing me to Mrs Peabody . I never imaginedany woman could be so wonderful . She knows everything , literally everything . . . in her field , that is . It 's been a real education , I can tell you . " " Is she getting on with her book ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just doing fieldwork . Collectingdata , that 's all . She will later dictate the entire work in five days into a tape recorder . " " Prodigious , " said Philip , sitting down beside the bed in such a way that the afternoon sun was not in his eyes . " Then you 're taking a more cheerful view of things , I suppose . " " I certainly am , " said Mr Willys . " I feel better than I have in years . "  | " You 've stopped all of that nonsense about wanting to kill your-self ? " " Well . . . yes and no . " Mr Willys suddenly looked as crafty as his open pudding face would allow . " If you mean have I given up hope of being able to kill myself , I will say yes , I have . I just do n't have the courage to do it . " " Well , that 's good news . You probably wo n't be staying here much longer . " " No . Not much longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand you . " " Can I trust you ? " Mr Willys narrowed his tiny eyes until they disappeared . " Of course you can . " Philip was curious . " You 'll not try to interfere in any way . . . if I tell you ? " " I promise . " " I know I should n't tell you but I ca n't help it . I must talk to someone and you 're the logical person since , without knowing it , of course , you brought the whole wonderful thing about . " " What wonderful thing ? " " Fay Peabody . " " Well ? Is she a wonderful thing ? " Philip had a vision of Mr Willys and Mrs Peabody being married in a Hollywood chapel full of lilies of the valley . . . providing , of course , Mr Peabody had presented no legal difficulty , if there was still a Mr Peabody to present difficulties . But his guess was wrong . " You can take it from me , young man , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right place . She 's consented to do it . " " To marry you ? " Philip did not want immediately to give up this dream . " No , to administer the poison . We 've had a number of long talks and she 's consented to do for me what no other person of my acquaintance would do and what , as you know , I could n't do for myself . As a matter of fact , she 's quite thrilled by the whole " thing . " " You had no trouble in persuading her ? "  | " A great deal . . . especially at first . She had all sorts of scruplesbut when she saw how serious I was and how much I needed help she took pity on me . She has a heart as big as all outdoors . " " And she is n't afraid ? " " At first , she was . But since then she has steeled herself to the task . . . especially when I reminded her who she was : the greatestmurder-mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her book , Red , White and Blue Murder . " " He said it was a swell yarn . " " That 's right . I never cared much for him , by the way . Did you ? " " I hate all politicians this year , " said Philip . " But how is she going to do . . . what you want her to do ? " " I do n't know . " He sighed . " Is n't it wonderful ? I do n't know how or when . . . only why . . . the motive , as Mrs Peabody would say . " " You must be scared to death , " said Philip tactlessly , carried away by the novelty of the situation . " I 've never enjoyed life more . . . if that does n't sound inconsistent . To know that any day now it will be over for good . .. . Well , it 's far better than I bargained for , believe me . There was a spell last week when I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without relief . " " Is it to be a perfect crime or will it resemble suicide ? " " She has n't told me and I have n't asked . I do n't want to pester her . I mean , what if she should suddenly refuse ? No sir , I 'm not asking any questions . I would n't interfere for a million ! I figure that little lady has done pretty well in this field , the writing end of it anyway and I do n't want to put my oar in . " Philip wondered whether or not Mr Willys was quite sane . Perhapsthe heat and the fat and the near-suicide had made him subject to hallucinations , made his dream of death seem nearly realized . Presuming that not a word of what he had said was true , Philip decided to humor him . " I should think Mrs Peabody would be nervous , even if you are n't . After all , you want to die . But she , I suppose , wants to  |p212live  and she is , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours . " " I should hardly call my wish to die a whim and although I may not have been very much in my life I think I should tell you that , as a citizen , there was a time when I was very highly regardedin Philadelphia : I was a director of the Quaker Greeting Card Company , before the depression . " " I did n't imply your death was a matter of no importance . I only meant that it would be a real tragedy if Mrs Peabody were to be caught . " " Fay Peabody caught ? Never ! Even though this is her first attemptat this sort of thing she is a complete master of both method and theory . I would n't worry about her . " " But I do , " said Philip . " For all her competence she is still only a theoretician . " " Well , have no fear , Mr Warren . I have none . " " I hope she pulls it off . " " I 'm sure she will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen ? " " Sometime during the next week , I suppose . I have n't given it much thought . " " Poison ? " " I believe so . The only stipulation I made was that it should happen so quickly I would n't be aware of it until it was all over . " " Sounds like poison then . " " I should think so . To help her , I 've taken to ordering enormousmeals . . . all my favorite dishes : not that I have much appetite , but I was something of a gourmet in my younger days so I 've got that manager working his tail off . Tonight he 's promiseda sauce bearnaise made with his own hands . He 's an amateurchef , he tells me . . . . Who knows what may be in that sauce ? " " Who knows , indeed ? " said Philip rising . " I hope everything works out for you . ' " Thank you very much . You realize , of course , that what I 've  |p213told  you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of it , will you ? Not even to Mrs Peabody ? " " Of course not . " He did not see Sophia that evening until they joined Mrs Peabodyfor dinner ; he had wanted to discuss the whole matter with her , to try and determine what , if Mr Willys had told him the truth , should be done . Although he knew of course that he himselfwould probably do nothing since it was no concern of his what Mrs Peabody and Mr Willys chose to do with the earthly residence of Mr Willys 's soul . Sophia was in a good mood . She had spent the day across the river near the Valley of the Kings and she had bought a contemporarycartoon of Ikhnaton which one of the natives had found the week before in the wreckage of an incompleted tomb . She showed them the fragment of plaster on which a cruelly sophisticatedartist had , in a few strokes , sketched the long head and heavy-lidded eyes , the full mouth and sharp chin of the great monotheist , gratuitously adding whiskers , revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . " What a fool he must have seemed to his contemporaries , " said Sophia , putting the sketch back into her purse . " What a fool he was , " said Philip . " From a practical point of view . He was given a first-rate country to govern and he wrecked it , all for the love of God . " " What did you say his name was ? " asked Mrs Peabody , liverish in a gown of fever-red with garnets at her throat . " Ikhnaton , " said Sophia . " He ruled over three thousand years ago . " Such a long time ! " mused Mrs Peabody , toying with her fork . You say he was a Christian ? " " No , Mrs Peabody . He tried to replace the old religion with a form of sun worship which various authorities have , ever since the nineteenth century at least , found singularly prophetic and attractive , actually , he was a mystic and he did the usual amount of harm those people do . His theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it always does . "  | " And the good is oft interred with their bones , ' " quoted Mrs Peabody under the impression she was reciting a sacred text from the Bible . " How sad it all is ! I am sure he must have been very fine . That face you showed us was sensitive ; I can tell ; I know a thing or two about faces . When I was doing fieldwork for The Dark Pullman Car Murder . . . . " As she told them about her research , Philip examined her narrowly for any sign of anxiety or guilt , but she seemed much as ever and he decided that Mr Willys had indeed gone mad with the heat . In fact , the authoress was uncommonly animated tonight and dressed with more than usual care ; she had even given her hair a fresh rinse and it was now a lifeless , frizzled maroon by artificial light . When she had finished discussing faces , Philip asked her how her work was coming . " Very well , all things considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . . . so I 've taken to wearing an old picture hat with a heavy muslin veil . . . stuffy , but at least it protects me from the harsh rays of the sun . " " You 've done a good deal of work , though ? " " Ah , Mr Warren , that is something I can never tell until the moment I start to dictate . Then , if I have done my task well , the book takes form splendidly and another Fay Peabody work is born . But , if I have a false start , I know that I have failed of my goal , that I have done insufficient spade work and so , willynilly , I am driven back into the field . At the moment my guess is that my rate of progress has been average . I spent the morning with the manager studying the train schedules . That sort of thing is important , very important . How many a work of imagination has failed because of faulty verisimilitude ! " " How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . " Get the facts , I tell young people who are contemplating a career in the field of detection writing . That , and plenty of elbow grease , spell success . " There was very little to say after this until the dessert , an elaborate Arab affair of crushed nuts and thin pastry , was put before them ; then , just as Fay Peabody , eyes glistening , hadp215brought a large forkful halfway to her thin lips , Philip asked her how Mr Willys had been . She was obviously caught between delaying her answer for several awkward , perhaps even suspicious , moments while she chewed the longed-for confection , and disappointing her salivary glands by delaying the anticipated treat to answer him . She exercised her will . She put the fork down , swallowed hard and , the dessert still untasted , said , " Poor Mr Willys . I fear he is morbidly inclined . " " He has very little to live for , " said Sophia . " Is not life itself enough , a precious gift ? " Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking noises . " I should have thought that you , of all people , Mrs Peabody , might have sympathized with Mr Willys 's attitude , " said Philip , watching her face . She was admirably controlled , however . " Come , come , Mr Warren . Merely because I have devoted my life to the problems of detection does not mean that I have , along the way , jettisoned that moral code which I learned long years ago at my mother 's knee in Cleveland . Quite the contrary . My fieldwork has dramatically demonstrated to me that crime is bad . " Philip waited a moment before he answered , not sure whether she had completed her statement or not ; she had . " I have never looked at it that way , " he said humbly . " But I 'm sure you 're right . Still , a suicide is not precisely a crime . " " It is considered a major crime by both State and Church , far worse , morally , than murder . As a device in novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not fair to the reader . Fortunately , most authors do not use it as a device , recognizing that it is not lair Play . " " But I should say that Mr Willys could only hope for death to come quickly of its own accord or else to pray that someone will - nurder him . " The effect of this statement convinced Philip that Mr Willys had been rational after all , that Mrs Peabody was indeed contemplatingmurder . The startled expression that had fluttered across her soft , ordinary face was succeeded by a debonair smile ,  |p216the  sort movie heroines wear when they want to dispel the suspicionsof another character , yet wish to remind the audience that , at the same time , they are involved in some noisome plot and that their smiles and gentle words are quite as false as their pearls . Fussing with her bodice , as if fingering those same ( invisible ) pearls , Mrs Peabody declared herself guilty when she said , " I should n't imagine he was in very good health . . . with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any day , " said Philip , wondering what he should do next , whether to interfere or not . " He has a bad heart , I believe , " said Mrs Peabody , finishing her dessert . " Perhaps nature will take care of him soon and solve his problemsonce and for all . " " I pity him , " said Fay Peabody as they left the table . She then excused herself , murmuring that an authoress 's work was never done . Sophia and Philip wandered out into the garden where they discussed his discovery . " Now the problem is what to do . " " But why do anything ? " Sophia sounded surprised . They stopped walking and stood in the middle of the path ; palm trees hid the hotel . " I think she should be stopped . " " Why ? For one thing it 's no business of yours and , for another , she 's doing a good deed . If I were tempted to , do a good deed , which I am not usually , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid I must seem conventional to you , " said Philip more from a sense of duty than from any real conviction . Sophia laughed . " It 's also the funniest thing I 've ever heard ! I could have sworn that woman would n't have been able to kill a fly . " " That 's the main thing that bothers me . Suppose she is caught ? " " Who will catch her ? The authorities here are n't going to bother about the death of a fat man whom no one knows , a semi-inva-lid. "  |p217Your  attitude seems rather cold-blooded . " " Then let 's go and tell the police . " " We ca n't do that either , " said Philip , confused , in an agony of spurious conscientiousness . " Let 's wait and see , " said Sophia . " Perhaps she wo n't go through with it . . . She may give up , you know . " But Fay Peabody did not give up . She did not lose her nerve . And , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw strength from the knowledge that she was , after all , the incomparable Fay Peabody , peerless in the world of detection writing , a woman whose fieldwork was a legend throughout the civilized world . The first attempt on the life of Mr Willys was made at breakfastthe next day . Philip first heard of it when , somewhat late , he came downstairs to find Mr Koyoumdjian despondent , in what our grandparents called " a blue funk . " " That guy Willys ought to be in an institution like a hospital . " " What 's the matter ? Has something happened ? " Philip 's hands grew cold , as though he himself were the murderer . " He got sick to his stomach after breakfast . The local sawbones is upstairs giving him the word . I told him I wanted Willys moved to the hospital but the doc said no dice . He stays here . Next thing he 'll probably die on me . " Philip thought this very likely but he did not say so . " Where i.s Miss Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day . " " And Mrs Peabody ? " " She 's out in the garden . Says she wants to do some flower arrangements for the dining room . The gardener will be fit to be t ied but the customer is always right , like they say . " VIrs Peabody , wearing a straw picture hat , gave a start whenPhilip , coming up behind her as she was leaning over some purpleblossoms with a pair of garden shears , said " Good morning . " " You startled me ! " she said , dropping the shears . Philip gotp218them for her ; then , as though suddenly exhausted , she sat down heavily on a near-by bench . " The heat , " she sighed . " Mr Willys is sick this morning . " " I should really look in on him . I plan to take him some of these gorgeous blooms after I do the downstairs arrangements ; I hate untidy bouquets . " " Mrs Peabody , do you think it wise ? Do you really feel you should risk your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peabody , now very pale indeed , dropped the shears again ; this time neither made a move to pick them up . " What do you mean ? " she asked , in a voice so tiny that had he not been sitting beside her , he might have thought a bee had flown by , or a cicada had whirred somewhere in the green foliage . " I 'll be frank with you , Mrs Peabody : Mr Willys once made very nearly the same proposition to me that he made to you .. . only I refused to be a party to it . You , on the other hand , were taken in . I do n't know why , and I do n't really care . Whether it was out of curiosity or out of a real desire to help him , makes little difference . The facts are the same in either case : you agreed to murder him . " Philip paused . " Mr Willys told you this . . . fantastic story ? " She got a grip on herself again : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she even picked up the shears and put them back into the half-filled flower basket . Philip nodded ; then , pressing his last bit advantage , he declared , " And I also know that you poisoned him this morning at breakfast , but that something went wrong . " Mrs Peabody rose with great dignity and said , " Follow me . " She led him to the far end of the garden where , in the shade of a gnarled eucalyptus tree , she said , " Since we are now completely alone and there are no witnesses I will be candid , although I vowed my lips would remain sealed until the day I died , but since the plot is already getting tangled and you are , whether you like it or not , involved quite deeply , I will confess to you that I took on this perilous job and that I mean to see it through , come hell or high water ! My motives were , and are , of the highest . Myp219method has , to my own amazement , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hypodermic needle early this morning and filled it with a colorless , tasteless poison of local origin which I inserted into the soft-boiled eggs he had ordered for breakfast . The chemisthad informed me , prior to my purchase , that the dose was not only lethal but that it would kill a host of rats . It failed , however , to kill Mr Willys . From my room I could hear the doctortalking to him and I gather he was only mildly nauseated . " " Which is probably just as well for you , Mrs Peabody . " " Let me tell you , Mr Warren , that should you attempt to go to the police you would only be laughed at since , obviously , I would deny having confessed to you while Mr Willys would never testify against me . " " I have no intention of going to the police . I was just reminding you of the risk involved , should you try again . " " I will take that risk , Mr Warren . Rome was not built in a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall strike again . " " I do n't see how you have the nerve , " said Philip , wonderingly ; but then one look into the bright little eyes of Fay Peabody convinced him that she was a fanatic , an artist . She would not be stopped by anyone until her demon was satisfied , until Mr Willys was dead . " It proves , " she said , in an ordinary voice , " that one ca n't rely on foreign products . If I 'd had more time , I 'm sure I would have been able to try the poison out on some creature to see if it were efficacious but , as you can see , I was forced to rely on the word of a native chemist and all my plans gang aft a-gley ' as Bobbie Burns would say . . . like a false start on my dictaphone . . . vet when I fail to get the beginning right , I go back into the field with renewed vigor and I have never , never failed to bring home the bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with her own seriousones , a loose flap of the muslin veil now shadowing her left cheek and eye , giving her a curiously slovenly air . " Well , I wo n't interfere , Mrs Peabody . . . beyond saying that I think that what you 're doing is dangerous and that the morality of the thing is confused , to say the least . "  | " I will do my duty as I see it and , though I appreciate your concern , I can . . . " Suddenly she stopped talking and for a momentPhilip was afraid she was going to faint . Quite pale , she made for the bench and , with one last spurt of strength , she got to it and crumpled , her hand to her heart and her eyes wild with fear . " What in God 's name is the matter ? " asked Philip , startled , positive that she was having a heart attack . " ' The hypodermic , " she whispered , growing paler by the instant . " I left it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You must get it back immediately . Perhapsthey have n't found it yet . " " It 's been there several hours . How could I ? How could I have blundered so ? The plan was perfect . Oh ! " She moaned into the muslin veil which now completely covered her face . " There 's no use in your losing your nerve now , Mrs Peabody . " Go to the pantry and see if the needle is there . After all , Mr Will ; rs is n't dead yet . " " That 's right . " This thought comforted her and she emerged for a moment from behind the veil . " We must hide the evidence . " " You must hide the evidence , not I. I 'm not going to be one of your  --  what do you call them ?  --  accomplices . . . " After the fact ; only there 's legally no fact at all . Come to the pantry . " The hypodermic was where she had left it and , since there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower basket ; then with something of her old assurance , she went into the lobby accompanied by Philip . " Ah , flowers , " exclaimed Mr Koyoumdjian brightly . " I hope you 'll take some up to Mr Willys . Cheer him up . He 's been asking for you . " " Poor dear man ! Has the doctor gone ? " " He just now left . He 's getting to know Mr Willys very well ... it was him who patched him up after he tried to take a powder . " Philip was pleased to find that the manager could make an occasional mistake in his well-loved vernacular.  | " What did he say was wrong with our Mr Willys ? " " Nothing much . . . just stomach trouble . He picked up a bug in Cairo , I would n't be surprised . " " I have just the medicine for him , " said Mrs Peabody , marchingoff , her flower basket swinging jauntily on her arm . The second attempt on the life of Mr Willys was made during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which held up the mosquito netting missing his head by several inches . Philip , when he heard the noise , thought to himself : " That 's done it " ; then he went back to sleep , refusing to be even a witness to Mrs Peabody 's plot . In the morning , on his way to breakfast , he looked in to see what damage had been done . The room was the same as ever , however , and Mr Willys was sitting up in bed , gravely sipping water through a straw . " What was all the racket last night ? " " The bed , " said Mr Willys . " It collapsed . Gave me quite a shock . My heart 's pounding so that I can barely breathe . " " Mrs Peabody ? " " Mrs Peabody . " " She 's failed twice . " " I know , " said Mr Willys , gloomily . " It 's getting on my nerves . I had no wish to be hurt , you know . I ca n't bear pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the suspense ! I tell you I do n't know when or where she 'll strike next . " " Make her stop . " " Oh , I could n't do that . She 's gone to such trouble . It would hardly be fair . " " I do n't see that fairness has anything to do with a situation like this . " " Perhaps not . Actually I still want her to pull it off . . . if only she were n't so damned sloppy . First of all , I knew those eggs were poisoned . She left enormous holes in the shells and they tasted god-awful but I ate them anyway and got sick . Then , lastp221night , the bed caved in . How she managed that , I 'll never know . I suppose she loosened the top piece while I was taking a bath . I must say she 's ingenious . What a mind that little lady has  --  like a steel trap ! " " One which wo n't close , though . If you were n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , we must remember that it 's all quite new to her : there 's a lot of difference between writing about something and actuallydoing it . " " I could do a better job than she 's done , " said Philip , scornfully . " You would n't take it on , would you ? I 'd be very grateful . . . I could make it worth your while . You can name your price , within reason , of course . " " No , I 'm afraid you 're stuck with Mrs Peabody . It 's a little like the medical profession . . . you engaged her and until she consentsto call in specialists it would be most unethical for you to get someone to replace her . " " This is not a joke . " " I realize that it is n't but there 's nothing I can do about it excepttell the police you want Mrs Peabody to kill you and that she 's trying to , without much success . No , I 'm afraid you will just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " You 're not very encouraging . " " Now , why do n't you be sensible and tell her to stick to her writing while you go to Switzerland and lose weight . " " I ca n't . . . . Glands . " " Then take shots . " " They do n't work on me . No , my mind is made up . Yet I do wonder what she 'll do next . " " Probably drown you in your bath . " Mr Willys shuddered . " I hate the idea of drowning : strangling to death , that 's all it is . Well , I 'll keep the bathroom door locked , She wo n't be able to get in . . . it bolts on the inside . Besides , we have an agreement to the effect that the business must be done in an instant . "  | " She 's a desperate woman , though ; remember that . She 's failed twice . Rather than fail a third time , she 's quite capable of losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , she would n't do that . " He was alarmed , and Philip hoped that the fear of pain might yet force him to change his mind . " I 'm sure the next time she 'll be able to do it , easily , without any fuss . " " I think you 're optimistic , " said Philip , darkly , and he left the room and went downstairs to join Sophia and Mrs Peabody who were already at breakfast . " Did you hear the noise last night ? " asked Sophia , cool in green , unlike Mrs Peabody who looked more dowdy than ever , tired as well , her eyelids red and granulated from fatigue . Her hands shook as she drank the bitter black coffee . " Mr Willys told me his bed collapsed on him in the middle of the night . " " Poor Mr Willys , " said Sophia maliciously . " So many things seem to happen to him " " He 's very unlucky , poor man , " said Philip , watching the murderessmanquee out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be listening . " One could almost believe in a malignant destiny . How could one man have so many things happen to him ? " " Foul play ? " suggested Philip . " It 's possible . But who would want to hurt poor , harmless Mr. Willys ? " " Mr Willys himself . " " Possibly . But no one else . The whole thing is so strange . " Then , having made Mrs Peabody suffer for her projected sin , they changed the subject and spoke of the trip they were to make that day to some tombs near the Valley of the Kings and , to their great surprise , Mrs Peabody asked if she might accompany them that afternoon because : " I 've never done those tombs . . . the ones where the nobles were buried . " And so , since there was no polite way to refuse her , she was allowed to join the expedition . After leaving the hotel , they went down the steps to the river where a rowboat and their dragoman were waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , pinkfaced , to stare back . Then , crossing the slow , warm river , they passed a sand island where donkeys were being raced to the delightof a large group of men . How the donkeys had got there and why they were racing one another Philip could never learn for the dragoman , though he spoke English fluently , invariably expressedhimself in such cryptic phrases that Philip preferred not to ask him questions . He was necessary as an interpreter but that was all for , among the ruins , Sophia took over ; even the dragoman had finally come to recognize her authority . Mrs Peabody was silent all the way across the Nile . When they got into their horse-drawn carriage on the other side , she said she disliked horses but except for that single observation she made no further comment or objection as they drove off in the heat , across the dusty countryside which stretched , dark green and gray and white , to the all-white hills with their treeless cliffs and level summits where , hidden away , was the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft limestone . But they did not drive to that valley ; instead , they drove along the road to the two Colossi of Amenhotep III , serene and immense , looking across the river to the sun and to the living city . Thebes-Living and Thebes-Dead were the names by which the east and the west banks were known to the natives . And this was indeed a dead city , thought Philip , looking about at the ruins , the funeral temples , the small sunbaked villages built on the foothillsso that the Nile , when it flooded , would not wash them away . . . a place all desolate and strange , a bleak land inhabitedby a listless people , victim of that same sun which the child of the Colossus Amenhotep had wanted all the world to worship , the glowing origin and the scourge of life . As they drove past one of the villages , a warren of adobe huts on a be-tunneled rise of white porous rock , a figure , tall and spare in flapping robes , stood in the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then , with an abrupt gesture , he unfurled a piece of cloth which snapped and rippled in the wind like a banner , likep225a signal to the ghosts that strangers were approaching their tombs . " What can he be doing ? " asked Philip . " Beating a rug , " said Fay Peabody ; it was her first remark since they had got into the carriage and both Sophia and Philip looked at her with greater respect than they would ordinarily have done had she been conversing as usual . The rug theory prevailed . Mrs Peabody had , with one sure phrase , created her own atmosphere and Egypt flattened out , receded , became a backdrop and this was only fieldwork , after all . At the base of the largest foothill , their carriage stopped in the shade of a withered acacia and the explorers got out . Before them , as though carved by the tributaries of a long dead river , were a series of small ravines cut a dozen feet into the soft rock and all connecting , like the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the tombs of the very rich , those nobles who had once adorned the vanished capital across the river . The day passed pleasantly . They visited many of the tombs , small cheerful little rooms cut in stone with bright wall paintings and tiny chapels . The colors were new and fresh , preserved by the dry heat ; and they read in pictures about the lives of the dead and looked at representations of their country houses , children , friends , and all the activities of three thousand years before . Mrs Peabody took many notes . She spoke very little but what she did say was to the point . They were , Philip decided , seeing the true Fay Peabody , the tireless workman , the master craftswomangiving her fans the best that was in her . Once when Sophia and the dragoman were quarreling over a figure of Osiris , Philip got Mrs Peabody off in one corner of the tomb of the Second Chief Accountant to the Royal Household and asked her in a low voice why the last attempt on the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I miscalculated the position of the crosspiece , " she said bitterly , implying she would rather not have made this admission.  | " But it was clearly in the center of the bed . I do n't see how you could have expected it to drop anywhere except in the middle of the mattress or on his stomach . " " It was weighted , " she said , looking at him with undisguised malevolence . " It was so arranged that when he turned over the entire thing would drop , from a considerable height , onto his head . Had it done so , he would no longer be with us . I had not counted , however , on his head being on the very edge of the bed . The odds were ten to one it would be close to the center where the weight did fall , missing him . " " I think it 's getting on his nerves , these false attempts of yours . " " Getting on his nerves ! " She glared at him . " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine I enjoy making a fool of myself before all the world ? . . . or at least before you and Mr Willys . You seem to forget that I embarked on this project for completely selfless reasons . I have twice failed of my object .. . I admit that . But I hardly feel that others should criticize me for not being able to do easily what they would never dare attempt to do in the first place . I want it clearly understood , by both you and Mr Willys , that I will brook no criticism of my methods and if I do not have the fullest co-operation and confidence of Mr Willys at least , I may be forced to withdraw altogether . Do you understand ? " " Perfectly . " " You will repeat this to Mr Willys ? " " I will . " " What time is it , by the way ? " " Four o'clock . " " Ah ! Then you will probably he spared the onerous task of repeatingwhat I have said for , unless some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here , among the tombs , the announcement lost much of its inherent awfulness . " But how ... " She would not answer his question though . Instead , she unpinnedher veil , shutting out the world with muslin.  |p227Mr  Koyoumdjian was in a rage . " I 'm going to have him moved today . I wo n't have him here another minute . The servants are thinking somebody has got the evil eye and they wo n't go near him . He 's jinxed . " " You mean Mr Willys ? " asked Philip " I certainly do . " " Has . . . something happened to him ? " asked Fay Peabody , one hand on the corner of the desk as though to steady herself . " Asthma ! " Mr Koyoumdjian moaned . " He nearly choked to death . The doctor 's with him . I 'm going to get him out of this hotel if it 's the last thing I do . " Sophia looked at Philip and smiled . Mrs Peabody , without a word , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done to him ? " murmured Philip , as he and Sophia followed Mrs Peabody up the stairs . " I have n't any idea . Do you think she tried again ? " " Oh yes . She told me so this afternoon . She intimated that he would be dead when we got back . " " Poor woman . She must be desperate . I hope she does n't lose l Icr head and blow up the entire hotel . " Mrs Peabody did not lose her head , however . Instead she came down to dinner even more carefully dressed than usual , her garnetscomplemented by a double strand of pearls which were 1 ingy enough , small enough , to be real . She was obviously aware that both Philip and Sophia knew her scheme and she carried t l Ie dinner off as well as possible under the circumstances , disussingfluently and instructively the large world of detectiveriters and readers among whom she was still a figure of the YYreatest magnitude , a thought which obviously sustained her now in I her hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest bulletin : " Ile 's going in the morning . The doctor says he should n't be Illoved but when I told him I could n't have any more of this monkeybusiness in my hotel he said they 'd send a car over tomorrow and take him to the hospital . I 've never seen anything like it . Myp228staff is just about ready to leave . They say a demon is loose in the hotel . " " Is he feeling better ? " asked Mrs Peabody with an air of gentle concern . " I think so . He stopped choking . . . looks weak , though . Does n't want to leave , of course , but I had the doctor tell him he would have to go in the morning . " " He 's certainly an unlucky creature , " said Sophia . " I sure wish he 'd be unlucky somewhere else , " said the manager . In the lobby , after dinner , Philip had another chance to talk with Mrs Peabody . She tried to avoid him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " he asked . " I would rather not discuss it . " " You wo n't try again , will you ? " " It 's no business of yours , " she snapped . " But to satisfy your curiosity , no , I wo n't try again . Now , if you 'll excuse me . . . " " Do tell me what you did this last time . " " I placed a certain deadly , air-polluting poison in the pistils of a large number of flowers which I then set about his room so that , in a few hours , the atmosphere would be completely malignant . I had not , however , taken into account the fact that Mr Willys had an allergy to all flowers and that he nearly choked to death before they could be removed . " " Frankly , Mrs Peabody , I 'm astonished you failed . I ca n't imagineanything simpler than killing someone who wants to die in a country where there probably would never be an investigation . " " I should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it every day . How can you explain that ? Thousands of murders go undetected every year . . . people get away with it all the time . I ca n't understand why you , with every advantage , ca n't do as well . " " Perhaps because I am not a criminal , " said Mrs Peabody ; and she went upstairs . " How did she do it this timer asked Sophia , when the other was gone . " Poisoned flowers ... to contaminate the air . "  | " She 's much too subtle . What went wrong ? " Philip told her and she laughed . " If only her fans could see her now . " That night , before going to bed , Philip visited Mr Willys . He looked the same as ever but his thin voice was more weak than usual and talking seemed to tire him . " It 's all over with me , " he said . " She wo n't try again . " " Just as well . I was always against the idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ; after wrecking my nerves and health she refuses to finish the job . . . it is n't fair . It just is n't fair . " " I 'm sure you 'll be well in no time . " " I expect to be an invalid for the next twenty years . I can hardly move as it is . The strain of getting out of bed and going to the bathroom gives me such palpitations that I can hardly bear it . Oh , it 's so terrible , " and he moaned , plaintively , his eyes tight shut , as though to blot the world out forever . " It nearly worked last time , " said Philip , illogically , hoping that this would please him , this reference to the plan which had failed ; it did not . " The fool . . . the incompetent fool ! " Mr Willys turned on his former idol with a ferocity made all the more frightening because his voice was so weak , so incapable of bearing the passion of a denunciation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought there might be a plug nickel in it for him ; but the brilliantFay Peabody , given every chance in the world , flops . She could have asked me about the flowers . But no , she waited until I 'd gone to the bathroom , then she put them all around the room like a funeral parlor . It was half an hour before I could get enough breath to shout for help . " " Do you think that anyone suspected the flowers were poi-soned ? " " How ? They were thrown out right away , while I was strangling . I suppose if she had put a few more in the room , nature might have done the trick . " " Did she have any excuse to make ? " " She attacked me for having an allergy . Said it was the mostp230ridiculous thing she 'd ever heard of , that if she 'd put it in a story nobody 'd believe it . " " I hope you told her off . " " Do n't worry ! I said that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking the bed , fat rippling dangerously as he gagged , tried to get his breath . When finally he did , he was pale and exhausted , too sick to acknowledge Philip 's sympathy . The next morning , refusing the litter which the doctor had sent over , Mr Willys dressed himself and slowly descended the stairs , supported on each side by a fragile native boy . It was the first time that Philip had seen Mr Willys on his feet and he was surprised to find that he was a short man , broader than he was tall , with ludicrously small hands and feet . He wore a crumpled white suit and a loud tie decorated with reindeer , a souvenir no doubt from his greeting card days . He was very pale and breathing hard when , against the doctor 's advice and the manager 's wish , he insisted on joining the others at breakfast . " Good morning , " he puffed , as a place was laid for him . " It 's nice to see you up , " said Sophia politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean . I am hardly up . I can hardly breathe in this weather . . . a large breakfast seems in order , though . " And he had them bring him sausages , eggs and potatoes , as well as toast and coffee . " A real American breakfast , " he said , eating as quickly as he could , his white face glistening with sweat . " Do you think you should eat so much in this heat ? " asked Philip , somewhat sickened by the other 's unnatural appetite . " I need a hearty breakfast , " mumbled Mr Willys . " I believe that toast and coffee is all anybody needs , " said Fay Peabody . " Except , of course , working men who must labor with their hands . " Mr Willys snorted but made no answer as he speared a fried potato . Philip looked out the French windows at the green gardensp231flickering in the heat . For several moments the only sound at the table was the wet noise of Mr Willys chewing and swallowing food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to go next ? " " Switzerland , if I can survive the altitude . Start taking glands and things . See if maybe they can do something . Doubt it , though . " This speech was dragged out to an inordinate length by long stops for breath and nourishment . Philip could not take his eyes off him as much as he would rather have looked anywhere else than at that gray shapeless face with the loose lips which quiveredas Mr Willys gasped and talked and chewed , all at once . Philip almost wished , if only on aesthetic grounds , that Mrs Peabodyhad succeeded . " Will you be in Europe long ? " asked Sophia , who , of them all , was the only one not officially in on the conspiracy which had failed . " Ca n't tell . May go back to Philly . Though it 's hot there , too . Waiter , bring me some more toast . One place pretty much like another to me , except some are hot and some are cool . Want a cool place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poached egg which Philip never wanted to see done again . " Did you get to see much of Egypt ? " Sophia was intent on being polite . " Saw the Sphinx my first day in Cairo . Then had a heat stroke and I 've been laid up ever since . First there ; now here . " " I 'm sure you 'd have enjoyed Karnak . " " Do n't think so . I did want to see the Sphinx but outside of thatI 'm not so keen on sightseeing . It 's hard on a man my size . " " Why did you want to see the Sphinx ? " asked Sophia . " Always heard about it . " " Did you like it ? " " Not much . Face all gone . " " At least you 're able to get a bit of reading done , " said Philip helpfully . . . only a few minutes to go.  | " Do n't read too much ; my eyes ca n't take it . I like detective stories , though " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at Mrs Peabody who had the grace not to stare back . " I 'm sure Mrs Peabody is pleased to hear that , " said Sophia . " I 've never read a detective story , I 'm afraid . . . a terrible confession to make in front of you , " she said , turning to the authoress . " Not at all . I am aware that the vineyard in which I have for so long toiled produces nothing more than a good table wine . At least so the connoisseurs in these matters seem to think ; but it is good enough for me and for a great many other people as well , both at home and abroad . " Mr Willys looked at her with loathing , but he said nothing while the others talked about Mrs Peabody 's vineyard . The manager came in just as Mr Willys was debating whether to have more coffee . " The car 's waiting for you outside , sir . I 've also got the bill for you and some other things out in the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them for me . " " Let us go then , " said Mr Willys , pushing back from the table ; the two frail native boys moved forward , got him to his feet and escorted him out of the dining room and into the lobby . Mrs Peabody , with a bleak little smile , excused herself and left the room for the morning-fresh garden . " Well , that 's the end of that , " said Philip . " She seems rather crushed by it all . " " And he does n't , which is suspicious . He seems almost cheer-ful . " " A great deal of attention sometimes has a good effect on people who are often alone . I do n't suppose Mr Willys has ever been the center of attention before in his life , except as a minor curiosityin public places . " " All that food ! " Philip shuddered . " He could hardly walk . " " Let 's go see him off , " said Philip , and they went into the lobby where Mr Willys stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr Koyoumdjian , beaming with relief , was wishing him a quick recovery.  | " Ah , there you are , " said Mr Willys as they approached . " This is it , I 'm off at last . " " Have a good trip , " said Philip , shaking the cold damp hand . " Are you going to stay at the hospital for very long or are you goingdown to Cairo ? " " Cairo . I 'll be at the hospital overnight for a checkup ; then I 'm leaving this goddamn country for good . " " I was going to say if you were at the hospital for any length of time , we would come visit you . " " Very kind of you , I must say . You 've been wonderful about the whole thing . . . very kind . But now I must be off . Good-by , Miss Oliver ; it 's been a pleasure . " Then , unaccompanied , he walked into the sunlight where he collapsed , a few feet from the automobile which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last recorded words were : " Get a doctor . " The sudden death of Mr Willys shocked them all , even though they had for so long and so nervously awaited his murder at the hands of Fay Peabody . To Philip it seemed , somehow , grossly unfair while to the manager it was the end : he did not believe anyone could be as jinxed as he was , or as the hotel was . Several servants resigned on the spot while the remaining ones gave him a vote of no confidence but did not press for any immediate ac-t ion , either on his part or theirs . The body was removed the moment the doctor announced that the anguished , flesh-burdened soul of Mr Willys had departed this vale of tears . Philip told the doctor that the deceased had wanted to be cremated and his ashes cast into the Nile . This last touch was Philip 's own . The doctorthought they might have trouble finding a large enough oven or this purpose but that there was a possibility the brick kiln on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Willys had had sufficient cash in his pocket to make a fine cremationpossible . . . the other details such as the disposition of personaleffects and the writing to the next of kin was assigned to Mr Koyoumdjian.  |p234That  night at dinner the two ladies wore black and Philip wore a blue serge suit . " What did the doctor say he died of ? " asked Sophia , after a long , lugubrious silence . " A heart attack , " said Philip , in a low reverent voice . " Excitement , the heat , and all that food he ate finished him off . " " What were his last words ? " asked Mrs Peabody , softly , her hands folded before her on the table , as though in prayer . " He asked for a doctor , " said Philip ; a sudden suspicion crossed his mind . " It does n't sound as if he was very sincere , " said Mrs Peabody , unaware of the suspicion in which she was held by Philip . " All that talk about wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is frightened . . . a lack of moral fiber , I should say . " " You . . . you were n't responsible ? " asked Philip , forgetting that Sophia was not supposed to know about the attempt on Mr Willys 's life . " No , I was n't , " said Mrs Peabody . " I debated whether or not to give it one last whirl . His rudeness to me at breakfast , however , restrained my essentially kind impulse and I allowed him to departfor what I hoped might have been a long life of physical distress and melancholia . Fortunately , for him , nature inter-vened . " The next day the manager brought Philip a shoe box which contained all that was mortal of Mr Willys . " You go throw them in the Nile , " said Mr Koyoumdjian , " and do it quick because if the boys find out that even that guy 's ashes are in the hotel , they 'll leave me flat . " Philip said that he would conduct the last rites immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank of the Nile and climbed down the rocky embankment to the water 's edge . Sailboats glided across the water . A dozen men were bathingnear by , indifferent to Sophia 's presence , their lean hard bodiesgleaming like polished metal in the sunlight , as unlike hisp236THE JUDGMENT OF PARISmemory of Mr Willys as it was possible to be , thought Philip , opening the box which contained some gray-black lumps of bone and ash . " Who would have thought he could have been compressed to this ? " he said , in an unconscious paraphrase . " Give me the box , " said Sophia , and she took it from the bemusedPhilip and emptied its contents into the green water . " You see how easy it is ? " she asked , throwing the box away . " How easy what is ? " " Dying . " " No , I don't. "  |p237HE  PRESSED his eyelids and saw two black suns , two eclipses in the red darkness . His head ached from the glare and heat of the day which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes again and looked across the desert at the near-by pyramids : large buff-colored objects as meaningless as a child 's toys upset in a sandbox . The sky was lovely , though : a pale luminous pink , cloudless and now , as the red disc slipped over the desert 's edge , sunless as well , leaving the sky still full of light . To his left was Cairo and to his right the desert . The green Nile Valley ended abruptly at his feet . One foot touched the grass ; the other the brown desert : the line between was unnaturally precise , as though drawn by a giant . He turned and looked at the city , coral pink and white , divided by the Nile , edged by dusty green which was , in its turn , circled by the wide flat desert at whose edge he now stood , a few yards from Mena House where he had been entertainedthat day with lunch and a swim in the hotel 's new pool . Thinking of his host , wondering if he should go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly up the steep road which led to the pyramids . He was nearly at the top , when he heard someone call his name . He stopped until , out of breath , his host and new friend Charles de Cluny joined him . " I had things to do . The manager wanted to know about a  |p238|party  some friends of mine were giving . How I hate this hill ! It 's so steep . I 'm quite out of breath . The sky . Is n't it a fine color ? This is the time of day when I find myself really loving Egypt . Rose . Wonderful rose color , the sky , and cool out here in the open without tLe sun . Here we are . " They were now at the top of the sand hill near the base of the great pyramid . Below them in the roseate distance was Cairo while across the desert , indistinct by twilight , were the other pyramids , like so many broken metronomes . " Magnificent sight . I never tire of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . Think what they must have seen . Think ! " Philip thought and then de Cluny , shifting from contemplation of the past to the scandal of the present , pointed to the only house in the desert , a small cube of a building with great windows and a soldier standing guard in front of it . " His , " he whispered . And from his tone Philip knew that he meant Farouk , the King , a plump young Albanian , a ribald successorto those austere Pharaohs who had reigned before him over the same green valley . " He brings his women here , " his guide whispered as they moved toward the great pyramid . " Including the dress models , the ones from Paris . " " Is it true . .. " " About the cigarettes ? " " Yes . " And he repeated to Philip the current bit of scandal : a couturier had come to Cairo with a number of models and his latest collectionto be shown to the royal ladies . The king , so the story went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butts , presumably lighted , at the models in the hope of landing a butt in the decollete . Cairo was amused . The ladies and the couturierwere not . They had promptly gone back to Paris , leaving behind one of their number , a moonglow blonde . " A gloomy-looking place , " said Philip , as they passed the sentry . " No trees , no garden . . . just sand . "  | " But the view ! Think of it ! Having the pyramids in front of you on a starlit night , with a beautiful woman beside you . . . how evocative : to recall in the midst of an orgy that one owns the pyramidsout there and all the desert around , to know that one is king . What a lovely prospect for a young man ! No wonder it 's gone to his head . " " Do you think he enjoys it ? " said Philip who often , in selfdefense , liked to take the popular American view that the rich and powerful were hopelessly miserable with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their wealth and even less for their power which was , of course , invariably attended by guilt and shame . The old woman who dies in a tenement house with fifty thousand dollars sewed in her mattress or the Texas millionaire who lives on cornflakes and weak tea are recurrent American folk types . .. but even Philip had to agree that the king of Egypt probablynever suffered from much more than an occasional hangover or a moment 's anguish at the lithe figure he had sacrificed to a robust appetite . Philip 's companion explained all these things to him as they approached the great pyramid at whose base guides and ragamuffinswere gathered in cheerful discussion groups , assemblies which quickly adjourned at the approach of the foreigners . In a moment Philip and his companion were the center of the annoying , chattering Cairo crowd ; everyone had something to sell . . . in this case , a tour of the pyramids , a visit to the Sphinx , postcards , a ride on a camel , a debauch with one enterprising twelveyear-oldboy who made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together or separately , a good time . Philip 's first impulse was to ignore the crowd , to walk as though they were not there . But , as he soon discovered , this was not possible . They made too much noise ; they pulled at his sleeves , got under his feet . His companion dismissed a number of them with a few significant words in Egyptian ; the rest continued to mill about , however , as Philip , ready to throw stones , walked to the base of that Pyramid which is ascribed to Cheops . Up close , it was like a geometrical mountain or rock pile . One of the boys scurriedp240up it , out of sight , like Jack on the beanstalk . He returned , a moment later , breathless . Philip 's companion gave him a coin and the child indignantly asked for more . The foreigners fled , shaking off all their pursuers except the boy . They stopped , breathless , on the edge of a valley where , handsomelysilhouetted against the sky , was , yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller and less tidy than he had expected ; to our authority , Professor Rawlinson , it is " among the marvels of Egypt , second to none . The mysterious being with the head of a man and the body of a lion is not at all uncommon in Egyptian architectural adornment , but the one placed before the Second Pyramid ( The Pyramid of Shafra ) and supposed to be contemporaneous with it , astonishes the observer by its gigantic proportions . It is known to the Arabs as Abul-hOl , the father of terror . " And Philip , ignoring the whining boy , stared into the mild , faintly smiling face and saw nothing at all , only an ancient monument ; and yet , though what he saw was not in itself impressive , the associations of thousands of years affected him as strongly as it had at Luxor and he experienced once again that grave serenity , that secret knowledge of the endless flow of life , of generation and regeneration , never-ending , never-constant , the endless structurewhich contained all time and matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes which could hold it all . Then the sky turned gray and silver specks appeared overhead ; the ruddy-faced Sphinx turned the color of slate and Philip mutteredthat frightening name , Abul-hol , to himself as he and de Cluny walked back to Mena House , the boy , like a dog , snapping at their heels all the way . Later he sat in the dark rose-smelling garden of the hotel and drank whisky with Charles de Cluny , his friend of several days now , a traveler like himself , but a knowing traveler , one who had been here often before . He was French and he had lived nearly everywhere , Philip gathered : in Central America , in Europe , in New Orleans ; now , for this month at least , he was in Cairo . He had never been up the Nile and he had no wish to go , althoughp241lie did have a certain real love of history , as well as a glib and authoritative fund of stories with which he amused Philip , telling him about the Pharaohs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on a thorough knowledge of Suetonius , from whom he made free and imaginative adaptations . But Philip was more interested when he spoke of the contemporary world which he knew well , of exiled royalties and rich tourists , of the voluptuaries whose deeds always awed and excited him , no matter how tawdry he knew they must be in actual fact . " When does she arrive , this friend of yours ? " asked Charles suddenly . " Miss Oliver ? Next week , I think . She 's in the desert now . I have no idea where ; but I suppose she 'll be here when she said she would . " " She sounds like a very intelligent woman , " said Charles , disapprovingly . " Very , " said Philip . " She 's good company . That 's all . " " Ah . Then you 're not in love ? " " Good Lord , no ! She 's the last woman in the world I 'd be inWrestedin . " " Do you think she knows that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " said Philip , who sometimes wondered whether she had or not ; his vanity often insisted that she did love him . . . a real fire beneath the cold surface . I I is reason , however , thought it unlikely . " Is she wealthy ? " " I expect so . " " I wonder if she might want to buy some jewels . I have an impoverishedcousin  --  as a matter of fact , I have dozens of impoverishedcousins  --  but the one I have in mind has some exquisite pigeon's-blood rubies which she 'd sell for nothing . Do find out if Miss Oliver 's interested . It would be such a help if she were . M v cousin , by chance , happens to be right here in Cairo . " " I 'll ask her , " said Philip , wondering how de Cluny himself earned a living . " I should appreciate that . "  |p242After  a long silence , de Cluny asked Philip if he knew Zoe Helotius . " Only slightly . Is she here ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . But then there 's to be a great party and wherever there 's a great affair , Zoe 's on hand . Amusing woman . When did you know her ? " Philip told him . A number of names were then exchanged . They had several acquaintances in common which they had not , until that moment , bothered to discuss . They had met as strangers and neither had made too much effort to fix the other 's place in the world since the identities of both were so clearly apparent : a young American of apparent leisure and a French adventurer with a taste , but not a flair , for philosophy and a flair , but no taste , for a fashionable life on an income which seemed uncertain . " If you care to , " said de Cluny , when Philip 's attitude and positionhad become more clearly defined after the naming of the names , " I might get you invited . It might interest you . A real Cairo affair to celebrate the wedding of . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two Egyptian men so highly placed that they could have touched the throne itself if they had been so minded . " Only it will be a Western party ... although we wo n't see the bride , of course . Both gentlemen are enlightened , more or less , but not that much . Other women will be there , however . . . in spite of the Prophet . " " Sounds interesting , " said Philip , going through the polite ritual of " but " until he was sure that he was really invited ; then he accepted . There was too much of everything at the reception : too many people , too many flowers , too much food and champagne , and more jewels than Philip had ever seen before . The non-orthodox Egyptian women were especially gaudy in lace and damask with huge yellow diamonds , square emeralds and rubies like gouts of blood ; their glossy black hair coiled and contorted by Paris hair.  |p243dressers  , dusted with gold or bright with diamond moons and stars . Philip had never before seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , airy room to the next , through Moorish arches each guarded by servants in livery while others , in white Westernstylejackets , served wine . De Cluny was an excellent guide . He saw to it that they never remained too long with the very dull or missed meeting the occasionalodd or interesting citizens of Cairo who stood , usually , at the center of large groups , receiving homage , constructing epigrams or diatribes or platitudes or whatever their specialty happened to be , their genius joyfully applauded by the distinguishedand decorative audience which moved from one point of interest to the next , like tourists in a museum . The host , a large imposing man in a morning coat , welcomed them gravely in French , declaring that his house was theirs . That was the last they saw of him . " And there , " said de Cluny , in a low voice , as they crossed the largest of the rooms , " is a Russian spy , under the chandelier .. . calls herself Princess . " The spy was a small pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian sari . She smiled engagingly at de Cluny . ' IIow are you ? " she said in French , as he kissed her hand . " And how are you ? I 've seen you in Shepheard 's , have n't I ? " Philip said that she had . " Oh , let 's find some chairs . Everyone stands . It just makes me wilt , standing in the heat . " She went over to one corner where three gilt chairs were placed against the wall . Two of them were empty ; the third was occupied by a small Egyptian . The spy gave a dazzling smile . " Princess would like to sit down , " she said . The small Egyptian looked puzzled . " I said , Princess would like to sit down , " repeated the spy , more sternly ; with a frightened expression , the little man got to his feet and fled . " ' That 's better , is n't it ? " They sat down . " They have such bad manners , Egyptians . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naively , not realizing that in Cairo no one asked the spies direct questions for fear of seemingnot only gauche but , worst of all , indelicate and prying . " My mother is Indian , " she said , repeating the same dazzling smile that so confused the former occupant of the chair ; then she began a long involved story about the peregrinations of her familyand herself , a melange of nationalities and resounding titles . " But I am talking only of myself , " she exclaimed , when both de Cluny and Philip were afraid she might never talk of anything else again all evening , holding them close to her with her brilliantsmile , with her tiny gesturing hands which , every now and then , touched Philip 's sleeve as she named yet another country in which she had lived . " But I am talking only of myself . Tell me about you . " " I 'm an American , " said Philip . " There is n't much more to tell . " " Come now . Princess does n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman building oil wells and making dollars i I , all over the world . " For a moment he was afraid that this might be a preface to an attack on capitalism , but she meant it literally . " No , I 'm a tourist , just out of school , " he said ; her interest Waned perceptibly . " How wonderful for you to come see our old countries . To breathe the same air that Cleopatra did ! Oh , history is my pas .. lion ! How I should love to have lived in those times and gone to the sources of the Nile in a pleasure barge . Princess would like some champagne . " It took him a moment to separate the request from the rhapsody ; by the time he did , de Cluny had already clapped his hands and a boy came with champagne for them . " Are n't you drinking , Charles ? " she asked , noticing that de Cluny refused the wine . " I 'm a good Moslem today . " " Now you 're making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she believes the Prophet would not mind too much since he has promised us all the wine that we can drink in Heaven . " " Only the men were promised that , " said de Cluny with a smilo.  | " You are old-fashioned . Tell me , though , how are your cousins ? i was at a dinner not long ago with one of them but I forget her name . " There are so many . " " How wonderful it must be to have distinguished relatives all over the world . " " And all struggling to survive , " said de Cluny . " The old ways change , " said the Princess gravely , putting down her glass ; then , making the usual farewells , she walked off . " I do n't believe she 's a Russian spy , " said Philip , as they moved toward another large room where an orchestra was playing waltzes . " I 'm sure she 's not either , " said de Cluny agreeably , " but she 's just like the ones they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . . . believe me ! Everyone was a spy and . . . Oh look , there he is . " They stopped in the doorway of the ballroom where a dozen couples were dancing to the music of an orchestra which was hiddenbehind a group of potted palms . The parquet floor had been newly waxed and , from time to time , the dancers slipped and stumbled , amusing spectators who stood chatting around the room , all eyes for the most part discreetly centered on a short burly figure in a tuxedo who was , de Cluny murmured to Philip in a low voice , the king of Egypt . Philip immediately recognized the curiously stiff figure and immobile face , half hidden now by dark glasses which made him look , more than ever , like an interesting experiment in taxidermy . The blonde with whom he was dancing was a head taller than he and very beautiful . " He 's incognito , " said de Cluny . " In other words , no one is allowed to fuss over him . But , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent . . . a happy arrangement . But here are the guards . " Philip looked and saw that in each corner of the room stood a man in a business suit , hand in pocket , revolverbarrel pointed . " What a nuisance , " commented Philip ; then they came to the last of the rooms , a small Chinese one , with carved teakwoodp246furniture and crimson silk banners on the walls . Here a group of sedate Westerners were gathered , talking politics . De Cluny knew them all and he introduced Philip , saying the names rapidlyand precisely ; then , since there was no place farther to go , their journey ended , they sat down and de Cluny promptly talked politics with the severest and grayest of the men , and , listening to his friend , Philip could not help but feel that he was perhaps too fluent , too affable , too ready to see the other person 's point of view and to argue it with even greater eloquence than the other person was himself capable of , at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . Zoe Helotius entered the room like some predatory bird of prey with white leather face and sharp nose , her blood-red lips in an ikon 's smile , as she attacked , surrounded by equerries , advisers , friends and enemies who spread out like an army , flanking the room , picking off this person and that person , rounding up the residents until a series of concentric circles had been arranged , the lesser figures close to the periphery , important ones at the small center where Zoe herself stood , talking quickly , casting febrileglances around the room to see if she were missing anything . She was not . She was the center of attraction ; the main event . " Ah , Charles , my dear . It 's been a long time . " " Five years , madame . " " Too long a time . And how is X ? and Y ? I love them so . I never see them any more . You must come and pay me a call while I 'm here . . . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A shudderof delight went through the circles , like waves from a stone cast in water , the circles ever widening until at last they spent themselves against the insensate silk-hung walls . " Mr Warren ? Have we met ? In Capri ? Ah , Regina 's friend . I remember now . You were attached to the Embassy at Rome . I love your Ambassador . Tell him I look forward to that dinner in Venice . . . he 'll know what I mean . Is Regina here in Cairo ? But of course not . I saw her in Paris a week ago . . . so much more like a queen than any of the queens one knows , if you follow me . Do you know her , Charles ? Yes ? No ? Ah , you would lovep247her . She has such style and he , well , one defers to the most powerfulman in the world , which he is nowadays . But , " and she loweredher voice and opened her eyes very wide , her onyx irises circled now by white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Philip was by now sufficiently used to the varying degrees of emphasis with which people in Cairo mentioned otherwise unidentified pronouns to establish correctly the intended reference : he was Farouk ; she was the lovely but seldom seen Persian he had married . " I hope not , " said Charles , neutrally . " It is what they say . But here is Anna Morris . Where have you been hiding ? This is Charles de Cluny , Mr Warren . " Charles kissed the lady 's hand ; Philip bowed to the newcomer , a dark-haired girl , Philip 's age , with large hazel eyes and , he quickly saw , a husband who joined them a moment later , a burly , rough-voiced man with a limp . An industrialist , Philip gathered . In steel . " Some party , " said Mr Morris , in a tone which could easily have been hostile . " Never seen so much jewelry in my life . Pay off the whole Egyptian debt with one roomful of it . " " You have no love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told them all about it while Philip talked to Anna , learning that she was originally European of mixed nationality and that she was now married to the industrialist with whom she was touringEurope and North Africa for her pleasure as well for his business : he had come to Egypt to sell steel . Philip was charmed by her , by her voice which was low and melodic , faintly accented and appealing , like no other voice he had ever heard . He was fascinated , prudent , diffident , too , not sure of himself , overawed by the virile , bull-necked husband in whose broad shadow she now stood unmistakably interested in Philip and yet obviously attached to her husband , moving always closer to him as they talked , moving away from Philip as though she wanted , somehow , to include or seem to include her husband while in no way sacrificingthis moment 's privacy with the young American who attractedher.  | " It is too much , " she said , in answer to a remark of Philip 's about the reception . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The petit Trianon ? " " Oh , I 'm sure I would have loved that . Have you been there ? " He shook his head . " I 've never been in France . Next month I 'll be there , in Paris . " " I lived there a long time . . . " " Is it .. . " It is . " She smiled . " You 'll never want to leave . " " I 'm sure of that . " " But when you do leave you 'll not be the same . " He laughed . " Now , that 's an exaggeration . I 've known hundreds of people who 've gone there , been enchanted , and returned the same as ever . " " But not you . I can tell . " She looked at him gravely while he looked not at her serious , shining eyes but at her mouth instead , wondering at its Botticelli shape , like a bird gliding , the upper lip childishly pursed . " I can believe anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief , I think . Until recently I doubted everything and trusted no one . Now the wilder , the more improbable the story I am told , the more eager I am to believe it . Tell me there are serpents in the sea and I will believe you ; the next time I travel by ship I will see one a mile long , attended by mermaids with seaweed in their hair . " " There are serpents in the sea , " she said , smiling , one hand touching the odd-shaped bit of crystal she wore about her neck on a silver chain . " Then I shall surely see one . " " Mermaids , too ? " " A platoon of them , all wearing naval officers ' caps . " She laughed and then , aware that her husband was saying farewell to Mrs Helotius , she turned to Philip and gave him her hand . " Perhaps I 'll see you when you come to Paris . Where will you stay ? " " I 've no idea . Where do you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
