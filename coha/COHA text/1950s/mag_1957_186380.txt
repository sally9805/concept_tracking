GREAT BRITAIN <P> Since the convulsions of the Suez crisis and Sir Anthony Eden 's resignation as Prime Minister , all Britain has been eying " the little general election " in nine constituencies . Though these by-elections can not shake the government 's substantial majority ( about 60 ) in the House of Commons , they are a good index of the Tory government 's popularity . <P> The first three seats contested , Labor won . Last week the Conservative Party won two , but with pluralities gravely reduced . Prime Minister Harold Macmillan felt obliged to call a private meeting of the Conservative backbenchers . Said he : " Do n't get rattled . The government is not going to be stampeded into a general election . " <P> In Bristol West , normally one of the Tory Party 's ten top redoubts , the winning Tory candidate got 8,000 fewer voters than his predecessor . In Warwick and Leamington , the fox-hunting constituency recently vacated by Sir Anthony Eden after 33 years , Tory managers anticipated that their candidate , lacking Eden 's magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he scraped through by a mere 2,157 . <P> Labor poured everything it had into Warwick and Leamington . Its managers and organizers criticized Suez , played up the threat of unemployment and the rising cost of living . Not only were there a large number of Tory abstentions on election day , but Labor 's own vote was up a fantastic 12% . " Resign ! " cried Labor M.P . Barbara Castle , and other Laborites took up the cry . But Harold Macmillan has no intention of resigning . <P> Despite Macmillan 's calm , there is much unease among the more than 100 Tory M.P.s who hold their constituencies by pluralities of 3,000 or less . It is standard Tory talk that it is necessary to be courageously unpopular now , that within a year the benefits of the government 's tightening economic policy will be more apparent and people will have forgotten Suez and gas rationing . Against the probability that his new administration does not now have a majority in Britain , Macmillan answers confidently : " This government will run its full term 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the issues of the next election . "
