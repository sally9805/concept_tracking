" I caught some pretty good pitching staffs in my time , " said Cleveland Manager Al Lopez , " but this tops them all . " Ex-Catcher Lopez ( Brooklyn , 1930-35 ) was in a mood to crow . By this week the Indians had won eleven straight , 38 of their last 47 games , had pulled themselves up from ten games off the pace to a lead of two and a half games over the New York Yankees in the nip &; tuck American League pennant race . <P> Though Cleveland 's famed sluggers , Luke Easter , Flip Rosen and Larry Doby , were wallowing in a batting slump , and the team was hitting a dismal .265 ( sixth place ) , Lopez was getting above-standard performances from Pitchers Mike Garcia ( 16-7 ) , Bob Lemon ( 13-9 ) and Early Wynn ( 12-11 ) , as well as from lefthanded Reliefer Lou Brissie ( 59 hits in 74 innings ) . But the man who was really cracking the whip in the Cleveland pennant drive was Righthander Bob Feller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing season since he came to the majors , was having his best ever . His 19 victories ( four defeats ) leads both leagues in his 13th year in the majors , puts him well on the way to 25 wins for the season . <P> Ex-Fireballer Feller has slowed down with age ( 32 ) , but more than makes up for it in experience . " I do n't pitch as fast as I used to , " says Bob , " do n't know whether I could . I guess I 'm only about 85 or 90% as fast as I used to be . I do n't try fast balls so much . I mix them up a good deal by trying curve balls and sliders . Hitters are n't afraid I 'll hit them with wild pitches like I used to , so it 's harder to pitch to them . They know I 've got good control . " <P> But Feller , whose big ambition is still to win a World Series game , * thinks he will get a chance at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game is to get up there . We 've done that , and I think we 'll stay . " Manager Lopez , violating every tradition of the trade , is sure of it . " I do n't look for a letdown . We 're where we are because of our pitching , and the boys know that . The hitters will still be trying to help more and they should . " <P> The Brooklyn Dodgers , the runaway leaders in the National League race , virtually settled the issue last week , once &; for all , by whipping the second-place New York Giants in three straight games , bounded off to a 12-game lead this week . <P> <P> *In 1948 , after Cleveland won the second pennant in its history , Feller lost two games to Boston , had to be taken out of one .
