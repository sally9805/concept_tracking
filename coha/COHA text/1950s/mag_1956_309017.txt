That expensive straw ballot , the presidential primary , last week added more wisps to the political winds : <P> In Massachusetts , House Majority Leader John McCormack got 28,500 write-in votes to 19,500 for Adlai Stevenson . Before the election , Estes Kefauver , who had not campaigned in the state , and had little visible support there , piously asked his " supporters " to vote for popular John McCormack , but Estes could certainly claim no share of the victory . On the Republican side , Dwight Eisenhower won 52,400 write-in votes and the support of all delegates . The biggest straw : John McCormack is more popular than Adlai Stevenson in Massachusetts , and Eisenhower is more popular than either . <P> In Pennsylvania , Adlai Stevenson , supported by all top Democratic leaders , and unopposed on the Democratic ballot , got 627,000 votes to 37,000 write-ins for Kefauver . On the Republican ballot , Ike got 925,000 votes to 43,000 for California 's Senator William Knowland . Ike outran Stevenson even in Philadelphia ( which went heavily Democratic in 1952 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In Alaska , with returns still coming in by bush plane from isolated districts , Stevenson led Kefauver by 5,900 to 3,700 and cinched Alaska 's six convention votes . Collecting more votes than either Democrat was Republican Eisenhower , even though his Administration was supposedly in bad odor because Ike had opposed immediate Alaskan statehood . The straw : In Alaska , at least , the Administration 's territorial and conservation policies are not nearly as unpopular as the Democrats have cracked them up to be .
