txt A report to Gov . Robert B. Meyner and Gov . Abraham A. Ribicoff said today that New York State should aim at taxing nonresidents only in proportion to the services it provided them . It also suggested that nonresidents be permitted to deduct from their New York income taxes the levies they paid on residential properties in their home states . If New York refuses to do this at present , the report continued , it should at least earmark 30 per cent of the nonresidents ' taxes for aid to distressed commuter rail lines . To Talk With Rockefeller Governor Meyner of New Jersey and Governor Ribicoff of ( Connecticut will meet with Governor Rockefeller of New York on Tuesday in an attempt to solve the controversy over the taxing of out-of-state residents who work in New York . The report was prepared by William C. Warren interstate tax consultant to Mr. Meyner , and Roswell F , Magill , who acts in a similar capacity for Mr. Ribicoff . It comprised a detailed analysis of the effect on nonresidents of New York State 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N. J. , is Dean of the Columbia University Law School . Mr. Magill , a tax lawyer , lives in Westport , Conn . The report argued that unless about $15,000,000 was cut annually from nonresident taxes there would be no equity among the states ' taxpayers . New York Plan Scored It assailed the Rockefeller administration 's plan for settling the thirty-year-old interstate tax dispute , characterizing the plan as " inherently defective and no solution to the problem . " It warned that the New York proposal , if adopted , might result in still " greater injustice and disparity " than under the ' present law . The Rockefeller administration 's proposal would permit nonresidents who worked in New York to take exemptions proportional to the share of their incomes earned in New York . If approved by the New York Legislature , it would become effective only when neighboring states authorized their employers to withhold taxes on employes who live in New York or to furnish Albany with data // RIBICOFF , MEYNER GIVEN TAX REPORT // Ion the earnings of such persons . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller on at least a partial solution . to the jeOntroV.eray . Their meeting Will be held at 11 A. M. Tuesday in Mr. Rockefeller 's office at 22 West Fifty-fifth Street in New York . Mr. Meyner and Mr. Ribicoff are known to have discussed the report by telephone and to have agreed to rely heavily on the advice of its authors , who will ! accompany them to the meeting ! on Tuesday . Mr. Warren and Mr. Magill argued that at least 56 per cent of New York State 's expenditures was legally denied to nonresidents . Thus , they reasoned , taxes on nonresidents should be less than half of those of the resident . They said that the 56 per cent represented allocations to public schools , health and mental hygiene and other public welfare activities in the 1957-,58 fiscal year 's budget . " Even a badly tarnished sense of equity , " they said , would seem to compel such a ' tax cut . The " pound of flesh " ' approach , " which is characteristic of the New York tax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an integral part of the metropolitan community , " they added . ' Biggest Bite ' Possible The report continued with its plea for aid to commuter lines and charged that Neuf York State 's interpretation of fair tax treatment in the past had been " to take the biggest bite it can get away with . " Its authors based their plea that nonresidents be allowed to deduct their property taxes from their New York levies on the ground that New Jersey and Connecticut derive income from real property that New York acquires through its income tax . The two men urged that-nonresidents be permitted to deduct some commutation expenses from this taxable income and that they be allowed to itemize their deductions in full to the same extent as residents . Today 's report said that the question of New Yorkers working in other states must be treated independently of the " problem at hand " and on its own merits . Mr. Warren and Mr. Magill , however , endorsed proposals offered Tuesday by the New Jersey Commission on Out-of-State Taxation for easing the dispute . Same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same tax deductions now afforded residents . In return for such a concession it suggested that New Jersey and other neighboring states permit employers to withhold New York State taxes from salaries paid to employes who resided in ' New York . The report to the two Governors , made public simultanelously here and in Hartford , argued that the nonresident most unfairly treated under the New York tax law was the person whose income was derived primarily from personal services performed in New York . Thus , it reasoned , any remedy should be tailored especially to provide equality for him . The tax study stressed that this category of taxpayer would be the only one among nonresidents subject to the levy to gain relief thorugh the latest New ' York proposal . The report expressed the hope Ithat Tuesday a meeting would let least identity the ultimate ' goal in affording fair and equitable treatment by New York on ( nonresident taxes . The report concluded by warning that a satisfactory solution to the interstate tax problem , probably could not be drawn without an intensive study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of New York land its neighboring states to achieve a truly just agreement .
