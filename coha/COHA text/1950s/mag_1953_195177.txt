HENRY FIELDING ( 1,183 pp. ) -F . Homes Dudden-Oxford ( $21 ) . <P> <P> One dreary day in June 1754 , a curious piece of goods was lugged to the dockside at Rotherhithe , on the Thames , to be stowed aboard the Queen of Portugal , bound for Lisbon . To the staring navvies it must have looked rather like the corpse of a drowned man , bloated and discolored . In fact , the man was alive , though drowning inwardly of dropsy and so weak that he could scarcely move a finger . There was nothing for it but to strap him in an armchair and hoist him over the side like any common lading . As the winch turned and the invalid rose lurching , the sailors and dockmen burst into jeering laughter at the pitiful figure . <P> Thus did England , in a careless age , make a farewell to her first great novelist - whom she considered at best a hack writer and at worst a national disgrace . <P> Some of the discerning disagreed , and half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for England 's incomprehension of Henry Fielding-they have stayed awake a million and one nights reading his ribald masterpiece , Tom Jones . <P> Some of the mud slung at Fielding in his lifetime has stuck through the centuries , but the last of it is scraped away in Henry Fielding , by Frederick Homes Dudden , master of Oxford 's Pembroke College , a biography which must now become the standard work on Fielding . As a biographer , Master Dudden is as dull and honest as an old pewter pot ; but he brims nevertheless with the sloshing ale of Fielding 's vitality , and time &; again the rollicking old genius seems to seize the pot in his pudgy fist , slam the table , and roar out his irrepressible toast to life , and again life . <P> The Manners of Comedy . Fielding came of the cadet line in the family of the Fielding Earls of Denbigh . His father was a roistering colonel who so mismanaged his estate that he could not even supply his children with fit beer , and young Henry , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several days together . " <P> At 17 , Henry lit his candle at both ends and rushed off to singe the fashionable moths in London and Salisbury . He was a big , ruddy-faced fellow , standing over six feet , with a chest like a barrel and a profile like something in a Punch &; Judy show . His eyes , however , were " dark , and as full of sweetness as of fire , " and his wit and intellect were already honed to a cutting edge . In London 's beau monde of 1727 , the petticoats rustled and the epigrams bristled where young Henry passed ; he appeared to like the sound of petticoats best . <P> At 20 , however , Henry was getting weary of the swim , and he tried to trouble the fashionable waters with his first play , Love in Several Masques , a deft little comedy of London manners . An excerpt from the conversation of a Fielding fop : <P> " Reading , sir , is the worst thing in the world for the eyes ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few months gone through almost a dozen pages . . . But I found it vastly impaired the lustre of my eyes . I had , sir , in that short time , perfectly lost the direct ogle. "
