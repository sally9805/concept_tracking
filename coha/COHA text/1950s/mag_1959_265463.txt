The greatest Hellenistic literary discovery since the Renaissance , crows Horizon about an exclusive story in its July issue . Readers with a classical bent or those who merely like a yarn about the farmer 's daughter are unlikely to argue . The story is the first English translation in poetry of The Curmudgeon ( Greek : ? s ? ? ? ? ? ) , written in 316 B.C. by the Greek Playwright Menander , whose 100-odd comedies were outranked in the ancient world only by those of Aristophanes . Out of Egypt . Even more intriguing . The Curmudgeon is the first complete play by Menander discovered by the modem world . Two years ago the only known copy , scrawled on papyrus possibly by a schoolmaster in the 3rd century A.D. , turned up mysteriously in the hands of a Greek antique dealer in Cairo . The finder : Martin Bodmer , a millionaire Swiss banker and bibliophile , who whisked it off to his lavish private library in Geneva . <P> There the play-1,000 lines without punctuation or word spacing-was painstakingly translated into French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( circa 342-291 B.C. ) during the decline of Athens , an era dominated by the Macedonian occupation . His audiences were no longer intellectually vibrant Greeks ; they had an appetite for pulp stories that might have made them content watching a TV western . " Stay at home . " one of his characters says . " A man is free nowhere else . " Menander gave the Greeks sharply etched , lifelike stories , tenderly observed and hilariously written . <P> He was the poet who wrote : " Think like a free man and you will not be a slave . " and " All that defiles a man comes from within . " To St. Paul , he was the only pagan dramatist worthy of quoting : " Evil communications corrupt good manners . " <P> Down the Well . Written when he was 25 . , The Curmudgeon is minor compared to the later shrewd comedies that inspired ( by way of plagiarisms by Plautus ) European playwrights from Racine to Giraudoux . <P> The play is still pretty funny-the tale of a misogynist farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad in love with his daughter . ( Solution : the farmer falls down his well , is rescued with the help of the swain , grudgingly hands over his daughter . ) Funniest part is the traffic of devout Athenians to the temple of Pan near the farmer 's shack ; their animal " sacrifices " always turn out to be raucous sheep barbecues with only the bones left for Pan . Horizon 's translator ( and chief editorial adviser ) is Glasgow-born Gilbert Highet , the lively author ( The Art of Teaching ) and classicist who teaches Greek and Latin at Columbia University . It took him a week to translate the play 's six-beat Greek iambics into six-beat English iambics . <P> His version is slangy , a bit hammy in spots , and not likely to strain the minds of readers . Highet hopes that it would have pleased Menander , " who loved people , like Shakespeare and Moliere. and so transformed Greek comedy from its original fantasy into reality .
