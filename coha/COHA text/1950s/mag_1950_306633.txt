In Mexico City 's bustling Barrio Santa Maria , a huge crowd gathered , staring intently up into the sky . Dario Moctezuma joined the skygazers , but complained that he could see nothing . An obliging stranger threw an arm around his shoulder , pointed up-and sure enough , Dario thought he discerned a white globelike shape floating by . When his gaze returned earthward , he saw the stranger disappearing around the corner . Dario slapped the pocket where his wallet had been and began to yell : " Policia , policia ! " <P> All over Mexico last week , pickpockets , adding a hyper-modern wrinkle to their ancient profession , did a booming trade among crowds gathered to scan the skies for plativolos ( flying saucers ) . For the saucer-hysteria that still flickers occasionally in the U.S. was sweeping Mexico . <P> From Yucatan came news that a large aluminum disc had been seen whizzing by at an altitude of a thousand feet . The most magnificent dispatch came from the northern state of Zacatecas : a farmer had found a large kite-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under two feet tall . The Department of National Defense solemnly denied the existence of the midget visitors . <P> Others beside pickpockets made hay while the plativolos shone . Two employees of the Department of Communications and Public Works were fired for peddling fake photographs of discs to newspapers . A chiropractor advertised : " Stiff neck from looking at the saucers ? Come and see me for a massage . "
