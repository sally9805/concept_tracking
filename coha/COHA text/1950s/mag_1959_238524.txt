It is standard operating procedure in Southeast Asia for a nation to win independence , fall into economic and political chaos and , finally , take desperate refuge in military rule that is usually efficient and honest but still dictatorship . Last week , after two years of freedom , the Federation of Malaya was proving a happy democratic exception to the rule . In the independent nation 's first general election , contending parties wooed the voters with posters , sound trucks , leaflets dropped from planes . <P> The leader of the heavily favored Alliance Party , Tengku ( Prince ) Abdul Rahman , 56 , quit his job as Prime Minister four months ago to barnstorm throughout all eleven states of the federation by motorboat and car . Cambridge-educated and a descendant of ancient Mongol conquerors of Malaya , he plumped for more education and economic development , said , " I was truly astounded by the ignorance in some places . " Before upcountry pagodas and in front of east coast mosques , he greeted crowds by crying Merdeka ( freedom ) and arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of race , religion and class rather than about our similarities , " appealed to citizens of Malay , Chinese and Indian stock " to sink our differences and speak about what is good for the country as a whole . " His political rivals had narrower aims . The Pan-Malayan Islamic Party dreams of bringing Malaya into a " Greater Indonesia . " Two small leftist parties formed a Socialist front and advocated the expropriation of all foreign holdings in the nation . <P> Abdul Rahman 's campaigning was aided by Malaya 's flourishing economy . The federation produces almost a third of the world 's natural rubber and tin ; its per capita income ( $350 ) is the highest in Asia , and it boasts one telephone for every 100 persons ( U.S. ratio : one for every 2 ) . With the ten-year-old Communist insurrection spluttering into oblivion in the northern jungles and with the nation 's rice crop the largest in its history , voters swarmed to the polls last week on foot , and by car , boat , pedicab and elephant . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance Party captured 73 seats in Parliament , nearly three-fourths of all those contested .
