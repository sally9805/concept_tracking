In the coming year the Federal spending for labor and welfare  --  not including , of course , the social security funds  --  will be $3.6 billion . For public housing and aids to commerce there is $1.6 billion ; more , if Congress fails , as it did last year , to raise the postal rates . For the T.V.A. , reclamation and other items under natural resources , $1.6 billion . Total : $6.8 lglllion . It 's ridiculous to say that this budget can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety requires , if only we reach for them with a resolute hand .
