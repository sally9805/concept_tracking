Last week , Poet Sergei Mikhalkov ( coauthor of the Soviet national anthem ) lyrically followed up Stalin 's announcement of an atom bomb explosion by writing a new soldiers ' marching song : <P> <P> We 've just made a trial of our strength , From our hearts-wonderful , successful ! There , where necessary , it exploded ! We are satisfied with the result-The Soviet atom is not so bad ! <P> As soon as the foreign press heard , It raised a worldwide hullabaloo : " Our secret deciphered ! The Russians Also have now what only we had ! How did Russia dare ? How did Truman and Attlee slip up on this ? " <P> <P> ( Chorus ) <P> That 's the thing ! Science for all ! Just try to stick your nose in ! Ha , ha , <P> ha ! <P> They were n't lazy , they worked hard For their people !
