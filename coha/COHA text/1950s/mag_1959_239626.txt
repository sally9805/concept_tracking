From the day he took office , Pope John XXIII made clear that he was not going to change the warm , outgoing nature that had made him a beloved Patriarch of Venice . Last week one more story was added to the lore of the man who is already one of the best-loved Popes of modern times . He has given away his breviary-and to an Anglican . The recipient : Canon Donald Rea. vicar of the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Eye , Suffolk , and chairman of the Anglican Confraternity of Unity , founded in 1926 " to restore communion with the Holy See . " <P> Writing in the latest issue of the confraternity 's journal . Reunion , Anglican Rea said that during a private audience last June the Pope noticed that the Anglican was carrying a breviary-a compilation of daily prayers and psalms in Latin that are obligatory for Roman Catholic priests . " That book of his looks a bit old , " said John to his interpreter . " Mine is not so new . but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <P> Next day the four volumes of the Pope 's breviary arrived , with the markers where the Pope had finished his office on the feast of the Sacred Heart , and containing John 's family memorial cards , including one for his father . On the cover of the black volumes were the arms of the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice : the breviary was bought in 1956 . <P> Canon Rea also quoted Pope John on the delicate subject of church unity . " In working for reunion , " he said , " it is necessary1 ) to be very meek and humble , 2 ) to be patient and know how to wait God 's hour , and 3 ) to insist on positive arguments , leaving aside for the moment those elements on which we differ , and to avoid discussions that may offend against the virtue of charity .
