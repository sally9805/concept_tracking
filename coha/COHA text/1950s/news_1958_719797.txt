txt WASHINGTON , June 14 ? Predictions are being made widely in Congress on this Flag Day that the flag business might be the first to pull out of the recession . Phis might come about , it is said , by the making of new flags with a forty-ninth star.to represent the new State of Alaska . Alaska 's bid for statehood , first made forty-two years ago , was approved by the House of Representatives on May 28 by a vote of 208-166 . A Senate showdown has been scheduled for next week . Prospects . of winning statehood in the Senate have changed in the last two weeks from " poor " to - " good , " and in some spots they are called " excellent . " Alaska  --  and Hawaii , too ? appeared to have won their fights for statehood ? ? several times in the last decade . Every time , however , they were frustrated . At present , Alaska seems to stand a better chance than Hawaii , despite strong forces in Congress working for both . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conceded generally , would again black out the hopes of both . The Senate has previously voted for both territories to enter the Union together . The House would not agree and still not , it is evident . Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , the Democratic leader , announced in the Senate today that the Alaska bill was one of five important bills that would be called up for action soon . Among factors involved in the statehood issue is the fact that Alaska is ' regarded as a Democratic territory . Thus its cause attracts strong support from Northern Democrats but strong opposition from the South . Many of the Southerners in Congress think that the presence of two ' Senators front Alaska would diminish the South 's influence in the upper house . On the other hand , Hawaii is considered to be generally // Republican . But its population , of varied races , is not acceptable to the South . Hence , it is believed in the Senate that Alaska 's bright prospects at the moment would be dissipated if the Senate should agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thinking of outstanding Republican leaders , who want to see Hawaii admitted : If a twin measure emerged from the Senate , it would wind up in a parliamentary snarl that would put the Alaska measure back into the hands of the enemies who have delayed action on it for nearly a year . Supporters are trying to avoid any amendments that would send the bill back to the House , or to conference because that could lead to further delaying tactics . Against this background reports coming from the Senate indicate there are now fifty votes available for Alaskan statehood . Some counts bring the number up to fifty-eight . A majority is forty-nine . Any attempt made to link Alaska with Hawaii can be voted down , the reports also suggested . It is further indicated that the threat of a Southern filibuster  --  the use of unlimited debate to delay or prevent action on a bill  --  has subsided materially . If a filibuster developed it probably would not be " a Solid South " one . There may be attempts to propose " riders " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed to curb the appellate powers of the Supreme Court . Such moves , it is believed widely , would be defeated . The Senate might consume some days and nights in reaching a final decision . However , even enemies of Alaskan statehood predict off-stage that it has " a better-than-even " chance of passing .
