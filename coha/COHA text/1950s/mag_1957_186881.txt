In Aspen , Colo. last week a group of hardheaded U.S. executives stayed up until the small hours of the morning arguing vigorously about the nature of angels . By day they pored over the works of Aristotle , Thoreau , John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx . Inside a hexagonal building , in the midst of an alfalfa field 7,900 ft. above sea level , they met twice daily to discuss such topics as the nature of happiness , the relative merits of justice and charity , the contrasts between democracy and aristocracy . <P> The executives were workers in an experiment designed to bridge the gap between the practical world of U.S. business and the world of philosophical ideas . " Whether it 's so or not , " says Montgomery Ward 's President John Barr , " every executive thinks that he does not do enough thinking . " To give U.S. executives a chance to think and talk in a relaxed atmosphere . Container Corp . of America Chairman Walter Paepcke , 61 , in 1950 set up the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminars , a new health center , and a spate of lectures , forums and other cultural activities . " The Aspen idea , " says Paepcke , " is the cross-fertilization of men 's minds . " <P> " Here to Exercise . " Last week 's executives were the vanguard of five groups from every phase of industry-most of them lower-echelon men on the way up-who will spend two weeks each this summer at the institute , a cluster of modernistic buildings perched high in the Rockies just over the continental divide from Denver . Cost : $600 for two weeks , which is usually paid by the executive 's firm . ( Wives may come along for $250 extra . ) As soon as the executive signs up , he gets a copy of all reading material for two weeks , with a strong hint that he get to work on it at once . As last week 's group arrived at Aspen , they were greeted by Philosopher Mortimer Adler ( TIME , March 17 , 1952 ) , who moderates executive seminars with Corporation Lawyer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to exercise-in the seminar building as well as in the health center . " <P> Neither phase is neglected at Aspen . During a day that begins at 7 a.m. , Aspen 's executives go through several workouts in the health center , two or three hours of heavy reading , daily seminars , in which they trade ideas with fellow executives and moderators , and a round of lectures , concerts and other cultural activities . The round-table discussions may start as one did last week , high in the abstractions of Aristotelian logic , and plunge hotly down into a labor-management debate on productivity . Executives are encouraged to express their views vigorously , apply the ideas culled from their readings to the present world of business and politics . Discussions often run over into the exercise room or into the sauna ( Finnish bath ) , where Philosopher Adler last week led a lively argument on justice and charity in 175 heat . Only occasionally do discussions get hotter : one chairman of a large corporation threatened to pull his money out of a bank represented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discussion of the profit motive .
