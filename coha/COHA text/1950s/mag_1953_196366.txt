During its investigation of British newspapers five years ago , the Royal Commission on Press Freedom pointedly asked Tory Press Lord Beaverbrook whether anyone in Britain could start a newspaper that would compete with him . " There is a young fellow called William J. Brittain , " replied Beaverbrook , " who is showing great promise . " <P> Brittain had shown the promise right in Beaverbrook 's own backyard . At 25 , after making a name as a reporter and editor , he became assistant editor of Beaver-brook 's Sunday Express , three years later was named editor of Lord Rothermere 's Sunday Dispatch . In 1934 Brittain started out on his own . borrowed $1,600 to buy a weekly , Recorder , which had a circulation of only 700 . He built it into a moneymaker , boosted its circulation to 22,500 and put together a chain of eleven other weeklies and trade papers . <P> Last week Brittain made part of Beaverbrook 's prediction come true . He converted the weekly Recorder into a daily , the first new British daily since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new paper , Brittain has a staff of 70 , and to finance his venture , he has close to half a million dollars from a stock issue and notes . ( Fleet Streeters gossiped that Beaverbrook himself had invested in the paper , but both the Beaver 's office and Brittain denied it . ) Editor Brittain hopes to find a " new public " of 500,000 readers who are " the product of our largely extended universities and are repelled by the vulgarity which admittedly appeals to millions ' ' of readers of other British dailies . <P> In its first issues , the Recorder avoided vulgarity . But in its place it offered little that was exciting in news coverage or in editorial opinion . The Recorder shares the Beaver 's enthusiasm for the ability of the empire " to go it alone , " Tory politics and " individual initiative " to solve Britain 's economic problems . So far , it is long on background stories , profiles and quiet features , put together in a trim eight-column , ten-page paper . But to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same journalistic flair that has made the Beaver 's papers among the most successful and widely read in Britain .
