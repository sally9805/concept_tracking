In Thailand every cloud , even one so dark as the ill-omened Year of the Goat , has a silver-and sometimes a gold-lining . Just as the astronomers had predicted , the Year of the Goat was bad . Day after day it plunged Thailand into gloom with the revelation of one misfortune after another : two solar eclipses in one year , a holiday bus crash in which 22 people died , the deaths of a number of prominent Thais . Only last week , on the very eve of the goat 's departure , a live bomb accidentally fell from an air force plane and killed 27 Thais . <P> All this made frolicksome old Kamthorn Visuthiphol stop and think . Merchant , banker and millionaire many times over , Kamthorn was rich in more ways than one . He had six wives , 25 children and , as an extra bonus from nature , eleven fingers . But , what with the astrologers and all , even Kamthorn could never be quite confident , so that it was in the Year of the Goat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abbot Phra Viradhammuni of the Trai Mitra monastery , begged him for the thousandth time to help build a temple . <P> Trai Mitra was a poor parish , its only material blessing a nondescript Buddha which stood under an old tin shed , and for years the abbot had been trying in vain to get old Kamthorn to do something about it . The Year of the Goat turned the trick . Kamthorn donated $35,000 . A new temple was built , and workmen set about moving the statue into its new home . But the goat was still at work , and in the midst of the heavy task the workmen 's cable broke , and the Buddha crashed to the ground , badly cracked . To the priests ' surprise , the plaster was only a shell ; beneath it shone the glint of metal . Trai Mitra 's old plaster Buddha was a mere mummy case concealing a beautiful sculptured image wrought of 60% gold . Though to the pious Buddhist one divine image is as valuable as another , regardless of intrinsic worth , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trai Mitra 's prize at close to $3,000,000 . <P> By last week donations and sightseers alike were pouring into the newly wealthy temple . But in his diabolical way the goat was still busy . In forgotten temples all over the land , to the consternation of the devout , Buddhists were hacking away hopefully and irreverently at any plaster Buddhas they could find .
