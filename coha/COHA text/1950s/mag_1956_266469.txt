THE UNICORN AND OTHER POEMS ( 86 pp. ) - Anne Morrow Lindbergh- Panfheon ( $2.75 ) . <P> " And when I can not write a poem , I bake biscuits and feel just as pleased , " wrote Anne Morrow Lindbergh lightly in her bestselling Gift from the Sea ( TIME , Mar. 21 , 1955 ) . But writing poetry has been a serious concern of Mrs. Lindbergh 's since her girlhood . " When I was young , I felt so small/And frightened , for the world was tall , " ran one of her early verses . The poems of her 303 and 403 , collected here for the first time , show that , as she grew out of those girlish fears , she also grew to be courageously at home in the world . Her courage is often colored with resignation , she is still looking for answers and praying for strength , but these poems are , on the whole , triumphant celebrations of life , love , death and , through them all , the " beauty of earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring an ache to the throat , remembered beauty to the eye , music to the ear , a fresh tack to familiar musings . Some do less . Mothers of five children are rarely the stuff of which great poets are made , as Mrs. Lindbergh herself has pointed out . Her prose is often markedly poetic ; at times her poems are prosaic . But if artistry and eloquence occasionally flag , sensibility never does . At their best , her lines flash with beauty and brightness , and like <P> A sail , spark-white upon the space of sea , Can pin a whole horizon into place .
