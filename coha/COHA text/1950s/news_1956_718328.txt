txt Letters to The Times ELIZABETH SEEGER.GEORGE MACOVESCU , EDITH R. WEST.FELIX FRANKFURTER.T.S . MATTHE ... Letters to The Times Power of the U. N , , Is Said to Have Demonstrate &; Its Potentialities to End War To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIMER : I am very much disappointed and disturbed by the attitude of The New York Times , and particularly of its editorials regarding the recent momentous events . Your editorial of Nov ; 9 " The Suez Balance Sheet " is especially alarming . Here we have for the first time in history a war in which major powers are already engaged , a war which might develop into world conflict , stopped , on the part of all the combatants , by order of the United Nations , an order voiced almost unanimously by the assembled nations of the world . Here we have for the first time in history ( for this is a very different situation from that of the Korean war ) a United Nations police force , voted again by the assembled nations of the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the present stage of history , could one hope for ? While one holds one 's breath until that police force actually lands in the area of conflict , until the cease-fire becomes a peace of some sort , it may well be that in this week we have seen the greatest step toward world peace ever taken , the turning point between international anarchy and world order . And what has your great paper to say about all this ? That the United Nations has been " flouted , " not that it has been obeyed ; that " it will take long to live down the initial blow to the United Nations , " when the U. N. has surely never been so strong ; that " the Western ranks must be closed again " in the old system of alliances which have continuously , dismally and inevitably led to bigger and bigger wars  --  not that we must , in every possible way strengthen the power , prestige and authority of the United Nations in its , so far , successful effort to stop a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced ? The great nations of the world have not been very eager to create an international force to preserve peace ; it has taken the threat of immediate war to make them realize its necessity . It seems to me that to anyone who has listened , as so many of us have done , to the debates and meetings ri the past week , that the United Nations has demonstrated its grandeur , its indispensability , its potentialities to all who hope to end the suicidal stupidity of war . But we are the United Nations ; all of humanity is the United Nations . It can act only with our support , our faith and our active participation . Must The New York Times be so lukewarm , so discouraging and so fearful ? ELIZABETH SEEGER . New York , Nov. 9 , 1956 . Observing Our Elections To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES In leaving the United States , the Rumanian delegates who were invited by the American Government to observe the elections of Nov. 6 wish to express their gratitude and thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were given during their eighteen days ' visit to your great country . In accordance with the schedule set up by the Department of State we visited New York City and Washington , D. C. , as well as localities in the States of California , Washington , Minnesota and Ohio ; we attended electoral meetings , we watched polls and talked to Republican and Democratic representatives . Consequently , we gathered a general idea of what the American electoral system means and realized that it is different not only from our own . electoral system , which reflects another period of historic development , but even from the classical electoral system of the capitalistic European countries . However , we stand firm/3 , and consistently for the inalienable right of each people to choose its own way of life  --  and against interference in the domestic affairs of states . It is up to the American people to decide on their political and electoral system , and other nations and Governments all over the world must respect their decision . It goes without saying that this concept is valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the Rumanian delegation and , we want to state that we shall be strictly guided by this principle when we present our conclusions to the public opinion of Rumania . By the same token we wish to stress that the opportunity we had to meet Americans , to meet the American people during our visit , was of the utmost importance to us . We are glad to note that the main aim of the American people is peace , the consolidation of peace based on mutual understanding , on coexistence between the different systems . We consider this to be the principal conclusion which can be drawn from the poll of Nov. 6 . GEORGE MACOVESCU , Director of Film Production . O.

Low-Slung Cars Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES !

EDITH Er Philadelphia , Nov. 1 , 1958 . Judge Oppenheimer His Election to Supreme Bench ' el Baltimore Is Hailed To Tat EDITOR or THE New YORK Trurls , Precisely because a member of thi Supreme Court should keep moo , pulously aloof from politics , it teil : comes not inappropriate to call at ? ' tention to an event bearing on the ; independence of the judiciary whic.11 ; was ? submerged in the more spacie demanding accounts of electioni results even in what maybe deemed ; our one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reuben Oppenheimer to the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City . The following circumstances make his selection noteworthy far beyond , the confines of Baltimore and Mary- , land . A leading member of the Maryland bar , Mr. Oppenheimer was persuaded by Governor din to fill a short-term vacancy ' As is indicated by its name , the . Supreme Bench is not the highest court in Maryland but , in a liters. / sense , as the chief criminal court it touches men 's lives perhaps more . closely than the highest court . Judge Oppenheimer refused . t ? , iiiake any campaign speeches , to make any contributions or to do , anything except to say that if the people wanted him he would serve. ; To emphasize this , immediately , after the primary he took off fog Europe and stayed there for two ' months . The people vindicated this appropriately austere attitude in ' an emphatic way . Let me quote The Baltimore Suns " The voters have shown special discrimination in electing Judge Reuben Oppenheimer to a full fifteen-year term . And by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the candidates . A legal scholar of national standing , a man . of judicial poise and fastidious pro . fessional sensibility , Judge Oppenheimer has graced the Supreme ' Bench and will continue to do so . " Comforting as is this particular outcome , there is no reason to believe that the people of Maryland are better equipped than their fellow-citizens to appreciate the in. , dispensable need in a democracy of a completely disinterested judiciary . " It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free , inie partial and independent as the lat , % of humanity will admit . " This bie , not less true today than it was in 1780 , when John Adams wrote these. : words into the Massachusetts Constitution . FELIX FRANKFURTER . , Washington , Nov. 12 , 1956 . Stevenson as Secretary of State TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW ' YORK Tams : , President Eisenhower ha . alwayl held himself above party politics " The vote of Nov. 6 proves that the majority of the American people , prefer Dwight Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre Or the Republican party . President Eisenhower starts his second term with a Democratic majority in both houses , and a threatening world situation ; the world situation cies* : will not improve by itself . In the eyes of the world there are two great Americans , President . Eisenhower and Adlai StevensOn. , The affectionate respect of classes of foreigners for Mr. Stevenson can not be exaggerated . Would it not be an act of true statesmanship , the act of a leader of all that people , for President Eisenhower ta show the world that America IS : s united nation , and pass over party , politics in appointing a new Sect** Lary of ' State ? Would not America be stronger and the world more fortunate : it President Eisenhower and Adler Stevenson , as Secretary of State , could work together in the service of the nation and of mankind ? T.
