The Day the Money Stopped ( by Maxwell Anderson and Brendan Gill ; based on the Gill novel ) deals with a classic stage theme : a fight over a will . It uses classic combatants : the disinherited black sheep and his self-righteous brother . As the glib playboy with a rusting charm ( Richard Basehart ) and the sententious prig with a rankling virtue ( Kevin McCarthy ) trade slurs-while their sister ( Mildred Natwick ) waves an olive branch - they lay siege to the holdings in the family vault via the skeletons in the family closet . Out , eventually , clatter illegitimacies and suicides and a crushed father image . And the disinherited playboy , at the end , has wangled twenty grand , only to spurn it . <P> The play uses a classic stage form , the brittle conversation piece . In terms of smart brushes and insulting banter , this has its good points ; but seldom were a classic action and a classic method so mismated . ' Stage struggles over a will make for melodrama or serious drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers or skinny claws-but not for the playfully brandished rapier . Fencing verbally , the brothers sometimes neatly pink each other , even achieve an occasional moral louche . But they use buttoned foils on synthetic flesh . Nor , in place of human drama , is there any real psychological probing or moral insight . The wastrel 's behavior , at the end , for example , has no ironic force and is wholly out of character - words are his forte , not gestures .
