On offense , Maryland is very deliberate , North Carolina State prefers the fast break and North Carolina alternates between running and ball control . On defense , Maryland is strictly man-to-man , State prefers the zone , while , again , Carolina alternates and very often employs the press . At NORTH CAROLINA STATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starters , led by strong rebounder John Richter and Lou Pucillo , one of the smallest men ( 5 feet 9 ) in college ball and one of the best . Pucillo is a clever dribbler and passer and has every shot in the book . With these two are Don Gallagher , Bob MacGillivray and Don Englehardt and veteran reserves George Stepanovich and Ken Clark . Three promising sophomores , Stan Niewierowski , Mark Reiner and Bruce Hoadley , may break into the starting lineup later in the season . This is a fast , seasoned squad , assured of national ranking . The loss of three good starters at MARYLAND is hardly as serious a blow as it sounds . The returning veterans are fast and strong , shoot well and handle the ball with finesse . Coach Bud Millikan has taught his charges well . They are Charles McNeil , Al Bunge , Gene Danko , Jerry Bechtle , Bill Murphy , Pete Krukar , Doc Weingarten , Jerry Shanahan and Jim Halleck . And there is still more sound talent in sophomores Bob McDonald , Bob Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S fine squad there is only one senior , a non-starter , so affable Coach Frank McGuire can look forward to a sparkling season next year . Not that this one will be dreary ; on the contrary , though the roster of top-grade talent is slim , it is comprised of good speed and shooting and better-than-average size . Two smooth guards are veteran Harvey Salz and sophomore York Larese . Up front are Dick Kepley , Danny Lotz , Lee Shaffer , Ray Stanley , Doug Moe and Hugh Donohue . Backcourt reserves include John Crotty and Lou Brown . All of Coach Bill McCann 's regulars are back at VIRGINIA , plus excellent reserves and at least one top-grade sophomore , Jay McKenzie . This would assure an improved record if the other teams in this conference were n't so tough . The tall , strong starters are Herb Busch , Bill Metzger , John Siewers , Paul Adkins and John Haner . Coach McCann , now in his second year , is also better prepared for the competition he faces . WAKE FOREST 'S Coach Bones McKinney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with five returning regulars , and 6-foot-8 sophomore Jerry Steele moving in at center . The veterans are high-scoring Dave Budd , Olin Broadway , Charlie Forte , George Ritchie and Twig Wiggins , plus reserves Bill Greene and Dick Odom . Transfer student Bill Cullen and sophomore Alley Hart add backcourt strength . This adds up to good speed and shooting and at least adequate size , and Bones will get the most out of it . DUKE 'S fine team of a year ago was stripped of all starters and two top reserves by graduation , but the current crew , dominated by sophomores , has every asset but experience . It is a deeper squad , taller and possibly faster . The newcomers , on whom Coach Hal Bradley counts so heavily , include Doug Kistler , Fred Kast , Howard Hurt , Jay Beal , John Frye and Carroll Youngkin . Five veteran reserves are Gerry Robertson , Larry Bateman , George Barrett , Bill Watson and Marty Joyce . Much depends on how quickly the green players acquire the poise to go with their talent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past two years at CLEMSON , and the current squad does not appear able to solve it either . Otherwise , it is a sound team , featuring very good shooting and steadily improving ability on defense . George Krajack , Doug Hoffman and Walt Gibbons are strong veteran regulars up front , and the rest of the starters will come from among reserves Dutch Shample and Bill Warren , the two likeliest , and Jim Lewis , Don Carver and Frank Clarke , SOUTH CAROLINA 'S rather dim prospects were hardly brightened when veteran Guard Dick Prater injured his ankle ; he will be out of action for at least another month . The most serious weakness here is the lack of scoring punch and a close second is the lack of speed . Experience and size are abundantly present , however , in the persons of Mike Callahan , Walt Hudson and Ray Pericola , all veteran regulars , and reserves Larry Dial , Bob Frantz , Fred Lentz and Fred Luigs . Four sophomores , Bury Hudson , Ron Johnson , Dan Morgan and Everette Newman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student Mel Quick , who is expected to improve the back-court situation .
