Canada 's funny-money Social Credit Party , which was elected in the province of Alberta in the hungry ' 30s on a promise to pay " dividends " to all citizens , got ready at last to hand out the cash . Premier Ernest Manning 's government last week set aside $11 million , about one-third of the revenue it will receive this year from the province 's oil and gas boom , for direct distribution to the people of Alberta . Shares this year will amount to about $22 for every adult Canadian citizen with five years ' continuous residence in the province . With oil and gas revenues growing steadily , they should be even larger in years to come . <P> Social Crediters freely admitted that the oil bonus is not the citizens ' " dividend " promised when their party came to power 22 years ago . That scheme was to be part of a major overhaul of federal monetary policies , and is beyond the power of a provincial government . The payments now planned will help to drain off cash from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $90 million , financed large-scale grants to local schools and municipalities , and has built up a $347 million surplus . Some of the bonus money will also go to enrich the federal government , since tax authorities in Ottawa were prompt to rule that Alberta citizens will have to declare and pay federal income taxes on the money from Edmonton . <P> The bonus scheme brought a protest from some of the people eligible to collect it . The Senior Citizens ' Club of Medicine Hat adopted a resolution declaring that the money could better go to widows , the handicapped and pensioners . Art Smith , Conservative member of the provincial legislature , declared : " So long as the infirm suffer financially , so long as there are over-burdened municipalities , so long as there is need for roads and education , there is no justification for the dividends . " The antiadministration Calgary Herald indignantly advised its readers to " treat the bonus with contempt , " and the Edmonton Journal denounced the plan as " a great hoax . " Largely unheard from : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happily spend the dividends . <P> The Social Crediters were clearly aiming to extend the party 's power . In neighboring British Columbia , where Canada 's second Social Credit government was re-elected with a crashing majority last year . Premier William Bennett moved ahead with his own giveaway . With no flood of oil revenue to draw upon , he had to content himself with a more modest scheme : rebating $28 of taxes to every homeowner in his province . Both British Columbia 's Bennett and Alberta 's Manning , having built solid political bases at home , are now planning a drive to add to the 15 seats that Social Crediters occupy in the federal Parliament at Ottawa . With a national election probable for this spring or summer , they will soon have a chance to test the appeal of giveaway government for the voters in other parts of Canada .
