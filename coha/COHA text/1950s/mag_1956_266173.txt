In World War II Soviet fighter pilots boasted of a maneuver called taran , i.e. , ramming an enemy plane when ammunition was exhausted and parachuting out . In the absence of reliable witnesses of such tactics , Western air-force men were apt to suspect the Russians of " shooting a line . " Last week a startled group of Westerners saw a Soviet pilot perform the taran and live to lie about it . <P> Inhabitants of the Austrian village of Pamhagen on the Hungarian border were just finishing lunch when four MIG jets came screaming across into Austria from Hungary . The two planes in front , bearing Hungarian air-force markings , were being pursued and fired upon by the two planes in the rear , bearing Russian markings . Suddenly one of the Hungarian planes banked to turn , and the leading Russian plane collided with it . The Hungarian plane crashed and exploded with the pilot at the controls . The Russian plane also crashed , but its pilot came floating down to earth by parachute . Picked up by Austrian police , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran of the Soviet air force . Calmly and confidently he told his story : he had been ordered to intercept two unidentified planes flying over Hungarian territory . The collision was an accident . <P> <P> Captain Konoklov 's story did not stand up to the evidence of the crashed planes , and scores of eyewitnesses who had seen the Russian seemingly maneuver his plane into the Hungarian and , seconds before the crash , hit the air in his ejection seat . Taxed with this evidence , Konoklov admitted , just before stepping back into Hungary , that he and his wing man had been chasing two escaping Hungarian pilots and , failing to shoot one down , had rammed it . The second Hungarian plane apparently got away , but where it landed ( whether in West Germany or Yugoslavia ) was one of the week 's best-kept secrets . <P> <P> For Austrians the incident dramatized the length to which their Chancellor Raab will go in see-no-evil neutrality . Why , asked Vienna 's Bild-Telegraf , should a Russian who has violated Austrian terri tory , fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapee , be surrendered with such promptness and readiness ? Chancellor Raab had no good answer .
