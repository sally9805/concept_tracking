The Civil War , though it shattered Timrod 's health , called forth his most memorable verses and assured him a narrow niche in immortality as the spokesman of a promising culture , prematurely destroyed . " Ethnogenesis " and " The Cotton Boll " portray in miniature the whole splendor of the Southern dream ? the dream of a cotton empire , freed from Northern trammels , continental in its breadth , flourishing in the midst of an opulent yet lenient nature , and crowned with a chivalrous people . The new nation of Timrod 's picture is to be strong in the possession of a navy furnished by her mountain forests ; nevertheless , her chief mission is not to be one of battle .

To the last , Timrod was faithful to this grandiose dream of the South as a beneficent world power . Though his hopes for victory were shattered , he nevertheless made it his task to commemorate in the " Ode " sung at Magnolia Cemetery ( 1866 ) , the fallen soldiers of the Confederacy : Sleep sweetly in your humble graves , Sleep , martyrs of a fallen cause ; Though yet no marble column craves The pilgrim here to pause .

Alongside the planter aristocracy there existed , as we have seen , a rugged hinterland population , quite different from their lowland cousins , and never perfectly assimilated into the plantation system . They were indeed more Western than Southern ; their society was that of a hardy , semi-pioneer people , thoroughly democratic , and often crude and boisterous . They formed , on the whole , a hard-working yeomanry , though on the lower fringes of their society there were always groups of perpetually shiftless " poor whites " ? grotesque clay eaters , crackers , and hillbillies .

Presbyterian and Methodist and Baptist ? was especially strong , so that portions of the inland South , as they were subdued to piety , came to be a kind of subtropical New England , as Puritan in spirit as New England itself . But on the whole , civilization , Puritan or otherwise , lagged behind settlement ; and the backcountry people lived ordinarily under primitive conditions . They dwelt in log houses , had their water from springs , dressed mostly in homespun , danced lustily on old-fashioned puncheon floors , chewed tobacco , dipped snuff , and drank hard liquor by the quart . They fought on slight provocation , with any weapons from bare fists to shotguns . They enjoyed horse swappings , horse races , shooting matches , and gander pullings . They were , quite often , artists in profanity , and they loved to gather at some crossroads store to drawl out tall tales and see which could tell the biggest yarn . In such gatherings they developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on grotesque incongruity and exaggeration .  | A. B. LONGSTREET ( 1790-1870 ) AND THE Georgia Scenes ( 1835 ) . The southern back country , strictly defined , was never really articulate in literature . It was put on record , however , by men like W. T. Thompson , Johnson Hooper , Joseph G. Baldwin , and Augustus B. Longstreet , who were familiar with it , yet far enough removed , in background and education , to see its oddities in some perspective . In the writings of all these men the back country is hit off with a bluff , humorous realism which stands at the literary antipodes from the refined romancing of Timrod . Longstreet , who may be taken as a representative of back-country realism , was a husky plebeian , equally at home in a fist-fight , a shooting match , or a hot political campaign . Born in Augusta , Georgia , in 1790 , prepared for college at Dr. Moses Waddel 's Carolina academy , graduated from Yale , and prepared for the law in the school at Litchfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern up-country in tow . He practiced law , won an election to the legislature in 1821 , got appointed to the Georgia superior court in 1822 , and turned newspaper editor with the establishment of the State Rights Sentinel in 1834 . In this periodical he published serially the sketches which later appeared in the volume , Georgia Scenes . Thoroughly familiar with the back country , Longstreet carried in his head such a stock of amusing anecdotes and eccentric characters as only a country lawyer or traveling evangelist could acquire ; and in this richness of authentic native material lies the principal merit of his book . In its satire , in its prudential moralizing , and in its employment of the informal tale or character sketch , the book belongs with the eighteenth-century essay of Addison or Franklin ; but these features are unimportant in comparison with its racy back-country flavor . Pictured here is a slovenly world which could hardly be invested with a romantic halo , but which has the tang and gusto of reality . Two grand rascals cheating each other in a horse swapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; three old women dipping snuff and swapping sage advice about home remedies ? out of such homely stuff the Georgia Scenes are made . Perhaps the sheer barbarity of it all is what most impresses one now . At the races two little boys get into a fight ; this produces another fight between two men , and one of the men is carried off with a cracked skull . A jockey is killed in a fall , and the onlookers casually refer to the affair as an unfortunate little incident . Two notorious strong men of the community get into a scrap . They agree to make it a " fair fight , " and straightway proceed to trip  | each other , grind sand into eyes , and bite off ears and noses and fingers .

Whatever Longstreet 's limitations , he succeeded in embalming the back country for the gaze of posterity . But he succeeded in more than this . From the time of Madame Knight and William Byrd , a fruitful source of American humor has been the observation of the oddities of life in the remote hinterlands . Moreover , the semi-frontier communities themselves developed a distinct type of humor ? a humor , as we have seen , of broad incongruity and exaggeration . Longstreet continued and improved on these traditions of American humor . The literary vein which had appeared in Madame Knight and Byrd was now expanded into a work which , though hardly a classic , was a minor achievement of considerable importance . Later the same type of humor was to come to full growth in the classic pages of Mark Twain 's Huckleberry Finn . With all their homeliness , the writers of the South 's back country were quite as near as those of the coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toward Modern America : Walt Whitman ( 1819-1892 ) WHITMAN 'S PREPARATION . While Longfellow was publishing Evangeline in 1847 , and while Lowell was hammering away at The Biglow Papers , a shiftless and somewhat dandified young journalist of Brooklyn , Walter Whitman by name , was slowly , half-consciously preparing himself to be the most widely representative poet of romantic America . Whitman 's experience of American life was broad . The son of a Long Island carpenter ; a pupil in the Brooklyn schools ; an office boy for a lawyer and then a doctor ; a country schoolteacher ; a printer and contributor to the Long Island Democrat ; a New York journalist , reformer , theatergoer , and editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle , Whitman had already rubbed shoulders with all classes of Americans . In 1848 , on a long journey down the Ohio and Mississippi , and in three months ' work in New Orleans , he came to know the West and South . Neither Cooper nor Melville , neither Emerson nor Lowell , was so broadly national in experience and sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitman added no little reading . He read Walter Scott 's poetry entire , the Old and New Testaments , Ossian , the Nibelungenlied , 1Eschylus , and Sophocles . Dante he read in " an old wood " ; Homer 's Iliad , on a Long Island peninsula , " in a sheltered hollow of rocks and sand , with the sea on each side . " Meanwhile , he was forming his political philosophy not only on America 's practice of Jeffersonian democracy , but also on the theory inherited from the eighteenth-century enlightenment . His were the usual attitudes fostered by the enlightenment ? acceptance of a benevolent and harmonious universe , aggressive opposition to outworn customs , faith in the natural man rather than in institutions , and , above all , an ardent expectation of a larger , richer life for the common people . Cornnionplace as these ideas had become in his America , they had  | not yet received , so Whitman felt , a strong , adequate , clarion expression in literature . Consequently it became his chief ambition to voice , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctively American body of ideas . At the age of thirty-one to thirty-three , as he tells us , A desire that had been flitting through my previous life , or hovering on the flanks , mostly indefinite hitherto , had steadily advanced to the front , defined itself , and finally dominated everything else . This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary or poetic form , and uncompromisingly , my own physical , emotional , moral , intellectual , and aesthetic Personality , in the midst of , and tallying , the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days , and of current America ? and to exploit that Personality , identified with place and date , in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book . His RECEPTION . Whitman began to realize his ambition in a volume of poems entitled Leaves of Grass ( 1855 ) , a volume that was at once the fulfillment of American romanticism and the beginning of a revolt against it , the consummation of an older America and the herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grass was by no means proportional to its importance . Familiar as were most of Whitman 's premises , his readers were not prepared for the startling conclusions he drew ; nor were they prepared for the rough , unmetrical , apparently lawless verse he chose to use . Leaves of Grass was received , therefore , in much the same way as the Lyrical Ballads of Wordsworth and Coleridge . Most people were indifferent ; a few were bitterly hostile ; a few were enthusiastic . Whittier , it is said , was so thoroughly shocked that he threw his copy into the fire . Emerson , in a letter of cordial praise addressed to the author , called the book " the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed . " While the most contradictory opinions were circulating , Whitman steadily enlarged his volume , republishing it in 1856 and 1860 , and again and again until the end of his life , so that the final volume of Leaves of Grass contains his complete message . Gradually Whitman , like Wordsworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thoreau , Bryant , Swinburne , Edward Dowden , John Addington Symonds , and others , praised him . He became the involuntary leader of a sort of cult , and his house at Camden became a shrine for young literary pilgrims like Hamlin Garland . Excessive adulation , no less than unjustified criticism , came to make a sane judgment of Whit-  | man 's work difficult . Even to the present , his true stature has hardly emerged from the smoke of controversy into the clear perspective of history . What kind of writing brought forth such violent conflicts of opinion ? What was Whitman 's message , and by what artistic methods did he give it voice ? WHITMAN THE ROMANTICIST : ( 1 ) HIS TRANSCENDENTALISM . Whitman 's poetry , as both he and his early critics realized , is basically transcendentalist ; the paramount influence is that of Emerson . " I was simmering , simmering , simmering " ; ? so Whitman testifies ? " Emerson brought me to a boil . " Whitman 's thought , like that of Emerson , is illogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , the thought not of a logician but of a mystic . Whitman 's is the true mystic 's rhapsodic suggestiveness of phrase , the true mystic 's untaught assurance of spiritual verities : Wisdom is of the Soul , is not susceptible of proof , is its own proof , Applies to all stages and objects and qualities , and is content , Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things , and the excellence of things ; Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul . The " truths " of which Whitman was thus mystically assured were mostly transcendental " truths " ; but in reinterpreting them Whitman so impressed them with his own personality as to give them a more hearty , vigorous , extreme , and sometimes more irritating tone . The individualism of the transcendentalists became with him now a towering egotism , now a romantic enjoyment and wonder at the mystery of his own being . Arrogantly enough , he entitled the longest poem in his 1855 volume , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I celebrate myself . " Whitman 's , however , is not a narrow or selfish egotism ; it is not merely the individual , Walt Whitman , whom he celebrates . The poet himself immediately becomes a type of the whole human race ; mystically , his identity is fused with that of his myriad inarticulate fellows : And what I assume you shall assume ; For every atom belonging to me , as good belongs to you .. . I am of old and young , of the foolish as much as the wise .. . I embody all presences outlawed or suffering .. .  | Between these two poles much of Whitman 's earlier poetry swings : on the one hand , the passionate enjoyment of his own individuality ; on the other , the equally passionate feeling of the merging of his own personality with that of common humanity . This two-fold feeling lies at the core of that strangely assorted rhapsody , " Walt Whitman " or the " Song of Myself , " and also of the winsome reverie , " Crossing Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transcendentalist mystery of the ego , he was adopting an optimism even more buoyant than Emerson 's . Healthy , well-satisfied , overflowing with life , Whitman found it easy to see in the universe , as the eighteenth-century deist had seen , only a scheme of harmonious , benevolent order . But he did not stop with mere bland approval of life . With him , the love of life became a passion , which thrilled him with a lover 's ecstasy . The tasteless taste of the clean atmosphere was sweeter than perfume ; the ocean , whose rhythmic swells were never long absent from his cadences , was a wild yet affectionate playfellow : Cushion me soft , rock me in billowy drowse ; Dash me with amorous wet .. . No American poet had yet sung with such abandon of the sheer joy of existence : Of Life immense in passion , pulse , and power , Cheerful ? for freest action formed under the laws divine . Pleased with life in all its phases , Whitman readily accepted the Emersonian doctrine of the greatness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous than the journey-work of the stars ; the present moment was as good as any of the past decillions . And equally marvelous with the star and the leaf of grass was the human body itself . Whitman resolved to sing of its wonders , especially the wonder and mystery of sex , and to liberate the enjoyment of the body from the trammels of pseudorefinement . In " I Sing the Body Electric " ( 1856 ) , he proclaimed , If anything is sacred , the human body is sacred , . . . And in man or woman , a clean , strong , firm-fibred body , is beautiful as the most beautiful face . Accordingly , he proceeded to celebrate the body with a concrete  | frankness which his nineteenth-century readers found devastating , and which led many of them to think him obscene . Daunted no whit by their misunderstanding , Whitman held his ground with a more than Emersonian self-trust . His optimism was no puny plant , to be whiffed over by a breath of disapproval . He could cheerfully wait : My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what you call dissolution , And I know the amplitude of time . Physical science , which has brought many a modern thinker to despair before its picture of a universe of impersonal force , served only to ground Whitman 's optimism more firmly . Like Emerson , he welcomed science , and he wove its conclusions into his transcendental scheme . He enjoyed the sense of living in the midst of " vital laws , " the greatest of which , he felt , was the law of evolution . To Whitman , evolution meant progress . No blind flux of mindless matter , it represented the slow unfolding of cosmic purposes . Healthy youth as he was , lover of life , poet of the body and the soul , believer in immortality , believer in a purposeful evolution , it is not to be wondered at that Whitman discovered Good in all , In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals , In the annual return of the seasons , In the hilarity of youth , In the strength and flush of manhood , In the grandeur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . ( 2 ) His NATIONALISM . Ready as Whitman was to acknowledge his transcendentalism , he did not look upon it as the main drift of his poetry . Above all else , he aspired to be the singer and prophet of American democracy . A belated child of the enlightenment , he found the sources of evil in tyranny or superstition rather than in human nature , and out of the comparatively free environment of America , especially the West , he expected the growth of a haughty , noble , aspiring race . This great and free race , already in the making , needed a literature that should break sharply with the feudal past of Europe and celebrate the democratic present of America . Therefore he , Walt Whitman , would not sing of kings and nobles engaged in chivalric adventure , but  | rather of the " divine average " of American citizenship , engaged in the homely yet miraculous tasks of every day : In the labor of engines and trades , and the labor of fields , I find the developments , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would fill his poems full to the brim with the America he loved , the America whose spacious scenery no less than her unique political mission moved him to exaltation . Accordingly , Whitman 's writing is filled with pictures ? unforgettable , panoramic , processional views of American people and American scenes . The blacksmith , the negro teamster , the butcher , the farmer returning from the fields , the mother sewing , the soldier keeping watch on the battlefield , the prostitute , the pioneer , and hundreds of others ? all move in a motley , yet somehow intensely living , throng across his pages . We hear the hum and clatter of house-building , shingle-dressing , ship-joining , ferrying , mining , iron-smelting , stone-cutting , and cotton-loading . In line after line the opulent physical scene of America moves before us ? the husky-voiced northern ocean , Niagara , Georgia marshes , sun-dappled Midwestern prairies , arid plateaus , the gigantic peaks of the Rockies , and the long shore line of the Pacific . If his grandiose attempt to cram a continent within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataloguing , he nevertheless succeeds , as no other writer succeeds , in conveying to the reader a broad , panoramic grasp of America 's spaciousness , her opulence , her varied multitudinous life . Whitman thus rejoiced in free , materialistic America ; but neither mere freedom nor mere materialism alone sufficed him . The best fruit of a democracy , he felt , would be the highest development of the individual . Freedom should develop into " rich , luxuriant , and varied personalism " ; and the crown of free citizenship should be fraternal and spiritual in nature . For the oldfashioned celebration of feudal loyalty , therefore , Whitman substituted the praise of democratic brotherhood . Even on the brink of the Civil War , in the midst of violent sectional hatreds , he sang : Come , I will make the continent indissoluble .. . With the love of comrades , With the life-long love of comrades . And at the close of the war he could still sing , undaunted :  | Be not disheartened ? Affection shall solve the problems of freedom yet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall yet make Columbia victorious .. . One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian 's comrade ; From Maine , and from hot Carolina , and another , an Oregonese , shall be friends triune , More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth . And not only fraternal love , but spirituality , as Whitman understood that word , was to be the final fruitage of American society . Bound to no formal creed , Whitman 's ideal America was to adopt a religion which exalted the sense of wonder , the hearty acceptance of the world-scheme , zest for life , a haughty freedom from conventions , and , above all , a glorification of the life of the Divine Average . And the priests of Whitman 's American religion were to be the genuinely American poets ? poets who should kindle the slumbering American spirit with songs suited to a new , democratic nation . Such is the message of that vigorous chant of Americanism , " By Blue Ontario 's Shore " : Of all races and eras , These States , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are to have the greatest , and use them the greatest ; Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall . Whitman , it is evident , aspired to be not merely a poet , but a prophet as well . Others had hymned the national ideal partially ; he would hymn it fully . He therefore made himself uniquely the poet of American democracy . And since that democracy was essentially a product of romanticism , Whitman came to represent , in this as in other things , the peak of the romantic movement in America . ( 3 ) His STYLE . In his style , as well as in his transcendentalist and nationalistic message , Whitman carried to their logical conclusion tendencies that had long been evident in romantic poetry . These tendencies affect his verse form , his diction , and his method of organization . For nearly a century , romantic verse forms had become constantly more diversified . Whitman , searching for a medium suitable to his vast American theme , diversified them still further . Abandoning metrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular chant that is similar , in  | its cadences , repetitions , and parallelisms , to the harmonies of the biblical psalms . His innovations in diction , though less noticeable than those in metrics , were not less real . His romantic predecessor , Wordsworth , had tried to avoid the cliches of eighteenth-century poetry and to use a selection of the language of common speech . What Wordsworth had preached , Whitman rigorously practiced , in that he carefully avoided the stock poetical phrasing of his time , and scattered broadcast through his poetry the racy language of the street corner , slang included . And the novelty of his verse and diction was matched by the novelty of his construction . Often logical enough in organization , the preferred to conceal this logic rather than to reveal it . Transcendentalist fashion , he aimed to suggest and provoke rather than to round out and finish , so that his poems often seem as bafflingly inconsequent as the essays of Emerson . The more one ponders the relation between Whitman 's medium and his message , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . Whitman 's transcendental , nationalistic message , together with his panoramic portraiture of America , could hardly have been delivered in the neatly turned heroic couplets of Pope , or in the rapid octosyllabics of Scott , or even in the majestic organ-verse of Milton . That message required the medium of Whitman 's own free and sonorous chants . Any candid student must admit , however , that as a stylist Whitman is almost as uneven as Wordsworth , and that page after page of wearisome iteration and exclamation , page after page of undigested impressions , repel rather than attract the reader . Whitman 's best passages are those in which the reader is not diverted from the poet 's thought by vagaries of style ; in which the poet produces , through his own novel medium , the romantic overtones of a Shelley and the sonorous harmonies of a Milton . WHITMAN , THE POET OF THE UNIVERSAL . Whitman himself was fond of identifying his work with his own age and his native America . Many of his readers have preferred , however , poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular age and place ; poems which are so representative of human nature in all ages that they approach universal significance . Among the best of these is the " Passage to India " ( 1871 ) , in which the ancient search of the explorer becomes a symbol both of the human soul 's exploration in search of God , and of the vast unfolding of cosmic purpose . In loftiness of thought , in majesty of utterance , the " Passage to India " is among the noblest of American poems . Line after line is Miltonic in its sublimity :  | O we can wait no longer ! We too take ship , 0 soul ! Joyous , we too launch out on trackless seas ! Fearless , for unknown shores , on waves of ecstasy to sail , Amid the wafting winds , ( thou pressing me to thee , I thee to me , 0 soul , ) Caroling free ? singing our song of pleasant exploration . O soul , thou pleasest me ? I thee . Sailing these seas , or on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent thoughts , of Time , and Space , and Death , like waters flowing , Bear me , indeed , as through the regions infinite , Whose air I breathe , whose ripples hear ? lave me all over , Bathe me , 0 God , in thee ? mounting to thee , I and my soul to range in range of thee . No less universal in import are the three elegies , " Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking " ( 186o ) , " 0 Captain ! My Captain ! " ( 1865 ) , and " When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom 'd " ( 1865 ) . On the surface , the first of these elegies is a reminiscence of the poet 's childhood on the Long Island seashore , where he listened during the mysterious night to the wash of the waves and the calls of a bird bereft of its mate . Underneath the surface , the poem is a chant of the eternal mystery of things ? love and longing , life , and , above all , death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirge written in commemoration of Lincoln , the fallen leader of democracy . " When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom 'd , " which is also a commemoration of Lincoln , is an elegy of far greater scope , comparable to Milton 's " Lycidas " and Shelley 's " Adonais . " A sonorous nocturne , Swinburne called it ; and the term aptly describes the web of solemn harmony which Whitman weaves about his three motifs , the lilac , the star , and the bird . Without making his pattern of thought too harshly apparent , Whitman delicately suggests his own and the nation 's sorrow , fuses the memory of Lincoln with the broad and ample beauties of the American continent itself , and builds a triumphant climax in which he celebrates Death as an escape from suffering to rest : From me to thee glad serenades , Dances for thee I propose , saluting thee ? adornments and feastings for thee ; And the sights of the open landscape , and the high-spread sky , are fitting , And life and the fields , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , under many a star ; The ocean shore , and the husky , whispering wave , whose voice I know ; And the soul turning to thee , 0 vast and well-veiled Death , And the body gratefully nestling close to thee . In many a brief , almost photographic poem on the Civil War , no less than in the two elegies on Lincoln , Whitman invests some particular event with universal significance . Whitman knew the war from experience , and knew it in some of its most terrible aspects . Though not a soldier himself , he went down to the Virginia front in 1862 in order to care for his wounded brother . At the front , and later at Washington , he became an unofficial nurse and confidant for the wounded soldiers , talking with them , bringing them gifts , writing their letters , and lending a hand at dressing their wounds . Apparently cheerful and strong , Whitman in reality suffered deeply from his experience of war ? " deep in my breast a fire , a burning flame . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralysis which he suffered in 1873 is sometimes regarded as the aftermath of his service in the hospitals Meanwhile Whitman 's experience had eventuated in a new type of war poetry . That poetry contains no ringing calls to battle , no moving tales of heroic adventure . It consists rather of little , unambitious pictures of the march , the bivouac , and the field hospital . Nothing is said of the glory of war , much is said of its gruesomeness . Unpretentious as these poems are , they are realized with the vividness of great art , and over them all dwell a brooding pity and an ineffable sense of mystery which lend them the sense of profoundest , universal tragedy . Here again , as in Melville 's Moby Dick , or Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter , is to be felt that lofty , tragic sense of life , that high seriousness , which belongs only to the greatest works of art . These war poems , to be most deeply felt , should be read as a unit ; as a single tragedy , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side , " " Come Up from the Fields , Father , " " Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night , " " The Wound-Dresser , " and " A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim . " THE FORERUNNER OF RECENT AMERICAN LITERATURE . Observed from one angle , Whitman 's work is the consummation of the romantic movement in the United States . Observed from another , it appears in part at least to be dateless and universal , as timeless and universal indeed as our human sense of mystery and  | tragedy . Observed from still a third angle , Whitman 's poetry reveals in him the precursor of modern American literature . 1 i i him appear both poles of our literary development ? romance and realism . He looks not merely backward , but forward . American literature has advanced , to a surprising extent , along lines which Whitman forecast , according to principles which he laid down . Whitman was , as we have seen , lustily American . He called , somewhat stridently , for a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene ; who should stimulate and awaken the American people . As if in answer to Whitman 's call , American writings have made increasing use of native themes . The local-color school which flourished after the Civil War ; Mark Twain , with his vivid genius ; William Dean Howells , with his delicate analyses of American manners ; Garland and Norris , with their heavier-handed naturalism ; much of the brilliant array of twentieth-century poetry , drama , and fiction ? all these have brilliantly portrayed the spacious American life which Whitman loved , and have in turn helped to create and mold that life . The literary independence of America , which was desired even in the days of Freneau , and which was ardently proclaimed by Emerson and Whitman , was so completely won that by the early twentieth century it could be taken for granted . Not only in his national feeling , but in other phases of his romanticism , Whitman is a forerunner of twentieth-century America . In his revolt against convention , whether social or literary , modern authors have increasingly followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic desire to free the individual from the restraints of decorum has become , with some twentieth-century authors , almost an obsession . In poetic style , the romantic desire for freedom has been used to justify a bewildering array of experiments , metrical and unmetrical , which Whitman himself would probably have looked on with astonishment . Especially has modern poetry tended to follow those phases of Whitman 's work which are impressionistic and fragmentary . Interspersed among Whitman 's more copious and sustained poems are numerous brief , clear-cut pictures ? miniatures , etchings ? which aim only to convey a single vivid impression of reality , and which are invested neither with the romantic overtones nor with the air of cosmic significance that envelop his more sustained works . In sharpness of impression , in brevity , poems like " The Ship Starting , " " The Runner , " " A Farm Pic-  | ture , " " Cavalry Crossing a Ford , " and " Look Down Fair Moon " might have been written by a twentieth-century imagist . The critical realism of recent literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as indeed in that of his preceptor Emerson . As social idealists , it behooved the two to observe closely the actual structure and habits of society , and to measure against their ideal the imperfections of the real America . In Whitman , this vein of critical realism is most apparent in the roughhewn but eloquent prose of Democratic Vistas ( 1871 ) . Observing the aftermath of the Civil War in the North ? the political corruption , the hectic scramble for wealth ? the now aging Whitman pondered whether these developments did not call in question his whole buoyantly optimistic theory of democracy . With the candor of the most realistic observer , he admitted that American society had become " cankered , crude , superstitious , and rotten , " and that the most important element of any nation , the moral conscience , was either " entirely lacking , or seriously enfeebled or ungrown . " With a disillusion curiously modern in tone , the poet who aspired above all else to be the voice of democracy charged that , so far , American democracy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in really grand religious , moral , literary , and aesthetic results . " Whitman , in short , was led by his very idealism to become a realistic critic of society , observing , with a keen , candid eye for fact , the ills that democracy is heir to . Democratic Vistas is therefore a harbinger of that critical realism which , within the last two generations , has played an increasingly important role in American letters . Unlike some of his successors , however , Whitman did not abandon his hopes for America . Instead , he called for a vigorous national literature to breathe into " these lamentable conditions . . . the breath recuperative of sane and heroic life . " He reiterated his beliefs that the final goal of democracy should be a rich individualism , and that material growth should be only a steppingstone to spiritual growth . As fuel to flame , materialism should " feed the highest mind , the soul . " TOWARD A CRITICAL ESTIMATE . No American author , Poe and Longfellow perhaps excepted , has created such wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has Whitman . The most unfavorable estimate has naturally come from the humanists , who deplore Whitman 's apparent surrender to a mere flux of impressions , and lament his unwillingness to think , analyze , and ponder . In Whitman 's own day , Lowell , after reading Leaves of Grass the third time , could still see no poetry in  | it . And in the twentieth century , Norman Foerster , while he admits the great historical importance of Whitman , has concluded , " Turn where one will in his poems , one will look in vain for indications of any discipline , intellectual or ethical , making for self-mastery and spiritual vision . " On the other hand , Whitman commanded the respect of the British critics Dowden and Symonds , and , with reservations , of the poet Swinburne . Later American authors , particularly the radicals , often looked to Whitman as a sort of godfather . Hamlin Garland visited the aged poet in a spirit of almost religious reverence ; Edgar Lee Masters assumed Whitman 's equality with Homer . The historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " a great figure , assuredly the greatest in our literature " ? and then felt constrained to add that perhaps , after all , Whitman was " only a great child . " Though one may not speak dogmatically about a nature so complex as Whitman 's , certain conclusions appear justifiable . Clearly enough , the unevenness of his poetry does not invalidate his claims as an artist , for after all his inferior passages have been canceled out the remaining achievement is both fine and massive . That remainder embodies , dynamically expressed , the values , the immense inchoate energies of romantic , expansive , midnineteenth-century America . Whitman renders , in native rather than in foreign version , many varieties of what may be called the romantic mood in poetry ? its sense of wonder , its mystical elevation , its primitivistic response to nature , its love of beauty mingled with strangeness ; and he expresses these moods in a language-art that wrests new effects of freedom , variety , and resourcefulness from the generic romantic style . And , finally , he perpetuates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and feelings which , instead of dividing and frustrating human beings , tend on the whole to unite and satisfy and fulfill them .  | The Changing Age and the Realistic Impulse A CULTURAL REVOLUTION . The Civil War , parts of which are limned so sharply in Whitman 's battle pieces , helped set in motion a cultural change as far-reaching as that which accompanied the war for independence . Modern America , it is not too much to say , developed in the single generation from the Civil War to 1900 . Within thirty years , 1870-1900 , the population grew from thirty-eight million to seventy-six million . Within even less time the enormous areas between the Kansas tier of states and California were settled . Meanwhile the older sectional cultures ? New England , Middle States , and Southern ? were being submerged in a nation-wide , rising tide of industrialism , which shifted the economic basis of our culture from farms to factories , from rural life to urban . At the same time the older cultural disciplines ? speculative , theological , and 2esthetic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . These new forces , working with astonishing speed , produced no slow , orderly development , but a cultural revolution ? a revolution that made the Civil War itself almost as remote by 1900 as the war for independence had been in 186o . Before we can understand the literature of the age , we must first follow the story of these deep , swiftly-moving changes in the national life . THE PERSISTENCE OF ROMANTICISM . But we must remember , in our survey , that the cultural revolution did not appear to its contemporaries either so sudden or so complete as it appears now . Ante-bellum folkways , ante-bellum standards of taste , long retained their influence . Among others , the dominant romantic fashions in literature persisted into the new generation , shaping the taste of many intelligent readers until 1900 or even later . Thousands of cultivated readers still delighted in the romance of chivalry , adventure , exoticism , and sentiment , and devoured the works of authors who appealed to these tastes . Scott , BulwerLytton , and Dickens still had an enormous American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lew Wallace learned the magic of the rococo romance , his popularity far outdistanced that of the venturesome young realist . Even among authors who were touched by the new forces , the conventional romantic themes and attitudes long persisted . Mark Twain turned aside from the vivid realism he was capable of to write boyhood idyls and historical romances . George W. Cable , a serious social critic and reformer , invested his New Orleans with a languorous charm as exotic as that of Byron 's Mediterranean isles . Bret Harte surrounded the hard-boiled Western adventurers with a sentimentality akin to that of Dickens . The poets en masse continued to worship at the Nature shrine erected by Rousseau and Wordsworth . And the national ideals of the romantic period , which had had such an extensive and honorable treatment in American writings from Freneau to Whitman , continued to animate such different personalities as Mark Twain and William Vaughn Moody . Not only did romantic tastes and romantic subject matter persist into the new era ; the personal influence of the older writers persisted likewise . The aging romanticists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hawthorne , lived on , enjoying a deserved prestige . Once a radical force , they were now , by the rapid march of events , become conservative ; and the younger group on which their mantle fell were as conservative as they . They came to stand largely for the preservation of the genteel tone ? the restraints and purisms and pruderies and refinements ? which the " elegant " taste of the latter eighteenth century had bequeathed to our ante-bellum literature . In the support of these standards , Thomas Bailey Aldrich , the heir apparent of the Brahmin group , joined forces with the Pennsylvanians , led by George Henry Boker and Bayard Taylor . The romanticism of the seventies developed , therefore , a " genteel tradition , " which tended to fence American writings within the narrow preserves of the merely refined and pleasant , and which frowned on the more courageous renderings of life attempted by Clemens , Garland , and Crane . The poetry of the genteel authors , notwithstanding its sincerity , beauty , and technical competence , had singularly little vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They , together with the equally genteel public they represented , were remarkably successful in enforcing their cultural scruples on the more original talents of Howells and Mark Twain . But romantic culture had more to offer than a dubious stand-  | and of gentility . Other romantic standards , other ideals , shaped and in part created the critical realism that replaced them . From the opportunities afforded by the frontier , from the traditions of the war for independence , from the philosophy of the enlightenment , romantic America had conceived , as a peculiarly American ideal , the creation of a larger , better life for the common man . From other sources , including Christianity and transcendentalism , romantic America had got the lesson that the inner life ? humane or spiritual ? is of more importance than riches . Both these ideals , the democratic and the humane , appeared in danger from the rising industrialism , which turned the free laborer into a cog in the industrial machine , and which offered the capitalist only the tawdry rewards of luxury and power . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed into critical realists , studying the evils of the new regime in order to condemn and correct . Whitman , in his Democratic Vistas , was a pioneer in a critical movement which later involved Mark Twain , Lanier , Garland , Moody ? in fact , a substantial majority of our creative authors from 1870 to 1900 . Hence it came about that the new critical realism was evoked and guided by romantic ideals fol ululated in the time of Paine and Jefferson and Freneau , Emerson and Thoreau and Whittier . The romantic heritage , therefore , thoroughly permeates the literature of the new era . The prevalent romantic tastes , the prevalent romantic themes and moods did not at once disappear , but long influenced , and at times dominated , American writings . The genteel tradition continued to be influential if not productive . The democratic and humane tendencies in romanticism aided in developing the new critical realism . In short if American literature did not remain romantic , its failure to do so is owing to no lack of vigor in the romantic impulse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some were common to all nations in the European cultural group , others were peculiarly American . Of these forces , one of the most powerful was the continued westward movement of the population . THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT . In 1870 , as in 1800 , the most distinctively American thing in America was the frontier . At the close of the Civil War , the huge area from Nebraska to California was virtually unoccupied . The settlement of the Mississippi Valley had been rapid ; that of the Far West was to move with breathless speed . Access to the public lands had been made easy by the Homestead Act of 1862 , and the discovery of gold and silver had further stimulated the flow of settlers . Within two decades , a  | rush of white immigrants had thrust aside the Indians through fifteen hundred miles of fertile valley , barren desert , and rugged mountain ; the frontier was closed ; and the pioneer had become a memory . Yet in this brief time the Far West had developed , on its ranches and in its mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new frontier was both more lawless and more colorful than the old . It affected a dashing , devil-may-care verve and zest ; it laughed with the rest of the country at the incongruous riffraff of people who flocked to it . And the incongruities were many . In the early sixties , according to Mark Twain , the population of Carson City was composed of " thieves , murderers , desperadoes , ladies , children , lawyers , Christians , Indians , Chinamen , Spaniards , gamblers , sharpers , coyotes , . . . poets , preachers , and jackass rabbits . " The hand of this new West was immediately felt in American literature . It created first of all a new area of romantic adventure , and new types of the romantic hero . Side by side with the oldfashioned knight in clanking armor appeared the cowboy with chaps and jingling spurs . Alongside adventure stories of the Revolutionary and Civil wars appeared stories of border gangs and outlawry . If the older America had had its John Paul Jones and Daniel Boone , the new had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become a part of the body of American tradition . The new West also contributed its share to social and literary movements which the older West , or at least the back country , had originated . Not the least of these was the invasion of the cultural monopoly formerly enjoyed by the East , and especially by New England . As the western states became populous , new literary centers grew up , each fostering writing that could hardly have appeared in Boston or New York or Philadelphia . In the sixties , a flourishing California group surrounded Bret Harte in San Francisco ; in the nineties , Henry Blake Fuller and Garland and others maintained a coterie in Chicago . Meanwhile , the westward movement , to which these new groups bore witness , was spelling the doom of the provincial culture of New England . As youth after youth , family after family of the best New England stock moved westward , the sturdy agrarian culture which had supported Emerson at Concord disappeared . After 186o , no sage of transcendental optimism could have come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers like Sarah Orne Jewett and Mary Wilkins Freeman , whose stories record , in tones ranging from gentle reminiscence to stark pes-  | simism , the drab-colored annals of a folk from whom much of the more vigorous stock had been drained away . The exploitation of the West , it is claimed , brought to prominence some of the salient traits in American character . American optimism , self-reliance , equality , energy , restlessness , and lawlessness have all been attributed to the influence of the frontier . The chance to exploit natural resources of fabulous wealth , it is further claimed , sharpened the materialism , the acquisitiveness , of the American industrialist , and tended to make industry adventurously speculative rather than economically sound . Certainly , all these qualities have existed in America , and all have left their mark on American literature , though the exact degree to which the frontier was responsible for them must probably remain undetermined . The Far West also contributed to that distinctively American type of literature called Western Humor . Western humor is really a back-country rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were used to drawling out tall tales in gatherings at crossroads stores or on the decks of river steamers ; even after it was adopted by the newspapers , its methods remained essentially oral . It was a folk product , maintained by people who cared little for the formal culture of the down-Easters , and in whom much of the coarse-grained , realistic shrewdness of the eighteenth-century Englishman had survived . Western humor was at almost every point the opposite of the polite writings of the genteel school . It was deliberately coarse , realistic , prudential , anti-sentimental , dialectic , and vulgar ; and when it did turn aside from realism to fantasy , it wrought with Gargantuan exaggeration such a quasi-heroic saga as that of Mike Fink . Longstreet , Baldwin , the authors of the Davy Crockett myths , and others had , even before the Civil War , caught much of the spirit of Western humor . During the war , and for twenty or thirty years afterwards , the production of that humor was at its peak . Readers of newspapers were entertained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward , " " Petroleum V. Nasby , " and " Josh Billings " ? as Charles Farrar Browne , David Ross Locke , and Henry Wheeler Shaw chose to sign themselves . Currents from both these periods of humor ? that of Longstreet and that of ArtemusWard ? met in the work of Mark Twain , who is to the other back-country humorists as Shakespeare is to the lesser dramatists of the Elizabethan age . INDUSTRIALISM-THE RISE OF THE CITY . The Western experi-  | ence , vivid though it was , was short-lived . It was already being superseded , even before the Homestead Act was passed , by a force destined to bring the most far-reaching changes into the life of every American ? the coming of industrialism . In Great Britain , industrialism had already come of age . The use of inventions to apply mechanical power to industry , the expansion of production , the concentration of the laboring classes in factories and slums , the heaping up of unemployment as men were displaced by machines , the consequent decline of wages to a wretched subsistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully developed in England , and they had at least appeared in the United States . When the power of the Southern planter aristocracy was broken , when Northern capitalists could shape the policies of the federal government , the United States developed within two decades a large-scale industrial machine comparable to Britain 's . Stimulated by a new high tariff and a huge supply of immigrant labor , furnished with the rich resources of a continent , the industrial machine quadrupled the money value of its output in thirty years . Whereas American manufactures in 187o were valued at three billion dollars , in 1900 they were valued at thirteen billion . The maturing industrialism wrought , of course , an enormous increase in the total wealth of the nation . It multiplied , of course , the conveniences of life ; the telephone , the electric railway , and the automobile ? not to speak of the important inventions connected with the technical processes ? all appeared between 1870 and 1900 . These additional comforts , however , were balanced if not outweighed by the evils of the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led otherwise legitimate businesses into acts little better than piracy . Oil companies sought to wreck each other by securing railroad rebates , two railways made open war on each other with gangs of hired thugs , and unscrupulous promoters made millions out of watered stock . Business men often made mere tools of city and state governments , and in the notorious Black Friday deal of Fisk and Gould came near involving the President of the United States . In the effort to relieve the stress of competition , businesses were consolidated with breath-taking rapidity . The small operator , whose work had previously been the backbone of American industry , was ruthlessly crushed out , and huge monopolies , such as the oil trust , came to dominate the industrial scene . An alarmed middle class cried out against the growing monopolies , but failed totally to halt the march of consolidation .  | The industrial revolution also wrought profound changes in the racial stock , distribution , and class alignments of the population . Expanding mills demanded armies of fresh labor , which could be had only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Europeans each year poured into the Atlantic ports . Formerly , immigrants had been British , German , and Scandinavian ; now , they were Italian , Greek , and Slavonic ? people whose racial traits differed widely from those of the older stock . Meanwhile the proportion of people living in cities rapidly increased from 187o to 1900 , and the control of American society passed from the rural areas to the urban . The farmers , caught between the two fires of the mortgage system and the rigid demands of world-wide markets , vented their bitterness in a series of agrarian political revolts , but wrought no important changes in the national policy . Meanwhile , wherever industrialism had made much headway , social classes had been realigned in a manner roughly comparable to that of feudal Europe . At the " top " of the scale was a plutocracy of fabulous wealth , who dominated the industrial order as completely as any hereditary aristocracy . Next came the middle classes , composed of professional men , merchants , small tradesmen , and farmers . And next came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained powerful trade-unions on a national scale , down to wretched sweatshop toilers who eked out a miserable existence in unspeakable slums . Under the impact of industrialism , the cultural life of America seemed at first to decline . The Southern aristocracy was prostrate , and the promising provincial cultures of the Middle States and New England seemed in danger of being submerged by a rising plutocracy with no standards save luxury and display . But the culture of the " Golden Day " ? as Lewis Mumford has called the ante-bellum era ? was by no means dead . By social contacts and by intermarriage , the older families gradually absorbed the nouveaux riches . Meanwhile , men who shared the democratic ideals of the older America launched a critical attack against capitalistic industrialism . Henry George , in Progress and Poverty ( 188o ) , drove home to his readers the sufferings of the American poor in the very midst of plenty , refuted the laissez faire economics derived from Smith and Malthus and Ricardo , and proposed a " single tax " which should transfer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edward Bellamy , in Looking Backward , 2000-1887 ( 1888 ) , laid bare the wastes and cruelties of competitive capitalism , and described  | with appealing charm the Utopia of the future , in which all production should be nationalized for the common good . As spokesmen for a nationwide discontent , both George and Bellamy attracted an enormous following . Their readers numbered millions ; antipoverty societies were organized to carry on the work of George , and the " Nationalist " political party was founded with the object of realizing Bellamy 's Utopia . The effort to control the machine age gave promise , in fact , of creating a ferment of ideas comparable to the eighteenth-century enlightenment . So far as actual , practical reforms were concerned , the movement bore no important fruits until the twentieth century ; but in conditioning the literature of the age , it immediately became a major force . Wih the exception of Henry James , every important author from 187o to 1900 owes something to the strong current of economic criticism . With the advance of industrialism came also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shadow over the pages of our literature . Confronted with the harsh facts of economic warfare , romance tended to give way to realism . As the pressure of population increased , and as class lines were more and more sharply drawn , the frontier assumption of free will tended to give way to a feeling of determinism , which regarded human life as the mere pawn of resistless economic forces . Correspondingly , the national optimism , of which Emerson had been the most persuasive spokesman , began to give way to pessimism ? the pessimism of the individual who has ceased to feel himself master of his fate . In fine , whereas American thought in the midcentury had been formed in a small nation , agrarian , romantic in temper , and fairly well understood , in 1900 it was forced to take shape in a huge continental power , increasingly urban , uncertain of its philosophy , and beset with industrial forces whose workings no man could explain . THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE . While the industrial revolution was reshaping America , another force , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the scientific spirit , in its nineteenth-century expressions . From the Renaissance on , scientific thought had reacted upon literature ; the deism of Franklin , Paine , and Freneau ? to take only one example ? had derived from a picture of cosmic harmony and order made possible by the discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton . Nineteenth-century scientific thought , however , differed greatly from that of past centuries , and penetrated farther into the popular mind . Whereas , in the past , scientific thinking had been founded chiefly on mathe-  | matics and physics and astronomy , in the nineteenth century it was founded chiefly on geology and biology . Three conceptions , derived from these sciences , profoundly modified man 's understanding of life . The first of these three was the concept of evolution , which substituted , for the eighteenth-century idea of a static world-machine , the idea of a constantly changing , developing , evolving universe , in which the complex forms of life , such as man , had been slowly evolved from simpler organisms . The second was the conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which an excess of life is continually brought forth , only to be callously destroyed in the process of natural selection . The third conception , which for lack of a better name may be called scientific materialism , involved the deterministic interpretation of all existence , including the most complex shades of human consciousness , as merely automatic , physical processes . Scientists like Thomas Henry Huxley might , it is true , deny that they held the laws of matter sufficient to account for all phenomena ; yet the very tools , methods , and vocabulary of their sciences required that their study of life be chiefly materialistic and physical . They thought , in short , as natural scientists rather than as speculative philosophers or as mystics . Long in process of development , the nineteenth-century picture of the **29;147;TOOLONG reached its full outlines in the works of three English thinkers : in Charles Darwin 's The Origin of Species ( 1859 ) and The Descent of Man ( 1871 ) , in Herbert Spencer 's First Principles ( 1862 ) and Principles of Biology ( 1864-1867 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 187o ) . The new scientific viewpoint , as readers of these books were not slow to realize , called in question some of the most cherished beliefs which men had held in the past . The picture of a slowly evolving universe ran counter to the orthodox theological view of special creation , and the biological struggle for survival was difficult to reconcile with the idea of a personal God of love . Those who upheld the traditional view of life engaged the scientists in vigorous controversy , which , if it did nothing more , disseminated the scientific views more widely . America , of course , shared in the controversy . Spencer became well known during the sixties , and Darwinian evolution was widely discussed during the seventies . Of the American popularizers of scientific thought , the most widely known was John Fiske , who interpreted the thought of English scientists in his lectures at Harvard , in magazine articles , and in his Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy ( 1874 ) .  | Not only through controversy , but in less spectacular ways , the scientific spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had got their training in German graduate schools , became the special custodians of research in pure science . Older institutions , including Harvard , Yale , and Columbia , were made over on the German pattern ; newer ones , including Johns Hopkins in 1876 , were founded with scientific research as the dominant aim . And no less significant than the diffusion of scientific thought was the introduction of the scientific method into additional fields of knowledge . In economics , the scientific attitude rendered obsolete much of the older , speculative economy and laid the foundations of modern economic research . In history , it began the rescue of the American past from a web of myth-making and pseudopatriotic sentiment . In short , a new mode of thought grew quietly up beside the older disciplines ? speculative , 2esthetic , and theological ? and so rapidly acquired prestige that it threatened to overthrow them entirely . In American writings , as in English , the first effect of the scientific upheaval was to provoke a literature of discussion in which the questions raised by science were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , both reveal the impact of science on religion . Others , including Hamlin Garland , wrote stories in which problems of belief and conduct are examined in the light of the scientific revolution . Gradually , too , American writing was subjected to a new philosophy , which coincided in many ways with that fostered by industrialism . In its insistence on fact , science proved congenial to the growth of realism . In its materialistic , mechanistic interpretation of life , it fostered the growth of determinism and pessimism . The era of romantic speculation , which treated man as a rational being capable of infinite progress , was at an end . The era of the naturalistic novel , which was to treat man as a " mechanism , and a badly driven mechanism , at that , " was at hand . THE INFLUENCE OF EUROPEAN REALISTS . The four basic factors , which were at hand in 187o to form the new generation in American literature , were , therefore , ( 1 ) the romantic heritage , ( 2 ) the westward movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now all these factors , except the second , were shared with America by the principal nations of Europe , and all of them left their imprint on European literatures . Often , therefore , American authors felt their effects not directly , but through the writings of contemporary Europeans , especially the European realists . Of the English , George Eliot evidently influenced Howells , and  | Thomas Hardy the Kentucky novelist James Lane Allen . The French writers are most evidently connected with Henry James ; but the influence of one of them , Emile Zola , is written into the whole story of American realism before 1900 . Of the Russians , Turgenev affected Howells and James ; and Tolstoy influenced Howells and Stephen Crane . In this generation , as in others , American literature was intricately bound up with European . THE RISE OF REALISM . The most general and far-reaching change wrought by the new forces was the gradual shift from romanticism toward realism . Realism is , like romanticism , a permanent quality in literature . To speak of a period as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that period the realistic quality was unusually prominent . In contrast to the romancer , who tries by idealization to improve on life , the realist attempts to render life as it actually is . The motive of the realist may be , as in Mark Twain 's Roughing It , sheer zest for experience . On the other hand , it may be , as in Dreiser 's The Financier , something akin to scientific curiosity ? the desire to know and understand the facts about life , whether pleasant or unpleasant . But whatever its motive , the essence of realism is the faithful attempt to render truthfully the actualities of life . The American transition from romance to realism was exceedingly gradual , in fact , has never been complete . At first , realism was only a mild flavoring dissolved in a strong solution of romance ; then , slowly , as successive types of realism developed , it became a more and more substantial part of the literary diet . This transition was marked by the successive appearance of at least five types of fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new phase . The first type , in which romanticism was still predominant , but in which local scenery and dialects were faithfully rendered , was the " local-color " or " regional " fiction of Mary N. Murfree , George W. Cable , and others . The other types were , in the order of their appearance , ( 2 ) the comedy of manners , as illustrated in portions of James 's Daisy Miller and Howells 's The Lady of the Aroostook ; ( 3 ) the problem novel , dealing with some question of conduct or ethics , as illustrated by Howells 's A Modern Instance ; ( 4 ) the fiction of humanitarian protest , designed to expose some social evil , as illustrated in Garland 's Main-Travelled Roads and portions of Norris 's The Octopus ; and ( 5 ) the naturalistic novel , designed to portray the instinctive and mechanistic phases of human behavior , as illustrated by Norris 's McTeague . Retarded by the persistence of romantic tastes , and faced with  | a battery of hostile critics , realism made but slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the taste that was to enjoy them . In doing so , however , they solidified their art and developed a valuable body of critical theory in books such as Howells 's Criticism and Fiction and Garland 's Crumbling Idols . And so effectively did the realists work , notwithstanding their handicaps , that they created the most memorable fiction of the period . COMMERCIALIZATION AND JOURNALISM . The conditions under which American writings were published from 187o to 1900 offered no great encouragement to realism , or to other radical . movements in literature . Authors were subjected to increasing temptation to write for journalistic and commercial , rather than for more purely aesthetic , purposes . Journalism in American writings was , of course , no new thing ; Poe 's tales , for instance , had been distinctly journalistic . But after the Civil War journalism was stimulated by several factors . The growth of population , and the spread of popular schooling , enormously increased the number of readers , and correspondingly increased the literary market . The enlarged demand was met by new , quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain the reading public en masse . Good entertainers were well paid ; so that a clever storyteller , like Richard Harding Davis , was led to direct his work to the amusement-seeking multitude rather than to the lesser number who were genuinely interested in literature as an art . Except for a handful of conscientious artists , such as Henry James , every American storyteller modified his art at times in order to adapt it to journalistic needs . The short tale , in particular , had to be treated in a lighter , racier , and more condensed manner than that of Irving and Hawthorne . Hence the standards of the entertainer sometimes prevailed over those of the serious artist . On the other hand , the influence of journalism wrought benefits as well as evils . The American writer of Mark Twain 's time , if he learned nothing else from journalistic work , learned the art of contact with his audience . He learned , also , deftness in construction and economy of materials . Moreover , a rapid expansion in the publication of . periodicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the numbers , if not in the proportionate influence , of the magazines which were genuinely devoted to literature and literary criticism . To the old North American Review , Atlantic , and Harper 's were added Scribner 's  | Monthly ( 1870 ) , The Century Magazine ( 1881 ) , The Yale Review ( 1892 ) and The Bookman ( 1895 ) . SUMMARY . American literature from 1870 to 1900 represents , in some measure , a survival of the romantic outlook . The taste of readers continued largely romantic , the customary romantic themes were still employed , the ante-bellum authors continued to wield influence , and romantic ideals helped give form to the criticism of the new age . This new age was the creature of three principal factors . The first of these was the westward movement , which brought forth , among other effects , a native realistic and humorous literature to oppose the older romanticism . The second was industrialism , which created a new mode of life for the artist to interpret . The third was science , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new philosophy of life . Creature of these forces , and also of literary influences derived from Europe , was the new realism , which steadily advanced in importance and gradually cleared itself of survivals of romance . American writers were , meanwhile , largely journalists by trade , and their product was constantly influenced , for better or for worse , by their professional task of interesting the public . The influence of journalism , evident in most writers of the age , is especially marked in Bret Harte , the first significant author to appear after the Civil War , and the virtual founder of the " localcolor " school , which is now to be considered .  | The Fiction of Regionalism I. Regionalism and the Journalized Short Story LOCAL-COLOR FICTION : ITS ORIGIN AND NATURE . In a country so large as the United States , and in an age when communication was slow , it was only natural that , in many a remote , provincial community , life should have become racy with peculiarly local customs , folkways , and dialects . Prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell in the Biglow Papers , and numerous others had tried to capture the provincial atmosphere of the Southern back country , of the New England farms , or of other regions . After the war , the national curiosity about all things American , together with the growing literary taste for actuality , stimulated the extensive writing of regional fiction , the aim of which was to paint the scenery , manners , and characters peculiar to the more picturesque localities . The type of fiction best suited to this regional portraiture proved to be the journalized short story ? the old genially discursive tale compressed and unified , and withal adapted to the entertainment of a numerous body of readers . In their attitude toward their material , the authors of local-color fiction remained on the whole romantic . In their search for the remote , the exotic , the picturesque , the racily flavored , they ministered , no less than did Melville in Typee , to the romantic thirst for novelty . At the same time , their scrupulous effort at faithfulness in background and dialect discloses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new leaven of realism . BRET HARTE ( 1836-1902 ) AND THE FAR WEST . Appropriately enough , the first triumph of regional fiction was won through a regional magazine , the Overland Monthly . Early in 1868 the young editor , Bret Harte , observed that , although the Overland was designed as a California magazine , there was no California  | material in the issue he was preparing . Accordingly he wrote for the next number " The Luck of Roaring Camp , " a tale of a California mining town . The story proved to be the great popular " hit " of the decade . Within three years the author was a nationally known figure ; the Brahmin-controlled Atlantic Monthly had offered him ten thousand dollars a year to write California stories ; and Harte , accepting , had left the West , never to live there again . Already , however , his truly creative work was done . Clever and theatrical rather than great , he proved unable to develop the field he had discovered . He continued , it is true , to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrows down to a handful of stories and poems produced between 1868 and 1871 ? among his stories , " The Luck of Roaring Camp , " " The Outcasts of Poker Flat , " and " Tennessee 's Partner " ; among the poems , " Plain Language from Truthful James " and " The Society upon the Stanislaus . " Harte 's range is , therefore , narrow in the extreme . The larger part of the copious Western life that passed before him he left unused , perhaps unseen . By birth and early environment an Easterner , he had little sympathy with the region he came to depict . He had come to literature by the usual route of reading from other authors , in his case from Shakespeare , Hugo , Dumas , and Dickens . Dickens , especially , impressed him ; so that , like Dickens , he came to picture the world as a sort of gorgeous playhouse , designed to furnish the author with humorous oddities of character and with situations full of sentimental appeal . Always possessed of a flippant comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained also in the broad funmaking of the new school of Western humorists . Theirs was , as has already been suggested , a humor of grotesque incongruities and contrasts , told often in a style of whimsical , drawling understatement ; and , with his usual facility , Harte picked up the style as one to the manner born . And during all this time , while working on the Golden Era and the Overland Monthly , he was developing the journalist 's sixth sense for reader-interest . Harte portrays the West , therefore , not as an intelligent sympathizer , but as a curious onlooker . Or ( to change the figure ) he takes the role of a circus manager , who has come upon an incomparably amusing set of oddities , and who delights to play the impresario in showing them off to visitors . Harte 's great discovery was , of course , the picturesqueness of California life in the era following the gold rush ; his peculiar skill lay in blending this picturesqueness wth Western humor . Even his backgrounds are picturesque . Cherokee Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camp , " gives on a steep trail that leads over the summit of a hill illumined by the rising moon , and winds like a silver thread until it is lost in the night . The outcasts of Poker Flat camp in a wooded amphitheater , surrounded on three sides by precipitous cliffs of naked granite . While Tennessee is on trial for his life , the feverishness of the humid night air is one with the feverish human passions of the mob , and , above all this , etched on the dark firmament , rise the Sierras , " remote and passionless , crowned with remoter passionless stars . " No less striking , even though by no means beautiful , are the grotesque incongruities among the people themselves ? strangely assorted driftwood tossed up by the flood of the rush for gold : The assemblage numbered about a hundred men . One or two were actual fugitives from justice , some were criminal , and all were reckless . Physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives and character . The greatest scamp had a Raphael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gambler , had the melancholy air and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet ; the coolest and most courageous man was scarcely over five feet in height , with a soft voice and an embarrassed , timid manner . The term " roughs " applied to them was a distinction rather than a definition . Perhaps in the minor details of fingers , toes , ears , etc. , the camp may have been deficient , but these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force . The strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand ; the best shot had but one eye . Such contrasts , of course , offered chances for humor which no teller of tales dared overlook , and Harte took full advantage of them . In particular he practiced the drawling Western method of understatement . Stumpy 's bigamy becomes , in Harte 's language , " some legal informality " in regard to his two families . When a Western " learned " society breaks up in a riot , Harte 's version is like this : Then Abner Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen , And he smiled a kind of sickly smile , and curled up on the floor , And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more . Though Harte 's work is too theatrical , too sentimental , even , to be permanently satisfying , his handful of Western stories caught the popular fancy , and helped establish the vogue of localcolor fiction . Within a decade every locale of any importance possessed at least one writer who distilled its peculiar flavor for  | the taste of readers of magazines . The Mississippi Valley and the Nevada mining area had their Mark Twain , the Indiana backwoods their Edward Eggleston , the Tennessee mountains their Mary N. Murfree , the Georgia slave quarters their Joel Chandler Harris , Old Virginia its Thomas Nelson Page , and the declining countryside of New England its Rose Terry Cooke , Sarah Orne Jewett , and Mary Wilkins Freeman . From these numerous localcolor artists two may be chosen to represent respectively the South and the East , as Harte represents the Far West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A year or so after Bret Harte returned East , Edward King , sent by the newly founded Scribner 's Monthly to report conditions in the South , brought to light almost by accident one of the most finished artists of the nineteenth-century short story . While in New Orleans , King met an obscure warehouse clerk named George W. Cable , and found him an amateur of New Orleans ' old days of Latin romance . Cable had taken his own adventures ? he had served two years in the Confederate army ? quite as a matter of course . After the war he had settled quietly down to check accounts . He was reading widely , however ; he was perfecting his writing-craft in newspaper columns ; and he was poring over the records of New Orleans ' legended past . Irving-like , he began to form the traditions of his native city into romance ; so that , when he was discovered by King , his art was already well matured . His stories of Louisiana appeared in Scribner 's and Appleton 's at intervals from 1873 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the volume entitled Old Creole Days . The short stories were followed by The Grandissimes ( 188o ) , a strange , beautiful , barbarically opulent novel ; and Cable 's important creative writing was done . He lived , it is true , forty-five years longer , residing mostly in New England ; but his work was that of the social critic and publicist rather than that of the creative author . In fiction , his force was spent almost as quickly as was Harte 's . Cable found in New Orleans substantially what Harte had found in California ? a picturesque setting and a fascinating melange of brilliantly contrasting people . If Harte 's Sierra background was more imposing , Cable 's pictures of New Orleans were rich in a dreamy subtropical charm . And against this picturesque background ? languorous gardens and shaded lawns , impenetrable swamps and malarial marshes , winding bayous and old-world streets ? Cable paints a motley throng of people as picturesque as the scene . Creoles , with memories of a bygone , Gal-  | lic , semifeudal splendor , protest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black-mustached and dark-eyed , plot against Irish soldiers of fortune . American business men methodically carry on trade in the very temple of romance . Quadroon women , lithe and graceful , and of voluptous beauty , entertain young gallants at brilliant balls , or mourn with ascetic fidelity the memory of some dashing paramour . Pirate and priest , Dutch apothecary and Creole indigo planter , touch elbows in the narrow Rue Royale . The untamed African giant , Bras Coupe , battles savagely for freedom . All these and still others , in a picture gallery of amazing contrasts , mingle in Cable 's pages . Yet they do not appear as in life , but rather under a faint glamour of idealized reminiscence which softens all their outlines as moonlight softens a familiar scene , and which ( since no illusion can ever be quite complete ) reminds us that we have been conveyed , by an art at once delicate and unique , into the romancer 's world of dream . As an artist , Cable is principally dependent on his materials , his style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is narrow , and he lacks the great novelist 's profound understanding of the human soul . As a craftsman , he is competent , but of no exceptional skill . Yet his narrow scope was one to which his imagination , and hence his style , was perfectly fitted . 1-Iis sentences ? Gallic , suggestive , ejaculatory yet restrained , and full of piquant , amusing dialect ? are the inevitable medium for his strangely blended picture of decaying Latin splendor , subtropical nature , American enterprise , and the black savagery of the Voodoo . Few Americans have worked with more assured skill , or have created purer romance , than he . SARAH ORNE JEWETT ( 1849-1909 ) AND THE NEW ENGLAND VILLAGE . The reader of the seventies , in order to realize what contrasts existed within his America , had only to turn from the brillantly colored romance of Cable to the gray pages of Sarah Orne Jewett . Miss Jewett was a native of the quiet village of South Berwick , Maine . The daughter of a courtly-mannered country physician , she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went often with her father on his professional calls , she came to know the village and country people intimately . In her early teens she was awakened to the beauty of the New England seaboard by reading Mrs. Stowe 's The Pearl of Orr 's Island . Later , she observed with some indignation that her beloved village folk were misunderstood and sneered at by summer boarders from the city , and she loyally wished to vindicate her own people . " I  | wanted the world to know their grand simple lives ; and , so far as I had a mission , when I first began to write , I think that was it . " After being published in periodicals , Miss Jewett 's stories were collected into volumes , the best of which are Deephaven ( 1877 ) and A White Heron , and Other Stories ( 1886 ) . It was a world of quiet , subdued colors indeed that Miss Jewett chose to portray . Much of the more vigorous rural stock of New England had already gone West , leaving behind them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose flame of energy had flickered low . At the same time , with the passing of the trade of the clipper ship , many a port , once busy , lay deserted . Over all Miss Jewett 's country , a gentle decay had cast its spell . Hers is not a world of youth , but of maturity and advanced middle age , homely enough , and even ugly , yet attractive with the sober idyllic charm of Whittier 's " Flemish pictures " in " Snow-Bound . " In " The Dulham Ladies " two spinsters of advancing years , at once pathetic and comical , try to recapture their youth and keep up with the times by buying some absurdly out-of-date tonsorial " transformations . " In " A Native of Winby " a strong native son returns to New England from the West , but returns only for a single visit . In " Miss Tempy 's Watchers " two village women chat of Miss Tempy 's virtues and their own sins , while the body of their friend lies in an upper room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , best perhaps of all these stories , the nature of Miss Jewett 's art . Here is the story of a foolish , late , unhappy marriage , from the sterility of which the husband escapes by having himself reported drowned at sea . Here are the pain of loneliness and the deeper pain of humiliation mingled with disillusion ; and here is also simple yet supreme renunciation . In short , here is a situation that could have been handled with the stern objective naturalism of Mary Wilkins Freeman , or that could have been expanded into a full-length novel of Freudian analysis . From Miss Jewett 's hands , however , the tale emerges as an unpretentious idyl , fine with the fine homely stuff of life , full of carefully restrained pathos , and illumined with diserning sympathy . This Indian-summer haze of tenderness , lingering over all Miss Jewett 's stories , unites them , in spite of their lose touch with actuality , with the passing romantic school of fiction , and reveals them as transitional works , midway between romance and realism . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the provincial studies of Longstreet and Whittier and Lowell , and which was consciously exploited by Harte and  | Cable and Miss Jewett , appears to have become a permanent factor in American literature . Indeed , the stream of regional fiction has grown in volume ; and even in the supposedly standardized America of the twentieth century , writers have uncovered a richness and diversity of locale which would have been a revelation to the era of Bret Harte . But local color itself , whether of . the present or of the past , has proved of too thin a texture for the building of great fiction . " Atmosphere " is at best an accessory to the great novel ? the flavor , not the substance ; so that those local colorists who have depended upon it primarily have , as a rule , exhausted their materials with disappointing swiftness . Regionalism has been at its best only when used as a background for some theme of deeply human and universal import ; only when the atmosphere of a particular place and time has been used merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeless . And even in this early era , Bret Harte helped to train a young writer , who , though nourished in the milieu of regionalism , was to outgrow his surroundings and to develop into one of the few great , universal creative authors of America ? Mark Twain . II . " Mark Twain " ( Samuel Langhorne Clemens , 1835-1910 ) CHILDHOOD AND WANDERJAHRE . If a rich , varied experience-oflife is of primary value to an author , Samuel Clemens was well endowed . Coming of Southern " quality " folk who had felt the fever of Western migration , he was born in the village of Florida , Missouri , and was reared in Hannibal , in the same state , beside the Mississippi . Northerly as Hannibal was , the atmosphere of the community was semi-Southern . Slavery existed there , after the easygoing , quasi-patriarchal fashion of the Southern back country ; otherwise , the community was democratic after the new Western pattern . Clemens 's neighbors were good-humored , leisurely , orthodox in religion , a little slatternly , perhaps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . In this community Clemens passed a normal , carefree boyhood , and here he was apprenticed , at the age of thirteen , to a printer . Some two years later he was working with his elder brother , Orion Clemens , on the Hannibal Western Union ; and before he left Hannibal , in 1853 , he was contributing to the paper humor-  | ous sketches in the style of Western journalism . From 1853 to 1857 , following the roving traditions of his trade , he worked as a journeyman printer in New York , Philadelphia , Washington , Keokuk , and Cincinnati . In 1857 , while setting out on a wild-goose chase in search of quick wealth in South America , he fell in with the Mississippi River pilot , Horace Bixby , and , abandoning his South American scheme , engaged to learn Bixby 's profession . For three years , while he kept a thousand miles of treacherous river photographed in his mind or recorded in his notebooks , he mingled with the crowds that thronged up and down the stream at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , wealthy planters , patrician ladies , slaves , Creoles , Easterners , European visitors ? all types and kinds of humanity ? passed before his eyes ; and in the whole crowded show he took a robust delight . With the outbreak of the Civil War , the steamboat traffic collapsed ; and , after a bloodless " campaign " with an irregular Confederate troop , Samuel Clemens , now twenty-five years old , joined his brother on the long journey overland to the newly organized Nevada territory . Here , as he feverishly prospected for silver-bearing ore , and feverishly speculated in claims , another great phase of American experience was written into his mind . He was genuinely a part , as Bret Harte had never been , of the last turgid wave of the Western movement , of the hectic , energetic , lawless frontier of the Western mining towns . Not realizing his dreams of fabulous wealth , Clemens soon condescended to take a **25;178;TOOLONG job as reporter for the Virginia City Enterprise . To this paper , as formerly to his brother 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pseudonym of " Mark Twain , " recollected from his piloting days . In 1864 , having taken part in a duel as bloodless as his Confederate campaign , he was compelled to leave Nevada . Going to San Francisco , he began reporting for the Morning Call , and entered the literary circle headed by Bret Harte of the Golden Era ; nevertheless , he still found time for gold prospecting among the California mountains and for a trip to Hawaii . Thus at thirty years of age , on the threshold of his literary career , Mark Twain knew the American continent as few men have ever known it . He had traversed it from New York to San Francisco ; and of three great phases of our folk experience ? the settling of the Midwestern frontier , the steamboat era on the Mississippi , and the rush to the Rocky Mountain mines ? he had been a part .  | FROM SOLDIER OF FORTUNE TO MAN OF LETTERS . Only six short years , now , were to take this young Western reporter in hand , send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation , marry him to a refined Eastern woman , and settle him as a professional man of letters in Hartford , in the midst of New England gentility . He was to carry with him , to the foremost place in American letters , the native tradition of back-country humor ; a tradition which , popular though it was , * had not yet shaped the work of a truly great author . Newspaper sketches of the Western sort ? anecdotal , irreverent , realistic , satirical , humorous ? were Mark Twain 's chief literary vehicle in California , as they had already been in Missouri and Nevada . Some of his sketches , notably " The Jumping Frog " ( 1865 ) , were becoming nationally known ; and , like Artemus Ward , he had appeared on the platform , with uproarious success , as a humorous lecturer . Now , in 1867 , he returned East , published The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County and Other Sketches , and joined the famous Quaker City excursion to Southern Europe and the Near East , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once in America again , he lectured , developed his travel letters into The Innocents Abroad ( 1869 ) , met William Dean Howells , took a fling at owning and editing a Buffalo newspaper , married Olivia Langdon of Elmira , New York , and finally established himself in Hartford . Meanwhile , the sale of nearly a hundred thousand copies of The Innocents Abroad had established him permanently in his profession . Thenceforward the Western reporter was to be a professional man of letters , writing for periodicals , collecting , publishing and republishing , exploiting his talents for amusement with the energy of a Shakespeare , going bankrupt and paying off his debts with the fine sense of honor of a Scott , and traversing Europe and Asia with the growing world-weariness of the blase cosmopolitan . Influenced by his wife , and associated with authors who , like Aldrich and Howells , practiced a studied refinement , Mark Twain accepted without much protest the restraints of Eastern gentility . Yet , notwithstanding this curb on his boisterousness , he remained essentially a Westerner . To his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of backcountry morality . In his latest works he still wrote in the discontinuous , anecdotal , racily idiomatic style of back-country humor . This Western viewpoint , this Western style , still gives life to * Walter Blair , " The Popularity of the Western Humorists , " American Literature , III , 175-194 ( May , 1931 ) .  | The Innocents Abroad , though the rollicking verve of Mark Twain 's jokes is somewhat faded now . The principal interest of the book derives from the spectacle of the American back country , in the person of Mark Twain , face to face with the culture of Europe . Other authors , notably Cooper , had dissented from the Irving-Longfellow tradition of idealizing the Old World ; none , however , had yet gone so far as to portray the honest reactions of a Jacksonian democrat on the grand tour . Such , however , was Mark Twain 's object . " This book . . . notwithstanding it is only the record of a picnic , . . . has a purpose , which is , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him . " Accordingly , as a representative American , Mark Twain admires the beautiful cultivation and landscape gardening of France , is not impressed by the paintings of the old masters , is disgusted with the supine poverty of the Italian people side by side with the regal magnificence of the Church , and turns aside from the whole European spectacle to clown it with the skylarking passengers of the Quaker City . Through the whole story runs the irreverent realism of the back country , clear-headed if shortsighted , and always ready for a tilt at inflated romantic sentiment , whether embodied in the story of Abelard and Heloise or in the effusions of the tourists before Da Vinci 's " Last Supper . " REGIONALISM : MARK TWAIN AND THE WESTERN SCENE . The narrative method employed in The Innocents Abroad ? namely , the relation of a series of anecdotes with drollery , vividness , and " point " ? Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . In this task he was to become a regionalist , a member of the local-color school , yet far transcending the other local colorists both in native genius and in the ability to combine regional flavor with a theme of enduring value . The first of his regional works , Roughing It ( 1872 ) , a vivid re-creation of the plains and the Nevada silver-mining area in process of settlement . Here , in the sixties , our westward expansion had brought forth the lusty and picturesque , if short-lived , era of the pony express , of border outlaw gangs , and of the last Indian wars . Here was a vigorous , many-sided life , and Mark Twain was ready to paint it in all its variable moods . His book contains passages of pure clowning ? for instance , Bemis 's drawling tale of how he hanged a buffalo . It contains passages of the most vivid description ? such as the crossing of the alkali desert . It contains human-interest sketches ? the life of the border ruffian , Slade . It abounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the story of the million-dollar mining claim . And , withal , it is as anti-sentimental as The Innocents Abroad ? witness Mark Twain 's derisive treatment of the Goshoot Indians , in deliberate contrast to Fenimore Cooper 's cultivated savages . Roughing It marks distinctly the maturity of Mark Twain 's qualities , both good and bad . His principal defects disclose themselves as unevenness and lack of constructive ability . In one chapter his imagination may dramatize an incident magnificently ; in the next , it may altogether miss fire , leaving the reader only the barest , unkindled , crude details of the scene . In the organization of his story , his unit is the single episode , whether told in a paragraph or in a series of chapters ; and these episodes are seldom integrated within a controlling , structural whole . On the other hand , his principal strength lies in his gusto , in his enormous zest for life , in the vividness with which he realizes his scenes . Strength of style in the narrower sense is his also ? terseness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With American readers , moreover , his style is particularly effective because it is couched so completely in the native idiom ; no author has yet written the American language with more conscious and unconscious fidelity . In a mood more idyllic than that of Roughing It , Mark Twain turned to the multicolored life of the old steamboat times on the Mississippi. * In Old Times on the Mississippi ( 1875 ) , a series of sketches which later became the first twenty chapters of Life on the Mississippi ( 1883 ) , he tells a series of anecdotes , some amusing , some thrilling , of steamboating before the war . The river world is seen from the viewpoint of a green cub pilot who is being initiated into the mysteries of his craft . Though the story is told in the first person , it is by no means undiluted autobiography . Every incident is realized , compressed , dramatized , in the manner of creative art , so that the rude old river traffic is revived not as history , but as romance . In The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned in nostalgic mood to the Missouri of his boyhood , where the slave-holding South fused into the democratic West . As regional literature , Tom Sawyer paints a genial , easy-going , ignorant riverside community , suffused , like Miss Jewett 's Deephaven , with an idyllic haze of imagination . More important than its regional flavor , however , is the fact that the hero , Tom * An intervening book , The Gilded Age , will be considered from another viewpoint , below , p. 245.  | Sawyer , is the supreme embodiment of the romance of boyhood . Whether the young rascal is shrewdly getting his aunt 's fence whitewashed , or playing hooky , or courting Becky Thatcher , or playing pranks at school , or organizing his " gang , " or acting as star witness in a sensational murder trial , he does what the normal boy would give his right hand to do , and what the grown man wishes he once had done . Tom , however , is often in danger of being supplanted in the reader 's interest by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huck Finn slips away from civilization at the widow 's and returns to his rags and his hogshead bed , he appears to " come to life " as if without the author 's volition . A new character is ready to be added to the memorable people of English fiction . The picaresque story of this riverside waif finally appeared , after slow development , as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1884 ) . Huck himself is the storyteller , and the panorama of riverside scenes and folk , which he views as he floats downstream , is described in Huck 's own homely , but tersely expressive dialect . It is seen , moreover , through Huck 's intelligent and realistic , but unenlightened , mind . Eighteenth-century thinkers had speculated much on the " natural " man , whose innate soundness had not been spoiled by evil institutions . Huck Finn , ragamuffin as he is , is an engaging " natural " boy , shrewd , generous , tolerant , chivalrous , loyal , and essentially honest in spite of his fertility in lies . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , and the simple-minded runaway slave , Jim , on the other . Faithful , superstitious , warmly human , Jim is a triumph in genuine negro characterization . Seen through Huck 's candid young eyes , the mid-century Mississippi Valley unfolds itself . Scene after scene lives before the reader 's mind with a vividness beyond that of life , and every passage counts in the portraiture of the Middle West and South . I-luck Finn 's " pap , " disreputable , drunken , nursing his grievance against society , is a characterization which , in discernment , in delicate accuracy , in objectivity , has hardly been equaled by the later naturalistic school . The episode of the Grangerford-Shepllerdson feud gives a more authentic picture of Southern " quality " folk than any historian of Mark Twain 's time can offer . It both portrays and condemns an era whose culture alternated between mawkish sentimentalism and stark brutality . The funeral of Peter Wilks is equal to an ordinary volume as an account of back-country folkways . The homicidal rowdyism of a raw , primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | is luridly painted in the episode of Colonel Sherburn and the harmless drunkard , Boggs . The village of Brickville , where the loafers whittle and chew tobacco , where the hogs root through the black mud , and where " the houses had little gardens around them , but they did n't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weed , and sunflowers , and ash-piles , and old curled-up boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and played-out tinware " ? Brickville itself , in its contented slatternliness , is a type of scores of down-at-heels river towns . Altogether , it is a rude , unlovely society that Huck observes ; yet his variegated river folk , as they pass in disorderly groups and crowds before us , leave us with the same heightened sense of life as do the brave Elizabethans of Shakespeare or the lusty rogues of Fielding . That they do so , is owing first of all to Mark Twain 's power in condensed objective portraiture . Huckleberry Finn is , then , regional portraiture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraiture . It is romance as well , and its romance shades into intangibles comparable to those suggested by a Moby Dick or a Master Builder . Many of us have dreamed of an idle , purposeless , vagabond existence . In Huck 's voyage down the river , between wooded banks , between the tide and the stars , these dreams are vicariously fulfilled . Many of us have at times been conscious of mysterious shadingsoff of life , of the vagueness of dim horizons of memory or anticipation . In Huckleberry Finn the majestic river itself conveys always this sense of mystery , flowing on always , now solitary as a deserted ocean , now floating a motley traffic on its bosom , now hidden in treacherous fog , now slowly brightening in the dawn , now cosmically dark and wide , at night , between its dimly seen shore lines . SATIRE : MARK TWAIN , THE GILDED AGE , AND MAN 'S INHUMANITY TO MAN . As late as Mark Twain 's fortieth year , an intelligent observer might have been in doubt whether the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With an irresistible talent for funmaking , he joined the satirist 's keen sense for comical imperfections , and much of the true satirist 's anger at folly . He was equipped , moreover , with a philosophy and a personal temperament congenial to satire . His thought paralleled at many points , if indeed it did not derive from , that of the enlightenment . He was as skeptical of religious revelation as was Paine , whose Age of Reason he read and admired , as stoutly opposed to superstition as Voltaire , as passionately equalitarian as Jefferson . On the other hand , he lacked the underlying hope in  | the possibilities of human nature that might have led him , like Lowell , to use satire in the service of reform . Personally , he was a man of intense humanity , whose gentleness , like Swift 's , found paradoxical vent in volcanic outbursts of anger against cruelty . The spectacle of true tenderness , purity , and beauty always waked the latent chivalry of his nature , but sham , stupidity , sentimentalism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Twain was rich , therefore , in the personal equipment of the satirist ? so rich , indeed , that satire overflows at some point or other into every one of his full-length works . But his genteel environment in New England was hardly congenial to free-spoken satire , nor did he himself , apparently , have any consistent bent toward it . Satire became , accordingly , a secondary rather than a major force in his writing , yet a force much too important to neglect . Mark Twain 's possibilities as a satirist were shown comparatively early in his career by The Gilded Age ( 1873 ) , which he wrote in collaboration with Charles Dudley Warner . The " gilded " age is none other than the authors ' own ? the same corrupt era of reconstruction which had drawn down on its head the critical artillery of Whitman 's Democratic Vistas . More specific in their indictment than Whitman , Clemens and Warner direct their comic attack at the speculative spirit of the frontier and the corruption of the national government at Washington . The speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Beriah Sellers ; political corruption , in Senator Dilworthy . Sellers , in particular , is drawn with such enormous gusto that he comes near being Mark Twain 's greatest character . Always fertile in grand speculative schemes for enormous wealth , Sellers is nevertheless always on the ragged edge of poverty . Yet his spirits are so effervescent that , with only a candle for fuel and only raw turnips for supper , he is able to lose himself in illusions of grandeur . The action of the novel always livens up when Sellers enters , if it is only to address a jury out of turn or go to sleep in a CongTessional balcony . Ragged and uneven as The Gilded Age is , it exposes with cleverness and verve some of the crying evils of the national life . If it is not , technically speaking , one of the " best " novels of its generation , it is one of the most significant . After The Gilded Age , Mark Twain 's satire long expressed itself only in occasional irruptions into books like Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? gave direction to his satire ? the love of intelligence , gentleness , and  | fraternal equality , combined with the hatred of superstition , cruelty , and class distinction ? was expressing itself in the winning romance of The Prince and the Pauper ( 1882 ) . Although The Prince and the Pauper is a serious historical novel , it is close kin to Mark Twain 's satire , for in this preliminary study he trained his hand for a profounder attack on cruelty , couched likewise in the customs of a bygone age . A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ( 1889 ) , the principal American satire of its generation , arbitrarily drops a hard-boiled Yankee machinist into the legendary court of King Arthur in the sixth century . There , with the aid of a convenient eclipse , he gains an appointment as prime minister and sets about Americanizing the country . The Yankee 's story proceeds then in typically Mark Twain style ? terse , inconsecutive , anecdotal ? ranging from passages of inimitably ludicrous clowning to passages of all but unbearable pathos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pseudo-medievalism made current by such men as Scott and Tennyson . In Mark Twain 's opinion , the worship of chivalry disparaged modern democracy by casting a sentimental glamour over the really barbarous feudal era . Hence the medieval aristocracy in A Connecticut Yankee are portrayed as absurdly childlike and credulous ; the common people , slavishly submissive . Both classes are blissfully unsanitary , and both are scourged by disease . On the other hand , it is difficult not to feel often that the Yankee himself , as the embodiment of Americanism , is also the object of Mark Twain 's satire . The Yankee is , except for his program of Americanization and showmanship , so superbly unimaginative , so completely of the shop and store . The episode of the advertising knights-errant sounds like a fling at American salesmanship ; the chapter on " Sixth Century Political Economy " is certainly directed at the high-wage argument of the American protectionists . But deeper even than his dual exposure of the follies of these two contrasted civilizations , lies Mark Twain 's attack on a whole realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and callous cruelty hold sway . The denunciation of church and noble , which blazes through so many pages of the Connecticut Yankee , is only incidental to the larger , deeper attack on these immemorial enemies of human progress . Man 's inhumanity to man has never received a more terrific indictment than in such chapters as " The Smallpox Hut , " in which the Yankee and the disguised king find an excommunicated family dying in slow torture of the plague , without a Christian finger being lifted to  | aid them . Only the externals of the scene are medieval ; the human relations underlying such abuses , and the social callousness which tolerated them , were , as Mark Twain well knew , only less malignantly powerful in the nineteenth century than in the sixth . Here , as throughout the book , Mark Twain is not concerned with attacking customs long since dead , but in pillorying , with an indignation as fierce as Swift 's , an age-old baseness in human character . Nor did he have much more hope than Swift of reforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement , it was at least too stupid . Here , for example , is one specimen of the debased ore of human character as Mark Twain unearthed it . Just after several peasants have been hanged for supposed rebellion against the lord of the manor , A small mob of half-naked boys and girls came tearing out of the woods , scared and shrieking . The eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years old . They implored help , but they were so beside themselves that we could n't make out what the matter was . However , we plunged into the wood , they scurrying in the lead , and the trouble was quickly revealed : they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope , and he was kicking and struggling , in the process of choking to death . We rescued him , and fetched him around . It was some more human nature ; the admiring little folk imitating their elders ... . In the end , the slothful , devilish , superstitious nether side of human nature triumphs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , the common people desert their would-be liberator , and priest and noble resume their ancient rule . In Mark Twain 's mind , humor has finally been married to despair . ROMANCE : MARK TWAIN AND THE MAID OF ORLEANS . Yet in the same Middle Ages that had drawn down his fierce anger , Mark Twain discovered a heroine who commanded his chivalric devotion even as the Virgin Mary had commanded the adoration of her medieval followers . In Joan of Arc , Maid of Orleans , he saw realized those loftier , lovelier qualities of mankind that he despaired of in the race at large . Here ( so he felt ) was the supreme human embodiment of clear intelligence , pure-mindedness , lofty purpose , and supreme unselfishness , combined with the humanizing traits of winsome girlishness and laughter . To portray , and , in portraying , to exalt the loveliness of Joan herself , was , accordingly , his purpose in the Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc ( 1896 ) . Like his other historical romance , The Prince and the Pauper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Mark Twain 's works . In effect , the story may be likened to a gigantic tableau . The scenery of the tableau ? a dark background behind its brilliantly lighted figures ? is furnished by the chaotic Europe of the fifteenth century , with its superstition , its treachery , its barbaric cruelty , its fratricidal wars . Numerous minor personages , some tragic , some comic , many of them deliberately contrasted for artistic effect , throng the stage . There is the narrator , the mildly reminiscent , loyal Louis de Conte ; there are the satanic La Hire , the indolent king , the boastful standardbearer , and Joan 's giant bodyguard , called in jest the Dwarf . These and a dozen others , however , are only accessory figures in the tableau , so poised and displayed as to bring out , midmost the scene , the white immaculate splendor of Joan . To imagine the effect of Joan of Arc , one must visualize the tableau not as stationary , but as in constant motion , now shaping itself into gorgeous royal processionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic figures , now brilliantly enlarging into the pomp and panoply of medieval war . And through it all , Mark Twain 's Joan of Arc is supremely great ? greatest , perhaps , when at her trial she faces her accusers alone . DESPAIR AND RESURGENCE : MARK TWAIN AND THE " DAMNED HUMAN RACE . " But the idealization of Joan was not to prove an enduring mood ; the very decade that produced Mark Twain 's loftiest romance was to produce also his profoundest pessimism . Although feelings of bitterness and even despair had long dwelt in the depths of his consciousness , in his earlier writings they had broken the surface only occasionally . Now , for a time , these feelings , and the pessimism wrought by them , were to become dominant . Because he was always emotional , always tenderminded , he felt the more poignantly the personal misfortunes that were overtaking him ? the failure of his publishing house , the death of his daughter Susy , and the hopeless illness of his daughter Jean . Moreover , he , like Herman Melville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon high idealism . Devoted to intelligence , gentleness , and purity , yet confronted at every turn with the stupidity , cruelty , and corruption of the " damned human race , " Mark Twain was moved now to pity , now to cynical contempt . " Man is the only animal that blushes . Or needs to . " " Everything human is pathetic . The secret source of Humor itself is not joy but sorrow . There is no humor in heaven . " Nor was he blind to the depressing picture of the universe drawn by **25;205;TOOLONG science ? a cosmos indifferent or hostile to human values , a nature based on the  | predatory cruelty of the struggle for survival , a humanity which was only a badly driven mechanism devoid of free will and individual responsibility . It was just before the turn of the century that Mark Twain gave most powerful expression to this deeply personal and yet somehow cosmic pessimism . His cynical despair of human nature burns through the caustic story The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg ( 1899 ) , an exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smugly self-righteous villagers . His feeling that man is only an automaton , helpless in the grip of long chains of mechanical causation , is expressed in the essay What Is Man ? ( written 1898 , published 1906 ) . His ultimate despair is reached in The Mysterious Stranger ( written 1888 , published 1916 ) , in which the supernatural visitor , Philip Traum , teaches the village boys of Eseldorf that human life is a despicable thing , without one redeeming feature save that it is , after all , only an evil dream . So that only when the nightmare spell is broken , and life itself has become only disembodied thought in shoreless space , the dreamer may , perhaps , " dream other dreams , and better . " Yet despair was not to be the final end ; Mark Twain 's career was not to close in any unrelieved and tragic darkness . For the voicing of despair was itself a catharsis , and brought its own in tense , perverse pleasure ? " an intellectual drunk , " as he called the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within him was never wholly dispelled , his immense vitality repeatedly escaped it ; his earlier creative moods repeatedly flared up and for a time illumined or overlaid it . The hilarious humorist within him reappeared in the extravagant burlesque of A Double Barreled Detective Story ( 1902 ) . The passionate democrat reawoke to issue such ironic blasts against tyranny and imperialism as " To the Person Sitting in Darkness " ( 1901 ) . And in the reminiscence of his Autobiography ( 1924 ) , where the wheel of his awareness comes full circle , the nostalgic romanticist returned with memories of the slow-paced summer days and moon-drenched nights of his Missouri boyhood ? the truest source , always , of those mysterious depths that lie so often below the iridescent surface of his laughter .  | From Regionalism to Criticism in Poetry THE " GILDED AGE " AND POETRY . American poetry , it might be plausibly argued , has been in general of less importance than American prose . Our poets from 1870 to Igoo , in particular , produced no such substantial work as the prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In mere quantity of verse , it is true , there was no lack . Among others , the aging school of down-East poets still issued from time to time some lofty poem such as Lowell 's " Under the Old Elm " or Bryant 's " The Flood of Years . " A younger generation , including Thomas Bailey Aldrich and Bayard Taylor , preserved the refinements of the older school without their intellectual force . On the more popular level , newspaper columnists like Eugene Field sold their ten thousands , and popular sentimental balladists like Carleton and Riley their hundred thousands . But the quality of this poetry was not equal to its quantity ; except on the subliterary level , it has had no great endurance . The reader who is interested in poetry as a fine art need hardly read from more than four poets of the age : Joaquin Miller , Sidney Lanier , Emily Dickinson , and William Vaughn Moody . Viewed historically , the poetry of the time was shaped by much the same factors as the prose . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the West and South , as well as the East , for new authorship . There was in poetry , as in prose , a conscious regionalism which infused the poems of Miller with the local color of the California mountains , and those of Lanier with the lushness of Georgia marshes . In poetry , as in prose , the national ideals of the era of Whitman and Lowell persisted , and became a sort of gauge whereby to measure the imperfections of a turbulent new era of business piracy , trusts , immigration , class conflicts , and imperialistic wars . In poetry as in prose , therefore , a principal drift of  | the times leads from regionalism towards a realism that is not so much scientific as critical . Our poetry , like our prose , continued to respond to world forces as well as national . American poets , like their late-Victorian contemporaries , preserved in general the poetic methods of the romantic era ? the full , melodious rhythms , the ornamentation , the vagueness , the flowing eloquence of Shelley or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express the clash of ideas characteristic of the Victorian era ? the protest against materialism and the machine age , and the discussion of the relative values of religion and science . And , again like the Victorians , the American poets struggled manfully to preserve the values of humane culture in an age increasingly materialistic , scientific , and industrial . CINCINNATUS HINER ( JOAQUIN ) MILLER ( 1841-1913 ) . Curiously enough , the first authentic new voice of the era came across the Atlantic from London , where an American poet who called himself Joaquin Miller had just issued his Songs of the Sierras ( 1871 ) and was being feted among the Pre-Raphaelite group . Miller , it appeared , had himself drunk the cup of exciting far-western adventure which he filled for his readers . He claimed to have been born near the Ohio-Indiana line , in a covered wagon , pointed West , and to have taken part in several westward migrations , which culminated in an exodus for Oregon in 1852 . As a youth in Oregon , he claimed , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds in two or three Indian campaigns . He had certainly traded in cattle , taught school , acted as lawyer and judge , edited a newspaper , and , incidentally , drunk in the picturesque scenery and the stories of picturesque adventure with which the West was crowded . In 187o , after some preliminary publication and correspondence , he had appeared among Harte 's and Stoddard 's San Francisco group of poets , clad in " a pair of beaded moccasins , a linen duster ' that fell nearly to his heels , and a broad-brimmed sombrero . " From San Francisco he had gone East and thence to Europe , partly as a passionate pilgrim to the graves of Burns and Byron ; partly , no doubt , in the hope of that recognition which the Pre-Raphaelites and others were soon , in fact , to accord him . Miller aspired first of all to be the poet of the Far West . He saw the West , however , not clearly , but through two highly colored lenses : first , that of his own temperament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his reading in romantic poetry , particularly the " Oriental " tales of Byron . Miller 's is  | therefore an exceedingly Byronic West ? a place of rapid , exciting physical adventure , passionate love , desperate hate , and thrilling outlawry . But Miller does not merely copy Byron ; he gives his tales of warlike and erotic adventure at least a new local habitation . His scenery , the most valuable and original part of his work , is drawn on a vast scale and painted in brilliant colors . His hero , heroine , and villain move among snow-clad mountains , by rugged buttes , across alkali deserts in a world of burning gold and blue , within gorgeously colored Central American jungles , or over the broad Pacific . As if his poetic construction were determined by his scenery , he is usually unable to succeed within the briefer forms of the pure lyric and ode . Before his quality can be felt , he must be read in a narrative poem of some length , where his numerous insipid and even ludicrous passages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these longer pieces , the most successful are " With Walker in Nicaragua " ( 1871 ) , " The Last Taschastas " ( 1871 ) , and " The Ship in the Desert " ( 1875 ) . Among his shorter poems the best are the spirited ballad , " Kit Carson 's Ride , " and the impressive " Exodus for Oregon . " One does not go to these poems , of course , expecting any profound knowledge of human nature , or any intellectual stimulus , or any perfection in art . Miller 's one distinctive achievement , which alone gives him a place in American literary history , is that of a regional or local-color poet . What Bret Harte did in prose , Miller did , with more genuineness if not so much finesse , in poetry : ? he helped add the far-western scene to our literary domain . SIDNEY LANIER ( 1842-1881 ) . While Miller was penning his Songs of the Sierras and Songs of the Sun-Lands , a far truer poet was maturing in the desolate South of the reconstruction period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist who , in spite of almost superhuman efforts , was able to give only a fraction of his energies to the fine arts . Reared in the heart of Georgia , infused with both the deep religious feeling and the chivalry of the Old South , endowed with great natural gifts in music , Lanier was rudely swept out of his normal development by the Civil War . After service in the infantry , in the signal corps , and on a blockade runner , and after confinement within a federal prison , Lanier emerged from the war with his health badly undermined . Having drifted through a few years of legal practice and teaching , and having already begun his long battle with tuberculosis , he resolved to settle in Baltimore and give the remainder of his life to art . He supported himself and his family by playing the flute  | in the Peabody Symphony Orchestra , by writing stories for boys , and ( ironic commentary on the use which the Gilded Age made of its geniuses ) by writing descriptive advertising material for railroads . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to write a treatise on The Science of English Verse , gain an appointment as lecturer in the newly founded Johns Hopkins University , and compose a slender volume of poems , some of which bear the genuine stamp of genius . The fundamental thing to be said of Lanier is that he was an artist , endowed with an artist 's imagination . Whatever that imagination touches , it transforms and fuses into poetry , working sometimes with the mythmaking faculty of a Shelley . The coastal marsh , " low-couched along the sea , " becomes to Lanier the Old chemist , rapt in alchemy , Distilling silence . A summer daybreak becomes , not merely daybreak , but , in an image of striking beauty , the ante-reign Of Mary morning , blissful mother mild , Minded of nought but peace , and of a child . Nowhere is this artist 's imagination at work more sensitively , and with fewer faults of taste , than in Lanier 's better lyrics : the " Marsh Sony At Sunset , " " Tampa Robins , " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master , " and , especially , " Evening Song " and " The Song of the Chattahoochee . " Working more objectively , the same imagination is responsible for the vividness and rapid narrative movement of the ballad , " The Revenge of Hamish , " and for the mingling of piquant fancifulness and insight in " How Love Looked for Hell . " That Lanier 's imagination seldom worked flawlessly must , of course , be admitted . He was far too prone to languor and sweetness , and to figures of speech as unnatural as the conceits of an Elizabethan sonneteer . But these errors of taste , though they sometimes obscure his power , do not vitiate it . At most , they are mere flaws in the glass , through which the beauty of the outer morning of his poetry may still be discerned . Lanier 's lyrics and ballads , though they disclose his sensitive artistry , fall far short of revealing the poet 's full stature . To discover his most distinctive style , and to appreciate his intelligent  | response to contemporary thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the immature " Corn " ( 1875 ) , " The Symphony " ( 1875 ) , " The Marshes of Glynn " ( 1878 ) , and " Sunrise " ( 1882 ) . These four poems , and particularly the latter three , reveal Lanier as a romantic nature poet , as the master of a new orchestral style in verse , and as a social critic responsive to the turbulent currents of thought of the Victorian age . As a nature poet , Lanier is plainly of that distinguished line which begins with Burns and Wordsworth and extends , through Shelley and Bryant and Whitman , down into our own time . Much as he owes to his predecessors , however , his nature poetry is in several ways original . As Miller 's scenery belongs to the Far West , so Lanier 's belongs to the deep South . Through his poems one obtains glimpses of blue subtropical ocean , Florida sands and orange groves , huge live oaks , luxuriant marshes , and sedgegrown Georgia hills ; and one hears from time to time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mockingbird . To this extent , Lanier is a regionalist ; but he is much more than a mere merchant of local color . His is a fresh , pagan , almost primitive response to nature which regards natural objects almost as living beings . He will touch the " person " of the live oak only with a reverent hand ; he greets the sunrise with the frank wondering joy of some primitive worshipper of the sungod . Like Wordsworth and Bryant , he feels deeply the healing power of nature ; but he goes beyond these two poets in his passionate craving , not for mere communion with nature , but for an intense , emotional fusion of his soul with the " soul " of the marsh or forest . In Lanier 's intenser moods , this passion for nature leads him unfortunately far from the healthy uplands of American nature poetry , into the miasma of sentimentalism . In his characteristic style , Lanier is a musician turned poet . Like Swinburne , he enlarged the metrical bounds of the language , reaching out after measures ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swinburne in securing certain orchestral effects , and in constructing his odes with varying movements corresponding to those of a symphony . To this end he employed all the technical resources of English poetry ? rhyme , meter , rhythm , alliteration , assonance , onomatopoeia , and variations in the length of lines . Melody , even more than meaning , must have been Lanier 's aim in , for instance , the apostrophe to the forest leaves in " Sunrise , " beginning , Ye lispers , whisperers , singers in storms .  | Yet the single passage , melodious though it may be , does not reveal the complete effects intended by Lanier ; his full orchestral scope can be felt only in the reading of one of the longer odes entire . As Lanier 's artistry is comparable to that of Swinburne , so the critical bearing of his work is comparable to that of other Victorians . Like the Victorians , Lanier was drawn into the effort to criticize the respective values of industrialism , science , and religion . The aim of his critical poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supposed hostility of the machine age and of science , the humane values of religion and art . " The Symphony " is a Ruskin-like protest against the commercialism of the times , with its injustice to the poor . Lanier 's protest is based , not on the ground that the poor are robbed of their rightful spoil in the economic struggle , but on the ground that they are shut out from the enjoyment of art . The cure for this injustice , Lanier felt , lay not so much in economic science as in brotherly love ; the problem was for the heart , not for the head . Keenly conscious of the development of science , Lanier nevertheless felt that man 's spirit was possessed of needs which science could not fulfill . Beneath science lay mysticism ; beneath the reason lay " deeper inconsequent deeps . " Like Tennyson , therefore , Lanier sought to preserve a nonrational , intuitive faith in the goodness of God and in the essential worth of human aspiration . A recurrent theme throughout his poetry , his faith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : As the marsh-hen secretly builds on the watery sod , Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God : I will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh-hen flies In the freedom that fills all the space ' twixt the marsh and the skies : By so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod I will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness of God . EMILY DICKINSON ( 183o-1886 ) . Neither Lanier nor any other American of the turbulent seventies could have known that a shy New England recluse , about whose secluded life in Amherst clung stories of a tragically frustrated romance , would later come to be placed among the chief poets of the generation . Except within a narrow circle , Emily Dickinson lived unknown , as serenely indifferent to industrial America as America was to her . Having renounced the outer world , she turned to the inner . Within her own soul lay the only material she could transmute  | into poetry ; and there , with the vision of a mystic and poet combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptions , shy aspirations , hidden ecstasies , and startlingly prescient meditations . These adventures of the soul she formed into miniature poems , lyric or epigrammatic , dealing with " Life , " " Nature , " " Love , " and " Time and Eternity . " Successive collections and publications of these poems in 1890 , 1891 , and 1896 gave Miss Dickinson 's work an assured audience ; and , as her provocative miniatures proved better adapted than more ponderous poems to twentieth-century taste , her fame has steadily grown , and still continues to grow . Recluse though she was , Emily Dickinson was by no means shut off from the historical development of American poetry . Upon her mysticism there rests unquestionably the stamp of Emerson . Upon her stimulating miniatures , such as " Apparently with no Surprise , " rests the shadow of nineteenth-century thought struggling to reconcile the beneficence of God with the cruelty of the struggle for survival . And in her mode of expression ? fragmentary , enigmatic , careless of mechanical regularity , clear-cut and delicately original in imagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twentieth century , particularly the Imagists . Yet , after all has been said regarding her historical position , the principal impression left by Emily Dickinson 's poems is one of marked , sharp originality . Coming in her verses upon some shy , elusive fancy , upon some piece of whimsical naivete , or upon some breathless leap of ecstatic imagination , we feel first of all that we are in the presence of a fascinating , individual , even unique personality . Perhaps this elusive , personal quality can best be felt , not in her more serious utterances , but in the fanciful , half-humorous lyrics such as " She Sweeps with Many-Colored Brooms . " Emily Dickinson is ( it should be added ) a poet for alert , responsive readers only . Her unobtrusive poems are likely to seem trivial , or even incomprehensible , unless a reader brings to them a taste for unusual metaphor , considerable warmth of imagination , and some richness of experience . WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY ( 1869-1910 ) . In William Vaughn Moody , who was younger by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American poetry stands at the very close of the nineteenth century , with one foot well across the threshold of the twentieth . Moody 's environment , from his Indiana home through his undergraduate years at Harvard and his pro-  | fessional associations at the University of Chicago , afforded him a cosmopolitan culture and at the same time familiarized him with the style and subject-matter of nineteenth-century British poetry . Like the Victorians Tennyson and Arnold , Moody turned an essentially romantic sensibility to the service of evaluating and expressing ideas ? social , moral , and religious . As a social critic , striving to interpret his age and nation , he expressed himself principally through his reflective poems and odes . Among these , " Gloucester Moors , " a humanitarian poem , pictures the earth as a " gallant , gallant ship , " many of whose passengers , imprisoned by social injustice , lead lives of unthinkable suffering . " The Brute " shows how mankind , in creating the machine age , has formed a Frankenstein 's monster that bids fair to enslave it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tamed , and that his powers will create for men a security and leisure hitherto undreamed of . " An Ode in Time of Hesitation " and " On a Soldier Fallen in the Philippines " were called forth by the nation-wide argument over imperialism which went on during the conquest of the Philippine Islands . To Moody , as to Mark Twain , it was shameful that our nation , dedicated to freedom , should turn in her first flush of international power to the oppression of weaker peoples . These four ? and other ? poems of Moody 's are worthy members of that line of civic poetry which includes the peroration of Longfellow 's " Building of the Ship " and Lowell 's " Commemoration Ode . " Like his predecessors , Moody was devoted to the American vision of a larger life for the common man ; and this vision was the standard by which he judged the new forces of industrialism and imperialism . The force of scientific and of religious thought in Moody 's imagination may be gauged by other poems . In " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " mellow , " describes , in a tone alternating between lofty eloquence and colloquial huinor , the impressions he has had while visiting an animal circus . Inept as this semidramatic device might seem , Moody contrives through it so to re-interpret the theory of evolution as to reconcile it with man 's desire for humane and even spiritual values . And just as he attempted to find room for man 's spiritual development in the very midst of scientific materialism , so he tried t:o preserve this and other values of traditional Christianity from what he regarded as the decay of formalism . Turning away from the churches as mere " empty shells , " he sought for , and at least twice felt that he obtained , a passionately mystical union of his own spirit with that of the Christ . These two experiences are  | lyrically expressed in " Good Friday Night " and " Second Corning " At one extreme from the center of Moody 's weightier lyrics and odes stand such slighter though exquisitely modulated lyrics as " Heart 's Wild-Flower " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lengthier , more ambitious efforts , the dramas . Associated with Percy MacKaye and others who were attempting to revitalize the American stage , he produced in The Great Divide ( 1906 ) the most original and powerful American play prior to the work of Eugene O'Neill . Meanwhile he was essaying in a trilogy of poetic dramas ? The Masque of Judgment ( 1900 ) , The Fire-Bringer ( 1904 ) , and The Death of Eve ( unfinished ) ? a task " of highest hope and hardest attempting , " the interpretation of the mystery of man 's relation to God . If the task proved too high and too hard , as it proved at last even for Milton , it nevertheless enabled Moody to affirm poetically man 's twofold right to a rich sensuous development and an indefinite increase in knowledge . The opposed doctrine ? the repressive denial of life which Moody felt that formal Christianity had come to represent ? is for dramatic purposes attributed to the Creator . Moody thus assumes , in a curiously inverted fashion , the Christian doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienation , he feels , is destructive to both the Creator and the creature ; and he would have the two reconciled , not by the sacrificial atonement of orthodox theology , but by a mystical union in which man 's skill to enjoy and to know , as well as his skill to obey , should be well-pleasing to God . The Fire-Bringer and The Masque of Judgment ( to be read in that order ) illustrate in Greek and in medieval symbol the alienation of a tyrannical God from the defiant , creative spirit of man . The Death of Eve was to have treated , against a Hebrew patriarchal background , the reconciliation of man and God through Eve , the prototype of womanhood . But even without the unfinished The Death of Eve Moody 's theme is clear . Already it has been made evident in the entire handling of scenes , characters , and poetic dialogue ; and already Pandora has sung , in an exquisite lyric in The Fire-Bringer , the essential unity of the human soul with the divine : I stood within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known : ( I was blood-sister to the clod , Blood-brother to the stone. )  | I found my love and labor there , My house , my raiment , meat and wine , My ancient rage , my old despair , ? Yea , all things that were mine . I saw the spring and summer pass , The trees grow bare , and winter come ; All was the same as once it was Upon my hills at home ... . Notwithstanding the late appearance of Moody 's philosophical dramas , the principal currents of his thought were plainly set in motion by the nineteenth century rather than by the twentieth . His philosophy is , in the best sense of the word , Victorian . That is , he recognized the force of the drift toward scientific materialism , determinism , and pessimism ; but , instead of drifting helplessly with the current , he strove to direct it . Or ( to abandon the figure ) he sought to harmonize the findings of science with the humane tradition , and to achieve through the fusion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint in Moody of the early twentieth-century note of futility . Like most of the Victorians , he refused to abate one jot of his belief in the potential nobility of life . Even to the condemned race in The Masque of Judgment , Moody 's spokesman , the angel Raphael , is able to say , Whatever cometh with tomorrow 's light , Oh deem not that in idlesse or in spite The strong knot of thy fate Was woven so implicate , Or that a jester put thee in that plight . Darkly , but oh , for good , for good , The spirit infinite Was throned upon the perishable blood . For all of Moody 's effort as a critical thinker , however , he remained primarily an artist . Even The Masque of Judgment , he testifies , contains no theology , but is simply a poem . In " Jetsam " he claims to be beauty 's votarist ; in " Song-Flower and Poppy " he speaks of " sacred love and sacred art " in a manner that recalls Lanier . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical sense for symmetrical construction ; in the smaller , he wrought with such care that the reading of the individual line affords , itself , a pleasure quite distinct from that inherent  | in his general plan . And finally it may be said that , at the cost of occasional quaintness and obscurity , Moody greatly enriched his poetry by exercising what he called " the instinct of conquest in language , the attempt to push out its boundaries , to win for it continually some new swiftness , some rare compression , to distil from it a more opaline drop . "  | Emerging Types of Realism I. Fiction as Fine Art : Henry James ( 1843-1916 ) THE NOVEL IN 1870 . To turn away from the mature , critical poetry of William Vaughn Moody , and to examine the turgid stream of fiction that poured from American presses at the close of the Civil War , is to realize anew how late the novel developed in America as a genuine art form . While the English novel , under the tutelage of Eliot and Meredith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained romantic , sentimental , melodramatic , and , above all , formless . The gamut of the American novelist ranged from the Confederate romance of John Esten Cooke 's Surry of Eagle Nest ( 1866 ) through the moralized sensationalism of E. P. Roe 's Barriers Burned Away ( 1872 ) to the Richardsonian sensibility of Augusta Evans Wilson 's St. Elmo ( 1866 ) . Oliver Wendell Holmes 's The Guardian Angel ( 1867 ) is valuable chiefly in showing to what chaotic absurdity an intelligent man might be reduced by the prevailing mediocrity of the genre . Meanwhile the local colorists were beginning to create , in the regional short story , a form of authentic charm ; and here and there an individual novel , such as Clemens and Warner 's The Gilded Age ( 1873 ) or Eggleston 's The Hoosier Schoolmaster ( 1871 ) , gave promise of regaining the lost eminence of Hawthorne and Cooper . But the American novel , insofar as it was a thing of artistic worth and not of mere entertainment , was not to be cast in the mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Dean Howells , were to give our fiction the imprint of English and continental realism , and were to develop a sophistication , hitherto unknown , in the technique of the novel .  | THE YOUTHFUL JAMES : COSMOPOLITE AND LATE-VICTORIAN . Henry James , the earlier of the two to produce novels of distinguished excellence , came of a brilliant New York " family of minds " in which the father , moderately wealthy by inheritance , could divide his attention between Swedenborgian philosophical studies and the care of his family . An occasional associate of the Transcendentalists , the elder James practiced a robust Emersonian self-reliance , and accordingly carried out to the full his personal conviction that children should be educated as citizens of the world . From such an education ? tutoring , residence in Geneva and Paris and London , a year in the Harvard law school , and association with his father 's circle of friends ? Henry James emerged with unusual limitations and quite as unusual accomplishments . Few major writers have ever known and cared so little about so many areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , and he showed little interest in national affairs . He had at best only a lukewarm concern with economics , science , and religion ; he was indifferent alike to adventure and to sport ; and he had no continuing interest in most of the great literature of former ages. * Nevertheless , he could cultivate intensively the interests of his own class and generation ; he could assimilate the novel from Hawthorne through Flaubert , and he could breathe the thin air of late-Victorian upper-class concern with fastidious behavior , refined perception , and the enjoyment of objets d'art . These interests , limited though they were , could still nourish and blend with his study of the infinite varieties and subtleties of human nature . THE YOUTHFUL JAMES : CRITIC . The years 1865-70 , which saw the appearance of a number of James 's short stories , saw also the publication of the critical essays which were to grow into the volume French Poets and Novelists ( 1878 ) . Although James was well versed in the Victorian novelists ? Dickens and Trollope and Eliot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Flaubert and the brothers Goncourt , and by their associate , his own " great master and friend , " the Russian Turgenev . James of course did not approach these men as a mere pupil or copyist ; he was rather the detached , judicial student , observing the matter and the method of their fiction , and searching within these to discover the " laws " of fictional art . footnote * However , see , for a quite different estimate of James 's learning , Daniel Lerner and Oscar Cargill , " Henry James at the Grecian Urn , " PMLA , LXVI : 316-31 ( June , 1951 ) .  | From the beginning , then , James assumed that fiction was one of the fine arts , and was therefore to be studied seriously , with something of Matthew Arnold 's attitude of disinterested search for the truth . Truth about the art of fiction was to appear to James , at times , as no more than the critic 's perceptions of literary quality ; a critic was to be " a reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing enough to generalize about his art , and his very impressions and perceptions were the outgrowth of certain underlying principles , were the products of a profound and consistent philosophy of fiction . Like any other artist , the writer of fiction ( he holds ) must not merely represent life , but must create an illusion of more fully realized life , must so select and rearrange his materials as to give to them a finer intensity , a deeper significance . The novelist must work with materials important in themselves , choosing his subject with entire freedom but also with meticulous care , since the wisdom of his choice is a measure of his artistic stature . In a world made up overwhelmingly of moral relationships , the novelist should emulate the moral awareness of the English novel rather than the " moral levity " of the French . He may well follow the French , however , in his concern with the techniques and methods of fiction ? matters which were to become for James as great a preoccupation as metaphysics had been for the medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying principles of his craft , the novelist should regard each narrative as presenting its own artistic problems , the solution of which would give each story its own , individual mood and technique . ' THE EARLIER NOVELS . The earlier fiction of James reveals both the influence of his critical observations and the outcome of his search after his own individual subject-matter . His one continuing , controlling subject-interest was already , broadly speaking , in human nature ; or , more precisely , it was in human motive , in the subtle interaction of personalities , in fine discrimination among the values available to civilized men . This kind of interest , interwoven no doubt with his own psychological needs , led him to favor certain recurrent narrative themes : ( I ) the " international " theme , ( 2 ) that of the nature of art and footnote * The extent and variety of James 's critical writing may be studied in Morris Roberts ' Henry James 's Criticism ( Cambridge , 1934 ) ; also in James 's own The Art of Fiction ( 1884 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefaces to his New York edition , available , with an introduction by R. P. Blackmur , iii The Art of the Novel ( New York , 1934 ; new edition , 1956 ) .  | the artist , and ( 3 ) that of " the pilgrim in search of society . " Adumbrated or partially developed in his shorter fiction , the Jamesian matter and method found their finest early expression in The American ( 1878 ) and The Portrait of a Lady ( 1881 ) . In the former , his first distinguished handling of the international theme , James introduces an American millionaire into the heart of an old Royalist family in Paris . Christopher Newman , the American , wins the love of Claire de Cintre , loses her because of the arrogant class pride of her family , and finally , in a gesture of quiet magnificence , foregoes the revenge he might inflict on them . In The Portrait of a Lady , a book which will likely be regarded as James 's masterpiece by readers who care more for substance than for niceties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archer , in her initiation into European life . Isabel , the " Lady , " rejects the love of the impetuous Bostonian Caspar Goodwood , of her whimsical , intelligent cousin , Ralph Touchett , and of the manly English nobleman Lord Warburton . After marrying an American expatriate , Gilbert Osmond , she discovers that he has desired her only to secure her fortune for his illegitimate child . Isabel , one of the noblest heroines of fiction , meets the test of disillusion with a greatness of spirit equal to that of Newman in his renunciation of his revenge . Historically , both these novels are expressions of a period of transition from romance toward realism . The American is romantic , for instance , in its accentuation of picturesquely feudal types of character in the Bellegardes and in its idealization of Newman 's generous power . But both are immensely nearer to the truthful handling of materials than is the average American novel of the time . Both are , on the surface , " international novels " of manners , which show American people being introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophistication belonging to European society . Both , however , finally transcend the level of drawing-room realism and reach the plane of authentic tragedy , sweeping over the reader 's mind with a power that belongs exclusively to the creations of genius . Both are constructed with a skill rarely practiced by previous American writers of fiction . As Eugene Scribe and others had developed the " well-made " play , so James self-consciously developed the " well-made " novel , in which antecedent facts are presented deftly and unobtrusively , suspense is gradually heightened , and succes- footnote *- Adapted from Spiller , et al. , A Literary History of the United States ( New York , 1948 ) , p. 1042.  | sive peaks of interest culminate in a carefully prepared climax . Not every reader , however , remains with James long enough to enjoy either his power or his resources in technique . Already James 's penchant for mental analysis was tending to slow down the movement of his stories , so that the novels can be enjoyed only by leisurely readers who are willing to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S ART-THE Nouvelle . It should be frankly acknowledged , in short , that the art of James belongs among those dubious delicacies which only a minority are likely to enjoy . Not merely to the casual reader , but even to the intelligent , perceptive reader , James may often appear tiresome , or verbose , or trivial . For the uninitiated , perhaps the best access to James 's very considerable values is through his novelettes , which James preferred to call , after the French , nouvelles . Daisy Miller ( 1879 ) , his first important nouvelle , is for the most part a rippling comedy of manners , in which the naive mores of an American tourist family ? mother , marriageable daughter , and young son ? are amusingly contrasted with the more elaborate and rigorous conventions of " good society " in Switzerland and Rome . The Lesson of the Master ( 1892 ) is largely the story of the great but decadent novelist Henry St. George , who advises Paul Overt to give up his attachment to Miss Fancourt in order to devote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist 's career , but who nevertheless , after the death of his wife , wins Miss Fancourt 's hand himself . With less of sparkling wit than he had shown in Daisy Miller , James is plainly dealing , here , with a weightier situation and with deeper subtleties of human nature . The amusing superficies of dialogue are replaced , accordingly , by minute analyses of motives and phases of consciousness ? particularly those of Paul Overt , from whose point of view the story is told . And along with this subtler study of the mind has come a more careful weighing of values , in which wealth and the natural affections are balanced against an ascetic fidelity to art . Still weightier , and still more subtly suggestive , is The Turn of the Screw ( 1898 ) . In plot , The Turn of the Screw is a ghost story , full of passages of uncanny Gothic terror . But underneath the plot-mechanism of ghostly visitations appears a more portentous struggle ? a struggle of grim , mysterious forces of evil for the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic though the story is , how different is James 's method from the precipitancy , the neurotic tension , of  | Poe 's ! Writing from the point of view of the children 's governess , * he allows the story to unfold itself slowly , unhurriedly , even as it is gradually revealed to his narrator . He spins out to great length the breathlessly skillful verbal fencings of the governess with the children ; he lingers over minute analyses of every shade of feeling ; and what he loses by thus slowing down his narrative pace , he gains in a fullness of comprehension that lights up every nook and cranny of the conflict , in its inner phases no less than in its outer . THE LATER NOVELS : JAMES 'S " MAJOR PHASE . " t The narrative method of The Turn of the Screw adumbrates that of the later novels which , to the confirmed Jamesian , make up the author 's finest achievement . The latter eighties and the nineties were with James a transition time , a period of search and experimentation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtook his efforts in the drama , he came back with relief to the working of his own proper vein of ore . For it is essentially the earlier interests and methods of James ? only extended , refined , and somewhat changed in emphasis ? that make up his " later manner . " It is that later manner that unites in style and method the finely executed novels The Wings of the Dove ( 1902 ) , The Ambassadors ( 1903 ) , and The Golden Bowl ( 1904 ) . In The Ambassadors ? to illustrate ? an American gentleman , Lambert Strether , is dispatched to Paris to rescue young Chad Newsome from the wickedness of the French metropolis , and to bring him home to conduct the family business in Woollett , Massachusetts . How Strether comes gradually to believe that Chad is leading a more rewarding life in France than he could at home , how Strether finally entreats him to stay in Paris , and how other " ambassadors " are sent to the young man without avail ? all this provides material for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same preference of mental analysis to action , the same careful construction with which the reader of the younger James is familiar . To these earlier qualities James has added , however , others , including a finer nicety of technique . James had always , for instance , conceived of the point of view of his narrative with some care ; The American is told chiefly footnote * James 's fidelity to this point of view is such that the story has been interpreted , over-subtly , as a study in the morbid psychology of the governess . See , for a summary and evaluation of much of the controversy over the story , R. B. Heilman , " The Freudian Reading of The Turn of the Screw , " Modern Language Notes , LXIII : 433-45 ( November , 1947 ) . fi The quotation is , of course , from a title of F. O. Matthiessen's.  | from the viewpoint of Newman , The Portrait of a Lady from that of Isabel Archer . Now , in The Ambassadors , he limits himself , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the first page to the last , we as readers are continuously within Strether 's consciousness . We see the other characters only as he sees them , understand them only as he understands them . In keeping with James 's advance toward a stream-of-consciousness technique , his sentence-structure has become looser , less logical , less syntactical , as if in imitation of the quality of consciousness itself . At the same time , James has become an even more fastidious connoisseur of experience . In the person of Strether he lingers over every incident , every relationship , sensing its qualities , extracting from it every trace of its peculiar flavors . Life has become , to him , a slow-moving , complicated game , in which each player , to attain complete grace , must put forth his utmost in deliberate finesse . Life itself ? to drop the figure ? has become art . SUGGESTIONS TOWARD CRITICISM . The assumption that life can be made an art underlies , indeed , James 's entire attitude toward fiction , influencing both his subject-matter and his technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensitive people of comparative wealth , or at least of considerable leisure , whose principal occupation is that of tasting experience . The scene is ordinarily Europe rather than America , inasmuch as Europe ( so James thought ) offers more abundant materials for an art of living , more freedom of individual choice , and the background of a rich tradition of creativeness . Obviously , such a conception of the novel would not attract to James any large circle of readers . Many intelligent people have found and continue to find him , if not obscure , at least unduly deliberate , unduly concerned over the minutiae of a system of values which for them has no validity . Nevertheless , James has profoundly affected the nature and the later development of the novel in English . Although his audience was numerically small , it included ? and includes ? a number of critics , students , and fellow novelists who can reach collectively the audience that James alone could not . He could and did bequeath to his own I imited though influential circle a new approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beginning with his earliest stories and articles , he consciously and unconsciously persuaded his fellow-craftsmen to think of fiction , not as a means of instruction or of casual entertainment , but as one of the fine arts . In his earliest novels , he illustrated the possibilities of a  | " well-made , " classically symmetrical structure . In his later , he assayed , as no previous novelist had done , the very stuff of consciousness itself , and developed accordingly his method of revealing the story through a single " created consciousness . " In the former direction , his influence led toward the sophisticated and classically finished stories of his pupil Edith Wharton . In the latter it pointed , along lines whose direction James could not have wholly foreseen , toward the tortuous involutions and complexities of the interior monologues of James Joyce and William Faulkner . II . Comedy , Ethics , and Economics : William Dean Howells ( 1837-1920 ) HOWELLS 'S PREPARATION . William Dean Howells was , like Henry James , a cosmopolitan ; but his cosmopolitanism was built on the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howells 's childhood , the rural and village Ohio in which he lived was still a part of the West . Western democracy Howells learned in the same school as his friend and idol Mark Twain , and like Mark Twain he never forgot the lesson of equalitarianism . As his father was a country printer , his training in the business of journalism began early . He could no more remember learning to set type , he said , than he could remember learning to read . In his early twenties he graduated from the country newspaper to a place as reporter and book reviewer on a daily in Columbus , Ohio . In 186o , while still employed there , he wrote a campaign life of Abraham Lincoln . Howells 's familiarity with the business of journalism , however , did not prevent him from coming into fruitful contact with the traditions of humane culture . His father , who belonged to the age when the printing office was still the cultural center of the American town , made a practice of reading aloud to the family , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inclining mostly to the polished authors of English neoclassicism . Having begun to imitate his masters ? first Pope , and later Heine ? he published* a volume of poems in 186o ; and his poetic contributions were accepted by the newly founded Atlantic Monthly in 186o and 1861 . Upon the inauguration of Lincoln , he was rewarded for his campaign services by an appointment as consul to Venice . There he lived from 1861 to 1865 , footnote In collaboration with J. J. Piatt.  | continuing to write , and familiarizing himself with that ample world of European manners and art which afforded the breath of life to spirits like Henry James . After a short engagement on the Nation , Howells served the Atlantic Monthly as assistant editor from 1866 to 1871 , and as editor until 1881 . These fifteen years , together with the five more that passed before he moved from Boston to New York , went far toward determining the materials and manner of his art . Familiar with the eminent New England authors in their twilight years , he assumed from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , a decorous audience whom he could not afford to shock with notes of reality too harsh and daring . As his fictional area , he adopted a region dominated on the one hand by the impeccable manners of Back Bay and on the other by the New England conscience . That Howells 's realism is less pungent and daring than that of Mark Twain is owing in part , therefore , to the restraints of his Boston environment ? but only in part . Howells was by native temperament inclined to urbanity , to self-restraint , to the observance of the Victorian decencies . And in decorum , as in many other things , his development was less a play of " influences " than the natural unfolding of his own serene , well-poised genius . In Howells 's voluminous production , including poems , travel books , and plays , only his novels and criticisms are of primary importance . In both the novel and the critical essay he became early known as a militant leader of the realistic movement . Now a realistic author , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can render only those phases of life which he is equipped to observe . There are , consequently , as many hues and shades of realism as there are authors . The particular hues and shades of Howells 's realism ( given the environment in which lie worked ) were determined largely by his equipment as a comed ian of manners , a student of ethical problems , and an observer of America 's new industrialism . His vision of human nature includes comedy , ethics , and economics. * COMEDIES OF MANNERS . The comedy of manners , whether conveyed through the drama by a Congreve or through the novel by a Jane Austen , flourishes only in the midst of decorous , highly footnote * The reader may wish to know also certain books which can hardly be included in this rather inadequate outline : The Landlord at Lion 's Head ( 1897 ) for its superb character study ; New Leaf Mills ( 1913 ) for its idyllic pictures of semi-pioneer life in early Ohio ; and the autobiographies , especially Years of My Youth ( 1916 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where social conduct is presumed to conform to a standard of good taste . Comedy of this sort proposes to amuse the reader by exhibiting those follies and foibles in which imperfect human nature departs from the accepted standard of manners . It proposes also to serve as a corrective ; comedians from Aristophanes to Shaw have aimed to chasten folly and thereby to aid in civilizing mankind . In the politely Victorian circles about Boston and among American expatriates abroad , Howells discovered a society admirably suited to treatment in the comedy of manners . Here the individual 's conduct was subject to a dual control : that exercised by bourgeois , Victorian standards of respectability , and that exercised by the N.ew England conscience , whose vagaries continually interested and sometimes amazed the western-born Howells . Here , too , it was possible to study the contrasts between differing degrees and kinds of sophistication . The newly rich manufacturer could be brought into instructive contrast with the Brahmin ; a strait-laced Puritan girl could be studied side by side with an Italianized expatriate . An excellent example of Howells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strongest novels , is The Lady of the Aroostook ( 1879 ) . In this story , Lydia Blood , a simple upcountry girl , proves to be the only woman on board the Aroostook on a voyage to Trieste . Two Bostonian gentlemen , Dunham and Staniford , endlessly and ridiculously discuss their scruples about making friends with Lydia . Staniford , though desperately in love with her , finally decides that it would be ungentlemanly to propose until she is placed under the " protection " of her aunt in Venice . Once Lydia is safely in Venice , the comedy becomes even more amusing , for neither Lydia nor her aunt , Mrs. Erwin , can understand the other 's social code . Mrs. Erwin is shocked at Lydia 's attending church without a chaperon ; Lydia is equally shocked at her aunt 's attending the opera instead of the church on Sunday evening . Lydia stiffens to rigidity on learning that the Countess Tatocka enjoys a cavalier servente as well as a husband ; Mrs. Erwin is on pins lest the facts about Lydia 's unconventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , evidently , Howells has created a sparkling comedy of manners , which plays amusingly over the surface of life and exposes some of the less serious , more entertaining follies that flesh is heir to . Not so pure a type of the comedy of manners , but a stronger novel , is Indian Summer ( 1886 ) . Theodore Colville , an Indiana newspaper man who has retired in his early forties , meets in Florence , Italy , an attractive widow of his own age , Mrs. Bowen ,  | and her beautiful young ward , Imogene Graham . Imogene , who has learned from Mrs. Bowen of Colville 's youthful disappointment in love , and who is fascinated by his superior poise , is sacrificially willing to marry him to compensate for his lost romance . Mrs. Bowen loves him more tenderly , more wisely , and , as it proves , more lastingly . In Howells 's hands , this complication develops with the utmost naturalness ; and every action , every bit of dialogue , though as natural as life itself , tells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . While handling a situation that might easily have lapsed into the broadly ridiculous or the sentimental , Howells preserves admirably the difficult , even temper of well-bred comedy . Above all , he proves himself a master of dialogue . If his characters are incapable of the subtle verbal fencings of Henry James 's , they are superior in the play of wit and humor . Their badinage , compliment , and raillery are always amusing , and sometimes brilliant . STUDIES IN CHARACTER AND ETHICS . While Howells was mastering the comedy of manners , he was not neglecting more serious forms of realism . If he is the American counterpart of Jane Austen in wit , he is the counterpart of Turgenev or George Eliot in his serious interest in the realities of human character ? especially in character face to face with ethical problems . This weightier interest is responsible for the production of the two books by which he is most generally known : A Modern Instance ( 1882 ) and The Rise of Silas Lapham ( 1885 ) . A Modern Instance is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband 's desertion , and finally ends in divorce . Out of half a dozen planes on which the story might have been pitched ? from cynical comedy to romantic sentimentality ? Howells chose that of a sincere interest in human nature and in the solution of moral problems . Human nature is represented in a group of characters limned with such complete clearness that we as readers accept them as real people , with no thought of the deliberate art that produced them . The impetuous , passionate Marcia Gaylord ; her self-indulgent husband , Bartley Hubbard ; her father , the rugged old Squire ; her unconfessed lover , Ben Halleck ? all these are not merely characters of fiction , but actual people whom we have known in the flesh , with whom we have suffered , and from whose experiences we have gained in wisdom and sympathy . In the talk of these people , questions of ethics ? such as the social function of the press ? come up quite naturally for discussion . Of these questions , that of divorce is , naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Halleck is appropriately made the spokesman for greater freedom in divorce ; his friend Atherton , on the other hand , is made the spokesman for the most rigid ideals regarding the sanctity of marriage . Having thus presented both sides of the question , as well as illustrated it in his plot , Howells leaves it , with characteristic impartiality , unsettled . In the light of these discussions among Howells 's people , it is plain that A Modern Instance was intended not merely as an objective study in character , but as a problem novel , comparable to the problem plays of Ibsen . The Rise of Silas Lapham , Howells 's most popular novel , established in fiction a character peculiarly American ? the selfmade business man . Through the exploitation of a paint mine found on his father 's farm , Lapham has become a millionaire manufacturer . But when the son of an old Boston family comes to love his daughter , Lapham finds that wealth brings difficult problems as well as advantages . The efforts of the patrician and plebeian families to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kinds of sophistication ? a study done on a more serious plane than that of the comedy of manners . Meanwhile , in another field , Lapham 's character is subjected to test after test . His new house burns uninsured ; his wife , through a misunderstanding , temporarily loses confidence in him ; he makes an unfortunate loan to a former partner ; and his business finally fails . Nevertheless , when tempted to recoup himself by dishonesty , Lapham manfully " rises , " resists , gives up his business , and on the verge of old age starts life anew on his ancestral farm . In his acumen , his kindliness , and his rugged honesty , Lapham stands for the best in the old-fashioned individualistic business man ? a type whose doom was already sealed by the growth of corporate enterprise . The novel in which he figures is thus , like A Modern Instance , a solid record of American reality ; but , again like its predecessor , it is more than that . It is a problem novel , portraying human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lapham 's failure , as he thought , an inevitable retribution for his having dealt ungenerously with his partner ? Or was this conviction of Lapham 's only another vagary of the unaccountable New England conscience ? Howells , as usual , refuses to commit himself in regard to the ethical problem which he has posed . STUDIES IN ECONOMICS . In 1885 , one of the turning-points in Howells 's life came with his engagement on the editorial staff of Harper 's , a step which finally brought about his removal from  | New England to New York . Always interested in things American , always humane and sensitive , Howells responded to the larger world of industrialism , now opened to his eyes , with a deep concern over the class war waged by capital and labor . A traction strike in New York , and the unfair conviction of the Chicago anarchists in connection with the Haymarket Riot of 1886 , combined to bring Howells to a spiritual crisis which materially changed , for several years , the substance of his work . Acquainted with the single-tax program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utopian socialism of Bellamy 's Looking Backward , familiar with the young radical , Hamlin Garland , and moved by the ethical earnestness of his great foreign master , Tolstoy , Howells took in his own mind the decisive step of abandoning the capitalistic system in favor of a Utopian socialism . Correspondingly , he adapted his method of fiction ? objective realism tinged with the study of moral problems ? to the portraiture of human life as shaped by the huge energies of the machine age . In place of the scruples of the New England conscience , he substitutes the far-flung spectacle of class war . This transition in Howells 's interests is illustrated in A Hazard of New Fortunes ( 189o ) . At first glance , this novel appears to be only another of his studies in the commonplace ; indeed , the house hunting of Basil and Isabel March is usually regarded as his best work in the realism of everyday life . Gradually , however , it appears that the measure of Howells 's characters is to be taken not so much by their action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of class warfare , and more specifically to a traction strike similar to the one Howells had observed in New York . The characters are so chosen as to represent a wide variety of attitudes toward industrialism . There is the rich old Pennsylvania Dutch oil man , Dryfoos , whose philosophy is that business is a matter of " dog eat dog , anyway . " There is the radical socialist , 1. indau , who is mortally wounded in a picketing brawl . There are Conrad Dryfoos and Margaret Vance , who forego the luxury of t heir homes for social service in the tenements . There is the temperamental artist , Angus Beaton , who thinks of the strike only as an inconvenience to his comfort ; the newspaperman , Fulkerson , who enjoys the excitement with the gusto of a true gossip . Above all , there is Basil March , who , acting as Howells 's spokesman , denounces competitive exercise of the ballot . The impression made by A Hazard of New Fortunes is , how-  | ever , not as radical as the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's realism , honest though it was , was not adequate to portray either his own deep earnestness , or the crude energies of industrial warfare . The proletariat , with whom Howells sympathized , never emerge as living characters in his fiction , but are , at best , represented by humanitarian spokesmen from among the patricians or bourgeoisie . Nor is the decorous gentility of Howells 's manner ever ruffled by even the rudest gusts of industrial strife . In short , though Howells perceived large areas of raw , undisciplined , but energetic urban life , he was either unable or unwilling to transcribe them ; so that he remains essentially a realist of the drawing room , in whose work the intelligent observation of the commonplace must compensate as best it can for the want of the broadest range and of ultimate power . THE CASE FOR REALISM . To recognize Howells 's limitations , however , need not lessen the reader 's respect for his solid achievement . With reference to his time , both his theory and practice in fiction were novel to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far without making out a case for the realism which he practiced . As a critic , he became a special pleader in the cause of realism . Realism he defined as " nothing more nor less than the truthful treatment of material " ; and he would have a novel judged primarily by the standards of simplicity , naturalness , and honesty . Truthfulness , he holds , demands that the novelist be concerned with the commonplace rather than the extraordinary ; that he abandon the " moving accident , " front the everyday world , and " catch the charm of its work-worn , careworn , brave , kindly face . " The realist in America , Howells furthermore holds , should be as American as he unconsciously can ; and , since America has not yet experienced the profound social sufferings of overpopulated Europe , truthfulness does not demand of him the depressing realism of a Zola or Dostoievsky . Truthfulness and a quest for what is proportionately representative do demand that the novelist avoid giving undue attention to indecency , or to illicit love , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It demands , moreover , that the novelist be interested in portraying human nature rather than in rehashing the timeworn , conventional , often repeated plots . " The novelist 's main business is to possess his reader with a due conception of his characters and the situations in which they find themselves . If he does more or less than this he equally fails . " And in the portrayal of character , the novelist  | should work with complete objectivity , never interposing his own personality between his characters and his readers . In the creation of a taste for realism , Howells wielded an appreciable , though slowly fructifying , influence . Through his own practice in the novel , through volumes such as Criticism and Fiction ( 1891 ) , and through essays and book reviews in three leading magazines , he helped awaken a sympathetic interest in the explorations of reality made by the novelists of two continents . One of the few liberals who are glad for others to go beyond them in liberalism , he spoke out again and again in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were being denounced for the practice of a realism more daring and less genteel than Howells 's own . Though he was not so much concerned as James with niceties of technique , it is not too much to say that he raised appreciably the American understanding of the novel as an art form . It is not too much to say , with Carl Van Doren , that his influence as editor and critic was so extensive that he " amounts almost to a literary movement " in himself . III . Humanitarian Protest : Hamlin Garland ( 186o-1940 ) EARLY LIFE AND INFLUENCES . In the early nineties , Howells , ready as usual to stand sponsor for a promising realist of dubious popularity , called the attention of his public to a volume of short stories produced by a young Westerner , Hamlin Garland . Recognizing the earnest social purpose that underlay Garland 's work in Main-Travelled Roads , Howells expressed the hope that the young artist would not be lost in the propagandist . This hope , as it proved , was not altogether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main-Travelled Roads , American realism had already entered a new phase , and had conquered for our literature a new area of life . Had Garland not become a crusader for social justice , his biography would read like a typical success story . He was born into a Midwestern farming family , originally from New England , which followed the successive advances of the frontier from Wisconsin to Iowa , from Iowa to the Dakotas . As a boy he plowed all day on the prairie , learned to read , write , and cipher in an old-fashioned elementary school , and attended an old-fashioned academy in a neighboring town . While a young man , he worked his way across the continent as a carpenter ; and , having carefully put by his sav-  | ings , he stopped in Boston with the intention of entering Harvard . Instead , his courage failing him , he settled down in a cheap room for a winter of intensive , self-directed reading . If by this method he missed the systematic training offered by a university , he at least discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Herbert Spencer , the deterministic literary historian Taine , and the American and European realists , particularly Howells . Not many years later he discovered , in person , the brilliant protagonist of economic reform , Henry George , and , in so doing , discovered also the most poignant vein of feeling that was ever to appear in his writings ? his passion for social justice . As Garland remained in Boston , he gradually made acquaintances , became a lecturer at a neighboring academy , and was in a fair way to develop as a free-lance critic and scholar . GARLAND 'S SHORT STORIES . Garland 's development as a creative author dates from a visit back to his Western home in 1887 . Separated from his farm life by his years in Boston , and on the verge of his discipleship to Henry George , he could not fail to view rural life in a new perspective . Studying the land from the windows of his train , he could not but acknowledge its beauty , but he revolted from the gracelessness of its homes : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the dens of wild animals . The lack of color , of charm in the lives of the people anguished me . I wondered why I had never before perceived the futility of woman 's life on a farm . I asked myself , " Why have these stern facts never been put into our literature as they have been used in Russia and in England ? Why has this land no storytellers like those who have made Massachusetts and New Hampshire illustrious ? " Back home in the Middle Border , he found no idyllic countryside , but a depressed , wrathful community suffering from economic forces which neither he nor they clearly understood ? the exhaustion of the frontier , the speculative exploitation of the public domain , and , above all , the world-wide eddies of production and consumption determined by the machine age . Indignant at the sufferings of his people , repelled by the squalid futility of their lives , Garland began at once to record his new interpretation of farm life in fiction . A few radical journals , chiefly the Arena , opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , together with others that were too radical even for the Arena , he later collected into the two volumes , Main-Travelled Roads ( 1881 ) and Prairie Folks ( 1893 ) .  | In these grim stories , American realism first escaped completely from the restraints of the genteel tradition , and for the first time faced with entire candor the sordid realities of the average American rural life . Here are no idyllic , Whittier-like reminiscenses of childhood , no roseate idealizations of rural virtue . Here , on the contrary , are pictures of unremitting struggle with a poverty and toil that break the body and dwarf the soul . In " Up the Coolly , " a prematurely aged man refuses to be released from the burdens of the farm , bitterly conscious that , within his cramping environment , his spiritual atrophy has already proceeded too far . In " A Branch Road , " a woman , who is being broken by the drudgery and spiritual ugliness of her home , abandons her husband for a finely considerate lover ? and the author nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the forgotten man ? and woman ? wearily carry on the burdens which it costs less to bear than to throw off . The two , man and wife , are photographed with merciless accuracy : The man thrust his dirty , naked feet into his huge boots , and , without washing his face or combing his hair , went out to the barn to do his chores ... . No grace had come or ever could come into his life . Back of him were generations of men like himself , whose main business had been to work hard , live miserably , and beget children to take their places when they died ... . Lucretia Burns had never been handsome , even in her days of early girlhood , and now she was middle-aged , distorted with work and childbearing , and looking faded and worn as one of the boulders that lay beside the pasture fence ... . She rose from the cow 's side at last , and taking her pails of foaming milk , staggered toward the gate . The two pails hung from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy ground , her greasy and faded calico dress showed her tired and swollen ankles , and the mosquitoes swarmed mercilessly on her neck and bedded themselves in her colorless hair . Garland 's pages , in short , do not make agreeable parlor entertainment ; but they make immensely significant reading . In t hem our realism began its exploration of those ruder , cruder , and even repulsive phases of life which make up such a regrettably large proportion of the human story . Such literature does not , of course , give pleasure in the ordinary sense of that word . ' 1'Ihe motive of the authors and readers may be scientific curiosity ; or it may be ? and in Garland 's case chiefly was ? the humanitarian  | spirit . By portraying the sufferings of victims of society , Garland would protest against social injustice and awaken the public to the need of reform . Vigorous and historically important as Garland 's stories are , it is doubtful whether , in more than one , he successfully combines propaganda and art . That one story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic tract , " Under the Lion 's Paw " dramatizes Henry George 's teaching that exploitive , speculative holdings in land are the principal cause of economic suffering . Haskins , a tenant farmer , works like a fiend to improve the rented farm he hopes to buy from a land speculator , only to be charged for his own improvements and to be forced to sign a mortgage reducing him to virtual slavery . As a piece of art , the story dramatizes a theme of universal interest ? the struggle to " get ahead " ? and dramatizes it so successfully that it leaves with the reader , as does all worthy literature , the enrichment of a vivid and significant experience . The career so decisively begun in Main-Travelled Roads was not so decisively prosecuted . More than any contemporary author of equal promise , Garland came to suffer from indirection . He could never quite decide whether he was reformer , radical critic , objective realist , biographer , or local colorist of the Rockies . As a reformer , he wrote a vigorous piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic , the plea for originality and truthfulness in Crumbling Idols ( 1894 ) ; as an objective realist , Rose of butcher 's Coolly ( 1895 ) ; as a biographer , Ulysses Grant , His Life and Character ( 1898 ) ; and as . a local colorist , the vivid romance entitled Hesper ( 1903 ) . Meanwhile , being none the less a warmhearted , agreeable person for all the grimness of his stories , he was making the acquaintance of everyone worth knowing in literary America and England ? Howells , Clemens , Stephen Crane , Henry Adams , Theodore Roosevelt , Henry James , and numerous others ? with many of whom he formed lasting ties . Nevertheless , not for twenty-five years after his first brilliant period did imagination , absolute knowledge , deep feeling , and sinewy style again unite to produce a work of lasting merit . AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND REMINISCENCE . Such a fusion did occur , however , in A Son of the Middle Border ( 1917 ) , an autobiography relating Garland 's life through his first literary period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than the record of an era in American history . The Garlands , in their series of removes westward , are a type of the rural family of the Middle West , advancing in the wake of the frontier t0 Iowa and the  | Dakotas . The author himself , in his passage from a rural boyhood on the prairie to a manhood in Chicago , typifies the passage of America from an agrarian nation , with an open frontier , into a huge beehive of industrialism . Here in Garland 's autobiography , too , are the stormy class conflicts which attended this transition . With one hand the story grips the agrarian revolt , as it expressed itself in the Farmers ' Alliance , the free-silver agitation , and populism . With the other , it encloses the awakening of the national conscience to the wretchedness of the slums , as it reflects the antipoverty crusade of the eighties and nineties , and the single-tax program of Henry George . The materials of the book are in large part those of Main-Travelled Roads and Prairie Folks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mellow light of historical perspective . Because of its controlled artistry , but still more because of it sheer opulence in typically American life , A Son of the Middle Border is already securely established as a national classic . The same universality of interest does not attach to Garland 's later autobiographical works ? A Daughter of the Middle Border ( 1921 ) , Roadside Meetings ( 1930 ) , Companions on the Trail ( 1931 ) , and others ? in all of which Garland relates genially his innumerable contacts with American and British personages . These books , recording as they do the literary milieu of Garland 's generation , will probably maintain an interest only for the special student or amateur of that period , not for the general reader . So far as our literature in general is concerned , Garland remains of importance as the historian of the Middle Border , recording in artistic prose one of the great eras of American development ; and as the young rebel of the early nineties , breaking with crude , powerful assault the hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Modern Temper I. Precursors of the Naturalistic Revolt : Crane , Norris , and London THE PERSISTENCE OF ROMANTIC TASTE . Notwithstanding Howells 's intelligent pleading in the cause of realism , the taste of the American public long continued to demand the customary romantic fiction . As late as 1893 , David Copperfield and Ivanhoe were the two most widely read novels in America , and General Lew Wallace 's rococo romance , The Prince of India , was being received with enthusiasm. * Nevertheless , this pretentious romanticism , when seen in historical perspective , appears less important than the work of three young radicals whose earliest writings were almost unnoticed . Stephen Crane , Frank Norris , and Jack London had to fight sturdily to overcome popular neglect ; and in the course of their struggle they laid the groundwork for twentieth-century types of realism that differed radically from their nineteenth-century forerunners . Instead of becoming novelists of comedy and ethical problems , like Howells , or of humanitarian protest , like Garland , these young men became naturalists , comparable to Theodore Dreiser . THE MEANING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter nineteenth century , is a by-product of the scientific spirit . One of its motives is a scientific curiosity about human nature in all phases , pleasant and unpleasant . The naturalist applies to human life , moreover , the concept of scientific materialism . To him , man is not a complex intelligence , controlling his destiny by free will . Man is , on the contrary , a machine controlled either by the inner constraints of instinct and passion , or by the outer constraints of environment and circumstance . From footnote * Herbert Edwards , " Howells and the Controversy over Realism in America , " American Literature , III , 237-248 ( November , 1931 ) .  | this point of view , human life appears to be only a part of the automatic processes of the physical universe . The consistent naturalist is , therefore , a determinist , who holds that men 's deeds are commonly conditioned by physical factors beyond their control . In a philosophy which so reduces the action of free will , t here can hardly be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into perspective as parts of the uncontrollable processes of the cosmos . And as naturalism opposes the ideas of free will and moral self-control , so it opposes those ideals of gentility which had so long dominated American letters . If the naturalist is to render man faithfully , he must study man not only in the pulpit and drawing room , but in the sweatshop or the brothel or the stud-filled trenches of war ? areas of life whither the genteel hovel dared not venture . Scientific materialism , in the new milieu of the machine age , would probably have produced a naturalistic movement in America quite apart from the influence of foreign literatures . As it was , however , American naturalists had before them constantly the example of English and Russian and French naturalists ? particularly Emile Zola , whose influence is written large over the rising school of American radicals . And as the name of Zola had long been anathema to American gentility , so , for a while , were the names of his American followers . Naturalism was , in truth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled culture in the United States ; and , as its exponents became aggressive , their writings took on the character of a literary revolt . STEPHEN CRANE ( 1871-1900 ) . Stephen Crane , a young New York reporter of Bohemian disposition , was the pioneer American naturalist , and his short novel Maggie ( privately printed , 1893 ; published , 1886 ) is our first important piece of naturalistic fiction . Crane 's heroine , Maggie , a slum girl who is potentially beautiful and pure , is unable to cope with the brutality of her environment . She is spiritually calloused by the deadening work of a sweatshop , escapes it by becoming the mistress of a bartender , loses him , becomes a prostitute , and finally takes refuge in suicide . When Crane offered this naturalistic tragedy to magazines and publishers in 1892 , every door was closed against it ; so that it was not until 1896 , after his success in The Red Badge of Courage , that Maggie could be published . Clearly , the hostile neglect with which Maggie was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illicit passion , which had been inoffensively treated by Hawthorne , nor to his revelation of the squalor of the  | slums , in which he had been anticipated by a dozen social workers . Crane offended rather by his failure to assume any moral point of view with reference to the stupid brutalities he depicted , as well as by his insistence that readers should face unpleasant facts instead of lulling themselves with romantic dreams . Yet had the case against Maggie rested on the book 's intrinsic worth , instead of its violation of convention , it might have been a good one ; for , after all , Maggie is by no means a great novel . It is important chiefly as a landmark in the rise of American naturalism The Red Badge of Courage ( 1895 ) remains of more than merely historical importance . Here Crane applied to a familiar area of fiction ? the Civil War ? the unfamiliar methods of naturalism , combined with a still more novel impressionism . The novel carries the reader from the beginning to the close of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of a young Northern private , Henry Fleming . The highly unified point of view is maintained as rigorously as in any novel of Henry James . The reader knows the battle only as Henry Fleming knows it . With Fleming , he goes on marches whose purpose he can not understand , fires at enemies he can not see , watches the gory slaughter about him , hears the din of cheers and cannonades , and finally marches off without knowing whether his army has lost or won . The Red Badge of Courage , in short , thoroughly debunks the picture of war offered by the chivalric romancers ; and , what is more , it offers an experience that is sufficiently valuable and authentic in its own right to establish the book as a minor classic among intelligent readers . Such authenticity as the Red Badge possesses is not , of course , the result of Crane 's personal experiences , for when he wrote the book he had never smelled powder . But he had the accounts of veterans to go by ; he had excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Debacle ; and he had , above all , an imagination which rendered scene after scene with the most vivid intensity . Crane 's later prose is not equal to his earlier . Having become a war correspondent , he too often allowed his writings to lapse into journalism . He wrote numerous short stories , of which " The Open Boat " ( 1898 ) , a brilliantly impressionistic tale of sea adventure , is deservedly the most popular . In the meantime , he had transferred his literary pioneering from prose to poetry . Through Garland and Howells , he had been brought into contact with the poems of Emily Dickinson ; and these poems , together with Whitman 's , may have prompted him to his break with poetic con-  | vention . In the volumes Black Riders ( 1895 ) and War Is Kind ( 1899 ) he discards the usual metrical forms . Like Whitman , he employs free verse ; but his lines , instead of reflecting Whitman 's sonorous periods , are tuned to a brevity and point comparable to Emily Dickinson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crane took up with gusto the task of deflating the accepted American mores . " War is Kind , " in its ' unheroic , ironic treatment of battle , is the poetic counterpart of The Red Badge of Courage . And in Crane 's poetry , as in his prose , the dominant ideas are those of naturalism . His rendering of lire is shaped by the bewildered bitterness of a youth who feels himself a part of huge impersonal forces whose tendencies no ' Inman will can control , no human mind understand . Both his poetry and his fiction must be acknowledged , if measured in terms of actual achievement , to be disappointingly thin . But Crane is less memorable as a producer than as a pioneer , a trail blazer for the " New Poetry " and the naturalistic fiction of the twentieth century . " Modern American fiction , " according to the an Dorens , " may be said to begin with Stephen Crane . " FRANK NORRIS ( 1870-1902 ) . Frank Norris , in comparison with Lane , completed a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pioneer naturalist . Norris 's background as only dubiously favorable to the development of a literary di ( al . He came of a well-to-do family of Chicago and San Frano . He attended the University of California , studied art in iris , remained a year in graduate study at Harvard , and finally scovered his true profession of journalism on the staff of the n Francisco Wave . That he became a naturalist is owing largeto his acquaintance with the works of Zola ; at one period , acrding to his brother , he was never without a novel of Zola in his ml . While at Harvard , he began , under Zola 's influence , two turalistic novels : Vandover and the Brute ( unfinished ; pubhed 1914 ) and McTeague ( finally completed , and published in 9 ) . Yet it was not , after all , the authentically scientific naturalof Zola that attracted Norris ; it was rather Zola 's largeness , fondness for " strong " situations and violent action . Hence orris was being constantly led away from naturalism into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' dish restraints of the age , exploited the adventures and the mental emotions of " red-blooded " characters . Norris 's most severely naturalistic study is the grim novel , c /'vague . The very setting of the somber story is dully monotoa , composed as it is of the drab bystreet section of a large city .  | The principal characters ? an unlicensed dentist , McTeague , and his wife , Trina ? are of the unintelligent , potentially passionate type so often employed in the naturalistic novel . Both setting and characters are therefore suited to a deterministic study , showing how the lives of McTeague and Trina are governed by economic pressure from without , and by the interplay of desire , hate , and avarice from within . Though Norris occasionally uses a romantic symbolism and the romantic device of contrast , McTeague is for the most part severely naturalistic . The author 's determinism , his unconcern over the moral bearings of evil , and his concern over the sordid lives outside the pale of literary gentility ? all these traits designate McTeague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Norris 's love of breadth and virility led him to work on broader canvases . He was ambitious to execute , like Zola , a " big " theme , volumes in length , continental in scope , in which he might draw conclusions from " a whole congeries of forces , social development , race impulses , " and devote himself " not to the study of men but of man . " He planned , accordingly , a trilogy of novels which should deal respectively with production , distribution , and consumption in an industry of continental importance ? wheat . Of the three projected novels , Norris lived to complete only two : The Octopus ( Igor ) and The Pit ( 1903 ) . Norris chose for The Octopus a subject which led him far from the conventional situations of genteel fiction , and close to the storm and stress of the elemental struggle for existence . The plot hinges on the fight between a group of California ranchers and the " Octopus " ? the " Pacific and Southwestern Railroad " ? for the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigness , the story condenses virtually the entire economic experience of its generation . Here is reflected the wasteful distribution of the public lands , which had been parceled out wholesale to speculators , individual and corporate . Here is reflected the struggle of the middle classes to control the corrupt practices of unregulated railroads ; here is also the fright with which these same classes viewed the rapid growth of monopolies . And about this central story of the ranchers ' fight with the railroad , a dozen minor episodes revolve . A complete story in itself might be made of the disintegration of Magnus Derrick , or the development of Annixter through love , or the desperate criminality of Dyke , or the destruction of the Hooven family , or the mysticism of the shepherd , Vanamee . For sheer richness of abundant life , The Octopus deserves to be ranked among the great American novels . Yet not , if all things are considered , among the greatest . From  | the small company of masterpieces of fiction , Norris 's opulent work is shut out by three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions of determinism and moral order , and thus loses the concentrated force of either viewpoint , taken singly . Second , his style lacks the concentration of the greatest art ; volubility is substituted for economy . And , deepest of all , Norris lacks the imagination of the greatest creators , so that he depends too often on mere intensity , on vehemence , rather than on controlled power . The Pit , though belonging to the same trilogy as The Octopus , is built on a quite different plan . The action , instead of being expanded to epic breadth , is limited to a single plot and a small group of characters . Within its narrower limits , however , The Pit is equally successful in the painting of the American scene . Curtis Jadwin 's near-tragic absorption in the impossible task of cornering wheat is the vehicle for dozens of authentic pictures of ( icago ? such as of the stormy traffickings at the Board of Trade ? and for unforgettable etchings of character , such as that of the rimed speculator , Hargus . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it possesses unquestionable power in the enduring fundamentals of the novel ? in clear-cut characterization ; in the dramatic , lifelike interplay of character with character ; and in taut , sometimes breathless , suspense . More sensational , more gripping than the stories of Howells or Garland , The Pit appealed to a large body of readers and become one of the earliest popular triumphs of American realism . By the more critically minded , both the book and its author have been looked on with more reserve . Yet it can hardly be disputed that , among all the young pioneers of the nineties , Norris was the most richly endowed in the proper gifts of the novelist . More convincingly than either Crane or London , he succeeds in showing us an actual , substantial world in which actual , credible people live according to credible motives . JACK LONDON ( 1876-1916 ) . Much the same factors that created the naturalistic revolt in Crane and Norris , shaped it also in the more compellingly energetic personality of Jack London . London was , more outspokenly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Darwin and Huxley and Spencer his interpretation of life as a process of evolution governed by the struggle for survival . Equally with Crane and Norris , he was in revolt against the tradition of gentility which had so long dominated American letters , but he went beyond them in i ( belling also against the social class which had sponsored that  | tradition . Though he belonged by birth to the bourgeoisie , he allied himself early with the proletariat , accepted the Marxian interpretation of society as a class struggle , and predicted a socialist revolution . Even more than Norris , however , London was distracted from true naturalism by his love of vigorous action . Intellectually , he might accept the scientific outlook ; temperamentally , he inclined to " red-blooded " stories and a " storm and stress " romanticism . If he was a materialistic proletarian , he was also , in a manner , a frontiersman , whose adventurous life equipped him with much of his material for fiction . He had been first a newspaper boy in Oakland , California ; later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Prince of the Oyster Pirates , " a gang of young ruffians who operated in and about San Francisco Bay . When eighteen years old , he shipped on a sealing voyage , which took him into the Pacific as far as Japan and the Bering Sea . Returning , he drifted from job to job until , disgusted with overwork , he became a tramp , " riding the rods " East , shivering houseless in city parks , and serving prison terms for vagrancy . Thoroughly frightened by this close-up view of the social shambles , London resolved to escape the social pit by working with brain instead of brawn . By Herculean cramming he prepared himself to enter the University of California , only to find the classes too slow-paced to suit his consuming energy . Withdrawing from the University , he was off to the Klondike during the gold rush . He returned with no wealth , indeed , but with an intimate knowledge of the frontier locale in which his first successes in fiction were to be won . From childhood London had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with unflagging , dynamic energy , to the task of becoming an author . In 1900 his first volume , a group of Alaskan adventure stories , was published . In 1903 appeared his masterpiece , The Call of the Wild , in which he illustrated , in an Alaskan setting , the biological trait of atavism ? that is , the reappearance in an animal of the instincts and habits of its remote ancestors . The civilized dog , Buck , after being stolen from a luxurious home in southern California , is sent to the savage environment of the Far North , there to struggle for survival under the law of club and fang . As Buck fights his way to leadership among the sleigh-dogs , wild , predatory traits of his ancestors , always latent within him , are awakened ; and when his master , John Thornton , is killed , he abandons the last trace of human civilization to become the leader of a wolf pack . Such a primitive story , in the atmosphere of decadence and  | over-civilization which enveloped the turn-of-the-century years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page after page , as they found , is filled with genuine adventure ? Perrault and Francois struggling over all but impossible trails , Buck and Spitz battling to the death for leadership , John Thornton being rescued from the rapids . Page after page throbs with responsiveness to the pale , savage beauty of the Far North ? snow trails and frozen lakes , swift rivers , forests of fir , long nights with the aurora borealis flashing coldly across the sky . And on page after page , London 's vision of beauty and of brutal adventure forms itself into a strong , rhythmical , semi-poetic style which more than anything else lifts The Call of the Wild from the level of mere entertainment to that of true literature . The philosophy of The Call of the Wild consists in a glorification of sheer strength and cunning . London 's hero is ? insofar as human traits can be attributed to a dog ? a savage individualist , exulting with the strength of the strong in the struggle for existence , fighting his way to mastery with the ruthlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctive sympathy with these traits in human nature . Recurrently , he tended to set up as his ideal a Nietzschean superman who , moved by a resistless will-to-power , mastered his fellows by sheer brute force . But this brutal individualism was only one of several curruts in London 's thinking . His controlling ideas were someImes not individualistic , but collective . If he knew the conhcsions of Darwin , he knew also those of Karl Marx , who rercled society as a struggle not among individuals , but between lasses , in which the proletariat was finally to be victorious . In to c ornmon aims of his adopted class , London could often sucsslcclly merge his individual ends . He became an active socialist itator and propagandist , lecturing from the platform , exposing e degradation of the slums in The People of the Abyss ( 1903 ) , ( 1 preaching the dogma of class conflict in The War of the lasses ( 1905 ) . Moreover , in spite of his scientific materialism , talon recognized the part played in human nature by idealism d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put it , " of ' twilling finer and God-like . " Inclining thus to collectivism , en to altruism , yet never quite able to reconcile his inner dew , London projected his dilemma into problem novels in Inch the individualistic superman , though sympathetically aced , is finally consigned to defeat . ( ) I ' these problem novels , the best known , though emphatically t the best , is The Sea Wolf ( 1904 ) , a curious hodgepodge of  | adventure , philosophy , and plain hokum , in which the Nietzschean materialist , Wolf Larsen , finally proves to be less of a man than the overcivilized idealist , Van Weyden . Similar in theme , but stronger in execution , is Martin Eden ( 1909 ) . Here the hero is , in many ways , a prototype of the youthful Jack London . A sailor and common laborer , Martin Eden tries , as London had tried , to break into the charmed circle of authorship . Like London , he is moved by a consuming intellectual curiosity ; like London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like London , he is for a while the most rejected author in America ; and , like London , he comes while conscious of his growing powers of intellect to despise the bourgeoisie who neglect him . Eden 's great literary " strike , " which nets him a hundred thousand dollars within a few months , differs from London 's only in its greater concentration in time . Martin Eden , in short , wins his way to fame and wealth as a Nietzschean individualist like the youthful London or London 's hero Buck , battering down all obstacles and by sheer energy fighting his way to mastery in his chosen field . But no sooner has Eden gathered the fruits of success than they begin to turn to ashes . By too intense living he has exhausted the will-to-live . His magnificent body and brain become flaccid . He can neither read , nor love , nor even remain alert ; and , after a last effort to escape his lethargy by a voyage to the South Sea Islands , he voluntarily gives up to the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the age of thirty , the superman is dead , a victim of his own intensity . Whether accepting or rejecting the ideal of the superman , London is equally far from the beaten paths of nineteenth-century authorship . Into a literature dominated for a century by standards of genteel refinement , he brought the raw brutality of the primitive struggle for existence . In a literature written by and for the bourgeoisie , he sounded the battle cry of the proletariat . In a literature devoted to a spiritual interpretation of man 's experience , he reemphasized the physical basis of life and appealed , with a vigor as fresh as that of an ocean gale , to man 's primitive love of adventurous action . In his weaker passages , London is , it must be admitted , little better than the authors of the popular school of red-blooded fiction who derive from him . At his best , however , he is of value for his immense , driving energy , for his intelligent concern over social evils , for his ability to convey the thrill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauties of primitive landscape .  | II . The Loss of Certainty : Henry Adams ( 1838-1918 ) ADAMS 'S LIFE AND LITERARY PLANS . In its march from the nineteenth century into the twentieth , American literature was not confined to a single road . If one route led through the boisterous naturalism of Crane , Norris , and London , another led through the skepticism of the aging historian , Henry Adams . As a skeptical philosopher , Adams united the broadest observation of life with the most complete inability to discover any intelligible plan in human existence . A native New Englander , grandson of one president and great-grandson of another , graduate of I larvard , student in the University of Berlin , he developed early into a student of affairs and man of the world . While his father served as our minister to England during the trying years of the Civil War , Adams , as private secretary at the legation , observed from the inside the workings of diplomacy . Later , as a journalistic free lance at Washington , he observed the debacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of history at larvard , he came to know intimately a historical period that afforded the most suggestive contrasts with his own ? the Middle Ages . Having resigned his professorship , he lived in Washington , studying American history , writing or helping write the anonymous novel Democracy ( 1880 ) , and meeting everybody of any political or diplomatic importance at the capital . Never a tourist , he yet managed to see a surprising amount of the globe ? the Far West , Mexico , and the South Seas ; Germany , the Scandinavian nations , and Russia ; the Mediterranean countries almost en masse ; and especially England and France , where he was as much at home as in Washington . Yet , travel and observe as he might , Adams could nowhere discover any coherent meaning in the myriad crosscurrents of modern life . Still seeking some intelligible direction or development in history , he turned back to an age and place which , he thought , had possessed a civilization as unified as that of the modern world was diverse . This older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two centuries between 1050 and 1250 . Its bond of unity had been the Catholic worship of the Virgin Mary ; its chief expression , the great cathedrals ,  | such as those of Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres . Contrasting these two centuries with his own , Adams resolved to write two books which , taken together , would help to gauge the movement of history from the thirteenth century to the twentieth . The first was to be known as Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres : a Study of Thirteenth Century Unity ; the second , as The Education of Henry Adams : a Study of Twentieth Century Multiplicity . The first was privately printed in 1904 and published in 1913 ; the second was privately printed in 1906 and was published in the year of the author 's death , 1918 . ADAMS AND THE AGE OF UNITY . Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres is , on the surface , a series of descriptions and art criticisms , in which the author tries to render into words the elusive meanings of medieval religious architecture . To Adams 's mind , as to John Ruskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather an organic product of the whole life of a people . Medieval art thus afforded an avenue of approach to the study of the entire age ? an age of simple , creative faith , dominated by the luminous figure of the Virgin . For the Virgin was then the central object of man 's adoration . To her medieval worshippers she was loveliness ; she was beauty ; she was , above all else , a universal sympathy in which even the most wayward and lawless could repose with confidence . To Adams , she was , besides all this , a mystical Force which , even more than the Christian belief in the Trinity , had for two centuries fused the minds of men into a unified faith . No such unity , no such creative faith expressing itself in beautiful forms , had since been known . Confused by the uncertainties of his own time , Adams portrayed the Age of Unity with a wistful nostalgia , a tender longing , which gives to Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres one of its principal charms . ADAMS AND THE AGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages somewhat wistfully , he faced his own chaotic era with a world-weary skepticism . His autobiography , The Education of Henry Adams , reduces itself ( so far as its principal theme is concerned ) to a series of object lessons in the meaninglessness of life . The religious spirit , as a force capable of effectively shaping experience , quietly expired within him before he reached manhood . Whatever belief he had retained in a beneficent God , or a beneficent Nature , did not survive the peculiarly tragic death of his sister in 1870 . His observations of the most powerful group of statesmen in the world ? Palmerston and Russell and Gladstone ? did not convince him that any of these men knew what they were doing , or why they were doing it . Biological  | evolution , which gave a kind of faith to so many of Adams 's contemporaries , gave no faith to him . Where others saw the links in the chain of development , Adams saw the gaps . Not without far mute evidence could he accept " Evolution that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selection that did not select . " Such evolution as he could admit was only " change of form broken by freaks of force , and warped at times by attractions affecting intelligence , twisted and tortured at other times by sheer violence , cosmic , chemical , solar , supersensual , electrolytic ? who knew what ? ? defying science , if not defying known law . " Psychology , meanwhile , opened to him an equally dark , purposeless world within the human mind ? the world of the subconscious which , when conscious thought is suspended during sleep , assumes such chaotic expression in dreams . Atrophied toward religion , unable to find any continuity in history or politics , not onvinced of any systematic evolution , suspicious of the mind itself , Adams finished his education in the belief that the universe , man included , was formless , uncontrolled , and unintelligible . " Chaos was the law of nature ; Order was the dream of ratan . " SUGGESTIONS TOWARD CRITICISM . Yet Adams 's conviction of the formlessness of life did not prevent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American of his era wrought in a style so subtly suggestive , so sensitive to nuances , so full of impressive reserves . Possibly no other , Mark Twain excepted , expressed himself with such marked individuality , with such baffling cynicism , with words so richly flavored . His characterizations of Grant , Sumner , and others have therefore a value apart from their dubious accuracy , a value that belongs less to history than to creative literature . His descriptions of the I . ow Countries , of the Italian summer , and of Russia belong with the most delicate impressionism , in which mellow and burnished colorings are elusively shaded and fused . Considered as a thinker , Adams is open to the charge that he pictured the world too much in the image of his own mind ; that his own mental habit of negation , and not any essential formlessness in society at large , was the source of his devastating skepticism . These objections , however , must not obscure the fact that to many people , in a confused age beaten upon by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophet . They must not obscure the fact that , in the closing chapters of the Education , American thought moved definitely from the nineteenth century into the twentieth . The naturalist , Jack London ,  | still lived with Herbert Spencer in the nineteenth-century world of " matter . " The skeptic , Henry Adams , moved forward into a world where the emphasis of science had shifted from matter to motion and force . Mysterious , inconceivable Force ! ? whether embodied in the electric dynamo or in the compelling power of the medieval Virgin . How , or whether , such force could be given intelligent direction , the skeptical Adams could not say , but his loss of certainty opened for American thought the door of the confused twentieth century .  | The Early Twentieth Century THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PAST . The clear quiet dawn of the twentieth century in America gave hardly a hint of the storms of conflict and change ? political , ideological , and literary ? that were soon to break over the land . From the faintly heard noises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas , " trot even William Vaughn Moody drew any omens of the internationalism that was to launch the United States through two cataclysmic wars upon its world career . Domestic affairs , not foreign , dwelt in the forefront of the public consciousness ; and in spite of the menace of the trusts and the obduracy of the railways those affairs were not too much in disorder . The American compound of democracy and capitalism appeared more stable than it had in the depression-ridden early nineties . Through their literature of exposure and agitation , the Muckrakers , so ailed by Theodore Roosevelt , were soon vigorously revealing evils and promoting reforms ; and their very preoccupation with specific abuses could be taken as proof of their confidence in the general soundness of the republic . Until the time of the nation 's plunge into the first world war , the influence of democratic and " progressive " principles increased ; and the first administration of Woodrow Wilson , through a series of measures designed to spread the tax burden and to curtail inequities in industry , " brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reformers . " That the tradition of democratically slanted reform should have persisted into the twentieth century , that it should even have grown in strength , was symptomatic . For not in the area of Politics only , but in a hundred others , the American past lived on into the present . Storms of change , however violent , could not wholly deflect the ocean-deep currents of the nation 's inherited footnote * Spiller , Robert , et al. , A Literary History of the United States , p. ini5.  | folkways . Sociologically , the nation remained preponderantly middle-class , and therefore committed to the ends of comfort and stability . Religiously , it remained in considerable measure evangelical ; the powerful Methodist , Baptist , and Presbyterian groups maintained or enlarged their influence . If many believers , calling themselves Modernists , rejected the evangelical theology , they still retained most of the evangelical ethic . Meanwhile others , calling themselves Fundamentalists , rallied to the established orthodoxies and even , in some cases , made of the State an instrument in their controversial cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past exerted far more influence than did the winds of change which agitated our literature . As the English Puritan still said his prayers while the light-hearted wits of the Restoration kept revel , so millions of Americans , while ancient literary landmarks were dissolving , methodically cast their ballots , paid installments on their homes , read their newspapers , and sat respectfully through innumerable old-fashioned sermons . Just as many of the older cultural habits persisted , so the realistic and romantic moods continued to express themselves in forms not too different from those of the preceding era . Robert Frost , Willa Cather , Theodore Dreiser , Carl Sandburg ? these and numerous others painted more fully than any previous generation the actualities of the American scene . Yet twentiethcentury realism , instead of replacing romanticism , merely accompanied and complemented it , so that often , when in superficial appearance a work was realistic , in underlying temper it was romantic . Most of the main currents of romantic interest ? expansiveness and individualism , the enjoyment of a picturesque past , the return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nineteenth , changing at times in form , but remaining in essence the same . Recent literature is therefore neither mainly realistic nor mainly romantic ; it is , rather , eclectic , the outcome of choice among many moods and points of view . In fact , the very sophistication of recent writers in their choice of either realism or romanticism has tended to drain those two terms of critical significance . With reference to recent writings , they give on no vistas of historical continuity . The dominant patterns of twentieth-century writing are visible only through other windows ? the windows opened by a knowledge of our writers ' swiftly changing views of the nature of the cosmos and the nature of man . For out of certain revolutionary views of man and man 's place in the universe has grown that intangi-  | ble thing called the modern temper , within which modern literature lives as within an enveloping atmosphere . " SCIENTIFIC " THOUGHT AND THE NATURAL MAN . Though evoked by science , the ideology which so profoundly changed our literature was not in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unintended by-products if science , of the attitudes toward human nature , of the halftruths and even the perversions of science that moved fluid as clouds within the modern consciousness . Scientific investigation proper was , to be sure , expanding as if by geometrical progression . Research , which had once been the task only of the occasional gifted individual , was now often enough the cooperative work of university and hospital staffs , of great business corporations and of wealthy foundations . Tangible results , such as the stamping-out of yellow fever , were so impressive as to spur on the transfer of scientific method from the natural sciences proper into other fields of knowledge : into psychology and education , into ecnomics and sociology and anthropology , and into both general and literary history . Knowledge of scientific or quasi-scientific method became thereby the property of many minds not primarily concerned with the natural sciences , and that knowledge helped spread the influence of those over-simple and curiously dynamic ideas which science evoked in the popular mind . Among the most dynamic of such ideas are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose literary expression and counterpart is naturalism. * Stated in absolute terms , the monistic premises of naturalism are ( I ) that the universe we inhabit consists only of matter , and ( 2 ) that humanity is wholly a part of that material universe , nothing more . These materialistic premises , notwithstanding the fact that few writers would have stated their philosophy in terms so absolute , undergird like a foundation a large part of twentieth-century literature . Increasingly , for a generation , authors consciously or unconsciously built upon them , undeterred by many a fact that might well have made for caution . For modern writers were only imperfectly aware that Lucretius and others had long ago made trial of a materialistic philosophy ; they did not usually observe that the concept of nature as a machine , far from being scientific fact , is itself a metaphor elaborated by the eighteenthcentury imagination . Nor were the literary naturalists fully aware that scientific thought had already outgrown their over- footnote * See above , pp. 28o-8i , the definition of naturalism with reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple conception of the cosmos ; that in the work of Einstein and Jeans and Eddington the interpretation of nature was couched not in the terms of mechanics but in those of pure mathematics ; that the universe , according to Jeans , had begun to look " more like a great thought than like a great machine . " The older mechanistic materialism remained therefore a major shaping force in literature ; and whatever its degree of truth it was an ideology charged with dramatic possibilities , with imaginative and emotional overtones . With a curious blend of self-pity and awe the human imagination responded to the picture of a lonely mankind spawned accidentally by a vast impersonal universe where " blind to good and evil , reckless of destruction , omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless way . " With a sense of melancholy grandeur the imagination received Haeckel 's interpretation of evolution as consisting not in progress , but in the unmeaning flux of objectless chance . With a perverse pleasure in the thrill of primitive combativeness it simplified the Darwinian struggle for survival into the mere exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the superman and the will to power . From Nietzsche , one tangent of dramatic imagining led to the jungle superman of Edgar Rice Burroughs ' phenomenally popular Tarzan of the Apes ( 1914 ) ; another , to the Hitlerian glorification of a super-race and the calculated atavism of Nazi policy . The concepts of a mechanistic nature and of the " natural " man were , in short , among those curiously fertile ideas that lend themselves to endless dramatization in literature ? and in life . Among the media through which scientific materialism impinged on literature were two schools of psychological thought , the Behaviorist and the Freudian . Man , the behaviorist can show , is in some measure an automaton ; and if some human reactions are automatic , it follows that all the rest may be . To the behaviorist , thinking is a process wholly mechanical , an automatic shunting of impressions and responses through an infinitely complex network of nerves . The behaviorist 's view of human nature is therefore deterministic ; it excludes any ideas of free will and deliberate moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects consciously or unconsciously the psychology of behaviorism , shows his characters not as thoughtfully controlling their own destinies , but as reacting blindly to stimuli from without and impulses from within . Freudian psychology , footnote * Russell , Bertrand , " A Free Man 's Religion . "  | like behaviorist , has as its foundation the assumptions of scientific materialism , but it has affected literature far more profoundly through its own special interests and hypotheses . In the Freudian theory that the moving force in human personality is the " unconscious , " in Freud 's emphasis on the pervasive power of sex , in Jung 's awareness of the " ego " and the " herd " instincts , writers came upon ideas that appeared to reveal a new depth , even a new dimension , in human nature . In the adventures of the Freudian impulse or " libido " ? whether its fate might be suppression , inhibition , diversion , sublimation , or happily direct expression ? authors discovered for their stories new resources of excitement and suspense . Eugene O'Neill 's Freudian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Freudian motifs in Winesburg , Ohio , are only two instances of an influence so far-reaching as to be quite beyond calculation . Recent American literature is only less Freudian than it is American . Whatever its particular expression ? behaviorist , Freudian , or other ? the naturalistic world-outlook led toward revolutionary changes in man 's view of his own nature , changes more radical , indeed , than had yet been known to Western civilization . The ancients , whether pagan or Christian , had commonly taken for granted the uniqueness of man and the distinctness of man 's place in nature ; the naturalist assumes the identity of man with the Nature of matter , force , and energy . Classical philosophy , in its concern with the ethical and rational man , and Christianity , in its concern with the ethical and spiritual man , are closer to one another than is either to twentieth-century naturalism , in its all but exclusive focus on the instinctive and automatic man . As naturalism advanced , therefore , the older concept of man as a rational , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of man as a mere bundle of instincts and emotions , a being illogical , driven , and often unpredictable . If this new picture of man brought to many sensitive minds only despair , it brought to others a buoyant sense of liberation . Those who felt cramped by middle-class moral codes could now throw aside those restraints , which were irrelevant in a world where only survival and self-expression mattered . They could join freely in the cheerful hedonism and the not unpleasing cynicism of the early twenties ; they could welcome the liberation of the body from the imprisonment of Victorian costume and could enjoy the apparently increasing sexual freedom of the times . They could join with cheerful energy in the overthrow p 300 of the genteel tradition and could help win for American writers an unprecedented freedom in subject-matter and vocabulary . Nevertheless , these new attitudes met with stubborn resistance , a resistance no less vigorous for the fact that the contending parties did not always realize how fundamental and far-reaching was their conflict . Continuing as it did throughout the early twentieth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical-Christian tradition deepened those feelings of insecurity which twentieth-century man must in any case have experienced . Unlike the writer of the high middle ages , whose values could remain stable in spite of the instability of human affairs , the writer in modern America has had to deal as he could with a society shaken by ideological conflict , with an intellectual milieu he was bound to feel as insecure , fluid , even dissolving . THE MUSE AND THE MACHINE AGE . Meanwhile the headlong rocketing surge of industrialism , far from relieving the spiritual insecurity of modern man , acted often as only another irritant . During the early twentieth century , the march of invention , already swift , was accelerated ; the airplane , the moving picture , the radio , and other devices trod one another 's heels with bewildering urgency . Inventions in the processes of manufacture , though less widely publicized , held an equally rapid pace , helping increase the annual output of manufactured goods fivefold from 1900 to 1925 , and replacing with machines more workers than the expanding motor factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march of the machine , the organization of industry grew increasingly huge , complex , and corporate . Mammoth steel companies , power trusts , banking affiliates , and chain stores arose , each governing a nationwide force of workers through a single central organization . The industrial cities , already huge by any previous human standards , mushroomed into all but unmanageable size . If even the wisest student of society could not forecast the future course of industrialism , one thing at least was clear ? the machine process had become the dominant force in American economics . The full impact of the Machine on twentieth-century writing has not been estimated , can indeed never be estimated , since it has been so tremendous . Even the direct , explicit treatment of capitalistic industrialism is itself too massive , too complex , and too recent to be accurately gauged . The literature of exposure written by muckrakers like David Graham Phillips , the thoughtful study of the big corporate organizer in Robert Herrick 's  | Memoirs of an American Citizen ( 1905 ) , the satirical attack on standardized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1922 ) , the absorption of the rhythm and energy of the Machine into the poetry of Hart Crane ? these are only four out of innumerable instances of the effort of authors to come to grips with industrialism . Yet the sum of all such efforts would fall far short of the total effect of the machine age upon American writings , so fully do those writings express the intangible moods of their times , and so deeply were those moods affected by the stresses of swift industrialization . Conspicuous among the moods caught by sensitive artists was a blending of insecurity , of tension , and a vaguely frightening sense of the superhuman energies freed by the Machine . Along with the clamor of locomotive and foundry came an impression of new-found resistless power , which was caught by architects in the dizzy lines of skyscrapers flung up above canyon streets . Meanwhile the drive toward bigger , swifter production was triggering a chain-reaction of social ? and emotional ? effects . It necessitated installment buying , high-pressure salesmanship , the grotesque burgeoning of advertising art , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case have been tense . And , as competitive production outstripped buying power , the industrial process plunged the country from time to time into economic depressions , which reached their disastrous climax in the economic collapse of 1929 and after . In view of the continued replacement of men by machines , the loss of the workman 's individuality amid an increasing corporateness , the spiralling acceleration and tension and the recurring depressions , it is hardly cause for wonder that the machine age should have called into being such pervasive feelings of lostness , of insecurity , and of human insignificance . Only less than the ideological conflicts evoked by naturalism , it contributed to the modern sense of living in a disconcertingly fluid world , where traditional values and the fixed landmarks of custom were alike dissolving . THE ART OF ALOGICALITY . The force of some powerful though subtle disintegration , which moved so pervasively amid the economic unsettlements and spiritual conflicts of modern times , made itself felt also in the workings of the modern creative imagination . Whether in poetry , in painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mid-nineteenth century way of composing art according to logical patterns tended to yield ground . In its place arose an art made up of seemingly unpatterned impressions , perceptions , and distortions , an art , in short , which by-  | passed man the rational being in order to express man the instinctive , the perceptive , the often anti-rational being . In poetry , the French Mallarme , Laforgue , Rimbaud , and others escaped from the main-travelled roads of nineteenth-century sensibility to experiment with an extreme sensuousness , or a " conversational-ironic " style , or studies in synaesthesia . In painting , the French Impressionists , with their delicate objectivity , somewhat unintentionally opened the way for techniques of abstraction and distortion in succeeding schools of Cubists , Futurists , and Surrealists . In popular music the rise of jazz , and in more sophisticated music the taste for interrupted rhythms , atonality , and dissonance , reflected a similar breaking-down of earlier logical syntheses . In drama , the expressionism of Strindberg , Kaiser , and O'Neill sought to bring alive in symbol perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monologues of James Joyce and Sherwood Anderson sought to ensnare in words the very elusive , non-logical flow of consciousness itself . Recurrently , in a thousand shifting patterns , the various arts mirrored a composite modern consciousness in which the old cohesive , integrative ties were weakening , in which the irruption of strange archetypal forces was creating a sense of flux and fluid change , perhaps even of dissolution . WORLD WAR I AND THE POSTWAR MOOD . Of some final breakdown in the nineteenth-century synthesis of Western civilization , the shattering cataclysm of the first world war furnished the tangible evidence and spectacular symbol . Over minds already insecure , the overwhelming conflict poured out like a deluge spectacle after spectacle of stupidity , casual sexuality , brutality , savagery , and mass destruction . In basic injury to civilization and civilized behavior it far exceeded its bloodier successor , and its impact in America was the more shattering because it crashed upon a public mind still somewhat idealistic , still capable of disillusion . Upon literary art it laid a heavy and inescapable hand . Most American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ? even the serene Willa Cather did not escape ? and within the minds of a younger generation it struck with traumatic force ; it echoed and re-echoed for a generation in the writings of Dos Passos and Marquand , Hemingway and Faulkner . The literary response to the war was of course as various as the writers who gave it , and was only less complex than the war itself ; but one set of attitudes , left as a precipitate by the receding struggle , was so prevalent as to set the emotional tone of the postwar years . This postwar mood was variously blended of dis-  | illusion , cynicism , hedonism , and escapism . The typical young writer felt no urge to reform the society that had produced the war ; he wished at most to ridicule that society , and preferably just to stand aloof from it . The exodus of young American artists to Paris in the early nineteen-twenties was more than a flight from American Philistinism to Old World sophistication ; it was also a flight away from the " civilization " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a community of artists . CHRONOLOGY AND LITERARY ALIGNMENTS . The earliest American literature to express a twentieth-century sensibility was produced by authors of the same general age-group as Stephen Crane , Frank Norris , and Jack London . Writers of that chronological group mostly came of age on or before the turn of the century , and remained at the crest of their effectiveness from the eve of the first world war until near 1930 . In our twentiethcentury authorship they constitute , together , a " first " generation , easily distinguishable from a " second " generation who were born near the turn of the century and came into public notice during the nineteen-twenties. * Among the writers of this former generation , several were artificers of literary and ideological revolt . Like other radicals , they awakened bitter opposition ; and the storm of conflict they precipitated , breaking about 1912 or shortly after , lasted with only occasional lulls for fifteen years . Superficially , the literary battle appeared to turn on matters of taste and technique , as in Stuart Sherman 's and H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , the struggle was profound and fundamental , reaching down as it did into the authors ' basic ideas about the nature of man and the nature of nature . The initiative and the more immediate success in that struggle rested with the authors whose radicalism was organically a part of their acceptance of the world-view of naturalism ? with Theodore Dreiser and Sherwood Anderson , with H. L. Mencken and Sinclair Lewis and Eugene O'Neill . Intermingled with this main revolutionary force of naturalism , another and related radical force , that of the art of alogicality , appeared in the work of the Imagists and other aggressively " modern " poets . Because their values ran counter to so much of the folk-thinking and folk-emotion that had persisted out of the past into modern America , writers of the naturalist-symbolist revolt often antagonized large portions of their potential reading audience . A certain community of feeling , which had intangibly bound a footnote * See below , pp. 389 if .  | Longfellow , a Tennyson , or a Dickens to his Victorian readers , no longer existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at persuading ? and sometimes intimidating ? readers into the acceptance of new ideas and a new sensibility . When theatrical producers and commercial publishers proved recalcitrant , the radical authors employed the independent theater and the " little magazines " ? Poetry , The Little Review , The Masses ? to publicize their works and build their reputations . When they fell foul of the genteel tradition and of censorship , they attacked the entrenched proprieties with evangelical enthusiasm , and turned the censors ' efforts at suppression into an effective advertisement of their wares . By the middle twenties they had to all appearance broken the resistance of the public , entrenched themselves in the favor of publishers , and destroyed the genteel tradition insofar as it might affect the theater and the printed book . How deeply this whirlwind of activity had really touched the popular mind is still doubtful ; for many indications suggest that the radicals had succeeded chiefly in building up for themselves a special " literary " audience , and in so doing had divorced their art from its ideally organic union with national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done during the early twentieth century stands somewhat apart from this tempestuous radicalism . In such writings , unavoidably affected though they were by the naturalistic revolt , the concept of human nature is essentially that of classical and Christian tradition . Those writings assume the uniqueness of man and the supremacy of those human attributes that are not explainable in terms of man 's identity with a material cosmos ? attributes of reason , of moral decorum , of aesthetic or even mystical perception . Because they assume so continually the unique , distinguishing humanness of mankind , they may be referred to properly , if somewhat loosely , as humanistic . Because in the very midst of their freshness and novelty they still preserve the traditional view of man , they may properly be referred to as conservative . In poetry , the humanist and conservative tradition had its finest expression in the work of Edwin Arlington Robinson and Robert Frost ; in fiction , in that of Edith Wharton and Willa Cather . The achievement of these four writers makes up a substantial part ? perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters .  | The Humanist and Conservative Tradition ? Poetry I. Edwin Arlington Robinson ( 1869-1935 ) ROBINSON 'S LIFE AND LITERARY POSITION . Of all the twentiethcentury American poets , Edwin Arlington Robinson and Robert Frost moved with the most quiet assurance among the conflicting forces of a turbulent era . Neither reactionary nor radical , Robinson successfully fused tradition and originality . Neither sentimental nor altogether matter-of-fact , he admirably tempered romance with realism , realism with romance . Yet his poise and high sanity were hard won indeed , and his eminence came only after slow , uncertain groping through personal difficulties . During Robinson 's youth at Gardiner , Maine ? the Tilbury Town of his poems ? he was painfully aware of the great gulf fixed between his own perceptive , introspective nature and the successful practicality approved by the popular mores . In his choice between the two , in ignoring business and the professions in favor of poetry , he was making no self-conscious dedication of his life to art ; he was simply following an interest so powerful as to verge on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as made , he naturally concerned himself from the beginning with the form as well as the substance of his art . He became , he confesses , an " incorrigible fisher of words who thought nothing of fishing for two weeks to catch a stanza or even a line that he would not throw back into the squirming sea of language .... " He sought for " strange and iridescent and impossible words , " words that would fuse into a new idiom , something " smooth and shining and subtle , and very much alive , and not too strange . " Meanwhile , though he had from his family the gift of two rewarding years at Harvard , his energies were repeatedly sapped by emotional strains ? the decline of his father , the illness and financial burdens of his older brothers , the peculiarly tragic death  | of his mother , and the loss of his moderate patrimony during the depression of the nineties . Faced with difficulties comparable to those that had slowly exhausted Poe , Robinson had somehow the toughness and resilience to live through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boston and later at New York ? understood his talent and encouraged it with substantial help . Gradually his published work accumulated : The Torrent and the Night Before ( 1896 ) , The Children of the Night ( 1897 ) , and Captain Craig ( 1902 ) . His friendships widened to include William Vaughn Moody and Percy MacKaye , young men who seemed on the verge of creating a vital literary drama . Theodore Roosevelt attempted to popularize his poetry in an article in The Outlook , and relieved him of financial pressure by the offer of a place in the New York Customs House . From 1911 on , he made a practice of spending his summers at the congenial MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire , an environment that helped call forth much of his finest work . The Man Against the Sky ( 1916 ) brought him the critical recognition for which he had never striven ; and Tristram ( 1927 ) , despite its subtlety and obscurity , gave him at last a popularity reminiscent of that of Longfellow . Hls POEMS : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quality more frequent among novelists than among poets ? an intense curiosity in regard to human nature . Many of his poems , accordingly , are studies of character . In poetic form , these character studies include such various types as the dramatic monologue , the tale , the descriptive or reflective poem , and even the sonnet . No matter what poetic form is employed , however , the interest of these poems is primarily dramatic . That is , they tend away from the mere static portraiture of character , toward the portraiture of character in action , or of various characters interacting upon one another . The majority of these character studies deal with plain , everyday folk , of the kind whom Robinson knew at Gardiner and during his early years in New York . Many of Robinson 's people are outwardly failures ; yet the author finds them none the less interesting for their failure . Shrewd , kindly , sympathetic yet detached , he introduces his nondescripts to us with mingled insight and humor . Among others , we meet the two friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of advancing age in the other , yet fails to observe the same signs in himself . We become friends with Flammonde , a penniless castaway , of kingly bearing , who , though he can not save himself , is able to save others graciously . We learn , in gracefully ironic stanzas , of Mini-  | ver Cheevy 's desire to escape from the ugliness of the present into the romance of an imaginary past . We stand beside old Eben Flood as he holds a humorously pathetic party on his lonely road home , with only himself for company , only his jug for refreshment , and only two moons for audience when he sings " Auld Lang Syne . " Or , through the medium of verse that is almost too flawlessly competent , we observe the ruined speculator , Bewick Finzer : The broken voice , the withered neck , The coat worn out with care , The cleanliness of indigence , The brilliance of despair . Other character studies of Robinson 's deal not with common folk , but with unusual , striking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring these studies , enters a far larger world than that of Flammonde or Bewick Finzer , though somehow a world less friendly and homelike . These personages cover an immense scope of time and characteristics , ranging as they do from John Brown through Alexander Hamilton , Aaron Burr , Napoleon , Shakespeare , and Rembrandt , back to Saint Paul and the risen Lazarus at Bethany . By no means all of Robinson 's historical studies add anything of value to our understanding of the past , or succeed in dramatizing more vividly characters that are already well understood : but those which do achieve their objectives are masterpieces . In sheer dramatic force , the " Lazarus " is perhaps the strongest ; but in all qualities combined ? wisdom , insight , subtlety , and power of historical imagination ? the best poem of this kind is the study of Shakespeare entitled " Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford . " With sure dramatic tact , and with admirable skill , Robinson here places the interpretation of Shakespeare in the mouth of his friendly rival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish clearly between the character of Jonson and that of Shakespeare . Writing as he did after a century during which Shakespeare had become a sort of demigod of romantic idolatry , Robinson succeeded admirably in humanizing his hero , without in the slightest belittling him . Shakespeare 's greatness of imagination , his originality , and his profound pessimism ( as Robinson interprets him ) are only emphasized by Jonson 's insistence on the dramatist 's one worldly ambition ? to be " Duke of Stratford . " In his fictitious and his historical characters combined , Robin-  | son did more than fill a literary gallery with portraits . He created a community ? an imaginary world , indeed ? full of lifelike , credibly human figures , who in number and variety are without parallel in American poetry . No poet since Browning had written character studies of equal extent and penetration . HIs POEMS : ( 2 ) THE ARTHURIAN ROMANCES . Robinson 's subtlety of characterization is not confined to his separate character studies . Character study is perhaps his most important contribution to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romances of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table . Arthurian story , as developed in hundreds of medieval romances and as summed up in Malory 's Le Morte d'Arthur , has had a perennial attraction for English poets . From time to time , the romances have been retold by Spenser , Tennyson , Masefield , and others ; and , each time , they have been reinterpreted in accordance with the new author 's personality or with the thought of his age . When Robinson began his Arthurian romances , the version most widely diffused in the popular mind was that of Tennyson , who had attributed the decline of Arthur 's kingdom to a slowly culminating disregard for moral law on the part of Arthur 's queen and followers . A widely different account , suited to the thought of the twentieth century as Tennyson 's was to that of the nineteenth , appears in Robinson 's Merlin ( 1917 ) and Lancelot ( 1920 ) . These two poems , taken together , form a single tragic story . A third ? Tristram ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which belong somewhat earlier in time , and the tragedy of which is alleviated with more of romance . Though Merlin and Lancelot are epic in form , their theme , the dissolution of the Arthurian world , is conceived in the spirit of tragic drama . Disaster overtakes the Round Table not because of any single person 's treachery , not because of any violation of moral law , but because of the mutually destructive interplay of half a dozen different characters . Merlin , Vivien , Modred , Guinevere , Lancelot , Gawain , and King Arthur are all essential links in the chain of tragic causation . Each of these characters , with the exception of Modred , is drawn with Shakespearean subtlety ; each is intensely individualized . They are alike , however , in the fatal quality of acting from passion instead of from intelligence . Merlin surrenders to dalliance , Gawain to hatred , and King Arthur to grief , while Lancelot wavers between allegiance to the mystical " Light " and his fatal love for Guinevere . Meanwhile , a leaderless kingdom goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , Arthurian story has undergone ex-  | tensive changes . Without lessening the greatness of his characters , Robinson has shifted the emphasis from their actions to their psychology , and has equipped them with intricacies of thought and feeling undreamed of by the straightforward Malory or the moralistic Tennyson . Furthermore , the story is often made to reflect a twentieth-century , rather than a medieval or Victorian , experience of life . Lancelot 's war-weariness , for instance , is not in the spirit of the medieval romancer , who usually enjoyed a good fight ; it is rather in the spirit of the world of 1920 , exhausted by the dreary attritions of the first world war . Perhaps , too , the modern reader has seen in the disintegration of Arthur 's kingdom a mirror of the possible disintegration of his own society , beat upon by the forces of industrialism , total war , and scientific change . Tristram is infused , like Merlin and Lancelot , with the spirit of tragic drama ; but the tragedy is individual , not social , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich compensation for their suffering . The love of Tristram and Isolt leads , it is true , inevitably to a tragic doom , prepared for them by their own mistakes , the mistakes of others , the jealousies and hatreds in which they are involved , and , above all , by fate . Fate , more evidently than in Merlin and Lancelot , underlies the action , and , like a Greek nemesis , necessitates the catastrophe . But , though Tristram and Isolt pay for their love with death , they have experienced , in their glorious summer at Joyous Gard , the utmost fulfillment of life . Few as their years have been , they have torn life from time Like a death-laden flower out of the earth , and have enjoyed whatever It is that fills life high and full , till fate Itself may do no more . The reader who is unwise enough to go to Robinson 's three Arthurian romances for casual entertainment will probably be disappointed . Occasionally obscure , packed with thought , with characterization , and with elusive suggestions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them intelligent , sustained attention will be abundantly rewarded . For Merlin , Lancelot , and Tristram are rich in sustained intensity of experience , in  | beauty , in wisdom , and in elevation . With The Scarlet Letter and Moby Dick , they are among the few American writings which awaken that profound , tragic sense of life which is called into play by works like Othello and Faust . HIs POEMS : ( 3 ) THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TALES. * Beginning with Avon 's Harvest ( 1921 ) , Robinson developed another type of narrative poem , in which his skill in rendering elusive shades of consciousness is turned on modern , rather than on medieval , people . These stories are to poetry what the novelettes of Henry James are to prose . They have much the same scope , and they are renderings , not of action , but of states of mind and subtle interchanges of thought . Especially is this true of the moderatelength poems which he published in the years following Tristram : Cavender 's House ( 1929 ) , Matthias at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others . Here Robinson returned again and again to an earlier-treated theme , that of " the struggle of the lonely woman against the self-centered or disloyal male . " The women of the poem are " sisters , witty , wise , patient , solitary , driven to despair by the blind egotism of the men . " t The men illustrate Robinson 's fascination with the sort of failure that , masked in all the exterior trappings of success , consists in some irremediable lack of a sufficient sense of life . The ideas , whether explicated or left implicit within the narrative , are outcroppings of the poet 's persistent sense of the inadequacy of science and the machine age , of his deep vein of Transcendentalism , even of his fascination with the Christian tenet of the New Birth : You can not die , Matthias , till you are born ... . You have not yet begun to seek what 's hidden In you for you to recognize and use . There 's more of you for you to find , Matthias , Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His ART . Plainly the content of Robinson 's poems , with their highly intellectualized study of human nature , distinguishes them sharply from the more emotional poetry of the nineteenth century . In their technique , in their artistry , they are no less footnote In addition to the studies of character , romances , and psychological tales described above , Robinson 's work includes also some highly original sonnets and some reflective poems of distinction . Among the reflective poems are " The Man Against the Sky " ( 1916 ) , " Dionysus in Doubt " ( 1925 ) , and , possibly , " Captain Craig " ( 1902 ) . The merits of " Captain Craig " have been sharply controverted . It contains brilliant passages , but as a whole the reader may find it tedious . t Hagedorn , Herman , Edwin Arlington Robinson , a Biography , p. 36o.  | distinctly set apart . There is no great novelty , to be sure , in the poetic types or verse forms employed by Robinson . He worked for the most part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sonnet , and the epic ; and he expressed himself in metrical forms , such as blank verse and the octosyllabic couplet , which had been for centuries the staple measures of English poetry . He discarded , however , the sonorous eloquence common in nineteenth-century poetry ; instead , he aimed at intellectual precision . His verses employ simple diction , achieve a natural order of words within the most rigorous metrical limits , and are sparing to the point of austerity in the use of ornament . His rhythms ? and they are at times exquisitely harmonious ? are achieved with the simplest materials , as in the haunting lines , The dark is at the end of every day , And silence is the end of every song . In articulating his thought , Robinson often employs oblique suggestion rather than direct statement . With a few hints , he sketches the outline of his situation , which the reader is then expected to fill out for himself . The dramatic sonnet , " How Annandale Went Out , " illustrates the method : " They called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find words , and to attend : Liar , physician , hypocrite , and friend , I watched him ; and the sight was not so fair As one or two that I have seen elsewhere : An apparatus not for me to mend A wreck , with hell between him and the end , Remained of Annandale ; and I was there . " I knew the ruin as I knew the man ; So put the two together , if you can , Remembering the worst you know of me . Now view yourself as I was , on the spot ? With a slight kind of engine . Do you see ? Like this ... You would n't hang me ? I thought not . " The proper effect of this sort of writing is , of course , to release the imagination of the reader ; to enable the reader to visualize the situation in which the physician , seeing his friend wrecked in hopeless suffering , gives him a lethal hypodermic . The sug-  | gestive method is , when the intended effect is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's suggestions are too few , or too obscure ; the reader fails to complete the picture ; and the poem remains only partially intelligible . The most individual qualities of Robinson 's art are difficult , if not impossible , to describe tangibly . One of these qualities , certainly , is his fondness for semidramatic verbal sparrings and fencings , varying from the tawdry quarreling of the married couple in " London Bridge " to the delicate insinuations , overtones , and eloquent silences in the talk of Tristram and Isolt . This trait , however , is only a part of a larger , more copious individuality which eventuates in the creation of a unique world of experience , peculiar to Robinson 's imagination , and permeated everywhere by his individual flavor . FUTILITARIAN OR SPIRITUAL EXPLORER ? Like some of the greatest poets of the past , Robinson did not concern himself with inculcating in his readers any definite body of ideas . He had few lessons to teach . His interpretation of life is not a matter of instruction , but of illumination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its kindliness , its aspirations , its highest fulfillment ; and even more in its imperfections , its tangled cross-purposes , and its tragic defeats . Because of Robinson 's concern with failure , and because of his brooding though elevated sense of tragedy , he has sometimes been hastily called a futilitarian ; and it is true that he felt profoundly the evil , the suffering , the insoluble mystery that compose so large a part of life . Yet the temper of his poetry is not that of despair . If his imaginary Shakespeare is a pessimistic futilitarian , who sums up life in the despairing phrase , " It 's all nothing , " his Lancelot is a courageous mystic who , after the Arthurian world has crumbled about him , sets out undaunted in pursuit of " the Light . " This message of spiritual quest lies also at the heart of that austere , lofty reflective poem , " The Man Against the Sky . " Here , among other interpretations of life , the poet thoughtfully considers , and emphatically rejects , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only end is annihilation . The logical outcome of such a philosophy , as Robinson points out , is suicide ? a step which the majority of philosophical pessimists have not been eager to take . Life , on the other hand , has values in and of itself ; and , in addition to these , there runs , through all its unintelligible warp and woof , a faint , elusive thread of purposeful meaning :  | But this we know , if we know anything : That we may laugh and fight and sing And of our transience here make offering To an orient Word that will not be erased , Or , save in incommunicable gleams Too permanent for dreams , Be found or known . II . Robert Frost ( 1875- ) BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT . Though born in San Francisco , Robert Frost was by rearing and temperament a New Englander , who related himself , far more intimately than did Robinson , to the scenery and folkways of his region . During his latter boyhood and his years of earning a living on the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside and to absorb the tartly flavored speech ways of its Yankee people . During two years at Harvard , he proved less interested in academic routine than in the blend of rusticity and humane learning he found in Emerson ? though he was affected also by the more formally philosophical interests of William James . His . young manhood , which brought a few poems to periodical publication , brought also a steady , persistent growth in sophistication in literature ? acquaintance with the dramatic monologues of Browning , and familiarity with a tradition in pastoral poetry descended from Theocritus and Virgil . With Frost 's residence in England from 1912 to 1915 came the decisive turn in his development . Stimulated by his association with W. W. Gibson , Lascelles Abercrombie , and other poets , he published his first volume , A Boy 's Will , in 1913 , and his second , North of Boston , in 1914 . The latter , appearing as it did near the crest of interest in the " New Poetry , " brought him fame ? and made him a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next two decades . Throughout these cont roversies , Frost followed a consistently moderate course , not as . a means of catering to popular taste , but rather as an expression of his blend of Yankee conservatism and respect for the classical ( : olden Mean . But with Frost the course of integrity proved also the course of popularity , so that he continued to gain in both critical and popular regard through the publication of volumes . including Mountain Interval ( 1916 ) , New Hampshire ( 1923 ) , A. footnote * See below , pp. 361 if .  | Further Range ( 1936 ) , A Masque of Reason ( 1945 ) , and A Masque of Mercy ( 1947 ) . THE LYRICAL VEIN . A body of poetry so closely integrated as Frost 's does not lend itself to neat analysis into types and kinds . Its texture reveals , instead of sharply distinct genres , certain poetic veins that now disclose themselves separate and pure , and now blend into one another , as colors may stand out or recede in an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poems in A Boy 's Will , where Frost 's earliest collected writings show , already , how fully he owns the lyric poet 's immemorial gifts of emotion , imagery , and song . Emotionally , the poems suggest , though in somewhat muted tones , the exaltations and melancholies of a Shelley or a Keats . In imagery , they are filled with the shy , fine-textured beauties of the New England of Thoreau ? the darkness of late-autumn , the still depths of winter , the intensity of swift summer . Their song-quality is that of the conventional verse-and-stanza forms of English poetry , now quietly melodious , as in the wistfully beautiful " Reluctance , " now tuned to the more personal , more sharply individual rhythms of " Mowing " and " The Tuft of Flowers . " In these early poems , just as in his later ones , Frost 's originality lies not so much in the invention of new metrical patterns as in the turning of old , established patterns to his own individual use . Later volumes of Frost were written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purely lyrical vein . Yet the poet could recapture the lyrical magic in his exquisitely light-toned and ingeniously rhymed " Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening , " or in the graver chant of " Neither Out Far Nor In Deep , " or in the quiet , almost voluptuous melancholy of " The Peaceful Shepherd . " Continually , too , the lyrical vein emerges in other than purely lyrical poems , cropping out in the natural magic of lines like " A bird half wakened in the lunar noon , " and rippling through the fanciful scherzo of " Departmental . " For Frost , as he repeatedly demonstrated , could blend with the lyrical the meditative , and even the pointedly didactic ; thought and instruction , no less than perception and feeling , could be sung . Moreover , in his very earliest lyrics there is often a kind of implicit drama ; their song suggests action , dramatic situation , and the movement of events . They point toward Frost 's maturer expression in poems that are , in effect , brief dramas or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston is Frost 's principal " book of people , " though the poet 's interest in  | presenting character carries over from that volume into Mountain Interval and New Hampshire . To read the character studies in these volumes is to come to know a number of New England rural folk ? vivid , sharply individualized ? who are " seen " more clearly and deeply than are the people of ordinary life . There is the decrepit Silas , in " The Death of the Hired Man , " clinging through irresponsibility and decline to his need for self-respect . There is , in " The Black Cottage , " the old-fashioned New England lady whose need for spiritual security is portrayed by a philosophical minister quite as interesting as the person he depicts . There is the leisurely , humorous ox-driver of " The Mountain , " who voices Frost 's own principle , " All the fun 's in how you say a thing . " Inseparable from these and others of Frost 's people is the rural background against which they are posed , the regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild pasture , and lonely farmhouse ; the sudden mountain river brawling among boulders ; the still fall of snow ; the space and the darkness of northern winter nights . And the people themselves are at once local and universal : local in their shrewd , wry , tough-minded Yankee perceptions and speech ; universal in their timeless human traits of stubborn pride , or humor , or integrity , or fear . The form of Frost 's character sketches is commonly a loose unrhymed iambic pentameter , a verse in which the iambic pattern is less marked than usual , is more varied , and is turned to the conversational rather than to the declamatory . With only the rarest recourse to dialect , the author conveys through this verse the pattern , the rhythm , and the tang of sharply flavored local speech . The effect is usually realistic ; or , if romantic , it is romantic with a severer restraint than that of nineteenth-century verse , and with a more careful shaping-up of the artistic illusion . The genre usually employed is not the dramatic monologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , in some of Frost 's most successful pieces he has subordinated both drama and character to the practice of an increasingly rare art ? that of straightforward poetic narrative . In " The Code , " a farm hand tells how , because his employer made some trivial reflection on his work , thereby violating an unwritten law of the fields , he tried to kill the man by burying him under a load of hay . Here the dramatic poet , turning raconteur , has sketched out half-humorously an anecdote which shows the peculiar local customs , the odd expressions of personal pride , which develop in a remote rural community . In " The Witch of Coos , " a humorously grue-
