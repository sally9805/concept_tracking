The statistic of the year reads : 72 HOME RUNS . It belongs to 32-year-old Joe Bauman of the Roswell ( N. Mex . ) Rockets , whose batting record at season 's end last week sounded like something out of Paul Bunyan  --  72 home runs , 224 runs batted in , 188 runs scored , a .398 batting average . // Bauman demonstrated a Ruthian flair for the dramatic by hitting 10 homers in the last nine games , three on the last day , to set a new home-run record for organized ball ( old record : 69  --  Joe Hauser , Minneapolis , 1933 ; Bob Crues , Amarillo , 1948 ) . He was by far the most popular player in the league , principally because of his size ( 6 ft. 5 in. , 245 lb. ) and his slugging , but also because of the appealing home-town fact that he is now a permanent Roswell resident  --  he owns a service station there  --  and has no apparent desire to move back up the baseball ladder ( he once played with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bauman was certainly the most spectacular minor leaguer but even better players were found higher up : // ? The best pitcher was a tall , fast-balling left-hander named Herb Score who won 22 and lost 5 with the Indianapolis Indians , struck out 330 batters to break the American Association mark of 264 set in 1906 by Charles Henry Berger , and was named the Most Valuable Player in the league . Last weekend after striking out 16 men in his final regular season game Herb Score came down with pneumonia and was unable to start in the post-season play-offs . // ? In nine years of minor-league ball , Bob Lennon had never hit .300 , never more than 24 home runs . This season , his third with the Nashville Volunteers , he shortened his grip , lengthened his confidence and suddenly became a star . Last week as the season ended he had 64 home runs , 161 runs batted in and , with a .345 average , the Southern Association batting championship . // ? Elston Howard , who may become the first Negro ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catcher in spring training and optioned to the Toronto Maple Leafs . Last week , his team trailing , Howard hit a two-run homer to clinch the pennant for the Leafs . Next day popular Elly Howard , his eye on the Yankees , was named Most Valuable Player in the International League . // ? First Baseman Jim Marshall is probably the most valuable player on the Oakland Oaks : he is a superb fielder and a powerful hitter ( he led the Pacific Coast League in home runs and runs batted in ) . But his greatest value lies in the fact that Marshall is owned outright by Oakland . His forthcoming sale to a major-league team will take the Oaks out of the red for 1954. // ? And there were others . Branch Rickey offered no alibis for the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates but with an eye on his farms ( 10 of 14 teams were third or better , five finished first ) , he warned " A new day is coming . " Prize Pirate farm hands included Bob Garber , Denver , who won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who won 27 ; Ramon Mejias , Waco , who hit in 55 straight games ; Floyd Faust , Brunswick , who stole 73 bases . Prize of prizes : 20-year-old Gene Freese , New Orleans second baseman who in his second year of pro ball jumped from Class D to Class AA , batted .332 and was called by Rickey " the best ballplayer in the minor leagues today .
