In the year or more since Jerry Wald and Norman Krasna , Hollywood wonder boys , formed their own producing unit at RKO Radio ( TIME , Aug. 28 , 1950 ) , they have busied themselves with optimistic announcements and tinkering on movies already in production at the studio . Now , at last , they offer two products of their own : a wacky farce and an unabashed tearjerker . This double-barreled attempt to hit the target with old-fashioned bird shot may well succeed at the box office , but it also blows holes into the bright Wald &; Krasna promises of original moviemaking . <P> Behave Yourself tries to get laughs out of mother-in-law jokes , a trained dog , a man 's frustrated efforts to go to bed with his wife , and the innocent , harried involvement of a young couple ( Farley Granger and Shelley Winters ) bedeviled by comic thieves , murderers and cops . <P> The dog , trained as a gangster 's accomplice , attaches itself to Farley and Shelley , who are unaware that the animal is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Francis L. Sullivan , Lon Chancy , Glenn Anders et a/ . ) . Luckily required to speak none of the film 's dialogue , the dog charms Shelley into locking Farley out of the boudoir . Whenever Farley tries to get rid of this dog in the manger by answering a newspaper ad inserted by one of the rival crooks , Farley finds the claimant murdered-and the police ( William Demarest et a/. ) leaping to embarrassing conclusions . <P> Somewhere in this studied confusion of old stuff and nonsense lurks a workable idea for farce , as longtime Farceur Norman ( Dear Ruth ) Krasna should know . All it lacks is taste , timing , funny lines and , mostly , a pair of at least likable romantic leads . <P> The Blue Veil , a much slicker job with an imposing cast , tells the sad , sad story of a determinedly selfless woman ( Jane Wyman ) who goes through life ( in four episodes ) mothering other people 's children and hiding her sorrows behind the traditional blue veil of the old-world governess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences who confuse a good cry with a good movie . <P> Thanks largely to a fine performance by Charles Laughton as a bumbling , middle-aged widower trying to woo his baby 's pretty governess , The Blue Veil 's first episode could hold its own as part of an omnibus film like Quartet . Governess Wyman , a widow who has lost her own baby , gently parries Widower Laughton 's attentions and loses him willingly to his designing secretary ( Vivian Vance ) , who thereupon cuts her adrift from the household and from the little toddler she has grown to love . <P> From that point on , The Blue Veil , though acted and directed with praiseworthy restraint , grows increasingly maudlin . Succeeding episodes merely repeat Governess Wyman 's plight in triplicate , each time heaping her with keener deprivations and sanctifying her with brighter nobility . Marriage beckons Jane a second time , and with it a good man 's love , but she remains always a substitute mother , never a bride .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
