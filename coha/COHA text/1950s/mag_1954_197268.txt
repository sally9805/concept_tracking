Fiery discontent ripped Brazil 's violent politics wide open last week . After months of strikes , army and air force threats , ceaseless newspaper attacks and congressional roars for the impeachment of President Getulio Vargas , the proud old ( 71 ) Gaucho who had ruled Brazil for 18 of the past 24 years was toppled from office by the chiefs of the armed forces . Then , in a last , fateful act of Hitler-like defiance , he killed himself , leaving behind a bitter , eloquent testament heaping all blame for his failure-and Brazil 's plight-on a wicked combination of his domestic ene mies and " international financial groups . " <P> The news of Vargas ' suicide and his defiant farewell ( see below ) broke over the capital almost as fast as the word of his decision to step down from office . After a moment of stunned incredulity , Rio was caught in a vortex of emotions . Excited groups formed and violence flared . Mobs ripped down anti-Vargas campaign posters , whirled off to attack offices of opposition newspapers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Enter the Reds . The Communists , technically outlawed but in practice tolerated by the Vargas regime , went into action within minutes . With headlines in their newspaper screaming " Down with the Americans , " they shrewdly turned the vague " international groups " phrase of Vargas ' farewell note into a specific blast against the U.S. Red-manned sound-trucks egged crowds on to attack the Standard Oil Co . ( NJ. ) building and the glass-walled U.S. embassy . At the embassy police opened up with machine guns and tear gas , routing the mob and wounding a dozen rioters . <P> After that , powerful army units fanned through the city to squelch further outbreaks . But in Porto Alegre , capital of Vargas ' home state of Rio Grande do Sul , mobs fired the U.S. consulate and offices of two U.S. firms . Six died and more than a hundred rioters were wounded as troops dispersed them with gunfire . In Sao Paulo , police guns halted attacks on two U.S. company offices , wounding 20 . <P> Roused from bed at dawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Vice President Jo ? Caf Filho* 55 , was being photographed in his pajamas when he learned that the old man had put him in an even tighter spot by committing suicide . The new chief of state took over his job without any ceremony . While heavily armed troops held Rio like a city at war , he moved fast to avert any coups and to restore order . <P> Unholy Alliance . Some of the new government 's most decisive measures were taken against the Communists . Ever mindful of the 600,000 votes they rolled up in the 1945 elections , Vargas had played sly footie with the Reds for years , though never permitting them to operate as a legal party . By week 's end the new regime had arrested 100 Communist leaders , and Red-led violence in Rio appeared to be under control , even though two more had been killed and scores wounded in a mob assault on the Air Ministry . In Sao Paulo authorities announced that they would prosecute the Communist-controlled newspaper Noticias de Hoje for inciting attacks on U.S. company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
