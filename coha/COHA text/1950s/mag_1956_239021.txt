Sullivan , in the unaccustomed position of runner-up , affected disdain for the Pelvis , snorted that he would not have the gyrating groaner " at any price " on his family-type program .

Without batting an eye , Strategist Sullivan dropped his week-old scruples , signed the Pelvis for three appearances on his show at eight-week intervals , beginning in the fall .
