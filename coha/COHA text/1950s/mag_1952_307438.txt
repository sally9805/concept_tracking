For nearly a quarter-century , Nila Mack has been against new models in heroes . She does n't care for spacemen ( Buck Rogers ) , cowboys ( the Lone Ranger ) or clear-eyed adolescent adventurers ( Jack Armstrong ) . As writer-producer-director of Let 's Pretend ( Sat . 11:05 a.m. , CBS ) , she has stuck to her conviction that young radio listeners still like giants , witches and fairy godmothers best . Says Nila : " I 'll back seven-league boots and magic wands any time against six-shooters and space ships . " <P> Not even TV has cut into the 600-700 letters a week written by Let 's Pretend fans . In some families , three generations listen to the familiar , often-repeated stories enacted by Nila 's casts , ' largely juvenile . Cinderella , the favorite , has been given 22 times in as many years . Runners-up are Sleeping Beauty , Rumpelstiltskin , Jack and the Beanstalk , Beauty and the Beast and what Nila persists in calling-in near-blasphemous defiance of Walt Disney and the brothers Grimm-Snowdrop and the Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Brides during 1914-15 , Nila is a childless widow in her late fifties . Her scripts , in which , as she says , " the good are very good and the bad get just what they deserve , " come out flatly against racial prejudice , boom such worthy sentiments as honor and service in good causes . Her sound-effects men developed some wonderful sizzling and steaming noises when boiling oil was poured over Ali Baba 's 40 thieves hiding in jars . Bluebeard gets his just deserts , too , but only by implication : " The kids are tickled to death when Bluebeard 's sword falls , klunk , closely followed by the thud of Bluebeard hitting the ground for the last time . They get the idea , but not the horror . " <P> Last week , Let 's Pretend began its 23rd year on radio and its ninth under the sponsorship of Cream of Wheat . Nila has no plans for shifting to TV . Two years ago , her sponsor asked her to estimate how much it would cost to put the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated minimum of $8,000 a week , or three times the cost of her radio show ) , says : " I have n't heard a word from them since .
