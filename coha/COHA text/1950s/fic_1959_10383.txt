he suddenly went over to Malcolm and shook the boy 's hand . " Come back in twenty years , and we shall understand one another , " Estel said , and he ushered Malcolm rather hurriedly in the direction of the door . " But I would ever so much like to come back again , " Malcolm said . " I . . . enjoyed it all , sir . It was . . . travel to me . " " Travel ? " Estel Blanc considered this , dubiously . " No , I am afraid I can not see you again soon , or indeed at all , " and he pulled at the sleeves of his jacket . " I am flattered , of course , " Estel went on , " that Mr. Cox should have thought of me as a kind of introduction for you to a greater world . But I am not in my element with the immature . I must be firm about this . I am not in my element . . . But come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered a slightly greater environment from the one the bench and the hotel had for such a long time given him , Malcolm was somewhat loath to allow the door of Estel Blanc 's house to close on him . He stood as long as decency would allow him on the threshold , then , seeing that there was no way to prolong his visit , he stepped out onto the pavement , and in doing so  --  as he was to tell Mr. Cox the next day  --  walked right into the open arms of a policeman . Coming out of the police station two or three hours later , whom should Malcolm see waiting for him but Estel Blanc himself , muffled up in a light coat which he wore in the manner of a cape . " You said twenty years , " Malcolm cried , and the thought actually did cross his mind that perhaps after all he had been imprisoned in the police station for that length of time . " An auspicious beginning to your career , " Estel said ,  |p21somewhat  pleasantly , somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the police sergeant make the arrest , " the dark man said , " and although our soiree together was a total failure , I did feel some small sort of responsibility for you . I 'm so relieved they let you off , of course . . . " " The police captain and the sergeant both were very kind to me , " Malcolm reflected , " once they found out I was not the person they were looking for . " Estel nodded , waiting for more . " They said it was a confidence man they were after , and my good clothes , for a moment , led them to think I was he . But when they saw that I was not . . . . " " When they saw you were not a grown man . " Estel bobbed his head up and down . " Yes , everything is permitted to youth ! " " But how did you know ? " Malcolm seemed thunderstruck . " I know the police , " Estel remarked . " The police sergeant , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pointedly , " even invited me back . " " Invited you back . That is real success ! " Estel told him . " I do n't suppose you have changed your mind , bychance , about me , " Malcolm ventured . " No , no , " Estel replied , " I am not here to invite you back . Really , Malcolm , you are terribly backward mentally . No , my decision rests just where it did when you left . . . We are not meant for one another 's company , and until you are more mature , conversation itself , let alone friendship , is impossible . " The boy looked down disconsolately . " The main reason why I have been waiting outside for you , in such an undignified position for me  --  is quite a simple one . " Malcolm smiled , his eagerness returning.  | " You see , " Estel fingered a piece of cardboard on which some words had been scribbled , " I am usually No. 1 on Mr. Cox 's list of addresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrusted Address No. 2 with me  --  to give to you , of course , when the time came . . . But when the time came tonight , well , I forgot is all ! " " Address No. 2 ! " Malcolm cried . " Oh , what enthusiasm , " Estel commented . " I sometimesalmost regret my decision with regard to you when I hear your freshness of tone . But to business . . . As I said , Cox has entrusted me with giving you Address No. 2 . Here , take it , it 's yours . " " Address No. 2 , " the boy read , holding the cardboard reverently , and reading what he saw there : " Kermit and Laureen Raphaelson . Why , what beautiful names . Are they also . . . " Malcolm hesitated . " No , they are not Abyssinians , if that 's what you mean , " Estel said pointedly , placing the ends of his handkerchief , which seemed to have been dipped in some strong liquid , to his nostrils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your taste ! " " Please , please , sir , tell me how it was that I have offendedyou , " Malcolm began again , but a violent movementfrom Estel 's cloak-and-coat stopped the boy . " And you have stood out here . . . in the cold air waiting for me , " Malcolm went on deeply apologetic . " Yes , the cold June cold air , " Estel replied , and he took the boy 's hands and shook them with ceremonious restraint . " Now this is goodbye , " the dark man told him . " As I say , your career has begun auspiciously . The police sergeantepisode alone is proof you have a charmed life . Keep close to your bench and Mr. Cox 's addresses , and nothingcan go amiss . And remember , dear boy , when you are mature , come back to see me . I will be here . " Estel bowed , and retreated slowly walking backwardsp23directly to his house , which was only a short half-block from the police station . An old signTHE BLANC EMPIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish you would n't be so final , " Malcolm said , but too low for Estel to hear him . When the undertaker had disappeared into his house , Malcolm felt very lonely and tired . The events of the eveninghad been much too exciting and stimulating , and had he not just then looked down and seen the new address , he believed he would have burst into tears . Yes , there could be no doubt , he was beginning life , and with his usual silent evening prayer addressed to his father , wherever he might be , dead or alive , lost or found , he hastened back to his hotel suite.  |p24Malcolm  found himself the next evening in a long hall waiting for the buzzer to admit him to the apartment of Kermit and Laureen Raphaelson . But as the buzzer had not worked for many weeks , perhapseven years , Laureen herself appeared to open the door , a stout young blonde woman whose face was covered with white moles . She wore a look of extreme suspicion , together with mechanicalexpectation and boredom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Malcolm nodded.  | " The little man is not in his parlor yet , " Laureen said , ushering him into her home . " He is not ? " Malcolm replied , wondering to whom she was referring . " As a matter of fact , " Laureen continued , and they now entered the front room of the apartment , " he is in the pantryfinishing his supper . He often eats in there alone now just to spite me . He refused to eat even his cabinet pudding with me tonight . I am afraid Professor Cox may be right , and we are headed for the divorce courts . " Laureen pointed out a large over-stuffed chair for Malcolmto sit down in . " Divorce courts are entirely out of my range of experience , " Malcolm told Laureen . " But I am sorry you are headed for them . " " I have n't said a divorce is actually imminent , mind you , " Laureen thought better of the subject . But Malcolm was not listening , for he was experiencing the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off through age onto the floor beneath it . Malcolm was about to exclaim " But what a deep chair , Laureen , " when the latter cried out : " The little man ! " in such a loud voice that Malcolm was startled , and leaped out of the chair , though it cost him great agility and effort to do so . " You have a caller , " Laureen addressed the person who had entered the room . Malcolm at first mistook the latter for a child , but then realized that , limited though his experience in such matters was , the person was a man , and a midget . " Why , who are you ? " Malcolm could not prevent himself from exclaiming . " Her husband , " Kermit Raphaelson , the " little man , " pointed with malice and glee in the direction of Laureen.  |p26Malcolm  was not only astonished to see that Kermit Raphaelson was a midget but that he looked quite handsomeand clever , and differed from any other young man only in the matter of size : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong end of the eye-piece . " I 'm so glad to see somebody fresh and young ! " Kermit cried . " And do n't look so surprised , Malcolm , " he continued . " Ignore Laureen , if you like , and pay your best attention to me . I 'm the lonely one ! " " Good God alive , " Laureen cried , raising her eyes to the ceiling . " It 's beginning already . " " Yes , we are married , " Kermit laughed , sitting down in a small chair specially designed , it was clear , for him . " Married , and married , and married . " " I beg of you not to bring on a scene in front of this child , " Laureen turned to her husband . Kermit ignored her although he shot an oblique black look from beneath his lowered eyelashes . " So you , " he turned again to Malcolm , " are the boy who is infatuated with his father . " " I ? " Malcolm pointed a finger at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told us all about you , " the midget explained . " But there 's nothing yet to tell , " Malcolm protested against the all , which sounded to him both complete and frightening . " There is a great deal to tell , always , Malcolm , " Kermit spoke somewhat gravely now . " And you really are married , " Malcolm said staring closely at Kermit . Kermit lowered his eyes . " She proposed , " he explained , pointing to Laureen . " I warn you , " Laureen cried . " I will not tolerate your telling secrets about our marriage to a third party again ! " Laureen continued to stand , perhaps because she had notp27yet made up her mind whether to leave or to stay , and becausealso she was in an extremely bad humor , which Malcolm'sarrival had only worsened . " Why did you choose to come to see us , Malcolm , " Kermitsaid , edging his tiny chair closer to his guest . Malcolm remembered his disastrous evening with Estel Blanc and did not reply immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laureen was severe . Both Kermit and she now stared at the boy fixedly . " Why did I come to see you ? " Malcolm swallowed , lookingfrom one to the other , for the contrast between the two was stupefying to him  --  Kermit so small , Laureen so large and plump and commanding . " Why , Mr. Cox ordered me to , " Malcolm admitted under all the scrutiny and severity . " You had no interest then , in us , for ourselves ? " Laureen interrogated . " None whatever , " Malcolm replied without expression or regret or belligerence in his tone . " We see , " Laureen told him , and she smiled quietly triumphant . " I suppose you know about my evening with Estel Blanc , " Malcolm went on . " Of course we know about it ! " Kermit said . " Professor Cox keeps us pretty well informed , you know , as to what all his friends are doing and thinking . " " Professor Cox ! That awful old . . . " Laureen began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she sat down in a tall straight-backed chair , and began rolling herself a cigarette , a process which took a long time owing to her hands trembling so much . " Professor Cox , " Laureen began again when her cigarettewas rolled , " Professor Cox has ruined Kermit here with his ideas . We were so happy before we met him . " Kermit laughed sardonically at this point.  | " Laugh all you wish , " Laureen turned her back now on her husband and sat facing Malcolm . " Kermit and I were happy . But that old . . . Malcolm , " she said suddenly , " you must give up Professor Cox if you want to grow into a fine and trustworthy man . " " Laureen , my dear , " Kermit addressed his wife , " if you are going to sermonize , I will have to ask you to leave the front room , and go out and sit with the cats in the back parlor . " " You should tell Malcolm how many cats you have , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of where you are ordering me to go . " Kermit , however , said nothing , but made ironic little faces at Malcolm , who broke out into stifled guffaws . " We have fifteen cats ! " Laureen said in a tragic voice , but then hurrying on , in her telegraphic impulsive style : " Malcolm , am I getting across to you ? . . . Professor Cox is not a man whom you should know at your age . I am trying to help you ! " " On what grounds should I not know Mr. Cox ? " Malcolminquired . " A brilliant rejoinder to her stupid command , " Kermit cried . " Kermit , for pity 's sake , " Laureen begged her husband . " My husband , " she explained , " is scarcely any better than Professor Cox , I am ashamed to admit . But I can see that you , Malcolm , are not yet corrupt . . . Not completely , at any rate , " she studied the boy a little more closely . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again Kermit exploded into laughter , and Malcolm receiving this laughter as a compliment nodded briefly to the midget , and then directed his full attention back to Laureen . " Professor Cox commands people to be their worst ! " Laureen said . " Nonsense , " Kermit interrupted . " He tells them to dop29what they must do in any case , and they are merely free to be what they have to . " " All of Kermit 's metaphysical ideas are taken lock , stock and barrel from Professor Cox , " Laureen said patiently , looking at the bare wood of the floor . " Professor Cox has a rather low opinion of Laureen at the moment , " Kermit informed Malcolm . " Low ? " Laureen said . " Well , not just of me , Kermit , " she went on . " He has a low opinion of everybody . Malcolm , " Laureen said , moving her chair closer to that of the young boy and as she did so she touched him gently on his empty boutonniere , " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this is to show you the danger and the risk you run with him . . . " Malcolm shook his head . " But you 're so young to hear it ! " Laureen reflected . " So terribly young and unaware . " She shaded her eyes with her hand , perhaps overcome by the thought of Malcolm 's ignorance . " No one 's too young to hear anything about people ! " Kermit cried disgusted . " And where is my hot tea , by the way ? I asked you for my tea nearly an hour ago , and all you have been doing all evening is walking up and down complaining over your lot as a woman . If you kept up your womanly duties about the house , brought me my supper on time , and prepared my tea like a decent housewife , you would n't have time to be unhappy , would n't have time to worry about Professor Cox 's commands . " " My dear , did n't I bring you your tea ? " Laureen cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties by you , no matter what may happen later on . . . " Laureen immediately hastened to a small table , wherethe tea was already prepared , and brought Kermit his cup . " Will you join Kermit in a cup of tea ? " Laureen askedMalcolm , and when the latter nodded , she brought him thep30same kind of cup which she had given her husband except that this one had a crack in it , which Malcolm stared at some time before finally putting his lips to it to drink . After sipping his tea with a critical expression for a few moments , Malcolm said in a rather stentorian voice : " What did Mr. Cox command you , Laureen ? " " My precious , " Laureen said , and going up to Malcolm she kissed him on the cheek . " What a ridiculous display of pretended emotion , " Kermitcried , addressing his wife . " I will tell you what Mr. Cox commanded her , " he turned immediately to Malcolm . " Let me tell it , Kermit , " Laureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without your embellishments . " " Will you allow me to entertain my guest in my fashion , or shall I ask you again to step into the back room ? " Kermit thundered at her . Laureen bowed her head . " We are poor people , " Kermit began in a trembling voice , while Laureen held her head in her hands , like a woman in a court trial scene . " I make very little as an artist  --  " and here he pointed in the general direction of the many easels , oil paintings , empty frames , and sculpture which filled the large room . " Laureen , although a brilliant stenographer , can seldom keep a position , owing to her wish to meddle in the higher business of the offices where she is employed . Quiet ! " Kermit roared when he saw Louise make a motion that she wished to speak . " Knowing my wife 's propensities , " Kermit said vindictively , " ProfessorCox merely and sensibly proposed that Laureen go out with certain gentlemen who would pay her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely unknownfor her favors before her sudden proposal of marriage to me . " The midget took out a cowboy handkerchief and wipedp31his mouth , and examined one of the inexpensive rings on his index finger . " Laureen had promised me when she proposed marriage to me , " the midget continued , " that once I had agreed to be her husband and our visit to city hall was concluded , my days of struggle and difficulty would be over , that I could devote myself solely to my art , and at last achieve the full development and flowering of my talents . The exact oppositehas been true . Since the prolonged week-end of our honeymoon in Pittsburgh , there has not been a day or night when we have not worried about food or necessities  --  I do not mention luxuries  --  and the little money I had inheritedshe , incompetent thing , has squandered in her mismanagement ! I had to sell my finest oils for a song ! " " Exaggerations , dolly , " Laureen cried . " But , Malcolm , " Kermit suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you come to our house merely to let you hear about us . " " But it is so interesting and different , " Malcolm exclaimed . " You see there is nothing to hear about in my case . I am , well , as they say , a cypher and a blank . " However , Kermit and Malcolm soon found their attentionturned to Laureen , for she was giving what seemed to be a speech : " When one 's husband no longer respects one , when he can tell the most intimate secrets of marriage in front of a third party , " Laureen was saying , " there is indeed nothing for one but the streets . Malcolm , " Laureen said to the young man in particular . " I want you to know what ProfessorCox proposed to me . " " What boredom ! What repetition ! " Kermit said . " Do I look like a street-walker ? " Laureen demanded goingdirectly up to Malcolm . " Answer me , dear boy , for you are not yet corrupt . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to him : " Do I , or do n't I ? " " But are n't you . . . already one , dear Laureen ? " Malcolmcried in consternation . " I thought your husband . . . " Kermit laughed uproariously , while at the same time he pointed to the back room as a signal for Laureen to leave . " Go back there and talk to the cats , " Kermit ordered her . " I want to have a quiet talk with Malcolm . I certainly deserve to see somebody else in the evening beside your own horrible blonde self . " " A true pupil of Professor Cox , " Laureen exclaimed . Then turning benevolently to Malcolm , Laureen kissed him briefly on the forehead , and with a dramatic gesture of laying her hand across her mouth , she retired into the back room . After a luxuriant silence , Malcolm asked : " Are there really cats back there ? " " As Laureen said , " Kermit nodded , " there are fifteen . " " How sleepy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this hour ? " Kermit expressed shock . " Conversation makes me quite sleepy , " Malcolm explained . " You see , usually all I have to do with people is have them wait on me . A maid will bring me a cup of chocolate , or the man from the tonsorial parlor will cut my hair and nails , and I exchange a few words with the leader of the string orchestra in the hotel , but no more than that . But since I have met Mr. Cox , I have been having rather long conversations with people , and it has made me quite sleepy . " " Lie down on the sofa and I will talk to you , then , while you rest , " Kermit told him . " I 'd rather you did n't talk while I lie down , " Malcolm said , and he went over to the sofa and stretched out . " In a little while , " he told his host , " you must summon a cab , and I will go to my hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave in such a peremptory manner , notp33after you just got here , and after Laureen has left so that we can have our private talk ! " Kermit complained . " But what more is there to talk about ? We 've covered everything here , have n't we ? " Malcolm cried , lifting his head a little to see Kermit more closely . Kermit laughed and finished his tea . " How odd though that Laureen should be a . . . a . . . " Malcolm mused . " Odd she 's a whore ? " Kermit yawned . " Well , it 's the only thing she ever wanted to be , and why she thought marriage would straighten her out , God only knows , especiallymarriage with me , " and he picked up one of his paint brushes and inspected it briefly . " I never thought marriagewould straighten me out , " Kermit went on . " But I did think it might be a kind of long rest for me . But it 's been a real workout , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day passes we do n't worry about money . " The midget sighed and shook his head . " I do not seem to recognize women like that when I meet them , " Malcolm remarked . " You do have beautiful clothes , " Kermit said looking at Malcolm . " Do I ? " Malcolm looked down at himself . " They 're all suits my father picked out years in advance of my being this size , " Malcolm explained . " He has picked out suits for me all the way up to the age of eighteen . I think he had a presentiment he would be called away , and he left me plenty of clothes . " " Your father was quite extraordinary , " Kermit asserted . " That 's what I tried to tell Mr. Cox , " Malcolm cried , " but he would n't believe me . " " Oh , he probably believed you , " Kermit said . " He only wanted to test your belief . To make you talk . " Malcolm nodded . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy said . " You see , he 's all I 've got.  |p34And  now I do n't have him . " And a short sob came out from Malcolm 's throat . Kermit looked at his wrists , and then at his empty tea cup . Malcolm sat up just then , though , laughed , and then immediately lay down again , exclaiming : " I am too sleepy to sit up . " " I hope you wo n't command me to stop talking , " Kermit said winsomely . " I would rather you did n't , " Malcolm replied , " but if you do n't mind me never answering or not really listening , perhaps it 's all right if you do go right on talking . " " Very well , then , " Kermit said , " I will do just that , because I am awfully fond of talking . " " There is one thing , though , I must get straight before you begin your talking , " Malcolm informed Kermit . " Are you a dwarf or a midget ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , goodness , " Kermit said after a short pause . " I 'm neither . " " Neither ? " Malcolm was so surprised he sat all the way up and put his feet down on the floor . " Why , you certainlymust be one or the other ! " " No , no , no ! " Kermit said , becoming very red in the face . " How stupid can one be ? " " But you 're so small , " Malcolm cried . " You must be a midget ! " " I 'm not big , " Kermit was patient now but sternly emphatic , " but I am no different from other men  --  fundamentally . " He stood on this statement . " You 're just short , then ? " Malcolm inquired . " That 's one way of putting it , " Kermit agreed . " But I 've seen you in circuses  --  that is , I 've seen short little men like you . " " Not like me ! " Kermit shook his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've seen nobody like me , " he repeated , and suddenly he stuck his tongue out at Malcolm , and opened his eyes very wide like a movie actor . " Golly , how awful you look when you do that , " Malcolm observed . " I am awful sometimes , " Kermit laughed a bit tunelessly . " I think I like you , though , " Malcolm said . " You 're not usual . " " Well , I could say the same thing of you , Malcolm , though I wo n't , " Kermit replied . " You are not too bright , I gather , but you have your own charm , and an air of . . . innocuous fellowship . " " You do n't do anything disgusting like embalm people here , do you ? " Malcolm wanted to know . " Oh , back to Estel Blanc again , " Kermit scolded . " No , as I told you , I am an oil painter , though nobody ever buys anything that I paint . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Malcolm informed him . " Of course , I had never known an undertakereither until the other day . " Suddenly they both heard loud outcries in the back room , and soon Laureen rushed out , her hair down , and her dress torn , holding her arm , which had blood on it . " Peter bit me and scratched me , " she cried . She seemed near hysterics . " Fetch that pitcher over there , " Kermit ordered Malcolm . Malcolm brought the pitcher to Kermit and the latter quickly threw the contents on Laureen . The water , or whatever it was in the pitcher , was a sooty color and when it had covered her head completely , Malcolmthought that Laureen resembled ever so noticeably Cora Naldi , but of course the two ladies were not at allp36alike , and Laureen wore no wig , and probably could not sing a note . Laureen continued to cry even after the water had been thrown on her , but she was less vociferous . " Now come over here and sit down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kermit told his wife . Laureen obeyed him , and once seated on the stool , she complained softly : " Why ca n't we get rid of those beasts ! They invariably bite and take their spite out on me . " " You must learn to live with them , and love them , dolly , " Kermit said , using the same pet name which she had awhile before employed for him . He kissed Laureen gently on the hair . " Live and love , dolly , " Kermit told his wife . They had both almost completely forgotten Malcolm , who was kept standing up waiting to be recognized , and who finally after several minutes walked slowly over to the front door . " Good night then , " Malcolm cried after several minutes more of waiting , during which the married couple cooed and embraced . " Oh , Malcolm , " Kermit cried . " You 're not going ! " " I see a cab outside , " the boy cried , " and I do n't like tobe away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kermit expostulated . " I 'll be back , though , " Malcolm said . " That is , if you will let me . " " But the evening is still young , " Kermit explained . Then , resigned to Malcolm 's going : " You do n't know what marriageis , " Kermit called helplessly from his position with Laureen . " But do come again , dear boy . You 're awfully different , and it 's been more than enjoyable . " " Yes , do come again , dear Malcolm , " Laureen cried to him . " And forgive our not getting up . You 'll understand when you 're married , though . "  | " Do call us , dear Malcolm , " Kermit shouted from beneath the heavy embrace of his wife . " Thank you for the evening . Thank you for everything , " Malcolm cried , going out . " Good night to both of you . "  |p38Now  that Malcolm was going out into the great world , so to speak , he felt compelled to write down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , for he was sure they were very important , and would be even still more so in the future . But as he had never been to school regularly owing to his having always been travelling with his father , or waiting for his father to return , he had very little command of language , and could seldom do more than copy down some of the things which his new friends , especially Professor Cox , said . However , after his meeting with Kermit Raphaelson , Malcolm wrote down a statement original to him , whichp39was found later among his effects : " Married love is the strangest thing of all . " Meanwhile , a small envelope had arrived from ProfessorCox , containing Address No. 3 , but Malcolm did not open this immediately , but put it in his breast pocket for later study . The next day , on the bench , Mr. Cox questioned Malcolmconcerning his visit to the Raphaelsons . Pleased that Malcolm had been successful there , Mr. Cox sighed with relief : " If you had n't got on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear boy , " and he shook his finger at Malcolm , " I would , I am afraid , have had to give you up . " " Entirely ? " Malcolm cried . " Entirely , " Mr. Cox said . " I was talking it over with my wife only last night . If he fails again , I said . . . " " You mean there is a Mrs. Cox ! " Malcolm was thunderstruck , for it never occurred to him that an astrologer would have a wife . " Of course , " Mr. Cox replied . " Everybody is married , Malcolm . Everybody that counts . And you will have to beginthinking about it , too . " " But what would I have done . . . if you had given me up ? " Malcolm wondered almost to himself . " I mean , what would I have done about addresses ! " Mr. Cox smiled . " Well , " the astrologer mused , " you 've got to remember , sir , that you have been off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , sink or swim , as the old saw has it , you would have swum . " " Thank you , " Malcolm said . Then turning his attention to what puzzled him very much , Malcolm went on : " I do n't understand why Kermit will not admit he is a midget . " Mr. Cox whistled shrilly . " He has a certain personalp40right to deny it , if he wishes to , " he said , an air of dubiety about him . " I asked him if he was one , and he was firm about not beingone at all , " Malcolm expostulated . " That is so like Kermit , " Mr. Cox agreed . " He has never told anybody that he is a midget . His mother evidently never told him he was one , and never referred to it , so that when finally he grew up ,  --  well , he did n't actually know it , his life had been that sheltered . Laureen proposed to him when he was only 17 , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , much less , in fact , than you , for at least you have travelled with your father . " " Yes , " Malcolm agreed . " I have seen things around me to a greater extent than the little man . " Mr. Cox looked away toward the sky-line in the manner of one who has a matter of persistent concern there . " You 're not leaving so soon , sir ! " Malcolm exclaimed , for he had a hundred questions to ask of Mr. Cox . " The day will come , " Mr. Cox went on , just as though he had not heard Malcolm 's question at all , " the day will come when he will have to admit he is a midget , and go on from there . " " He ca n't just go on acting like a little man , you mean ? " Malcolm put the question to him . " Not if he is the only one who believes it ! " the astrologer answered immediately . Mr. Cox took out his small notebook with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something hurriedly on one of the pages inside . Then turning his attention briefly to Malcolm , he said : " Now that you have Kermit to visit , I wo n't be spending quite so much time with you here on the bench . . . " " And I can not visit you , and your wife ? " Malcolm tested Mr. Cox again.  | " Quite out of the question now , " Mr. Cox said . " Our relationshipmust remain on a certain professional level . " " I see , " Malcolm said . " But I think you are beginning to win through , " Mr. Cox told him enthusiastically , and shaking hands he took leave of his young friend . " Do n't forget Address No. 3 : they 're quite ready for you , you know ! " he said in parting . " I knew you would not fail me , " Kermit exclaimed when he saw Malcolm entering the door of his studio . " Come in at once . " The little man dropped his paint brush , pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting , and advanced toward his friend . " But what 's happened to everything ? " Malcolm wondered , for nearly everything in the studio had been broken , or thrown about : the plaster casts of gods , masks of celebrities , canvasses , articles of furniture  --  all lay strewn and dismembered as in a junk shop . Kermit did not say anything for a moment , then as Malcolmcontinued to gaze wonderingly at him , the little man explained : " Laureen has left me . " " Left you ? " Malcolm considered this with astonishment . " Oh , what 's so surprising about that , " Kermit added , a new kind of bitter quality in his manner . He ushered the boy to a seat . Kermit sat down now also , on his specially designed chair , but a different one from the fancy carved chair he had sat on at his first meeting with Malcolm . " What beautiful chairs you always sit in , " Malcolm said . " I make them myself , " Kermit explained , without enthusiasm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Kermit went on , indifferently , " I have a whole carpentry shop in the back where I make things such as you see around you . It 's closed just now . That is , the cats are living out there . . . Before I married Laureen , the cats lived wherever I was , that is , throughout the whole studio , but when she came things had to change . She demandedaffection at first of all the cats , and then she was partial to Peter and cruel to the others . Then she tired of Peter and was cruel to him and kind to the others . Finally , she was cruel to all of them . They wearied her . The same treatment was accorded to me . " " I ca n't get over that you are married at all , " Malcolm exclaimed . A flicker of displeasure crossed Kermit 's face . " I mean , " Malcolm saw the look , " you could have perhaps . . . waited . " " I think that is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kermit said , somewhat enigmatically . " But then who should I have married ? " he added as an afterthought , perhaps to himself . Kermit clapped his hands , and a young man without a shirt on appeared . " Ginger beer for two people , " Kermit commanded . " Who on earth is that ? " Malcolm wondered . " He is my morning servant , " Kermit explained absentmindedly . " He has such a powerful build , " Malcolm noted . " He is planning to open a gymnasium in the fall , " Kermitexplained , " and of course he has to look the part if he is to get pupils . But you do like ginger beer , do n't you ? " Kermit said , a bit more affable again . " I do n't know that my father and I ever drank ginger beer , " Malcolm studied Kermit 's question perhaps a bit too pedantically to suit his small host.  |p43Kermit  merely said , " Your father , I see , " and then added quickly : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Yes , we  --  that is I , now , have always lived in hotels . Big ones and little ones . But now that my father is no longer here , my money is beginning to go , and  --  " Malcolm said no more , a look of surprise and horror on his face at the thought that his money would , one day , all go . Kermit was about to say something comforting when the half-naked young man came in with a tray containing the ginger beer . But as Malcolm looked again he was almost certain that the young man had nothing on at all , the way the light now fell on him . In this morning light , too , Kermit looked a good deal older , and crosser : he looked about twenty-two . The young undressed man did not seem to know how to talk , but he poured and filled with ice the ginger beer in a professional and efficient manner . Kermit kept looking irritably from Malcolm to the young servant , and from the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your father probably would not approve of my introducingyou to a morning servant , but I feel your education could be extended , as does Professor Cox , so therefore I introduce you to O'Reilly Morgan . O'Reilly  --  Malcolm . " O'Reilly Morgan , the morning servant , nodded politely and said pleased and great morning and Malcolm began to get up to shake hands , but Kermit shook his head at him , meaning that would not be necessary and pray keep his seat . " Would n't O'Reilly Morgan care to have some ginger beer with us ? " Malcolm inquired when the servant had gone out of the room . Kermit swallowed some of the beer very fast and choked a little . Then frowning severely , he said quickly :  | " Another time , perhaps . Just now I have to explain the very bad news to you about Laureen . And I do n't want him to hear , " and Kermit gestured in the direction of the kitchen and O'Reilly . Kermit rapped vigorously on his chair arm , for Malcolm'sattention had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to give me your undivided attention , " Kermit said . " I have a very important thing to communicate , and I do n't want to shout . " " But what is it ? " Malcolm leaned forward , and he felt again that he was beginning life . " I must tell you how Laureen left me , " Kermit cried , and he was very pale , as pale as if he had said he had killed her . " You saw her last time just before the act , so to speak , and just when I thought she loved me the most . She 's betrayedme , you see , from the first , and at last , she has betrayedme completely by leaving . " " She discovered who you were then ? " Malcolm asked , eager to understand . " Who I was ? " Kermit 's voice shook . " I mean . . . I . . . , " Malcolm faltered . " Say exactly what you mean , " Kermit cried , and he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his further confusionthat Kermit was scarcely any taller standing up than when he had been sitting down . Malcolm 's look of surprise only increased , if anything , Kermit 's ill-temper . " Say exactly what you are thinking . I command it ! " Kermit said . " I only meant , " Malcolm winced , " she discovered at last  --  well , as Mr. Cox says , that you are a . . . " " A midget ! A midget ! " Kermit roared . " Is that what the old pederast calls me behind my back ? " " Old what ? " Malcolm cried , but his question wasp45drowned in a loud crash , that of Kermit 's throwing to the floor the entire tray containing the ginger beer bottles . O'Reilly quickly entered the room , but as quickly retreated . Kermit had , however , sat down again and was weeping quietly , but with a modicum of control . Malcolm came over to where the little man sat , but the latter vociferated at him : " Do n't touch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You use such difficult words this morning , " Malcolm complained , almost weeping himself . Suddenly Kermit seized Malcolm 's hand , and said in an imploring voice : " Why did she do it , Malcolm , when she was all I had ? " Malcolm wished to say something consoling , but he was afraid that he would again bring out the wrong word at such a dramatic moment . O'Reilly again entered the room , this time wearing a kimono , and carrying a small tray with a medicine bottle . He handed Kermit a tiny pill , which the little man took perfunctorily , and swallowed , refusing the water the servant proffered him . O'Reilly immediately withdrew again . " Oh , I had n't loved Laureen in months , " Kermit went on , steadier now . " She had lost her sparkle , and she almost disgusted me at times . But I had got so used to her and her waiting on me . I will not pretend about myself . I had come to expect her help , Malcolm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Malcolm nodded soberly . Then wanting to say somethingencouraging , the boy said : " Kermit , you do n't have the voice of a midget : you have the voice of a very young man . " Kermit 's mouth opened slowly and closed , but he didp46not appear to have heard the compliment . He continued : " When Laureen left me last night , I seemed suddenly to have reached my majority in age . I realized that I was beginninglife at last . Alone , as everybody is . " " And it 's pretty scary , " Malcolm volunteered . Kermit scrutinized the boy slowly in the manner of one who is seeing him for the first time . " We are both alone , " Kermit mused . " How fortunate , after all , that Professor Cox exists and that he brought us together . We are both in an impossible situation . " " Certainly I am , " Malcolm affirmed . " But why you more than I ? " Kermit was put out with the boy . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at your art , and your chair-making . And your marriage , which means you know women . I have nothing . I can do nothing . All I have is the memory of my father . My father  --  " " Shit on your father ! " Kermit cried at him . Malcolm stood up mechanically , white with terror , and trembling all over . There was a total silence in the room . Kermit got up slowly and came over to Malcolm . His head reached only to the boy 's waist and prevented him , humiliatingly enough , from speaking directly to Malcolm 's face : his words , in fact , addressed themselves to his navel . Kermit could only tug at the tall boy 's trouser legs . " Malcolm , " he cried , " you must forget I ever said it ! " Malcolm moved away from him , and sat down in a straight-back chair some feet away from where the midget was now left standing alone . " You must listen to me , and you must forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant like something heard in a deserted subway station.  |p47Malcolm  tapped on the wood of the chair with his index finger . " You must listen to my apology , dear Malcolm , " Kermit pleaded , and he had quit crying . " How can I ever listen to you again ? " Malcolm finally spoke . " And how can I forgive you ? To have said that about my father . This is the last straw of what can happen to me . I must pack and leave the city today . Why I have stayed this long here I do n't know . And on a bench to boot . " " Listen to my apology at least , " Kermit begged , and he actually raced over to where Malcolm was sitting so stiffly , and pulled savagely on Malcolm 's jacket . " You have no right to desert me , " Kermit protested . " We 're under the same star ! " " Is this some of Mr. Cox 's astrology now ? " Malcolm wondered bitterly . " Malcolm , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my entire world by admitting who I really am . And I 'm depending on you so . I have nobody else to depend on ! " " A likely story coming from a man who insults the dead , " Malcolm said . " I apologize . I apologize from the heart . Do n't I know that your father was a princely type , judging by the son . Do n't I see breeding and culture in every line of your face . " Malcolm nodded slightly . " Then do n't torture me any further , and forgive me . " " I do n't know whether I can forgive you or not , Kermit . I do n't know what my father would have done under the circumstances . If you had just said damn his hide or to hell with him that would have been terrible enough ! " And Malcolmagain shivered with horror . " I meant really nothing but irritation , not irritation against you and certainly not against your father . "  | " Very well , then , Kermit , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed the boy 's shoulder in a token of gratitude . " Laureen ! Laureen ! " Kermit began muttering now , walking about the studio , and tapping his forehead from time to time . " Did I tell you who she ran away with ? " Kermitinquired suddenly . " She ran off with somebody ? " Malcolm inquired . " How else would she go ! " Kermit thundered , some ofhis old anger coming back . " She ran off with a Japanesewrestler . . . " Malcolm lowered his head , too tired now to take in any more of the complex events of the world . But after a moment he found the strength to inquire : " Was he  --  the Japanese wrestler  --  also a small man ? " Kermit gazed at Malcolm for an interminable length of time , before replying : " He was the usual size for a man , " and he spoke with great dryness and restraint . " But Laureen will eventually return to you , " Malcolm offered this weak consolation . " Not Laureen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prehusband , her breaking-in man . Now she has gone on to the real thing , as she said when she left . She 's gone on to the  --  well , why not say it in front of children  --  " he spoke almost to himself . " She 's gone on to the real equipment ! " And Kermit became plunged into the deepest gloomp49The third address from Professor Cox had been written with a flourish of the pen which swooped down on the marginof the pale green paper like a finger of warning . It said merely : MADAME GIRARDTHE CHATEAU " But it does n't tell where , " Malcolm had exclaimed in his hotel suite . Going out into the street , he had summoned a cab , and consulted with the driver concerning the address . The driver had immediately recognized it , to Malcolm 's relief ,  |p50and  told the boy that it was the best address , perhaps the only real address in the city , and certainly the only one for high-livers , he told Malcolm , with a slight note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a white door on the boy , and Malcolm was taken immediately upwards in a green and gold elevator which smelled strongly of patchouliand rose water . The footman directed Malcolm , when he had alighted from the elevator , to a very narrow but very tall door , which looked more like a linen chute than an entrance . On the door , showing unmistakably it was the right one , was a message written on thick letter paper : MALCOLM : YOU ARE EXPECTED : MADAME GIRARD . The footman said goodnight , and disappeared into the elevator . Malcolm opened the door , and as he did so pushed his face into that of a young man in a Texas hat . " You 're Malcolm ! " the young man , who had a very flushed face , and who was carrying a tall iced drink , said . " How did you know me ? " Malcolm wondered , but the young man began pulling him up an additional staircase , without replying to his question . " Madame Girard is demanding a settlement from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkling the ice in his drink . " You 're just in time for the evening per-formance . " Malcolm and the young man now entered a room almost as large as a cathedral . Madame Girard herself faced them . She was dressed in a riding outfit , and her riding whip lay at her feet , together with several bottles , some empty , some half full . Her face was scratched , so that one would have suspected she had ridden through brambles , and her makeup was smearedp51so unevenly across her face and mouth that she resembled a clown more than a woman . Malcolm wished immediatelythat the beautiful riding habit which Madame Girard was wearing could have been bestowed on Kermit , for he was sure the midget would have looked better in it than Madame Girard . " Who admitted this child ? " Madame Girard demanded , picking up a glass of plain vodka . Mr. Girard , her husband , a short man of middle years , with a distinguished brow , now came forward to explain to his wife : " Professor Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be received . " Mr. Girard bowed to Malcolm and went to take his hand , but Malcolm had got both his own hands so tightly enmeshed in his trouser pockets  --  for the suit he was wearingwas an old one which his father had picked out for him some time back , and it was becoming too small  --  that he was unable to return Mr. Girard 's greeting and handclasp . " And who gave you leave , sir , to accept invitations by proxy for me ? " Madame Girard demanded of her husband . " I have a great mind to take proceedings against you , with reference to the matter which we discussed earlier in the evening ! " " Please try to be more hospitable , Doddy , " Mr. Girard addressed his wife . " Do n't use pet names for me in front of strangers , " MadameGirard cautioned her husband . " Sit down please a moment , " Madame Girard commanded Malcolm , and she went up close to him to get a better look . As Malcolm looked hastily about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ocean and the lights of cities  --  he caught sight of at least ten young men who were all seated on identical straight-back chairs  --   |p52all  facing Madame Girard , the sole member of her sex in the room  --  and all silent , like a mute chorus . " Are all these gentlemen friends of Mr. Cox ? " Malcolm said in a loud voice , for he did not feel at all comfortable in such a charged atmosphere . Everybody laughed at his remark  --  theten young men laughing together very much like a chorus  --  all except Mr. Girard , who looked down at the carpet . " Why is it you are not entering into the spirit of the party ? " Madame Girard asked her husband . " Do you want me to begin proceedings against you at once ? " Mr. Girard put his pipe into his mouth without looking away from the carpet . Malcolm said in his same loud voice : " I had no idea it was going to be like this . " " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you call it , " Malcolmreplied . He was not impressed with Madame Girard or her friends , the young men , and he showed it . " We are here for the sole purpose of considering taking proceedings against my husband , " Madame Girard spoke gravely , " and I think I can do this quite properly without comments from the newly-arrived . " " Perhaps Mr. Girard may want a divorce first , " Malcolm said , and again there was a chorus of laughter from the young men seated on the chairs , and Mr. Girard himself this time smiled from behind his pipe . " As you may not know , " Malcolm began , addressing himself to everyone present , and still employing his loud voice , " Mr. Cox , the well-known astrologer , is introducing me to all of his friends this year in the hopes that I may be a little less inclined to be lonely . " " That follows , " Madame Girard tasted her vodka loudly . " You must drink a great deal , Madame Girard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , and therep53were again cries of laughter , but greatly muffled this time , while Mr. Girard bit his pipe and looked away toward a row of vases all filled with fresh garnet roses . " What was it you said ? " Madame Girard inquired , a kind of stunned craftiness in her voice , like one who must discover the precise detail which will convict her enemy . " I think you are intoxicated , madame , " Malcolm said . The laughter from the young men now became unrestrained . " Do you realize in whose home you are ? " Madame Girard said in a breathless voice . And in still lower tones : " And do you realize who I am ? " Malcolm nodded , and said : " This is the third place I 've visited at Mr. Cox 's request "  --  and he turned to face everybody in the room  --  " but I ca n't say it is the most pleasantor comfortable of the three . " " Hear him ? " Madame Girard cried , standing up now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only a critic , but a spy ! A spy of Mr. Cox 's , that 's it . . . Throw him out ! Throw him out ! " " Doddy , dear , " Mr. Girard begged her , walking over to his wife and putting his hand on her arm gently . Madame Girard sat down quickly perhaps because she was beginning to lose her balance rather than because she wished to obey her husband . " I believe I have heard mention of your father , " Mr. Girard changed the topic of conversation , addressing Malcolmdirectly . " He 's a spy from old Mr. Cox ! " Madame Girard began again , for she did not like the topic of conversation to be changed without her giving the cue . A faint tittering from the young men came and went . " You really knew my father ! " Malcolm was all ears , but he did not say this with quite the enthusiasm he mightp54have shown a few days earlier . Malcolm suddenly felt  --  even as he spoke to Mr. Girard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own memory , and so he sipped the drink of vodka which a servant had just handed him . " I do not think your father exists , " Madame Girard cried , lifting her glass again . " I have never thought he did . " Malcolm swallowed hard , then opened his mouth to say something . " And what is more , " Madame Girard continued to hold the floor , " nobody thinks he exists , or ever did exist . " " That 's . . . that 's . . . blasphemy . . . or a thing above it ! " Malcolm cried , standing up , while Mr. Girard went up to him and attempted to say something quietly in his ear . " And this is the first time where I have ever attended a . . . a . . . meeting , " Malcolm chose this word after looking at all the young men on chairs  --  " a meeting where the person in charge was . . . drunk . " And Malcolm again turned his attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " As I said earlier in the evening , " Madame Girard turned her full attention now to the young men on the chairs , " I have no choice . I must take proceedings against Mr. Gi-rard . " " Doddy , dear , " Mr. Girard implored . " You do not need to take proceedings tonight . . . " He took her glass of vodka from her and handed it to a servant who was passing by at that second . " An enemy ! A husband ! " Madame Girard commented , narrowing her eyes . Suddenly she began to weep , and all the young men exceptMalcolm looked very uncomfortable , while the latter , on the contrary , moved his chair a bit closer now to be able to study Madame Girard 's features better . " All my young beauties on their uncomfortable straightp55chairs  --  see how I am suffering ! " Madame Girard implored them . " Come and comfort me , beauties , " she cried , stretching out her arms to the young men . " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Malcolm pointed out to Mr. Girard . Madame Girard stopped crying for a minute , and then asked her husband if he had a handkerchief , which he immediatelyproduced from his breast pocket and handed to her . " Wipe my face free of any blemishes , " she commanded him . " Oh , I 've been through so much , " Madame Girard told the room , as Mr. Girard wiped her face free of the mascara and the rouge . " Nobody knows what I have suffered ! That is why I feel so often I must start proceedings . There ought to be a reckoning for such suffering . " " Doddy , " Mr. Girard said softly to his wife . " And with this spy here from Mr. Cox , " she began whimpering again . " He will go directly again to that old fraud and tell him everything about this evening , and then Cox , blast him , will call all of his clients and tell them how I was not at the top of my form this evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing up , and coming over to Madame Girard , who seemed surprised and perhaps frightened that he drew so close to her , " why did Mr. Cox send me here ? " " Why ? " Madame Girard thundered at him . " You mean you are actually as stupid as everybody says you are ! Why ? Have I not given you the reason a score of times this evening . Yes , it is true , what everybody says about you , you have no mind . But you are Mr. Cox 's spy , whether you know it or not . For he must have information at any cost . . . And to think I am not in top form ! " She now wept uncontrolledly . Mr. Girard was so upset that as a special concession top56Madame Girard he now brought her a small glass of French champagne , which she sipped , while he assiduouslydried her tears with his handkerchief . Mr. Girard at the same time motioned for Madame Girard 's young " beauties " to leave their straight-backed chairs and gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she saw the young men surrounding her in a circle , in the center of which now stood Malcolm . " Why ? why ? " Madame Girard turned to her husband , " did you spoil this beautiful evening by introducing a spy in our midst , " and she pointed again at Malcolm . " You are not going to order me out then like Estel Blanc ? " Malcolm asked , despondency and gloominess in his voice . " Estel Blanc , " Madame Girard cried , stung to the quick . " Oh merciful God ! " and she burst again into weeping . " You should have never mentioned his name to her , " Mr. Girard was both reproving and apologetic . " She fears him more than anybody else . " " You see , " Madame Girard explained , when she had recovered from her new fit of tears , " this child knows only the worst people , and knows , indeed , only my enemies . Oh , make him leave , Girard , for pity 's sake , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of position , " Mr. Girard begged her . " Remember society , if you will not rememberyour position . " " Oh , it 's so hard to bear one 's burdens some times , " she said , drinking more of her champagne . " And we do n't need him , " she pointed to Malcolm . " Do n't I have my beauties already ? "  --  here she recognized with a peremptory nod the young men  --  " Why are n't they enough . Why must we have a paid informer in the shape of this brainless , mindless , but  --  " and here Madame Girard paused as if seeingp57Malcolm for the very first time  --  " this very beautiful young boy ? " " Perhaps we should all drink to Madame Girard ! " Malcolmcried , astonished at her lightning change of attitude toward him , and he raised his glass , and even as he did so , everybody could see that he was quite drunk himself . " My dear , dear young friend , " Madame Girard cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Girard now raised their glasses , and Malcolm , too , with some difficulty raised his again , got his glass to his lips , drained it , while a servant immediately replenished his glass for him , at a sign from Madame Girard . " Leave Mr. Cox , " Madame Girard addressed Malcolm . " Be my own , and not his . " " Let us all drink again to Madame Girard , " Mr. Girard cried nervously , and the young men all gathered round him , and some patted him on the back , relieved at the breaking of the tension in the room . " Do you know , my young , my very young dear friend , the company you are keeping ? " Madame Girard stood up now , seized one of the garnet roses from a vase , and in a twinkling had pushed it into Malcolm 's hitherto unused lapel . Malcolm kissed Madame Girard lightly on her cheek , reeling toward her . " Answer my question , wonderful young man , " Madame Girard demanded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company you keep ? Do you know , dear boy , what Mr. Cox himself is ? " she cried . " Why , a pederast , of course , " Malcolm reeled , his piercingloud voice a bit shaky and thick . " What ! " everybody cried at once , and the young men stared at one another in open-mouthed astonishment and disbelief.  | " What word did I hear ? " Madame Girard exclaimed , a bemused smile lifting her cheeks . " I do n't intend to repeat myself ! " Malcolm cried , draininghis glass . " My father never did ! . . . Hurrah ! " he shouted , and suddenly he fell to the floor in a sitting posture . Madame Girard rose from her chair , pushing aside the ten " beauties " and her husband , went swiftly over to where Malcolm lay slowly sinking into her thick carpet , and like a woman who has decided at last to come to terms with her own fresh decision , she bent low over the boy , a complete change of will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if seeing him for the first time , she held her hands to her breast , the change in her mind registering itself now in her heart : " You are a real prince , Malcolm , " she cried . " Oh , forgive me . An authentic  --  " And Madame Girard muffled the word she was saying by kissing him vociferously on his hair as he lay staring at her from his sitting posture . " Royalty ! " she cried pointing out Malcolm to the other guests staring anxiously at them both . " Royalty . "  |p59Malcolm  passed the next few days talking from time to time with Mr. Cox , who stood as usual before the boy , while the latter was seated on his bench , and in writing down his " conversations " with the personages of the addresses . Mr. Cox agreed that Address No. 4 should not be given to Malcolm until he had completely digested the scenes and significance of the first three addresses . Then , shortly after this , one late evening , Malcolm was surprised when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sea-shells which his father had bought him when they had been on their travels , he heard throughp60the incrustaceans of the shells , the uncommon sound of the telephone ringing . Answering it , he was still more surprised to hear the voice of Mr. Girard , who was , he said , telephoning him from the lobby of the hotel . " Can I see you , Malcolm ? " Mr. Girard was sober and prepossessed , as always , for although he may have been accustomed to consume as much alcohol as Madame Girard , his strong will resisted all stimulants . It was Malcolm who was not at ease , for it was the first time anybody had ever telephoned to see him since the days his father often dropped in unexpectedly from Denveror San Francisco from a business deal . Helplessly listening to Mr. Girard on the phone , Malcolm was not able to reply at once , owing to his confusion . Mr. Girard , hearing only Malcolm 's breathing on the other end of the wire , and no response to his inquiry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated his wish to see the boy . " I do n't see why you ca n't see me , if you do n't mind seeing me just dressed in my bathrobe , " Malcolm finally said . " I will be right up then , " Mr. Girard told him . In Malcolm 's suite , Mr. Girard looked much younger and more handsome , but also , oddly enough , more carewornand worried than he had in the Chateau . He seemed at home in the large faded elegance of Malcolm'shotel suite , and Malcolm immediately offered him a tumbler of ice water . " I felt somehow we were of the same station in life , " Mr. Girard began , and he took a seat on the divan "  --  even though I am so much older than you . How old are you , Malcolm ? " he wondered.  |p61Malcolm  swallowed , and moved his fingers , like one who is counting . " Fifteen , sir , " the boy replied . Mr. Girard looked at him hesitatingly . " That is , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm added . " I see , " Mr. Girard said . " And it is now June , is n't it ? . . . Well , you see , I am thirty-seven , so that I am easily old enough to be your father . " " Yes , you are , I see , " Malcolm answered . " My father , however , looked older , though perhaps stronger , than you . He looked nearly forty . " " I hope I have not disturbed you , " Mr. Girard continued . " But my coming is dictated by an emergency . " " Nothing serious ? " Malcolm expressed concern . " MadameGirard has not taken ill or died ? " " Madame Girard is home sleeping in her private wing of the Chateau , " Mr. Girard replied . " I simply came here to make a very unusual suggestion to you , and I hope you will hear me out . I have come , though  --  I must make clear  --  on my own volition , despite the fact that Madame Girard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead with his pocket handkerchief . " You seem , Malcolm , so close to me in general backgroundand point of view , and Madame Girard has taken such an immediate and violent fancy to you , also , that we wondered  --  " and here Mr. Girard took out a small silver box which contained some pastilles and popped one hurriedly into his mouth  --  " we wondered if you would care to come with us to our country house for the summer . Everything would be taken care of , of course , and you would not have to give up your hotel suite , as I would be glad to take all responsibility with regard to that . . . "  | " Why , I am speechless with surprise at your generosity , " Malcolm exclaimed , and he got up and walked about the room for a minute or two . " Would you care to listen to one of my sea-shells for a moment ? " Malcolm offered one of the larger shells . " Are you paying close attention to what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit grave at that moment , and he did not accept the proffered sea-shell . " Oh , yes , sir , very close attention , " Malcolm replied . " Nobody has ever invited me anywhere , you see , except my father . I have not been out of this hotel , mind you , except to go occasionally to other hotels  --  that is , until I met Mr. Cox . " Mr. Girard tapped somewhat impatiently on the wooden end of the divan . " You will make both me and my wife very happy if you will come , " Mr. Girard said in the manner of a man concludingan agreement . " And we may expect you then ? " " But I would have to leave all of my new friends ! " Malcolmcried out . " Your new friends ? " Mr. Girard said with the surprise of a man who hears something totally unforeseen and somethinguncalled for , to boot . " Kermit Raphaelson and Mr. Cox , especially , " Malcolm informed him . " I do n't count Estel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twenty years , as he said himself , that might be a possibility . " " I do n't recognize these people except by name , " Mr. Girard was somewhat withdrawn now . " You see , Malcolm , I am often gone , and do n't always get to know my wife 's friends . Often , in fact , I 've never heard their names and then returning late to the Chateau from a long trip , I meet them face to face for the first time . And often I never see them again after our first meeting . "  | " You do n't seem to care , then , for the friends of others , " Malcolm observed . " Well , dear Malcolm , I wo n't deny that I have never liked any of my wife 's friends . You are the first . " " You mean , you really are in earnest about me ? " Malcolmwas surprised . " Why , of course I am in earnest ! " Mr. Girard replied a bit hotly . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Girard , sir , you do not understand , " Malcolm assured him . " Until I met Mr. Cox on the bench my whole life was just this hotel suite . There was nothing much to it . And now suddenly , invitations from everywhere , people ringing me up at midnight . There is almost too much of it . " And Malcolm went up and shook Mr. Girard 's hand , who , not being exactly ready for such a display of etiquette , stood up , and his sudden raising of his knees pushed the boy away from him , so that the latter came close to losing his balance . Mr. Girard remained standing in this awkward posture . " I feel , Mr. Girard , sir , " Malcolm said , recovering his composure , " that life is actually beginning . " " I feel very much the same as you , Malcolm , " Mr. Girard replied , " and although my life is over in the sense of a beginning , I seem to see it starting all over again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . But as I said earlier in the evening , I believe that you are in my own generalsituation and in my part of the world . " " Thanks to my father , " Malcolm said . " No , not thanks to your father , " Mr. Girard assured him . " Thanks to you . It is to you we all look , and not your father . " " That is very hard for me to believe , Mr. Girard , " Malcolmsaid.  | " What is hard ? " Mr. Girard questioned , concern written all over his face . " That you place such a high estimate on me , sir . You see , my difficulty is I can hardly place any estimate on myself . I hardly feel I exist . " " You feel you do n't exist ? " Mr. Girard weighed the boy 's words . " That 's right . And when other people pay so much attention to me all at once , I feel something has gone wrong somewhere . . . " " Everybody is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At leastwe are , and I am certain everybody else must be likewise . " " Thank you , Mr. Girard , sir , " and Malcolm lookeddown at the gold embroidery on his dressing gown . " Then you will accept the invitation , Malcolm ? " " I will be happy to accept it , Mr. Girard . " " Please call me by my first name , although I am more than twenty years older than you . " " What is your first name ? " Malcolm wondered somewhat bashfully , hesitating to ask such a question of so great a man . " Girard , " Mr. Girard said . " But that is your last name , sir ? " " My last name and my first name are the same . " " You mean you are  --  " " Girard Girard , that is right . When I was a young man , it was very hard to bear , but now that I 'm old , I like it . " " You are a very likeable old man , " Malcolm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is one of the reasons I wanted you to come with us . My wife , however , is very much the partisan of you . " " She is ? " Malcolm swallowed , hesitating on the word partisan . " Thank her , please . " " Now when do you think you can make your little visit ? " Girard said.  | " Oh , I ca n't come , " Malcolm replied firmly . " What ? " Girard said , a note of imperious anger in his voice , so that he assumed his full character as billionaire and magnate in one change of expression . " It has nothing to do with you , " Malcolm said calmly walking up and down the room . Mr. Girard drank all of the ice water in his glass , opened his pastille box with a snap , looked into it , took nothing out this time , and closed it with another snap . Malcolm was somewhat taken aback at how fierce Girard looked at that moment . " I ca n't leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I can just walk out on Kermit and Mr. Cox . " " Well , bring them along with you , " Mr. Girard expressed some relief  --  " if that 's all ! " " I do n't even know whether I can call you Girard , sir , " Malcolm went on . " Because of my extreme age ? " Girard wondered . " I do n't know what it is , sir , " Malcolm said . " Maybe becauseto address you so sounds . . . insubordinate , I believethey say . " Girard Girard stopped , then said : " Well , who the devil cares what you call me . Call me anything or nothing , but come ! " Mr. Girard tried to smile and look pleasant . " You see , " Malcolm continued , " I 'm terribly afraid of leaving here where I 'm always alone , and waiting , and goingto where people may demand me at all hours . . . " " No one will demand anything of you that you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm felt that the great man 's patience was rapidly diminishing . " I must turn down your kind invitation , " Malcolm summonedall his bravery . " There must be some other reason which you are not giving . "  | " No , Girard , " Malcolm made the effort with his name  --  " there is none . I ca n't explain the reason except that it has something to do with the bench , Mr. Cox 's instructions , and also my new friend , Kermit , who , by the way , must be very hurt that he has never been invited to the Chateau to meet Madame Girard , and of course , sir , you . . . " " I see , " Girard said , ignoring nearly everything Malcolm had said . However , he made no motion to leave . " I want to please you very much , " Malcolm said after a long silence . " And Madame Girard , too , though I do n't know why I want to please her , except I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a loud voice . " I want to come , " Malcolm told him . " But I 'm afraid I ca n't . " " What then are you afraid of ? " Girard now thundered . " I believe , sir , as I said , it has something to do with leavingthe bench . " " Do n't call me sir ! " Girard commanded with icy severity . " And what in hell is this bench . . . " " The bench . . . from where I get all the addresses . Where , in fact , I got yours , Girard Girard ! " Girard knitted his brow . " My head is still spinning from all the addresses , those past and to come . . . And there are dozens more yet . Perhapshundreds . You must give me time , Girard Girard . " " But what in thunderation is this bench ? " Girard was less angry now . " It 's below the hotel where I always waited for my father to come home . " Mr. Girard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to anybody since my father 's disappearanceand/or death when Mr. Cox tried to introduceme to life and people . " " Mr. Cox ! " Girard threw up his hands.  | " My father 's death has left me  --  " " Exactly ! " Girard interrupted . " Going to the country with us is precisely what you need . " But there was now no conviction or feeling in the billionaire'svoice . Instead there was hesitancy , and sadness . " We will be your father and your friends , " Girard said finally . He went up to Malcolm and was about to put his hand on the boy 's shoulder , when , changing his mind , he allowed his hand merely to fall downward like a benediction . " At least consider it , " Girard said . " I will , " Malcolm replied . " And do n't look so sad , " Girard admonished him . " I never knew , of course , about the bench or I would have been more careful about what I said . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , " the elder man replied . " And I am so grateful for your visit , " Malcolm went on . " Please do n't tell anybody what I have said here to you . You see , Mr. Cox knows everything about me , though I have not told him a thing . He just knows it . As an astrologer , you see . . . " Girard did not reply to this , but instead went on to talk about Malcolm 's possible visit . " You must inform Madame Girard as soon as possible . We hope to leave any day now , and we must have you in the bargain . " " I will give it my undivided attention , " Malcolm said . " That 's right , that is what you should do , " Girard said . " Sleep on it , as they say . " Malcolm yawned . " Good night , " Girard said . " And remember , you are ours . " Malcolm said goodnight and opened the door for Girard onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a very good night . "  |p68Malcolm  had slept until past two o'clock in the afternoon because of the lateness of Girard Girard 's visit , so that any meeting with Mr. Cox on the bench did not seem feasible . Malcolm did not reach the bench , in fact , until nearly four o'clock , and by then he sensed that the astrologer had come and gone . Malcolm walked resolutely therefore to Kermit 's , rehearsingas he went the exact words he would use to tell the midget of his last night 's visitor . It was no real surprise for Malcolm , however , on enteringthe studio to find both Kermit and Mr. Cox engaged in what appeared to be a very close tete-a-tete . They both1p69looked somewhat guilty on seeing Malcolm , perhaps becausethey were then talking about him . " Where were you at the appointed hour ? " Mr. Cox assailedMalcolm . " I waited for you for nearly ten minutes ! " " Are you speaking of my not being at the bench ? " Malcolmbrought out somewhat indifferently , because he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And who else around here has a bench ? " Mr. Cox cried . " I ca n't ever remember having kept regular hours or appointmentswith anybody , " Malcolm said , and he recalled at that moment that Madame Girard had used the word " royalty " with reference to him only a few nights ago . He therefore fancied that his speech and manner at this moment must seem royal also to Kermit and Mr. Cox . But both Mr. Cox and Kermit were looking at him with cold and even critical eyes . " I had such a late visitor last night , " Malcolm addressed his words now to Kermit . " And I made certain arrangementsat that time also for you , Kermit , " he added for the midget . " A busy boy , " Kermit said , somewhat cool , though with no real irony . " Are you attempting to tell us by gesture and word that you no longer need us ? " Mr. Cox said , ignoring the news of Malcolm 's late visitor , and going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mr. Cox 's unpleasant tone . He had known Mr. Cox was not very kind or warm-hearted , but he had not known until now that his tone could be so nasty . " Who have you been recommending me to ? " Kermit ignored Mr. Cox 's question , and went back to Malcolm 's visitor . " I ca n't wait to know . " " I had , as I said , an unusual visitor , " Malcolm began again . " In fact , I should say that I had a visitor for the firstp70time since my father disappeared and/or died . My father was my only visitor before , not counting bootblacks and hotel managers . " " How you do repeat yourself , dear Malcolm , " Mr. Cox raised his eyes to the ceiling , and Kermit cleared his throat delicately . " What a cold contemptuous person you can be at times , Mr. Cox , " Malcolm remarked . " Hear ! hear ! " Mr. Cox cried , and Kermit smiled broadly , for Mr. Cox was almost never criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his back . " Mr. Cox was also denounced at the Chateau the other night by Madame Girard , " Malcolm informed them . " My being denounced by Madame Girard is hardly news to me , " Mr. Cox took this up . " A woman who owes all her success to me naturally must defame me frequently in order for her to feel that she exists in her own right at all . " " She does n't exist . . . in her own right then ? " Malcolmwas concerned . " Well , how did she strike you , dear Malcolm ? " Mr. Cox interrogated . " But I do n't want to tell you about my evening with Madame Girard this afternoon , " Malcolm interrupted . " That might have been all right for a morning on the bench , but  --  " " Then what do you want to tell about ? " the astrologer inquired . " Why , his visitor , of course , you old  --  " but Kermit checked himself before he said the word , laughing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at last a supporter in Malcolm against Mr. Cox 's long tyranny . " Perhaps I should save my story until Kermit and I are alone , " Malcolm ventured . " You will tell what it is you have to tell here and now ,  |p71and  we 'll have no more of this young-person coyness and drooling about , " Mr. Cox commanded . " I am not at all frightened of your manner , " Malcolm told Mr. Cox bravely . " Everything you have  --  everything you 've even been discussingfor days now , " Mr. Cox began , " you owe to me . Try to remember that when you feel proud and free ! " " Are we to hear Malcolm 's adventure , or are we to discussour indebtedness to you , sir ? " Kermit addressed Mr. Cox . " What happened , " Malcolm said without any further delay , " is that Girard Girard came to see me in person last night , at midnight . " Both Mr. Cox and Kermit were too thunderstruck to reply immediately . When not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , Kermit , after some struggle , brought out : " Do you fully realize the honor which has been paid you , Malcolm ? " " Honor ? " Malcolm replied , seriously trying to understandnow . " How could he realize , fully or at all ! " Mr. Cox said , flushed and irritable . " Malcolm , " Kermit exclaimed , going over to where the boy was seated , and taking his hand vigorously into his , like one who is to communicate with the deaf and dumb . " GirardGirard is a billionaire , a maker of presidents , a friend of royalty  --  a MAGNATE ! " " A friend of royalty ? " Malcolm caught at this one phrase . " Wined and dined by crowned heads , an African explorer , and a poet ! " " A poet ? " Malcolm was puzzled and not very much interested . " The man of his period , " Kermit concluded.  |p72Then  turning to the astrologer , the midget said hopelessly : " Professor Cox , he is not impressed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Cox was very put out . " He 's had only three addresses , and this was a plunge I had not expected him to take at all . Perhaps never . . . Girard Girard ! . . . Oh , it 's quite premature . . . " " You 're angry Girard came , " Malcolm cried , standing up , for he felt suddenly he had been betrayed . " Why he calls Girard by his first name , " Kermit noted with stupefaction . " Do n't be ridiculous , Malcolm , " Mr. Cox scolded Malcolm'shaving suggested they were angry . " Angry at you ! Be seated at once , " and the astrologer made a snorting kind of sound . " For God 's sake , tell us what happened , " Kermit said , disbelief still struggling with amazement . " Why . . . nothing happened , " Malcolm said , feeling now almost that perhaps Mr. Cox was right , and that he understood nothing , and that if Girard 's coming had not been exactly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his arrival and departure . " You mean Girard Girard simply looked in on you for no purpose , " Mr. Cox exclaimed . " It was midnight , " Malcolm began , " and I was listening to my South-sea shells in my bathrobe . " " Ahem , " Mr. Cox said . " And Girard Girard was all of a sudden on the phone wanting to see me . " " I would give ten years of my life to be so honored , " Kermitsaid . " I told Girard Girard all about you , " Malcolm addressed Kermit now , " though , of course , I did n't describe you in detail , but merely said you were a young unattached man , and my best friend . "  |p73Kermit  clapped his hands . " You will receive an award for that , " the midget told Malcolm . " You imbecile , " Mr. Cox now turned his attention to the midget . " You sound  --  the both of you  --  like a couple of schoolgirls ,  --  all excited over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kermit stuck out his tongue at Mr. Cox , and turned back to Malcolm . " It seems that both Madame Girard and Girard Girard feel they have to have me for their very own , " Malcolm said , and he felt that with this sentence he had told the whole interesting story , and so he rested his hands in his lap , and was silent , expecting that his auditors would take up the conversation from there . But when neither Mr. Cox nor Kermit added anything , but sat waiting expectantly for more , Malcolm added , by way of elucidation : " They love me , I guess , the Girards . " " Completely incredible  --  the whole shebang ! " Mr. Cox shifted on his chair . " You know Malcolm does not lie , " Kermit told the astrologer . " But you ca n't stand to hear of success , of course , especially with regard to one of your own friends . Success in others is for you what hell is to a pious believer , and success is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't believe the Girards could love anybody but themselves , " Mr. Cox ignored Kermit . " Madame Girard ca n't think about anything but herself , in any case , for more than five minutes , without becoming panicky . " " They  --  " Malcolm continued , musing , " or rather MadameGirard through Girard Girard invited me to spend my vacation in the country with them . " " At their country estate ? " Kermit cried . " That 's the place , " Malcolm replied  |p74Even  Mr. Cox was convinced by this statement , and he sat back slowly , collapsing downward until his hands touched the floor . It was all over , he knew . He had done it , he had set the ball rolling , and it had rolled further than he had ever dreamed or contemplated . Malcolm was definitely " in "  --  long long before he was ready , and long before Mr. Cox had seen any indication  --  astrologically  --  that Malcolm was anywhere near his goal . Malcolm had arrived , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladder . He was the protege , after an evening 's talk , of the country 's most powerful man . " But do you know what has happened to you ? " Kermit questioned the boy . " Of course he does not , " Mr. Cox was still acid . " But as you say , Kermit , he could not lie about it . Nobody could invent a thing this large . No , Malcolm has simply done it . " " But what have I done ? " Malcolm cried . " You 've captured them , " Kermit shouted . " Is n't that enough for one lifetime ? " Then remembering his conversation with Girard Girard , Malcolm said in his slow loud voice : " But I turned the invitation down . " " What ? " Kermit leaped to his feet from the chair into which he had been sitting . Malcolm shielded his face , for the little man 's expression was so threatening the boy feared he was about to be attacked . But Kermit only remained frozen in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his eyes and bowed slightly , and then shook his head . " But Girard Girard persuaded me at the last that one day I must accept , " Malcolm added weakly , and Kermit and Mr. Cox gave out sighs of partial relief in the thought that all had not been won , then , only to be thrown so wantonly away . " Malcolm should have a keeper , " Mr. Cox said to Ker/mit . " How he has kept alive this long is a mystery , of course . " " I 'm not going to their country estate without you , Kermit . " It was Malcolm 's turn now to stand up and tell his questioners . " I told Girard Girard that , in so many words . " Kermit did not answer , but he turned very pale , and looked away from Mr. Cox , who was observing him closely . " I believe there is no more for me to do here , " Mr. Cox said suddenly , getting up , for he could no longer conceal that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in his own science had warned him of the event . " Sit down , Professor Cox , " Kermit fulminated . " You 've played God long enough . You 'll act now like other mortals . . . " And Kermit beat on a small gong for his morning servant , forgetting that it was not morning , and that O'Reilly Morgan had gone . " There is so much to think about , " Kermit said , referring , all knew , to Malcolm 's visitor . " And so much to plan . " But Mr. Cox had already gone toward the door . He had , after all , perhaps done enough for both of the young men . He hesitated with his back to them , and then taking hold of the knob , opened the door , and went out without another word.  |p76One  afternoon , following a vague warning of their arrival , a Rolls drew up in front of Kermit 's studio , and Madame Girard , Girard Girard , and Malcolm all got out and stood before the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bolt and chain of his door : he feared these might give under the combined pressure of the three visitors outside . They had come , of course , he knew , to take him to the country mansion . He had agreed to go  --  in some indefinite future  --  but now that he saw the sudden splendor of MadameGirard , the princely calm and command of Girard Girard , and the unbelievable youth of Malcolm , he ac/knowledged to himself that he could not open the door to them . He could not , he knew , be happy . The sight of such wealth and effulgence blinded him . He had intended , of course , to open the door , to receive them . O'Reilly Morgan had already made the tea , a special blend he had purchased only that morning . The entire studio had been washed down in ammonia , followed by patchouli oil and rose water ( Madame Girard 's sina qua non for habitations ) , and was in immaculate order . And Kermit had planned to receive Madame Girard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the very last of the reception , Kermit had been going to tell Madame Girard calmly , even a little majestically , that other commitments would prevent him from accepting her kind invitation . She would protest , of course , but in the end would give in , regretful , and leave , while caring more for the little man than if he had accepted and gone with her . The spectacle of the three persons outside his shabby ramshackle studio pierced his breast with such force that he felt he might fall insensible if they did not depart at once . At the same time , even if he had now desired it , he would never have had the strength to be able to lift the bolt and latch and admit them . After a few moments , a humiliating realization crossed Kermit 's brain . He saw , gradually , that Malcolm had from the first recognized his " outline " against the glass door : Malcolm had recognized him but was not letting the others know . Of course , it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was hiding there behind the door , and so the boy had kept silent . Kermit could not move now , he could not even show to Malcolm that he knew the latter had recognized him . He stood there like a prisoner in stocks , helpless to run even and hide from his shame . He had deceived them , and here he stood , the shadow of his perfidy and deceit falling uponp78them : he had said he would go with them to the country , and now he had bolted the door against them , and had , in effect , insulted them with his contempt . Kermit saw Malcolm 's feverish and concentrated frown . Then , suddenly , he heard Malcolm 's voice saying to MadameGirard : " I 'm certain he has to be in there ! " " He has chosen not to see us , " Madame Girard said with her haunting fear that those she really wished to know feared and avoided her . " Perhaps something has happened to him , " Girard Girardsuggested , and he went up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kermit drew back briefly . The sound of so much power being exerted on his door by one of the most influential living men was too upsetting to his already frayed sensibilities . The little man began slowly retreating backwards into the room reserved for the cats . He knew now that he could never go with them . He was too used to poverty , to the routine of deprivation , to his little empty life of complaint and irritations , and the final inanity when he tucked himself in his small bed . To be suddenlytranslated into a car with a monogram that looked like a vehicle from another civilization , to be surrounded by what was , in effect , royalty , and to see Malcolm enthroned as the favorite ,  --  he could never do this . He retreated still further back , and as he did so , the movement of his back pushed open the door , and all the cats , seeing their prison open , rushed out with cries of wildness and relief into the front room and began scratching and meowing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girard now stood . Madame Girard gave out cries of delight when she was aware of the presence of the cats . Malcolm pushed his face against the glass of thep79door , and as he did so , the lock sprang open , and they were all admitted into the studio . Kermit , though himself invisible in the dark back part of his studio , was able to see his visitors clearly , and observedthat Malcolm was near tears , calling out : " I ca n't go alone , Kermit , you do n't know what will happen ! I ca n't go alone ! Come out , and do n't be a coward . " Madame Girard now raised her voice : " Come here this instant , Kermit . I am issuing a command , do you hear me ? A command . " At this imperious order , Kermit felt that he could no longer stand the suspense and the pressure , and calling out to them , he said : " Go away ! I ca n't bear the splendor of your being here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame Girard cried , trying to see into the inky blackness of the studio 's interior so that she could catch some short glimpse of the little man . " I ca n't stand the splendor of your presence ! " Kermit repeated . " The splendor of our presence ! " Madame Girard cried , for she feared her ears deceived her . " Open the door to your closet , and come out at once , when I command ! " she exclaimed . " I could never , never , " Kermit now groaned , his head pressed against the narrow door of the back room . " The little creature is moaning ! " Madame Girard commented , at which words Kermit 's weeping became more audible . " Open your door , and come out , " Malcolm cried to Kermit . Girard Girard now added his voice to that of the others , but with the calm and dignity which Kermit would have expected from so famous a man . Worn out from his emotion , Kermit let himself slowlyp80slip to his knees where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his visitors . Madame Girard continued to knock with her soft gloved hands on the glass pane of the door , Mr. Girard offered counsel , and Malcolm urging Kermit to come for his sake , if for no other . Kermit attempted several times to answer one or another of these eloquent appeals , but his voice always choked up , and no words came out . After a wait , the three visitors went slowly away and sat in the Rolls waiting for the little man to change , perhaps , his mind . They seemed , the three of them , to Kermit , to wait there for hours , while he never moved from his position of kneeling . Dusk fell . Then , as the night was beginning to show itself in all its black city completeness , the engine of the Rolls started and his splendid visitors motored off into the void . " Kermit has rejected me , " Madame Girard said , as they drove off . " I 'm afraid it 's me he 's rejected , " Malcolm replied . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the back seat of the Rolls . In the heavy rich-smellingleather and severe uprightness of the car , he felt that he was going to his own funeral . He was impatient to jump out and rejoin Kermit in the studio . He knew that he did not belong with " royalty " any more than Kermit had believedhimself to belong with them . Soon Malcolm began sobbing in earnest . " Oh , no , no , " Madame Girard cried , turning about and looking at him from the front seat where she sat stiffly at a distance from Girard himself , who was driving.  | " I am not very manly , I suppose you are thinking , " Malcolmblew his nose on his sleeve . " I can not stand emotional crises in others , " Madame Girard explained her position . " This must be attended to , Girard , " she turned to her husband . " Do something at once . " " We will drive and think , " her husband made the rejoinder . " There is nothing to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rejected all of us . He stood back there , probably staring at us as if we were odd-plumaged birds in a sanctuary . " " That was the worst thing about it , " Malcolm agreed . " To see his little shadow in the glass door watching us . Too afraid to make his presence known . " " How could he be afraid  --  when it was only love I wanted to bring him ? " Madame Girard said . " We could telephone him , perhaps , and tell him what it is that we actually wish of him , " Girard proposed . " People often can not refuse a request when it is telephoned . " " I must also have a drink , " Madame Girard said in her deepest voice . " What of ? " Malcolm asked , rather severely and loudly . Madame Girard thought for a long time , while humming , and then said , very quickly , so that everybody jumped a bit : " Dark rum . " " Completely out of the question , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last remark , " Madame Girard addressed her husband . " Your drinking days are over . At any rate , with me present . I know that at night you sometimes run off and get it , or perhaps when young men come they secret it in to you but , on the whole , your drinking days are over . " " He pronounces my sentence of doom with the sang/froid of an ape , " Madame Girard said . " You are an ape . It was your malign presence which frightened the midget ! " " Never use that word ! " Malcolm exclaimed . " Sir ? " Madame Girard cried , turning about again to look at Malcolm . " Kermit does n't think he is a midget , " Malcolm told her . " He was about to strike me one afternoon for almost thinkingit . " " How perfectly remarkable , " Madame Girard said , her mind temporarily lifted for a moment from her desire for drink . " How intensely significant . " Thinking still more , Madame Girard asked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feared you were going to ask that , " Malcolm confessed . Madame Girard nodded , understanding . " I do n't suppose he has quite decided what he thinks he is , " Malcolm suggested . " Perhaps , however , " Girard spoke up , " if we knew what he thought he was , we would be able to persuade him to come with us . " " You could persuade nobody  --  nothing ! " Madame Girardexploded , and her husband bent slightly under the vigor of her attack . " You hen-peck Girard , I observe , " Malcolm commented . Madame Girard turned her blazing mascaraed eyes with the purple puffs under them directly into the line of Malcolm'sflashing teeth . " How do I do that ? " she wondered , more curious than belligerent . " You reduce him to a smaller size than he should be , " Malcolm ventured . " I am quite a strong man , reduced or not , " Girard laughed . " He is very strong , " Madame Girard agreed looking atp83her husband . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded them . " We have to have Kermit or we have to go home , becauseMalcolm would cry himself into the hospital , should we set off for the country now . " " We must go to the country , " Girard said . " My lungs require that air . " " You will do as you 're told , " Madame Girard affirmed . " Drive to the Avenue of the Temples . " " But that 's far far out of our way ! " Girard protested . " Did you hear what I said ? " Madame Girard demanded . " I said The Temples ! " " And with me not having been near the bench for what seems days , " Malcolm sighed , almost to himself . " I insist a phone call to Kermit is in order , " Mr. Girard returned to his original idea . " Well , there are phones in the Temples , " Madame Girard gave in a bit , grudgingly . " What is to become of Kermit ? " Malcolm said , realizing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be . " Beautiful small men like that go on living , " Madame Girard assured him . " How did you know he was beautiful ? " Malcolm wondered . " Silhouettes tell all , " she replied . " I thought his voice was distinguished , " Girard said . " Everything about him was distinguished , " Madame Girard summarized their afternoon . " And that wonderful studio . I wish to buy it as soon as possible . " " Buy ? " Girard said . " You heard me , " Madame Girard was cold now . " I must own the studio . " " I do n't think it 's for sale , " Malcolm informed her . " Oh , it 's too beautiful , of course , but it 's for sale , naturally  --  if I want it  --  it has to be ! " " Here are your Temples , " Girard said , pointing out top84them with a wave of his gloved hand the ruins of an old Japanese-style building . The ruins struck a kind of autumnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephones ? " it was Malcolm who spoke up at last . " Near by , " Girard assured him . " And I will call him . " " The Temples bring back so many memories for me , " Madame Girard said in an altered voice , and she put her gloved hand over her eyes . Malcolm studied her very closely . " Do you want your veil ? " Girard asked her , looking down , unaccountably , at the floor of the car . " Madame Girard wears a . . . riding veil ? " Malcolm wondered , too much surprise for politeness in his voice . " Here it is , my dear , " Girard said , ignoring Malcolm 's remark , and he handed Madame Girard a bluish purple cloth , which he had taken quickly from a compartment in the car . She placed the cloth over her face immediately . " A riding veil should prove very attention-bringing to any possible walkers at this time , " Malcolm told Madame Girard . " This veil , of course , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She touched it at that moment , gingerly , with her hand . " You could be the headless huntsman , " Malcolm told her . " Texture is all , " Madame Girard said , " substance noth-ing . " " Shall I now telephone Kermit ? " Girard brought them back to the afternoon and their failure . " But all means , use every way of persuading him , " MadameGirard consented . " You will excuse me , then , while I do so , " Girard said.  |p85Both  Malcolm and Madame Girard bowed to him , and he went off in the direction of the Japanese Temples . Girard Girard was gone such a short time that Madame Girard had scarcely spoken ten words to Malcolm through the blue veil which now cut her off from the world . Malcolm , however , had decided that her veiled appearance went very well with the Temples and the melancholy of the light , and was about to tell her this when Girard Girard returned , looking , Malcolm thought , somewhat happier than when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news I bring , " Girard said . " Let us decide its quality , " Madame Girard told him . " Come into the car and tell only what happened . If commentsor adjectives are to be supplied , we shall do so . " " I see , " Girard said , and smiling , he took his position at the wheel . " Was I gone long ? " Girard wondered suddenly . " You were gone the normal length of time , " Madame Girard replied . " I seemed to be gone a long time , " he explained . " It was not long , " Malcolm told him . " I think the reason for the seeming length of my stay was that I had to talk with a man named Professor Cox . " " No ! " broke from both Malcolm and Madame Girard . " Mr. Cox is everywhere , " Madame Girard said , shaking her head , and she lifted her veil momentarily . Malcolm decided that he liked Madame Girard better with her veil on than off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on : " Professor Cox was very evasive . " " How could he be straightforward ? " Madame Girard inquired . " He was , in any case , very firm , " Girard admitted . " Well , he is firmly evasive , we might say , " Madame Girard commented.  | " I asked him naturally for Kermit , since I was not able to recognize the voice which answered the phone . " " Continue , " Madame Girard commanded her husband . " This is Mr. Cox , ' the voice then identified itself . And I asked , Would you please call Kermit to the phone , then , Mr. Cox , for it is to him I wish to speak . ' Mr. Cox replied , however , that he had no intention of doing so , for Kermit was in the throes of nearly complete collapse . The throes of collapse ? ' I inquired , acting surprised , though , of course , I was not . . . " " Of course you were not ! " Madame Girard nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The little man can not under any circumstances speak to you Girard Girard , ' Mr. Cox then said . " " But I am asking you , ' I said to Mr. Cox , humbly . We are ready to go to our country house , and it is imperative that he go with us , or Malcolm can not accompany us either . Three people are waiting for his answer . ' " " The answer , ' Mr. Cox then told me , is NO . ' " " No ! " Malcolm cried , pounding his head with his fist . " No for how long , Mr. Cox , ' I then asked him , " Girard Girard said . " No forever , ' Mr. Cox replied . " " Forever , " Malcolm said . " And he refused to allow a man of your caliber to talk with Kermit , " Madame Girard was pale with indignation . " Mr. Cox told me that Kermit would never be able to say yes again to anything , " Girard Girard finally brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Madame Girard raised her hand for silence . " And do not call Kermit again , ' Mr. Cox commanded me , " Girard Girard went on . " I will call you should he ever say Yes in the interim . ' " " Then why in hell did you look so merry when you camep87back here to the car ? " Madame Girard demanded to know of her husband . " I was only laughing at Mr. Cox 's tyranny , " Girard Girard said . " He is a prig , too , as well as a tyrant . " " A prig ? " Malcolm paused over the word . " Oh , that always goes with tyranny ! " Madame Girard tossed aside Malcolm 's confusion . " To think I had almost entrusted my life to Mr. Cox , " Malcolm said , almost whispering . " So you had , " Girard Girard was firm about this . " And now he has such power over Kermit ! " Malcolm remarked . " He ca n't do anything to Kermit , " Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a tyrant ? " Malcolm wondered . " What has his prig-hood to do with his power ? " Madame Girard inquired . " His prig-hood is only his manner . Mr. Cox 's power emanates from another source . But on Kermit it is wasted . " " I see , " Malcolm said . " He will never win , " Girard Girard said . " Never , " Madame Girard agreed . They all three sat there thinking of how Mr. Cox , however , did have Kermit , and the wires were , so to speak , down , or at least in the hands only of Mr. Cox . Then Girard started the motor . " Where are you taking us ? " Madame Girard exclaimed . " For a drive about the water . " " But not to the country estate ! " Malcolm warned . " Oh , do you think we could go after this shattering experience ? " Madame Girard scoffed . " Not even if I had a whole cave of dark rum waiting for me ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " My lungs must have that air ! " " We will go when I give the command , and not until , "  |p88Madame  Girard said , suddenly removing her veil , and as she did so , Malcolm gasped to see her beautiful , though haggard , eyes , again . " You talk of your lungs ! " Madame Girard scoffed . " But you never consider my thirst ! " Girard Girard opened his mouth to say something . " Silence ! " Madame Girard anticipated him . " Do you ever consider my thirst ? " she vociferated again . But again when Girard Girard attempted to reply , MadameGirard cried out first : " Do not open your mouth . Silence ! " Malcolm held his head in his hands . " Girard Girard , " Madame Girard said , shaking the veil at him , " have you ever given my thirst at any time the seriousattention , say , Professor Cox has given it  --  the very few times he has given it ? You may answer this question . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bashfully , as Malcolm thought . " You lie ! " she screamed . " You lie in front of this innocentboy witness . " They drove on for a moment of silence . " It 's so infernal to be thirsty , and to have your thirst interdicted , " she said in a whisper . She wept a little , then bracing herself , she cried : " Your lungs can rot ! Do you hear ? Rot ! "  | " Yes , it 's you , " Mr. Cox said , without any real surprise , but with a sourer tone than Malcolm had ever heard in the astrologer 's voice before . " While everybody thinks you are living in Madame Girard 's country house , here you are on the bench  --  as if nothing had happened to you since your father 's death . " " I could n't go to the country without Kermit , " Malcolm said , no conviction in his expression . " The Girards were too . . . imposing " ( here Malcolm borrowed a word ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Subterfuges ! Dodges ! Oh , how I know you , " Mr. Coxp90shook his head . Today he carried a fancy toothpick in his mouth , and his tone seemed even more cutting and insolentthan usual . " Everyone in and out of the Girards spoke slightingly of you , " Malcolm told Mr. Cox , with the expression of one merely vacantly reporting the facts . " Those in the possession of the truth are hardly ever thought well of , " Mr. Cox said coolly enough . " You are in the . . . possession . . . of . . . ? " and Malcolm stood up briefly , but sat down just as quickly at a gesture from his mentor . " I thought you knew I had it , " Mr. Cox said calmly , a little pleasant humor coming into his face . " I do n't believe I would care to have it , " Malcolm said finally , a bit disconsolate again . " Well , dear boy , " Mr. Cox considered this . " I think you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . But in your case , too , you do n't need to worry about it  --  because you 're not going to be bothered with having it ! " " I suppose when you say I 've accomplished a great deal  --  you mean my conquest of Madame and Mr. Girard , " Malcolm said . " Who else ? " the astrologer nodded . " Madame Girard relies on you an awful lot , too , " Malcolmthought aloud . " Yet she continually condemns you , as does Girard Girard . " Mr. Cox removed his toothpick from his mouth , but did not reply . " You are a magician , as they say  --  as well as an astrologer , " and Malcolm shook his head at the complexity of things . Mr. Cox did not bother to reply to this statement , but hurried on : " All the people whom I stir to action  --  and there are anp91awful lot of them , let me tell you  --  they somehow fail . . . " " But what are the actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , as usual , understand . " Mind you , " he went on , " I do n't care how much they talk against me , or how much they talk with one another  --  though the only real talking I will do . But I want them to act out the parts they are meant to act out with one another ! " " And what parts would those ever be ? " Malcolm wondered , not able at that moment to smother a wide yawn . Mr. Cox waited for Malcolm to close his mouth . " I have arranged all the situations , " Mr. Cox spoke without his usual optimism . " Why ca n't they act ? I have brought the right people together , and the right situations . I 'm not such a fool as not to know right people and right situations when they 're together . But nothing happens . Nothing at all . " " You may have made a mistake ! " Malcolm boldly suggested . " No , no , Malcolm , " and the astrologer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Cox spoke with resignation in his voice . " What else can you call it ? There 's just no help for it . Everything is played out . " " You mean I 've left the bench , then , for no reason at all ? " " No , Malcolm , we wo n't give up , stars or no , though I may have to pay for this remark later , " and Mr. Cox whistled in a simulation of high spirits . " For if the Girards did n't win over the forces "  --  here the astrologer looked furtively to the horizon  --  " perhaps this might do the trick , as a desperate remedy "  --  and he pulled out a small card and thrust it into the hand of his young friend . " Another address ! " Malcolm crowed . " Do your rejoicing later , " Mr. Cox was again severe . " And as to enthusiasm , child , get rid of it . It can only leadp92you to commitments , and not just some , but a legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and we may meet again , and if not , well , then not , and may success be yours . " Taking out his toothpick from his mouth , and giving Malcolm a vigorous farewell nod , Mr. Cox left just as unceremoniouslyand quickly as ever . " You 're the new boy ? " Eloisa Brace said , looking out at Malcolm from the basement door of her three-story house , but not opening the door to him . Malcolm was listening to the sound of the alto sax which was coming from upstairs , but his glimpse of the strong chin and fierce blue eyes of Eloisa Brace stopped him a little . He had never seen such a strong-looking woman . He could n't tell her age because she looked so imposing . Her blonde hair was long and thick and hid her forehead . " Malcolm ? " Eloisa Brace inquired . " Is it you ? " He nodded . " O.K. , then , either come in or go out . You ca n't just stand there , O.K. , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a few more O.K. 's , for she put this expressionafter every few words she uttered . " Mr. Cox . . . " Malcolm began . " Yes , yes , O.K. , " Eloisa Brace told him , irritability and impatience rising anew in her . " You 're awfully cross tonight , are n't you ? " Malcolm asked her . Eloisa opened the basement door at last , and Malcolm went partially inside the room . " Is that the new boy ? " a man 's voice demanded , and a young man with a beard and thick glasses hurried down the back staircase which led from the concert room above to the basement where Malcolm and Eloisa were now standing.  | " Will you please take over from here , O.K. , " Eloisa Brace turned to the young man . " You know I ca n't stand kids . And the musicians are waiting . " Eloisa let out a great sigh of relief and disappeared up the stairs from which the young bearded man had just descended . " My wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Malcolm . " Eloisa Brace is your wife ? " Malcolm asked . The young man nodded . " But do come clear into the room , why do n't you ? Do n't stand against the door , " he asked Malcolm . Malcolm came further into the room , and became immediatelyabsorbed in looking at the furnishings about him : it was not unlike Estel Blanc 's  --  only , if anything , gloomier , but as at Estel 's , paintings adorned all the walls , but here there was a great display of stuffed birds , especially owls sitting on varnished perches , and the furniture was all very old and worn , like what one would expect on a farm . " Yes , " the young man told Malcolm , " you are just as Mr. Cox described you , " and he held his spectacles against his eyes to see the boy more clearly . The man was very friendly , though rather in the manner of a doctor , and Malcolm smiled under this attention . He thought that this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some wine , Malcolm ? " the man handed him a cracked jelly-glass filled with red liquor . " I usually do n't drink , " Malcolm replied . " Do have some , " his new friend urged him . " You 're so . . . very polite , " the boy noted . " You 're much nicer than I even thought you would be for a boy of your class , " the man said . " My name , by the way , is Jerome . " Malcolm accepted Jerome 's hand , and smiled  | " I do n't suppose you have heard of me , " Jerome inquired , a vague hopeful emotion coming into his voice . " Just as the husband of Eloisa Brace , " Malcolm told him . " Well , of course , Eloisa is at present a bit more famous than me , " Jerome admitted . " As a painter , you understand . " He pointed to the paintings on the wall , which were by Eloisa . Malcolm looked at the paintings now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , a woman with long hair and a strong chin , but with a soft , kind , even moony , expression , garbed in a long flowing robe . The different women depicted in the paintings , Malcolm decided , both were , and were not , Eloisa . The real Eloisa was so much crosser and older in everyday life . " Did n't Mr. Cox tell you what I was famous for ? " Jerome brought Malcolm 's attention back from the paintings to himself . " No , " Malcolm replied . " He just mentioned you as Eloisa 's husband . " " How typical of Mr. Cox , " Jerome said . Then : " You see , " Jerome went on , " I was in prison . " " I see , " Malcolm tasted his wine , and nodded . " For burglary , " Jerome informed him . " Flow did you ever come to get here then ? " Malcolm wondered , and he pointed to the room in which they were now sitting . " You charming fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . " I 've heard all about you and your bench ! " " But  --  " Malcolm began by way of explanation , and surprise . " No more need be said , sir , " Jerome cried , raising the palm of his hand . " It 's all all right here . Everything is all right here . "  | " But you said you were a burglar , " Malcolm managed to get out . Jerome tasted his wine with loud deliberative smacks . " That 's right , " he finally said . " I got ten years for it . The state pen . " " You must have . . . stolen an awful lot , " Malcolm decided . Jerome laughed . " Somehow you can say that , " he told Malcolm . " Yes , Malcolm , I stole one hell of a lot . " At that moment Jerome seemed to have forgotten all about Malcolm , and he merely looked out past where they were sitting into the inner darkness of the next room . Then coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm , you are looking at nothing less than an ex-con . " " I 'm very proud to know you , " Malcolm said , and he finished his second glass . " Do you know what I am talking about , Malcolm ? " Jeromesaid more gravely , but still with great friendliness . " Yes , " Malcolm said thoughtfully . " I was just wonderingthough , if Estel Blanc may perhaps have at one time maybe not for ten years , you know  --  been one . " " Estel Blanc ! " Jerome 's smile faded into an offended and shocked look . " Why , he 's not in our class at all ! For one thing , he 's a total snob . Whatever made you think he would be an ex-con . " But Malcolm 's sunny calm restored Jerome 's good humor . Malcolm , however , continued : " You see , " he said , " I do n't really know what an ex-con should look like on account of you seem just like anybody nice to me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe not so awfully impressively nice as Girard Girard , say , " Malcolm reconsidered . " But in so many ways you are so much sweeter than he is . " " Sweet  --  O.K. , thank you , Malcolm , " Jerome said , andp96he was at that moment , anybody could see , very sweet , and he smiled , perhaps thinking of his own sweetness . " You and I , Malcolm , are quite different in all things  --  in every way  --  and yet we like one another , and we are alike , " Jerome told him . " Here , " he pointed out , " you 're not drinking up . " He poured Malcolm some more wine . " But you see  --  I do n't drink , " Malcolm reminded him . Jerome made the tasting sounds again from his own replenishedglass . " Jerome  --  what is an ex-con ? " Malcolm said suddenly . Jerome stopped tasting . He paused . " A man who 's been in prison . An ex-convict , you know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really were in prison , " Malcolm considered this . " Here , " Jerome pointed out to him . " I wrote a book about it . " " How difficult that must have been , " Malcolm observed . " Would you like to read my book ? " Jerome inquired , eagerness and anticipation in his expression . Malcolm was about to tell Jerome that he could not say , for he had never read a complete book , when Jerome , without waiting for an answer , hastened to a little closet nearby where there was piled a stack of books , all with the same title , and brought one copy back to Malcolm . The book 's title was They Could Have Me Back . " What a nice title , " Malcolm said . " Is that you naked on the cover ? " Jerome smiled and touched Malcolm lightly on the ear . From upstairs came the thick rich tones of the sax and the bass . " Do you dig that music , Malcolm ? " Jerome kept his mouth very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I do n't read very much , " Malcolm explained , handing the book back to Jerome . Malcolm put his hand slowly to the place on his ear where Jerome had touched him . " What was that for ? " Malcolm said . " Look , Malcolm , " Jerome said , " I know you make a point of being dumb , but you 're not that dumb . " Just then the music upstairs stopped , and Jerome hastenedaway from Malcolm and sat down on the floor and began talking very fast about how he was a writer and was now finishing a study of delinquency among minors . Footsteps sounded on the staircase . " Jerome , are you coming up here or not ? " Eloisa Brace 's voice sounded severe , but shaky . " In a minute , darling , " Jerome said . " Look , " she continued , " the musicians want to see you about the arrangement for the new number . Please consider others for once in your life . Is that boy still down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Malcolm , Eloisa cried : " Do n't keep me waiting now , after all my trouble to bring Grig and Goody together here tonight , " and they heard her footsteps retreating upstairs . " My wife , " Jerome smiled both sweetly and sadly , and he winked at Malcolm . Malcolm looked down at his empty glass . " More ? " Jerome said . Malcolm made no effort to refuse , and Jerome poured another brimming glass . " I do want you to read my book , " Jerome said , sitting on the floor by Malcolm 's chair now , and grasping the boy 's foot lightly . " I want you to because , well , because I guess you do n't seem to have any pre-judgments about anything . Your eyes are completely open . " Jerome pulled on Malcolm 's pant cuff . " Look , Malcolm , " he said suddenly . " I 'm not a queer orp98anything , so do n't jump like that when I touch you . You do something to me because I guess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or something , and I would n't have said anything so corny before in all my life . But hell , you do . " " I see , " Malcolm said , and he looked down at Jerome 's hand which rested on his leg . " Will you be a good friend , then ? " Jerome asked Malcolm . " Of course , Jerome , " Malcolm cried , like one startled from sleep . " Thank you , Malcolm . " They sat now close together , while upstairs the music had begun again . " It 's going to be a wonderful friendship , " Jerome said thickly , his mouth pressed against Malcolm 's trouser legs . " But you must give up Mr. Cox and Girard Girard . They wo n't do for you at all . They do n't believe in what you and I believe in . . . " " But what do we believe in ? " Malcolm said , and he made a motion to stand up . " Sit still , " Jerome put his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , please . " Jerome cocked his head , swallowing the wine in his glass . " What do we believe in , Malcolm ? What a pleasant , pleasant question . I 'm so awfully glad you said we . I will appreciate that a long time . A hell of a long time from now I will think of that question of yours , Malcolm : what do WE believe in . You carry me right back to something , Male . . " " You see I do n't know what I be " Do n't spoil it , Male . Do n't say another word . " " Jerome , " Malcolm 's voice came shaky and tiny now . " Do n't spoil anything now ! " Jerome commanded again , his eyes soft and half-closed . " Do n't speak . "  |p99At  that moment , the glass fell out of Malcolm 's hand , and without another syllable , the boy toppled unconscious out of his chair and onto Jerome 's lap , head first . " Jesus Christ , " Jerome said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small bed unlike his own , without a canopy , and found himself with a wall against him on one side and on the other a dark-skinned man who was snoring . Malcolm had never , he thought , since the probable death of his father , seen such a distinguished looking man . Still somewhat asleep , the boy said , " Are you by chance , then , royalty , sir ? " It was a kind of rhetorical question , an echo from Madame Girard 's rather than anything that Malcolmmeant to address to his bed-fellow . But the darkSkinnedman frowned , and quit snoring.  | " Sir , " Malcolm pushed the man , addressing him now directly , " who are you ? " When there was no answer , Malcolm looked about him . There was no way to get out of bed without practically pushing the dark man out of bed at the same time , for the bed was much too small for two persons  --  it was too small for the majestic type of person who was sleeping next to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not move without pushing the stranger . At that moment , the man opened one eye , then the other , and then yawned widely . " Sir , " Malcolm began again , " this is the first time I have not slept in my own bed , and I am quite surprised . " The dark man nodded , still yawning from time to time , and then scratched slowly and deeply under his arm pits . " Who are you , sir ? " Malcolm inquired again . " I know who you are , " the man replied , and he looked pleasant and calm , though grave . " You have an even richer voice than Estel Blanc , " Malcolmnoted , but was about to correct himself at once for having mentioned the unpopular undertaker , and there was , furthermore , no connection between the two , he realized , except that , of course , they were both of the Abyssinian race . The man reached behind their common pillow and brought out a handsome small comb with which he began tidying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't suppose you are . . . royalty , though please forgive me if you are , " Malcolm said . " Well , forgive me  --  for forgetting to introduce myself , Malcolm . George Leeds , sir , the piano player with the quartet . " Malcolm shook hands with George Leeds and told him how pleased he was to meet him.  | " Everybody who is a friend of mine calls me Grig , " George Leeds then added . " May I see your hands , then , Grig ? " Malcolm asked . " Oh , I 'm not lying to you about my profession , " George Leeds smiled , stretching out his hands for Malcolm 's inspection . " Those are piano player hands , " Malcolm commented . " Well , I 'm not royalty , kiddo , " George told him . " Not the royalty you 're talking about . " " May I borrow your comb now , sir ? " Malcolm inquired , and George passed it to him with a short bow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George Leeds commented . " Passed out ? " Malcolm frowned , wondering , and putting down the comb briefly . George Leeds stared at him , and then speaking slow , pronouncing each syllable as to a foreigner : " DRUNK . FELL UN-CON-SCIOUS . At feet of your host . " " Jerome the burglar ! " Malcolm remembered , with a short snort of recognition . George Leeds smiled , and stretching out hugely , cracked the bones in his spine . " That seems a hundred years ago , " Malcolm said , passingthe comb back to George . " Jerome a hundred years ago ! " George inquired . " My father seems a thousand years ago , " Malcolm told him . " By the way what 's the slant on this father of yours ? Seems that 's all people talk about in this part of town : is he or ai n't he , et cetera . " " Oh , he 's been dead or disappeared for nearly a year now , " Malcolm said . " Mr. Cox has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , and that is how I got in with Jerome . "  | " Got in with him ? " George turned about painfully in the narrow space of the bed , and took a better look at the boy . " Nearly every day , you see , Mr. Leeds , I get a different address . I 'm beginning life , I guess you might call it . You would never believe all the people I get to meet , " Malcolm explained , but so close was the confines of their sleeping quarters , he found himself speaking direct into the piano player 's ear , as one would to a stone deaf person . " I think maybe I do believe it , " George Leeds replied , and then he put his hand on Malcolm 's forehead . " No , " he said , after a pause , " you do n't have no fever . " " Thank you , " Malcolm said , immediately putting his hand to where George Leeds had placed his . Malcolm was just about to tell George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room bearing a tray of steaming coffee . " O.K. , how are all of my fellows this morning , " Eloisa said . There was no trace of her irritability of the night before . She kissed both of them briefly on the forehead , and handed each of them his cup of coffee . " Cramped quarters , " Eloisa commented on the bed . " This is his first night in a strange bed , " George Leedspointed out to Eloisa Brace , cocking his head at Malcolm . " I slept very well , " Malcolm replied ceremoniously . " Fine , fine , " Eloisa said . " And I think I know the reason why , " Malcolm continued . Eloisa and George stared at him . " It 's because the piano player smells like coconuts , " Malcolmsaid with a kind of slow triumph . " Coconuts ! " George Leeds exclaimed . " I accept that as a compliment , Malcolm . "  |p104Malcolm  was about to continue speaking when Eloisa Brace said that she wanted a word with him alone as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything personal and serious , " Malcolm was disturbed . " It is and it is n't , " Eloisa told him . " The fact is , " she said , and she began tidying up the bottom of the bedclothes a bit , " I would like to paint you , Malcolm . " Malcolm smiled insipidly . " Eloisa wants to draw your portrait , " the piano player further explained to the boy . Malcolm nodded . " Good , " Eloisa Brace said . " It 's a commissioned portrait , practically , you see , " she went on . " I have an idea Madame Girard may want it , once it is completed . So we must begin immediately after you 've had your coffee . . . " " But I have to go to the bench some time this morning , " Malcolm explained . " Bench ? " Eloisa said , for she had only vaguely heard of this aspect of Malcolm 's life . " No , no , we 've made all the arrangements with your hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're having your portrait done . " " With the piano player ? " Malcolm stared at George Leeds . " Well , not exactly . You will , I mean , have a room somewhere , though my house is just full up at the moment . O.K. ? Well , hurry , Malcolm , " Eloisa Brace commanded . " We do n't have too much time to lose . " " Is this all correct ? " Malcolm turned to the piano player . Yawning , George Leeds replied : " You see , Malcolm , Ijust stick to the piano . And the rest of the world and thepeople , too , even nice people like you , well , I just kind oftend to let them go , if you do n't mind me saying so . " Eloisa Brace watched Malcolm , waiting.  | " Eloisa has already begun his portrait ! " Mr. Cox was speaking to Kermit , who was lying on the sofa in his own studio , covered in quilts , sick with a bad cold . " Everywhere Malcolm goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cox paused lengthily , then said : " He was simply lucky enough to have found us . " " You mean , of course , " Kermit sat bolt upright in the sofa , " lucky enough to have met you . " His nostrils palpitatedfrom his exertion . " Let 's not quarrel when you 're ill , " Mr. Cox said . " Quarrelling is something nobody can forbid me , " Kermitreminded him . " When I cease to quarrel , I will cease to be . " Mr. Cox was about to make some comment , perhaps metaphysical , on this remark , when Kermit hurried ahead of him : " I can hardly wait , nonetheless , to see Eloisa Brace 's portrait of Malcolm . " " But your sharp little eyes can surely visualize it already , " Mr. Cox rejoined . " No , my sharp little eyes can not ! " Kermit sat up all the way now on the divan , and put his feet on the floor , and with a loud bang put on his derby hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All of Eloisa 's portraits , whether they are of her or others , look just like Eloisa , " Mr. Cox reminded him . " This one will be different , " Kermit was emphatic . " You seem to be praising another artist , " Mr. Cox cautioned , "  --  which , I must say , is a new tack for you to take . " " Did I say anything in praise of Eloisa Brace ? I wouldn'tp106dream of doing that . She ca n't paint , and she ca n't draw , and she ca n't even see . But  --  " and here Kermit threw off the covers of his bed onto the floor , and stood up solidly  --  " she does have a definite feeling for young men like Malcolm , and that feeling will triumph in this case and produce a good painting , perhaps a masterpiece . That often happens to painters without talent  --  they do one fine thing . " " All you 're saying is you 're a bit partial to Malcolm , " Mr. Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live only to see that finished portrait , " Kermit replied . " The thought that Malcolm is living there is more interesting to me than that he is being painted , " Mr. Cox pointed out . " It must be a good deal more strenuous than living in a whorehouse , " Kermit observed . " I suppose the poor boy has already been taken to bed by a score of people there . " " Eloisa did speak to me a bit  --  almost on that very subject , " Mr. Cox began . " She is sorry , she told me , that Malcolm can not have a room of his own as he did in his hotel . And she runs such a busy house , you know  --  all those travelling musicians coming and going at all hours , that Malcolm has to sleep with a different person each night , and sometimes  --  when there is real crowding , Eloisa has to move him in the middle of the night to a different bed . Often it 's more apt to be three in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like travelling in Czechoslovakia during a war . " " I 'm glad for his own sake that Malcolm 's father is dead , " Kermit said , and he pulled his derby hat low over his eyes . " There you go again , with your lower middle-class prej/udices coming out , " Mr. Cox exploded . " Everybody has to begin some time , and Malcolm is beginning . " Kermit shook his head . Then : " What will Eloisa Brace do with the portrait ? " Kermit asked . " But I thought you knew , " Mr. Cox pooh-poohed his pretension of ignorance . " What could I know , lying here in my widower-hood ? " Kermit demanded to know , and he walked over to his easel , where an empty canvas stared at him . He put a few strokes on it with a pencil , and then put the pencil down . " Everybody knows Eloisa will sell the portrait to Madame Girard , " Mr. Cox said . Kermit nodded , a slow strange smile on his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , " Kermit began , and he went back to his bed , took up a small bottle of camphor , and smelled of it . " A boy comes in off a summer bench , " the midget continued , " and is immediately wined , dined , courted , carried off in private limousines , painted , while I , with all my talents and training and charm  --  well , Mr. Cox , it 's the ash can for me , that 's about all anyone can honestly say . " Mr. Cox got up to leave , humming . " You had your chance , I 'm afraid , " the astrologer said gravely . " Before you go , " Kermit said in a low voice , his eyes looking away from Mr. Cox , " answer me one simple question : Does Malcolm have any mind at all ? " " I will answer your question with another one : Do you think he needs one ? " Mr. Cox said , and he was already at the door which led to the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the midget . " I ca n't help being interested in jazz musicians any more than a fish can keep out of water , " Eloisa Brace confessed ,  |p108as  she was painting Malcolm 's portrait . " Jazz musicians are my fare , and almost always have been . " " Does n't Jerome interfere ? " Malcolm wondered . " Move your chin just a little more to the right , hon , " Eloisa told him . Returning to his question , she smiled , then said : " Jerome knew everything about me when he married me . We both knew the chances we were taking . " Malcolm nodded , but kept his chin in place . " I gave up a rich husband for Jerome , " she stopped painting , perhaps remembering briefly that earlier marriageand husband . " But I 've never regretted it . Not that we 're happy , Jerome and I. We 've never known a day of rest . While with my first husband , I was outwardly happy , you see  --  had nothing but rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing , and not really a happy moment . Get poorer every day  --  he ca n't find work because of what he is , and we do nothing but quarrel . But , Malcolm , it 's life with Jerome . . . Here I am , telling you everything , " she said , squinting at the portrait , for she was more than a little near-sighted . " But when do you find time to be married ? " Malcolm asked , and added , at the look he got from Eloisa : " I mean with so many jazz concerts going on and all . " " Marriage is something that just goes on and on inside of you , Malcolm , " Eloisa said . " Concerts begin and end , and musicians come and go , but a real marriage just keeps going . " She painted slowly and rhythmically now , a soft look on her mouth . Malcolm cleared his throat vociferously . " It was Jerome , you see , I was worried about , " the boy finally said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taking up a second , smaller one in its place . " Whyp109on earth should anybody worry about Jerome ? " she frowned . " For the first time in his whole life he 's safe . " " Well , it 's so sad he has to remember he 's an ex-con all the time , " Malcolm noted . " Oh , everybody 's entitled to a few memories when he 's potted , " Eloisa shrugged this off . " And marriage has taken the place of all that old prison trouble . He just likes to remember when he 's potted is all . Grown-up people , you see , Malcolm , have long memories : you remember that . " " Poor , poor Jerome , " Malcolm exclaimed softly . Just then the telephone rang . Eloisa sat still , looking gloomy and thoughtful , and then turning to Malcolm , she inquired : " Would you have the heart to answer that , and then come and tell me who it is ? But do n't tell whoeverit is that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little stand where the telephone rested , took off its receiver . He paused , listening to the cascade of sounds at the other end of the wire , then looking up at Eloisa with wide eyes , he whispered : " Just guess . It 's Madame Girard ! " Eloisa raised her eyes to the ceiling . " Will you talk ? " Malcolm asked Eloisa . " I do n't suppose I have any choice in the matter , " the painter said . And she took the receiver from Malcolm 's hands . " I know you are lonely , my dear , " Eloisa said to Madame Girard on the phone . " But you ca n't ca n't come here . No , no , no , my dear , you can not ! " " But you have a young man there named Malcolm , " Madame Girard 's voice boomed . " And I wish to bring him to my home to stay . No , I have n't as yet considered adoption . It 's not quite that kind of relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " But , Madame Girard , " Eloisa implored . " You know I am painting his portrait . " Eloisa regretted she had given this piece of information at once . " Then I must purchase it at once , " Madame Girard exclaimed . " Do you hear . . . I have not been so taken with a young person in years . " Eloisa motioned to Malcolm to fetch her the tray with the brandy decanter and glass , which he brought to her in a thrice . " What are those oral sounds I am now hearing ? " MadameGirard asked a moment later . " I 'm sipping brandy , " Eloisa explained to her . " At nine thirty in the morning ? " Madame Girard interrogatedsuspiciously . " Telephones always upset me so , Madame Girard , you know that , and when it 's a long phone conversation , often a finger of brandy gets me through . " " I know nothing of your habits , " Madame Girard replied . " All I know is Malcolm is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ! " " Why should you people who have no money or backgroundbe entrusted with him ? " Madame Girard said . " Let those who can , take him . " " But the portrait , " Eloisa cried . " You forget that I am doing his portrait  --  which you say you one day will pur-chase . " " You can come to the Chateau and finish it , " Madame Girard told her . " I can not , and I will not , Madame Girard , " Eloisa stood firm . " I am claiming my own is all , " Madame Girard said , more calm now . " I am simply asking you to hand over Mal/coim . He 's no longer on his bench , and I have as good a claim as anyone . We want him to go to the country , and I need his special kind of companionship . Girard Girard , as you know , is no comfort to me any more . I need youth and freshness around me . I am imploring you , Eloisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consume , Madame Girard , to sustain me in this telephone conversation , " Eloisa appealed . " Eloisa , I will have Girard Girard send you a whole case up to you for your unpleasant task . What brand did you say you use ? " " Oh , please , you know we buy only a cheap domestic . " " You shall be sent Napoleon today , " Madame Girard assured her . " No favors , please , " Eloisa rejected her . " You know what Jerome thinks of favors . And Malcolm must absolutelystay until the portrait is done . " " No , no , you shall come here to paint him . Meanwhile , I am getting ready to make my visit to you at once . " " We will bar the door , Madame Girard . Your wealth and position can not force open the entry to a private house . " " You are rejecting my friendship and my generosity , " Madame Girard cried . " You are rejecting me . When all I wish to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Malcolm is not going to be handed over to you . When his portrait is finished , we will call you up  --  not until . " " You wish , I see , then , for me to employ force , " Madame Girard said with regret . " Consider me . Consider Malcolm , " Eloisa now implored her . " Consider you . Consider him , " Madame Girard harumphed . " You poor innocent thing . What do you know of real suffering ? What if your husband was in a differentp112woman 's bed each evening , and then upon his arriving home at last had time only for a business talk on the transatlanticcables . Contemplate that for suffering . " " I know , Madame Girard , your marriage is a difficult one , but consider  --  " " Consider you ! You have your jazz musicians . You have a loving , though idiotic , husband . You have your art . Now you have Malcolm . I have nothing . " " Madame Girard , this phone is simply weighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . I am not a heavy drinker like you , and as you know my brands are not imported . I wo n't be able to paint unless you hang up , and then you will have no portrait . " " Unless you give me permission to at least come to your home , I vow I will kill myself , " Madame Girard informed her . " Madame Girard , " Eloisa said , " suicide is your own decision . I will not respond to your customary threats . " " Eloisa , " Madame Girard cried . " Be generous , if you can not be reasonable . I will pay you . . . anything . " Eloisa suddenly hung up , without replying . " She may kill herself this time , " Eloisa said , taking a drink of brandy . " But I rather fear we will see her instead as a visitor here . " Malcolm nodded gravely . " But whatever happens in these next few days or hours , or even weeks , " Eloisa said , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't leave , do you hear . No matter what happens . Do n't go away with anybody . Your portrait must be finished , do you hear ? "  |p113At  that moment , George Leeds , the piano player , appeared in the room in evening dress and announced to Eloisa that the concert was about to begin on the third floor and that her presence was seriously " in request . " Malcolm was about to say something to George  --  how different he looked from the man who had combed his hair in their common bed !  --  who nodded affably at the boy , but Eloisa began giving Malcolm instructions before regretfullyexcusing herself , and warning him not to leave the room under any circumstances , and that she would return just as soon as the concert ended . Eloisa and the piano player then went out together , andp114a few minutes later , the sad persistent notes of bass and sax , piano and vibraphone and drums drifted down to him . Malcolm felt himself then entirely alone , more alone than had he remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , with its castle-like high ceilings , the feel of the gray thick carpets beneath his feet , and the self-portraits of Eloisa , the drawings of Negroes looking out from their pale eyes , of strange perhaps non-existent animals gazing at him from canvases everywhere , Malcolm remembered his early travels with his father in countries whose names he could no longer recall . But this time , he was more hopelessly alone , in addition to not understanding anything around him . And at the same time he rather felt that perhaps he belongedhere as much as anywhere , with the colored musicians , the paintings , and the different bed each night . A cat came up from the basement and examined him with a look , and then went on to the floor above . The three floors in the house were all of them furnished with identical furniture and with Eloisa 's paintings , and all of them punctuated hour by hour with the notes from the bass and sax and piano . Everywhere in the house , no matter at what hour , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight , with a coolness , too , like perpetual autumn , an autumn that will not pass into winter owing to some damageperhaps to the machinery of the cosmos . It will go on being autumn , go on being cool , but slowly , slowly everythingwill begin to fall piece by piece , the walls will slip down ever so little , the strange pictures will warp , the mythological animals will move their eyes slightly for the last time as they fade into indistinction , the strings of the bass will loosen and fall , the piano keys wrinkle and disappear into the wood of the instrument , and the beautiful alto sax shrivel into foil . How long Malcolm slept he did not know , but waking upp115suddenly he first saw the cat looking at him again , and then  --  Kermit . " The little man , " Malcolm exclaimed . " You 've escaped ! " Kermit laughed , a mischievous curl of pleasure on hislips . " I was about to turn you into a cat , " he told Malcolm . " Be seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhis own house . " How did you come to get in here ? " " The door was open , and I walked in from my morning stroll , " Kermit informed him . " I did n't know you ever took . . . strolls , " Malcolm said with some surprise . " You 're not afraid ? " " Afraid a dog will swallow me ? " Kermit laughed , an edge of bitterness in his expression . " I 'm afraid for you . . . is all , " Malcolm was serious . " And so the great woman painter and jazz queen hassucceeded in making you a prisoner , " Kermit began . " She may have , " Malcolm acknowledged , " but then perhaps I was one before . " " I see you as one , yes , " Kermit agreed . " But , from the bench . . . to the cat-house , which I suppose one could call it . Well . . . " Kermit laughed somewhat too heartily , while Malcolm merely sat with his hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persona non grata here , " Kermit said when he had finished laughing , "  --  or in plain words , Eloisa hates me . It took not a little courage to come in here . " " Why does such a successful woman hate you ? " Malcolmwondered , his chin loose , and his eyes full of puzzlement . " It 's an old feud , " the little man replied , in evident relishmentof what he was about to tell . " Years ago  --  two years , in fact , I called her on the telephone  --  her instrument of torture  --  and well , with four or five drinks to fortify me , I simply said to her , Eloisa , my dear , why is it I 'm not goodp116enough to ever be invited to one of your soirees ? ' She was struck speechless with whatever emotion an old retired whore like her is struck speechless with . Then while she was pinioned in her own silence , I went on : Is it the quality of my painting which critics find so infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is it the fact that my good looks and graceful presence make your unappetizing grossness and overblown charms so especially detestable ? ' " " You said that ? " Malcolm leaned closer . " I said I was drunk , " Kermit replied acidly  --  and then going on , with all his former delight : " She actually apologizedthen and there , said my not having been invited was an oversight , et cetera , and was never intentional , but I was not so easily appeased . . . There is one reason , dear Eloisa , ' I went on , why my name was perhaps never on your list . ' . . . What on earth reason would that be ? ' she cried , her voice shaking and thin . . . Your husband , dear Eloisa , ' I told her , is so fond of my kisses ! ' " Malcolm jumped up and walked over to a corner of the room , standing there motionless and silent like a schoolboy sent to punishment , while Kermit laughing at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had walked off from him . " What on earth are you doing in that corner ? " Kermit cried , when he had recovered from his mirth . " Come out from there at once . . . " When Malcolm did not move , Kermit went over to him , and took his hand in his . " Has the little midget failed to entertain his royal highness ? " Kermit said somewhat soberly , and he led Malcolmout from the corner . " Sit down , " the little man now commanded Malcolm , and the boy obeyed , a sober look on his face . " Tell me , dear child , " the midget said . " Are you by chance a virgin ? "  |p117Malcolm  's throat moved , his vocal organs appeared to be repeating Kermit 's question . " Do I have to draw a picture for you ? " the little man shot an angry glance . " Not exactly , " Malcolm replied . " Not exactly what ? " Kermit said irritably . " Not exactly . . . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helpless grin came over his mouth . " Well , speak up then . God knows I 'm not old enough to be your father . . . But if you 're missing in the basic informationof life , I can always take a minute out for you in the name of friendship . " Malcolm nodded . " How many girls have you been to bed with ? " the midget interrogated . " Girls ? " Malcolm swallowed . " It 's girls we are talking about , " the midget proceeded . " Well , you see , my father  --  " Malcolm began . " I thought we would come to that , " the midget said . Then going up to Malcolm , and shaking the boy , the little man said : " Now see here , see here  --  " when the sound of heavy footsteps made both of them look up . " Petit monstre ! " Eloisa Brace cried , entering the room , and addressing Kermit . " Take your hands off Malcolm at once . " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painter . " Forgive me , " Eloisa said quickly and contritely , perhapsrecognizing the real danger of Kermit 's enmity toward her . " I did n't mean to speak so sharply . . . There 's been so much excitement here today . " She broke into a short sob , which she immediately controlled.  | " I do n't mean to not be your friend , Kermit , " Eloisa continued . " ' Though I fear you are not mine . " " I could discuss this all so much better , " Kermit explained to her , " if we had something refreshing and at the same time alcoholic to drink . Something destined perhaps for one of the many parties which I seem always to have missed here . " " Kermit , please , " Eloisa 's temper flashed for a minute . Then looking briefly at Malcolm , she got up , explaining that she would bring Kermit a drink at once . " I 've always heard from those who have had invitations to your parties , " Kermit detained her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , dear Eloisa ? " Eloisa Brace covered her face with her painting hand , and sighed : " It 's always this way with me . I do n't have any , as a matter of fact , Kermit  --  not at the moment . Will you please please believe me , and have something else in its stead ? " " What is in its stead ? " the little man wondered , holding his index finger over his temple in the manner of one who wishes to hear an important reply . " I have some wonderful California red wine , " Eloisa cried enthusiastically , a bit too loud . " Jerome and I have just discovered it , and we ca n't get enough of it . " " But you did manage to keep some modicum for little visitors like me ? " Kermit inquired , narrowing his eyes . " Allow me all the hospitality I can offer you , " Eloisa implored him . " I know , dear Eloisa , that you have finer wines in your house than your California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who went for so many years without wine at all  --  " Here Eloisa attempted to interrupt the midget with ap119word , but the little man clapped his hands imperiously  --  and continued : " BUT , as I too am a reasonable person , and since this is my first visit to a house whose entrance has always hitherto been denied to me  --  I will accept , shall we say , what in serious houses is proffered to the domestics ? " " Kermit , " Eloisa began , and it was only at that moment that Malcolm noticed that she was wearing an evening dress which had a rather bad tear in the behind  --  " Kermit , let us not spoil this afternoon . For Malcolm 's sake alone . We should not let him see us as only adults should see one another ! " Kermit was preparing a reply , but Eloisa vociferated in her glad voice : " And now to your wine , " and went out of the room . " She never asked me what I wanted ! " Malcolm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The idea of crashing in on us like that , without knockingor a how-do-you-do or anything . And in that ridiculowscast-off torn dress . " Kermit scoffed . " And just as you were about to tell me something important , Malcolm , about yourself . " " IT ' Malcolm pointed in an expression of surprise to his chest . " Tell me at once what it was you were going to say ? " Kermit demanded . Malcolm stammered , for so much , so very much had occurred , it was becoming more and more difficult to remember what had happened and when , not to mention an unimportant thing like what he was about to say a few minutes ago . But while he was still stammering , Eloisa entered with a tray on which stood three glasses and a bottle of unlabelled red wine.  | " Pardon me , Kermit , if my hands shake too much to pour you each your drink , " Eloisa said . " Malcolm , " she turned to him , " Would you pour each of us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you have an apron for me to put on ? " Malcolminquired , looking anxiously at his suit . Eloisa and Kermit exchanged looks . " I will pour each of us whatever it is in the bottle , " Kermitstepped in , a lordly contempt in his voice for both Malcolmand Eloisa . " No , no , I will pour now , " Eloisa said . " My hands have quit trembling . . . " " But , dear Eloisa , " Malcolm assured her . " I would gladly pour , but all bartenders wear aprons , and I was only ask-ing -- 2 ' " Silence , " Eloisa shouted . " I ca n't endure another thing from anyone . I will pour , do you hear ? " she thundered at both of them . And trembling , she poured in great haste three glasses full of red wine . " To all of us ! " she cried with great vigor , raising her glass . " To Girard Girard ! " Malcolm exclaimed loudly , to which he got no response from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on the third floor attending the jazz rehearsal , " Eloisa said , " I could not control my nerves . I felt  --  perhaps because Malcolm is here  --  something terrible was going to happen . I could hardly wait to get back here to see if everything was all right . " " Be happy you can lead such a full life , " Kermit told Eloisa . " Accept danger as part of the risk . " " Please , " Eloisa said , and she looked happy for the first time that afternoon . " I will not please , " Kermit told her . " You have experi/enced nearly everything , except perhaps being under fire in battle : marriages , musicians , art , love , all the dazzle and excitement that can only come to a figure of the arts  --  " " You 're rubbing it in now , " Eloisa became ill-tempered again . " No , I am speaking from the heart , " Kermit assured her . " You deserve your coterie , such as it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps no other woman ever set foot . " " I knew it ! " Eloisa cried helplessly . " You 're ribbing me . " " You invented modern jazz , do n't deny it , " the little man went over to Eloisa 's chair . " Stop him , " Eloisa implored Malcolm with a look of futility . " And your marriage to Jerome ! " Kermit went on . " Is it not the marriage of the century ? " " Kermit , stop right there with my marriage . If you go further  --  " and she made a frantic gesture . " I ca n't hear  --  no , not even a compliment concerning my marriage . My marriage is too close , somehow , to  --  " " Too close to what ? " a deep feminine voice cried from the entrance to the room . All eyes looked up to see Madame Girard coming into the center of the room , a sun parasol in her hand . Closing her eyes , and raising her parasol gently into the air , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the sign . " Madame Girard cleared her throat , but she did not need to wait for silence : she had created the deepest kind possible . Addressing again now her auditors , she said : " I have only come here to claim what is my own . A reasonable re/quest . I am , of course , a reasonable woman . Let there be no interruptions , please ! " Madame Girard turned to Malcolm , who had stood up only , as a matter of fact , to hear her better , but she had construed his movement as an attempt to interpolate . " Sit down , " Madame Girard commanded Malcolm sotto voce . She continued , closing her eyes again : " Why should the rest of the world know plenty , happiness , domestic satisfaction , love  --  while I am shut out from all these things , deprived of a woman 's human station in life , turned in upon my own devices , and saddled  --  " here she opened her eyes directly and immediately upon the tray with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a husband who knows not whether I am alive or dead , and cares , yes , cares  --  dear Eloisa , I can feel you are shakingyour head , so stop !  --  cares LESS . " " Madame Girard , " Eloisa managed to get out . " Silence , I say , " Madame Girard addressed herself briefly to Eloisa . " I know you are a woman of talent , perhaps genius , but your words , your advice , whatever you have to offer here this afternoon is worth no more to me than yesterday'sbath water . . . " Kermit shrank into his chair , his bravado of a moment ago completely vanished , while gazing glassily at the woman he had feared so long to meet , but since she kept her eyes closed , allowed him for the time being to stare at her with impunity . Malcolm began to look sleepy , and Eloisa Brace , overcomeby the day 's fare of brandy , wine , fear , and confusion began whimpering softly . " I have been called unreasonable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still tightly closed and flutteringlike a medium who sees the ghost she had never thought to catch . " I , who am the most reasonable of women , thep123kindest , the most generous , the one who wants to give all her love . Yes , all ! " Here , Madame Girard opened her eyes wide , and , when they fell on Eloisa , the latter cried out : " Stop her , oh , stop her , somebody ! " Madame Girard closed her eyes again , but then , changingher mind , she opened them suddenly and said , " Will you be quiet , lady , while I am delivering my speech ? Why do you think I am here , but to get you to see reason ! hear reason ! follow reason ! " " Reason ! " Eloisa cried . " For good God 's sake , why does this house not fall upon us when such words are spoken . " Kermit brought Eloisa her wine glass , which , in the confusion of Madame Girard 's entrance , she had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Madame Girard continued , and raising her parasol a bit too carelessly , the point of it caught one of the stuffed owls which rested on the mantle , and brought it flying to the carpet , where it suddenly disintegratedinto a heap of dust and feathers . " Do n't touch it , " Madame Girard warned , at the signs of motion on Eloisa 's part . " You shall be repaid  --  triple  --  for this damage . " But to get back ! " she went on . " Wronged not only by that satyr Girard Girard who has divided his lifetime into  --  passion for money and lust with servant girls  --  " " No , no , Madame Girard , you wrong him , " Malcolm exclaimed , standing up . " Will you keep these immature ephebes seated and silent , or shall I summon someone who can ? " Madame Girard turned her anger against Eloisa Brace . She was about to continue when her attention was distracted by the extreme awe written on the face of the midget . Strolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat cringing  --  looking , as Madame Girard later de/scribed him , like a kinkajou at noon  --  Madame Girard studied him closely for a moment , and then delivered a resoundingkiss , as stooping , she bent over his mouth . She immediately returned to the center of the room to resume speaking . But Kermit , touching himself on his mouth , had exclaimed : " I have been anointed then . " " Merely recognized , not anointed , " Madame Girard informedhim , aside . " Madame Girard , my dear friend , " Eloisa said , making a last effort , and rising she took the older woman by the hand . " You must go upstairs and lie down , and I will call your husband . You are going to be very sick , if you do not listen to me now . " " Go away , my dear , " Madame Girard recommended to Eloisa . " You are eternally de trop . I am speaking primarily to them  --  " and she pointed to the two men . " You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supplying the world with your genius , but not appearing in public . You are too ugly to appear in public , even a public as small as this room . Let the world feast its eyes on young beauties like theirs  --  , " and she swept her arms in the direction of Malcolm and Kermit  --  " but let work-a-day geniuses like you keep to themselves in work-rooms . To your work-room , genius ! To your work-room ! " " Do n't you see , my dear , " Eloisa continued to hold MadameGirard by the hand , " you are bringing about a crise . " " Then , do you go to bed , my dear . I myself am fresh as a daisy . Who could not be in such company ? " " You have given me a splitting headache , " Eloisa complained . " To your work-room , then . Work is the sovereign cure for headaches . You know that . Ah , how beautiful you were , " Madame Girard reflected softly , looking directly into Eloisa 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your hair was like ripe wheat  --  no , do n't deny that it was . A delight to the eye , and hand . And now look at it . Look at you . You have allowed that burglar to defile you , to common you , that 's what . Even your speech is no longer dignified , harumphing O.K. 's in a stream . And you 've gotten a pot on you from drinking with him . Oh , how my heart has ached for you , Eloisa . I will not deny it . But my feelings for you must not interfere with my own words of advice , which are wise and true for you : Leave this room ! Go to your work ! You are fit now for nothing but labor . Leave me to these beautiful young men . Did you think I came to see you ? Never ! Go ! Leave ! We have no further need of you , do we , my handsomes ? " Malcolm and Kermit both gaped at Madame Girard , too engrossed by what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eloisa began walking about the room , weeping and drinking from time to time now direct from the wine bottle . " A woman who calls herself my friend , " Eloisa said weakly . " There is no friendship here , my dear , " Madame Girard replied . " You sullied my friendship for you by marrying that jail-bird . Had you cared for me you would never have gone through with such a marriage . I am here today to pay tribute to these two young men , and I implore you for the last time to leave the room . I beg , and I demand it . " " You are leaving me no choice , " Eloisa Brace said with great steadiness , putting down the wine bottle . " No choice for what ? " Madame Girard asked , a hint of apprehension in her tone . " I am going to call Girard Girard , " Eloisa warned her . " He is in Iowa making four million dollars . " " Then I shall call the authorities , " Eloisa said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Authorities , your foot ! " Madame Girard sneered , andp126she moved over to the table on which sat Malcolm 's wine glass , which was more than half full , and which she now drained at a swallow . " They have called the authorities a thousand times for me , " she regaled them . " But do you think they dare take me ? When they know who I am ? Never . And do you know , even if they did not know who I was , why they would never dare take me ? " she stared at everyone in the room , all of whom , she saw , hung on each word that now came from her . " Of course you do n't know why ! How could you ? They do n't take me because I know everything ! And they can see that knowledge on my face ! For that reason , even if they should be called , they would never disturb me . . . " Going immediately over to Malcolm after she had said this , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in rapid succession . " It is for you alone , " Madame Girard said , " that I made this difficult trip , that I came to see your beautiful face . . . living , and portrayed in oil . . . " Madame Girard stopped suddenly , like one who is listening for a sound which will be a signal and cue . " Where is that portrait , you swindler ? " she addressed Eloisa . " Malcolm ! Kermit ! " Eloisa said fiercely . " We must tieher . We must tie her or she will begin to destroy things . " " They wo n't help you , " Madame Girard hurled at Eloisa . " Hold her , " Eloisa commanded the boys . Neither of the young men budged . " You see , " Madame Girard laughed . " You can do nothing . Go call your authorities . " Madame Girard had , however , forgotten one thing about Eloisa Brace : the latter 's athletic prowess . Eloisa closed her eyes , bracing herself for the supreme effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed deliriously at her imagined victory.  | " I will never leave , " she was crying when Eloisa Brace looking remarkably like a boxer who has re-entered the ring , advanced toward the great woman , and delivered two blows , a powerful left , and then a right to the chin , and Madame Girard tottered and then fell silently , a sad smile on her mouth , to the floor , and lay there in an attitude like that of the stone queen , asleep through all the ages . " Pick her up and carry her to the east guest room , " Eloisa commanded the two men quietly , and Malcolm and Kermit hastened to obey her.  | " But why should I leave your house , if you love me ? " Madame Girard was speaking to Jerome Brace , late the next day , lying back in the largest bed in the house , to which Malcolm and Kermit had , with great difficulty  --  they had dropped her twice on the staircase  --  carried her . Madame Girard held her hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as Jerome noted admiringly , one of the blackest eyes which he himself , in his own specialized career , had ever seen . Madame Girard was proud of Jerome 's acknowledgment of her " mouse , " but soon she began to complain again ofp129her treatment  --  not so much of Eloisa 's " brutality , "  --  she had admired the painter 's daring attack on her  --  but of Jerome 's insistent order that she leave the premises . Madame Girard denied that Jerome loved her any more . " We do love you , Madame Girard , more than you will ever know . " " My mother used to employ that same phrase to me , and yet it was she who ruined my life with her undiscriminating affection . " " I love you , Madame Girard , " Jerome said , taking her small hand in his . " Yet you ask me to leave the premises , " she shook her head . " Only because we love you . " " Do n't you realize that you are asking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything in the world , " Madame Girard expostulated . Jerome watched her . " Because I am with the ones I love now , " she went on . " The little Kermit  --  " she suddenly spoke in " baby-talk " over this phrase . " Malcolm , Eloisa , George Leeds , and the musicians , and you , wonderful you . " She held out her arms to him , and Jerome kissed her quietly again , this time on the hair . " It 's not , " Jerome began sitting down on the bed beside her , " it 's not as if you could never come to see us again . " " Oh , but it is , " she replied . " It is , and you know it is . " " Madame Girard , a little reason , please . " " I must stay because love is here , " she told him . " You will diminish a good deal of that love if you stay ! " he warned . Her eyes darted about in her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him : " But I will be good  --  for you . " " You were never good in your life , Madame Girard . Your whole life has been devoted to not being good forp130your friends . And it is this quality in you that makes us love you : you can not be good . " " I can not ? " she asked , craftiness and sweetness in her voice . " You can NOT , " Jerome repeated for her . " But this time , I will . I will command myself . " " Madame Girard , consider the man you are talking to . " " Jerome , the burglar , " she said , hopelessly considering her situation . " How people of privilege always put things so coarsely , " Jerome said . " It is really only the downtrodden who have all the sensitivity . " " I have suffered too much to be fine any more , " she said , speaking now into the wall . " What I was trying to tell you , " Jerome continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I know that you , do n't reform by saying you mean to . Besides , you have no intention of reforming . You want to be naughty . " " I want to be ? " she considered this . " It 's the only part you can play now . " " You mean I have limited myself , " Madame Girard reached for one of the brioches which they had brought to her at her insistence . " Consider , " Jerome said , " you have acted this one part for as many years as you have been married to Girard Girard , who worships , or at least , worshipped the ground you walk on . " " Do n't go into my years of marriage and my age , " she warned him . " I know how old I am , and you need not give a chronicle of my life . " " I had no intention of referring to your age . But you have played your naughty role for a great long time . " " Jerome , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is you have left life and gone on to religion . " He laughed , superior to this comment.  | " The worst kind of change , " she went on , " has happened to you . You 're a reformer . A do-gooder . You think because you were a burglar and did time that you have a blueprint for everybody outside . You 're every confounded preacher and evangelist I have ever known . " " Tell me what they 're like . " " Like they know the answers before they even heard the question . Yes , you 're one of the truth boys , and though you have a lot more honey on your tongue than most of them , no thank you , Jerome , no thank you . You 've ruined Eloisa , but keep your hands off my soul . " " Madame Girard , you 're being pretty hard on me . " " And do n't keep addressing me with my full title , " she reminded him . " What should I call you then ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge you from there . " Jerome smiled , and his gaze fell down to one of Madame Girard 's exposed feet , whose nails were freshly painted . " Then there is nothing for Eloisa and me to do but what we have always done in this situation ? " he said , standing up . " Do you mean to call Girard Girard again , or only the police this time ? " she wondered . " Girard first , of course , and then , if necessary , the po-lice . " " And to think I am talking to an ex-con , " Madame Girard said . " You 're as dumb and mean as any damned arm of the law you could turn to . " " We have to lead our own lives , Madame Girard , " Jerome said . " And yet you talk about love , " she mused , wiping off her fingers of the crumbs from the pastry . " By the way , " she added . " That brioche was stale . " He bowed.  | " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stale . Not at all . " " Then why mention it ? " " We should mention everything . Otherwise no friendship , or love is possible . You yourself have taught me that , and you are cured ' . " Jerome cleared his throat . " We are not asking anything impossible of you , " Jerome continued in his ( as he himself could not help noticing now ) pastoral manner . " We are merely asking you to go to your beautiful home and to your husband . " " Do you know what is happening in my beautiful home at this very moment ? " Madame Girard demanded , raising her hand upwards . Jerome waited for her answer . " Girard Girard is in bed with the laundress . " " And are you clear of any responsibility in this ? " " I suppose I am responsible for everything , " she replied . " But why go home to see what my irresponsibility has produced . I ask you this , Jerome , and this time reply as your old burglar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Girard , " Jerome began hesitatingly , and with the unmistakable note of loss of patience . " Do n't tell me you love me again , either , " she warned , " or I may lose that stale brioche . " She held her hand to her breast . " I 'm afraid we have no choice but to take measures with you , " he said lamely , perhaps quoting something somebody had once said to him . " Is that all ? " " Why ca n't you believe in us ? " " Why ca n't you love me enough to let me stay and enjoy my beauties , ' Malcolm and Kermit , and my admiration for Eloisa. "  | " For one thing , Malcolm is having his portrait painted , and you would upset all order and calm around here . " " I would be still as a tomb , " Madame Girard begged . " You would want to watch , you know you would . Andthen watching , you would begin to criticize , or you wouldruffle up Malcolm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have never teased a cat in my life , and I was raising cats long before you even thought of being a criminal ! " she said hotly . " Madame Girard . " She began weeping softly . " If only one person cared , " she said . " But nobody does . Except perhaps old Mr. Cox . He does listen to what I have to say , and he does not tell me he loves me when he commandsme to do something ridiculous . " " Do you think Mr. Cox would allow you to eat brioche in his bed ? " Jerome wondered . " Mr. Cox has never ordered me out of his house , " she defended the astrologer . " Only because you have never been in it , " Jerome said acidly . " Mr. Cox gives me all he can , but he does not pretend he has very much for me . You , like all evangelists , pretend you do . " " You are accusing us of bad faith . " " I am only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are , then , hypocrites . " " You talk about love a good deal more than you do anythingabout it , especially you . Or perhaps especially Eloisa , " Madame Girard hesitated . " No , especially both of you . You are professional lovers ' like the Christians used to be . " " Do n't use those terms with regard to us . " " I had forgotten all about how old-fashioned Christiansp134acted until I met you , " Madame Girard was firm . " I knew there was some fly in your ointment , but I thought you were a bit soft-brained from prison . But now I know what it is ! " she cried in triumph . " Madame Girard , I 'm asking you  --  " he cried . " You are an old-fashioned Christian looking for your flock . " " Please , " Jerome said , red-faced . " Do n't be indecent as well as obnoxious . " Madame Girard rose high in her bed , and slapped him vigorously across the mouth . " Sit down , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pretend I am uncontrollable so that you can beat me . Do n't I see the sadist in you ? Sit down at once . " Jerome sat down , the same deep red on his face . " I saw through you the day Eloisa married you , " MadameGirard told him . " Your honied words , your honied love . Under all your honey runs a conduit of venom . " " I will not listen to your raving . " " You people who talk and talk about love all the time , " Madame Girard ignored his interpolation . " You 're the least of the lot . If you did anything about it , you would n't have to tell it . I 'll bet if I offered you a million dollars right now you would walk out of this room and leave Eloisa on her can . And do n't I know why you want Malcolm and Kermit to yourself , too . " Jerome gave her at that moment such a smile of patient condescension and untouchable superiority that Madame Girard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't love anybody , " she sobbed . " You do n't love Eloisa , you do n't love me , you do n't love Malcolm . And you say you 're cured . ' Of what ? Cured of everything but talk , that 's all , that 's the cure , cured to go on your selfish evangelical way acting superior to other human beings and being proud you were a goddam burglar and can now sitp135around with your less fortunate straight middle-class fellows , and act superior to them because they are dumb enough to say they do n't know to all your pious questions . Yes , you know everything , but wait , just one moment  --  , " and here Madame Girard stood up in the bed and pointed a finger at him with such sterness that the smile on his face slowly disappeared . " I issue a prognostication on you : your cure ' is over ! Do you hear ? You are no longer cured . ' A long set-back is about to overtake you , and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your burglar days , that love is deeds and not honied talk . " " And now , Madame Girard , " Jerome told her , " will you please get up and get ready to leave like a good girl ? " And he gave her a chaste kiss on her brow . " Condescension ! condescension ! " Madame Girard cried . " The last weapon ! " Girard Girard had come , summoned by an intoxicated and distraught Eloisa Brace , and he was waiting , frowningand gray in his handsome raincoat , when Madame Girard came painfully down the long two flights of stairs from the guest room where she had just finished her long interview with Jerome . Madame Girard stopped at the landing of the second flight of stairs in order to stare at her husband . " I suppose I have interrupted some amour of yours with the kitchen help ? " she levelled her attack . Girard Girard barely looked up from his stance in the middle of the lower room . " My husband does not speak to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance to the room , was weeping and hiccuping . " Ignored by my own husband , ordered out of the housep136by a burglar , pommelled by my dearest woman friend  --  ignored by my beauties , " and she waved a gloved hand at each of these persons in succession . " Can any one deny that my empire is in ruins ? " " Madame Girard , " Eloisa cried , going part way up to her . " Halt ! " Madame Girard whispered , and she seized a sprig of greenery which was trailing from a heavy vase . " I will not hear anybody speak of love again , " Madame Girard announced . " You are all , yes all of you , professional love-speakers . Girard Girard , Eloisa , Jerome , the burglar , all of you speak of your great beating love-full hearts . Yet you will not endure my presence here for more than a few hours . You tear me away from the only pleasure that now remains to me in my mature years "  --  here she threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell as air . " You call men to come for me whenever you tire of my repetitions , whenever my presence ruffles your comfort , whenever your boredom spouts out of its foundationless depths . . . " " She is giving the oration , " Girard Girard cried in a hopeless voice . " Yet you , " Madame Girard went on , motioning to Girard and Eloisa Brace , " spare yourselves no pleasure . And what would you do if you did not have me to talk about , to feel superior to ? What pleasure that would take away from you ! What pleasure indeed ! " She began to weep a little , but then becoming dry-eyed and mildly savage : " Without me , your life would have no imagination . For though you can not stand me in the flesh , my spirit and will are all that keep you going . You are all of you dependent on me for life . " " Christ in heaven ! " Girard exclaimed  | " Who has stolen my parasol ? " Madame Girard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress breaking off at rehearsal . " Your parasol is here , my dear , " Eloisa said , producing it with a swiftness that seemed obscene . " Ah , " Madame Girard cooed . " So you were ready for me . . . You have spared no time at all in having the final preparations for my eviction . . . " Madame Girard went up closely to Eloisa now as if to study a rare stone . Slowly , while Eloisa exchanged looks of fear and doubt with Girard Girard , Madame Girard pressed her lips against Eloisa 's forehead , kissing her several times . Then looking carefully and critically at Eloisa , Madame Girard said : " You have no beauty left . Your skin , which was never handsome , is now that of a woman without either age or youth . You belong to the nameless waves of the middle-aged . " Eloisa sobbed softly . " Can any husband looking on that skin feel love ? " MadameGirard appealed to the entire room . There was a long silence . " Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an artist you are obliged to answer . " Eloisa sat down on the sofa near Girard Girard , and picked up a glass of brandy , which had been left there from the day before . " Can any man looking at your face see love or even a woman . The answer , my dear Eloisa , is no . You are no longer a woman . Are you an artist indeed ? That remains to be seen when the portrait of Malcolm is finished . Are your powers as an artist allied to your powers as a woman ? If they are , you are done , finished , through forever . " " Madame Girard , " Eloisa cried in great anguish , " you must leave at once . "  |p138Girard  Girard now advanced toward his wife , galvanizedinto action by Eloisa 's cry . " Do n't touch me , either of you , " Madame Girard warned . " I will go out to the car alone , and I will get into it unassistedby anybody . I am leaving this house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eloisa said . " You will not leave until you promise me you will return in a happier time . " " Eloisa suddenly remembers how very wealthy the both of us are , " Madame Girard addressed herself to her husband . She adjusted her scarf about her throat . " I want , however , " Madame Girard added , " I want the portrait of Malcolm , and Girard Girard will pay you for it now . " Eloisa attempted to say something , but her throat had not been sufficiently moistened by the brandy . " How much is the portrait ? " Madame Girard demanded . " But it is not finished ! And you have not seen what is finished ! " Eloisa exclaimed . " How much will it be when finished ? " Girard Girard inquired . Eloisa stood thinking . " Is five thousand too much to ask ? " Eloisa ventured at last . " Five thousand ? " Madame Girard said , beating her parasolinto the rug . " Five thousand is not my price for any-thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her further deliberation . " Is that price not satisfactory to you then ? " Girard Girard addressed his wife . " Five thousand is not my kind of price for anything , I repeat , " Madame Girard expostulated . " Give her ten thousandor nothing . " " Is ten thousand a satisfactory price , Eloisa , my dear ? "  |p139Girard  questioned , looking at the painter warmly and sympathetically . " Ten thousand , " Eloisa gasped , surprised , genuinely surprised . Girard Girard , however , was already taking out his checkbook . " But you have not seen the portrait , " Eloisa cried weakly . " What if you should not like it ? " Girard Girard meanwhile had written with great rapidity and flourish a check for the amount agreed upon , and handed it now to the painter . " I have never paid five thousand for anything I wanted , " Madame Girard warned everybody in the room . Clapping her hands swiftly , Madame Girard announced , perhaps to cut off the warm looks being exchanged by Girard Girard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going up to Eloisa quickly , Madame Girard kissed her wetly on the mouth and said , " Despite all , you will always be dear to me , Eloisa , " and both Madame Girard and Girard Girard left the house at once without another word.  | " I have been enriched ! " cried Eloisa Brace . " I am no longer what you can exactly call a pauper , let us say . " Jerome , Malcolm , and Kermit ( the latter having , in the confusion , stayed on and on )  --  all three came up to her at that moment like a delegation of congratulation , although her statement had been as private as a soliloquy , and the sight of the check appeared to have removed her from all other human contact . " Ten thousand smackers ! " she moaned . Singling out Kermit , then , Eloisa Brace bent very low and kissed him on the head.  | " You are at the pinnacle of your career , " Kermit said calmly . " Thank you , dear , " Eloisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present vanished . " I am the husband of a rich woman , " Jerome said , and he was very pale . He sat down on the small wooden chair which Girard Girard had briefly occupied while waiting for Madame Girard to descend . " Why are you so white ? " Eloisa asked her husband , and she turned also to look at the faces of Malcolm and Kermit , perhaps seeking an explanation of her husband 's pallor from them . The two young men , however , both showed pink poker-faces , and of the two , Malcolm showed the lesser emotion . Money , after all , had never been anything special to him , although of late what he had was rapidly dwindling , and had Eloisa said she had just got one million dollars , Malcolm would have probably been just as impressedor unimpressed . But Jerome knew what money meant , and so Eloisa turned her full attention to him . " Jerome , dear , you must explain your attitude , and your paleness . " " Must I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tone . " What change has come over you ? " Eloisa begged to know , and Malcolm saw that her former character of dominance  --  which he had experienced the night of his arrival , changed now to dependence , almost panic . When no one spoke , Malcolm began eating a Delicious apple , and his chewing filled the silence . Eloisa studied Girard Girard 's check , meanwhile , admiringthe signature , as well as the denomination , and then advancing to the bureau , she took down a purple velvet box , and laid the check inside.  | " I wish you would speak , then , " Eloisa told Jerome suddenly , her back to him . " What would you have me speak ? " Jerome replied distantly , more distantly than she had ever heard him . Malcolm 's chewing continued . " It has been a completely full two days , " Eloisa remarkedafter a long silence . " Ending in wealth for one of us , " Jerome commented , with dogged unpleasantness . " For one of us , " Eloisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is the meaning of one ? " " You heard me say one , very well , one it is , " Jerome raised his voice , and then leaped up and turning unexpectedlyin the direction of Malcolm , he seized the apple almost from out of the boy 's mouth and threw it into the fireplace . " I hate both those goddam capitalists , the Girards , " Jerome cried . Eloisa Brace began wringing her hands , and Malcolm stared open-mouthed , pieces of apple still unchewed showingon his half-protruding tongue . Kermit was looking blackly angry in his own corner . " But you yourself were always wishing for money , " Eloisa expostulated . " And they paid it for a painting . " " They did not , and you know they did not , " roared Jerome . " Oh , my darling , " Eloisa Brace said , and she went up to her husband and put her head on his shoulder . Jerome roughly shook her off , saying , " Stand over there with the boys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eloisa went obediently to the part of the room where the boys were stationed . Malcolm had picked up his apple , dusted it off , and was again chewing , and Eloisa could not help but place a warning finger against his mouth . " I wish you would explain it all to me , dear Jerome , "  |p143Eloisa  attempted to soothe him from her new position in the room . " Why should I explain what is crystal clear ? " Jerome said tensely . " Madame Girard has no high opinion of you as an artist . " " But the tribute of the money , " Eloisa gasped , struggling not to hear more . " Must I tell you in primer terms ? " Jerome cried . " I am afraid primer terms are required , " she said , after thinking a moment . " You wish brutality , I guess , " Jerome emphasized to her . " I want things said , yes I do , " Eloisa said with more vigor than she had employed up to now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is infatuated with Malcolm , " and here Jerome pointed to the boy in question , and Malcolm half-rose , bowed slightly , and swallowedthe remains of his apple . " Oh , but Jerome , " Eloisa begged him . " There had to be a picture , after all , whoever the subject : it is the picture that matters ! " " Of course there had to be a picture , " Jerome said with menacing sweetness . " Then all is settled : all is settled , and well , " Eloisa urged on him . " All is not settled , and nothing will ever be well between us again , " Jerome called out to her , livid with anger . " How familiar and complete this all is , " Kermit said , suddenlycoming out from his corner . " Be silent at once , and do n't play any role in this , Kermit , " Eloisa turned on him . Kermit showed his teeth in his well-known sardonic si* lent laugh . " Why is nothing settled ? " Eloisa turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bribe and nothing more . By acceptingp144the money , " Jerome cried , and in his excitement his spittle sprinkled itself upon his wife 's face  --  " by accepting the money , you not only proclaim to the world that you have ceased to be a serious artist ( which Madame Girard believesanyhow ) , you have given her , to quote one of her phrases , carte blanche to enter this house at any time she escapes from her husband 's surveillance . And she probably thinks she owns Malcolm , too  --  although he may be as disgustingly wealthy as she and her crooked financier husband , for all I know . " Malcolm now stepped forward to say something , but Eloisa pushed him rudely ( he thought ) back into the corner with Kermit . " Then , as usual , all I have done , and all I have attempted is a mistake , " Eloisa summarized their discussion . " I am speaking of the situation , I have not come to you as yet , " Jerome replied . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pretend now I am innocent of anything ? " " You have accepted money on false premises . " " Then what is your wish and decision in the case ? " Eloisa held out her arms to him in a token of resignation . " There can be only one decision , " Jerome told her . Eloisa stood watching him , pale as he was now , and when he did not say any more immediately , she turned her back on him , and went to the sideboard , took down the brandy bottle , and poured herself a generous draught . " Do n't drink . . . quite yet , " he asked her . " I must have a drink to hear what it is you are going to say . " " You do not know what I am going to say , " Jerome was savage again . " There is nobody in this room so feebleminded he does not know what you are going to say , " she cried.  | " What I was about to say , Eloisa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her husband said to her . " And you have come to the point of moralizing more than Mr. Cox , " Eloisa retorted . " Mr. Cox was mentioned , " Malcolm cried to Kermit . " Silence , " Eloisa turned on the boy again . " Be silent or leave the room ! " " Will you control yourself ? " Jerome sang out to her , and he went over to his wife and took the brandy glass out of her hand . " You will allow me then no deadening of the pain to come , " Eloisa said . " You have not only betrayed yourself , " Jerome said , " you have cheapened our marriage . " " Yes , it is always I , I , who am low , and you , you with your years of suffering who are noble . " Kermit laughed aloud at that moment from his corner , but nobody thought to correct him . " Tell me , then , what your impossible wishes are , " Eloisa said in a stifled voice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Eloisa , " Jerome said in his quiet firm voice , the voice he had used to convince Madame Girard that she must leave the house  --  " you know perfectly well it is you who must tell me . " " I knew you would say that , " and Eloisa folded her arms acrosss her breast . " I shall sit down , now , " Jerome was calm , " and wait for your statement . " " I will break under the pressure some day , and then you will regret some things , " Eloisa warned him , but without conviction , and she went to the brandy bottle again , and drank directly out of it this time . " An Amazon out of her period , " Kermit exclaimed in a loud voice to Malcolm , who seemed to have fallen into onep146of his sleepy attitudes , and did not appear too attentive to what was transpiring . " I am to tell you , then , what it is I am to do , " Eloisa began again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made , " Jerome was unshakable . " Must my life always be heroic ? " Eloisa said with routine bitterness . " Is there to be no rest anywhere , no oasis in the ... " She opened her arms again to Jerome , but he turned away gloomily . " How can I say what you want me to say ? " she appealed again to him . " You must choose between me and the rich . The decision is simple , " he broke his own silence . " My nature is more complicated than your decision , I fear , " Eloisa said . " A choice , however , must be made , " he warned her again . " Why did it have to happen ? Why did I have to see the money , then  --  to know its pleasure  --  only to give it up . " " You 're actually going to give up money then ? " Malcolmsaid , opening his eyes from the half-slumber into which he had been plunged . Eloisa let out cries of pain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Malcolm whispered with Kermit , and Kermit nodded , and laughed softly . " Were there ever two such days of pain for me in a row ? " Eloisa cried . She looked momentarily and savagelyin the direction of the boys , and then going up directly to the little velvet box , she took out the check which Girard Girard had signed with such a flourish only an hour before . She held the paper before her an instant , like one whop147sees more written on it now than she had at first discovered , and then suddenly tearing it all up before them , she tossed the pieces into her mouth , and began chewing them . " Eloisa ! " Malcolm cried , going up to her . Jerome stood up now , and commanded , a benign expressioncoming over his recent scowl  --  " Let her alone . Let her do what she must . " She ate a bit more of the check , and then seeing Jerome so close to her , she struck him soundly over the jaw . He was silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow . Kermit broke loose now in uncontrolled laughter . " You 're all of a pack ! " Eloisa cried out suddenly , looking at all of them . " You 're all fairies , that 's what . All a pack of fairies . And you let women carry the burden , while all you do is talk . Damn all of you ! Fairies ! Fairies ! " she cried , weeping , and seizing the brandy bottle , she ran out of the room. 148During his courtship of her , many years before , Girard Girard and Madame Girard had often sat in a dark wood on the other side of the lagoon from the Japanese Temples , but still within earshot of the bench on which Malcolm was later to sit . Girard Girard had here asked her to marry him , and she had , of course , refused . Another few days had passed , and Fall shaking down the last leaves , he had asked her again . This time , silently weeping over her passing youth , she could not speak but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girard Girard , like the magician he was , already holdingp149the ring in the palm of his hand , pushed it with painful vigor onto her finger , and kissed her heavily on her mouth . ( The trap opened and closed , as she told Mr. Cox later , and all old and dear things were forever replaced by mar-riage . ) " You are then victorious , " Madame Girard had said to her husband-to-be . " We are both victorious , " he told her with what she knew was excessive pride . " What kind of victory can that be ? " she cried , amazed . " What kind of victory is it in which we are both winners ? " It was then that Girard Girard knew , if he had not known before , that marriage with her would be a continuous contest . " There must be victories for both , " he told her , " if there is to be victory for one . " " But victory has always been only my own , " she countered , " unshared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , not my own . " She looked at her ring with surprise now . He waited for a reply to occur to him , shuffling his feet on the oak leaves that formed a carpet for their interview . " I am always alone in victory , " she exclaimed , frightened at the changes that now suddenly appeared about her on all sides , like cracks in an ice floe . " You are no longer unprotected , no longer alone , is all , " Girard Girard kissed her again on the mouth . " My real victories can not be shared , " she insisted to him . " No one understands my victories . " " You can not forbid me to rejoice in your success , " Girardsaid , and he touched the finger on which he had placed the ring . " I can forbid you to feign you are rejoicing over my success , but I will not , " she explained . " I will be generous . " " Thank you , " he replied , nodding.  |p150They  both stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of acquiescence or happiness . " Now we are together , " he said , more pleading than asserting . She was silent . " May I not now call you Madame Girard , which you always said you would forbid me to call you until you had said yes . " She forced down his arms from where they had held her , and looking past him to where the trees stood nearly naked over the lagoon , she said , " I will now be Madame Girard to the entire world . I will be no one else . " No one had ever addressed her again by anything except that name . Madame Girard recalled these things to herself , almost aloud , from that long yesterday afternoon , while she listenedintermittently to Girard Girard entertain her at the piano . He played Scarlatti tolerably well , and he was playinghim now to quiet her . " In a little while you will go out to commit your routine adulteries , " she said to him above his playing . " And , " she continued , unsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you embrace laundresses and chambermaids , I am deprived of the sight of Malcolm , before whom I only wish to light candles . My loves have always been of that type . The candle-lighting type . " Madame Girard , who had never loved and perhaps never respected Girard Girard , now suddenly whetted her own interestin him as a result of his incessant unfaithfulness to her . She sometimes followed him now in a taxi to simulate attention and desire , and as she watched him meet a woman and drive off with her speedily to some second-class hotel , she felt a kind of slow distant imitation of love that shouldp151have come to her full-force the afternoon long past when he had put the ring on her hand . She observed his animal vigor as it descended into his hands on the piano keys . " The music , like all else he touches , " she said aloud , but inaudible to his ears , " is but the overture to his sexual perfection with women . " But a thought that had come to her even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with a kind of feathered swiftness , like that of a poisoned arrow which , she knew , would this time leave its fatal mark . She had never loved Girard , and Girard , of course , had never precisely loved her as a woman . He had worshipped her , satisfying his appetite with the blossoming bodies of common women , but ( and here the feathered arrow whizzed horribly about her ears ) his worship had grown with the years . As she lighted candles to handsome young men like Malcolm , he had never ceased keeping a whole altar of lights burning to her . Now suddenly ( and here she felt the poison of the arrow strike her ) he would no longer light candles to her . The last match had been put to the last wick . Girard Girard no longer loved Madame Girard . And within a few days , or hours , or months , she knew , he would take the title from her . She would have no name . Another Madame Girard would replace her . " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candelabrum at him as he still sat at the piano . He waited there , flushed with some new emotion , the candelabrum having missed him by inches . " You hit a wrong note , " she explained , and they both knew she said this as a lie , even though he had hit a wrong note . He got up without a word , and this was the first time hex shaken mind recognized that it had finally occurred.  |p152He  put on his great coat which he wore only for the most crucial of business deals . " No , Girard , " she expostulated , and at that moment , they both recognized victory passed forever from her to him . " Girard Girard ! " she cried , going up to him . Now he took her arms and put them down away from him . " Do not look to me , " he said , and immediately he had said these words , he trembled , shaken with the power of his own excommunication of her . " I will kill myself this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is your choice , " he stood like stone before her , and the depth of his gaze never left him . He was granite , she saw , with his new character , his new and completevictory . " You will have to look at me as I lie crushed and bleeding , " she said , but almost to herself now , because she knew he was going out of her life altogether . " Madame Girard , you must for this one time listen to reason , " he said finally , and for a moment , and a moment only , he threw back his heavy coat with the colored silk lining on which his name blazoned like a shield . Her eyes fell on the intense gold letters of his identification , seeing perhaps then her own identity melting away into the letters of his name . " Girard Girard , " she pleaded . " I mean to kill myself . " " You remember , your victories were all to be your own , " he recalled the lagoon for her . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never known . " This is now , " Girard commanded by his tone . " I will not , of course , kill myself merely to please you , " she began . " You are free to do what you can and what you must . When I walk out of here tonight , I will walk out forever . "  | " But victory is always mine , " she now echoed him , hollowly . " Do you not recognize me ? " she inquired , a new kind of wildness in her face . " I am Madame Girard . " He advanced now like an actor in an over-lengthy unsuccessfulplay who is about to make a speech after which the curtain must fall precipitously upon his last syllable . " You are no longer Madame Girard , " he said . She faced him now without defence , wordless , with the expression of almost any woman , his laundress , his charwoman . " You have ceased to exist , " he told her . " I am not . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out of this house , I will not return . I go out this time to be married . " " You can not know marriage , " she cried . " I forbid you , and you can not know it anyhow . " She laughed unsteadily , and going over to a closed cabinet , she opened the door , and looking back in mild defiance , she drew out a small pistol . He made no motion to stop her . " I will always be Madame Girard . A command from you can not destroy my identity . " " I am issuing no command in this case , as you yourself must see , " he told her . She stared at the pistol . " You are the one , my dear , who has ceased to be MadameGirard . I have not touched you , " he said finally . " How could I cease to be she ! Was I not she last night when you wrote the ten thousand dollar check for Eloisa Brace ? " " It was your last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol at him . " I am divorcing you in order to marry Laureen Raphael-son . " Madame Girard raised the hand with the pistol like onep154who may command an entire army to extinguish itself , and then letting her hand drop before she gave the omnipotent gesture , she exclaimed weak and without humor : " The wife of the midget . " " We have found one another , " he said , picking up the pistol which she had let fall to the floor , and placing it on top of a reading desk . " I will not allow you to degrade yourself , " she began . " You can marry anybody else . I will urge you , in fact , to marry a woman of your class . But I will not allow you . . . her . " Suddenly the idea came to her : " And she will be MadameGirard ? " " She will indeed , " he replied . " But you could so much easier change your names than I mine , " she begged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have never realized that all the time "  --  and here he advancedalmost threatningly upon her  --  " that victory was always mine . I am victory . " She bent under the words . " You are victory now , " she admitted . " But I will destroyyou . . . " " And through what ? " he cried . " Through a beautiful young man . " He laughed . " I am Madame Girard , " she went on . " The whole world has always known me as she , the whole world will not so quickly lose its memory . " " The world remembers only what power and money tell it , " he spoke to her like one who merely reads from a document . " And my power and money now decree that you no longer exist . " " Victory has always been mine , " she repeated incoherently.  | " That was in the lagoon , in the days when I had this strange love for you . And strange it was , " he laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity . I can change ! " " There is a limit to time and fortune , " he said . " You are now  --  history . " " But without my name , without your fortune , " she cried . " My dear , " he made a gesture of writing , " you will continue to be wealthy . " A cool pity came into his voice . " You will be comfortable , richly entertained . You will be able to see your ' beauties . ' " " But my name ! " she cried . " I am known everywhere as Madame Girard . " " Your name must be taken from you . Has already been taken . " " You mean to destroy my identity , then ? " " Your friends , your young men , will come to see what is you . Your pure victory , as you have always called it , is now . You are completely free  --  ca n't you see ? " " But I need the name . The name is mine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Laureen is waiting for me . We have so much to discuss . And there is so little time for the kind of happiness I know I can have with her . " " My name ! You can not take it . Take the money , the victory , but leave me as I was : Madame Girard . " " Fate has already moved . You speak as the melancholy young woman should have spoken on the lagoon so long long ago . " " Girard Girard , " she pleaded and she went down on her knees to him . " It has been a week of melodrama , " he said , fatigued . " A lifetime of melodrama . " He buttoned his great coat . " Your shoes are so beautifully shined , " she wept.  |p156Suddenly  she kissed his shoes . " Leave me with what I was , " she begged . " Leave me Madame Girard . " She saw the shoes withdraw from her embrace , and a moment later she heard the closing of the massive outside door.  |p157Very  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large bed , on the third floor , which he shared with three musicians , Malcolm was awakened by Eloisa Brace . " Girard Girard has asked that you come at once to see him at the horticultural gardens , " she cried . Malcolm opened his eyes slowly and gaped at her . She repeated her question to the grumbling and complaintof the three musicians , one of whom wore a silk stocking over his head as a night cap , and all of whom had actually only just turned in a few minutes before and just gotten nicely to sleep.  | " It is very important for your future , Malcolm , " Eloisa Brace went on . " You MUST go to see him . " Malcolm looked at her , uncomprehending . " Remember , your money is going , you have given up your hotel suite , and your father will not return from the dead . " " But my portrait ! " Malcolm cried . " There is no portrait now , kiddy , " Eloisa said solemnly . " Remember ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the boy cried . " For Christ almighty 's sake ! " the musician with the silk stocking on his head raised up , enraged at the disturbance . " Shh , come immediately , Malcolm , " Eloisa said . " You have no choice . O.K. ? No choice at all in the matter . " She hurried him to the bathroom , where he put on his clothes , and downstairs in her basement kitchen she hurriedlygave him a cup of coffee with milk , and then took him to the curb , where she hailed a taxi . She kissed him goodbye . " I am not turning you out , Malcolm  --  I am turning you over to stronger hands . Please remember that we love you , Jerome and I. But when all is said and done , Malcolm , kiddy , you are not in our class . O.K. ? I hope I do not offend . And I really feel that Girard Girard has the key to your future . " " But the bench and all , " Malcolm expostulated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . And Mr. Cox . . . And yes , even Estel Blanc . . . " " You will see them again , Malcolm , when better days come to us all , " Eloisa said to him from behind the pane of glass of the taxi . " Goodbye and good luck , for you will need it , " she cried . " We are just not of your class , " she repeated , as the taxi drove off.  |p159As  it began to disappear with the boy , she sighed , relief and hope coming into her eyes . " Destination ? " the chauffeur inquired , but Malcolm was groaning in the back seat with sleep , confusion and despair , and did not reply . " You said something ? " Malcolm finally addressed himself to the driver . The chauffeur repeated his question . " Why , " Malcolm thought for a while , " the horticultural gardens , I believe she said . Did you not hear the lady say that ? " he inquired . " I believe I did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving everything behind ! " Malcolm told the driver . " And I do n't know any other part of the city at all . . . My hotel , my bench , Mr. Cox , Kermit , Jerome , the piano player  --  everything behind ! " he cried out , inconsolable . Girard Girard came out from the entrance of the horticulturalgardens when he heard the approach of the taxi , paid the driver , and helped Malcolm down from the cavernousback seat . He ushered the boy into the first room of the greenhouse , which was devoted to tropical plants . " I called you here , Malcolm , " Girard Girard said , " only because you are , I know , my friend . I hope that you consideryourself my friend also , despite the fantastic difference in our ages and our respective positions in life . " Girard Girard motioned to the boy to sit down on a stone chair , which appeared to be the only aritcle of furniture in the tropical garden.  | " I am therefore appealing to you , Malcolm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heavy sultry heat of the horticulturalgardens , or to the shock at his break with his life , Malcolm was slow to extend his sympathy to the older man , or respond to his speech of welcome , for the boy said nothing at all , and finally , in an attempt to suppress his yawning , he hiccuped loudly in the mossy silence of the gardens . " Are you going to reject me , too , Malcolm ? " Malcolm stared at the cavernous circles which surroundedGirard 's eyes , adding ten years to his age . He looked like a handsome but demolished angel . " Reject you , sir ? " " Malcolm , " the older man said at once , " I have left Madame Girard . " " Left her ? " the boy hiccuped again . " Shall I call an attendant for some water ? " Girard inquired , somewhat irritably . Malcolm shook his head . " Our twenty years of life together  --  Madame Girard 's and mine  --  are at an end , " Girard impressed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly against his throat to prevent another hiccup . " But I have left her  --  only because  --  only because I am to be married . " " My congratulations , sir , " Malcolm bowed slightly . " Malcolm , " the older man said , looking searchingly into the boy 's face , " do you understand what I am saying to you ? " The boy nodded , then smiled . " You are so winning , " the older man almost complained . " But do you know , do you hear , do you cornprehend ? Oh , how I need you at this moment . Need somebody . I am entirely , entirely alone , " he cried.  | " Sir , " Malcolm began again . " No , do n't speak , " the older man said . " I do n't say this in anger , but in despair . Malcolm , you do NOT understand . . . " " I do , sir , I do . . . And I try ! " " You do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I need you more than anybody else . For though I am to be married  --  almost indeed at once  --  I need you and I mean to have you . . . Madame Girard shall not have you to herself ! " Malcolm opened his mouth to reply to this , but Girard was already speaking again : " I am going to marry Laureen Raphaelson , Malcolm . " " Laureen . . . The little man 's woman ? " Malcolm hiccuped . " Woman ? " Girard Girard flushed . " Forgive me , sir , " Malcolm said . " I only met Laureen once , you see , and that was the evening before she went off with the . . . Japanese wrestler . " " Oh , that old story . An invention of Mr. Cox . " " I only know , of course , what people tell me , " Malcolm explained . " Malcolm , you are of my class , and you must understand a man 's principles : one does not marry a woman because she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , Malcolm , with Laureen I will be the father of children : sons will come after me who will bear my name . While with Madame Girard : our future was only our present , our future was only . . . well , Madame Girard ! " " But you prefer Madame Girard to me , is that not it ? " Girard asked , looking intently at the boy 's eyes . " No , " Malcolm said in a choked and rather old voice . " I prefer you , Girard Girard . You were my favorite address . Only , I think of you and Madame Girard as together ,  |p162and  when you will be apart . . . I do n't know yet what to say . " " You see , Malcolm  --  and you must already know this  --  Madame Girard has expressed the wish ahead of everybody else , to have you . My desires in this matter were , I admit , second . But what I have brought you here for is to ask you as humbly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of her . " " Choose you for what , sir ? " " For my own  --  for Laureen 's and my own . " " Oh , sir ! " " I will be your father if necessary , though I know that is something that would be difficult . . . " " No , no , " the boy stood up . " There was only one father , " Malcolm said sternly , his eyes flashing . " You may be great , but you will not take the place that he occupied alone and first . " " Malcolm , I have no desire to offend your father 's mem-ory . " " Your desire was not asked , sir , " Malcolm said . " You replace nobody . " " I have put it awkwardly , Malcolm . Kindly reconsider . . . " Suddenly a violent hiccup came from Mr. Girard 's interlocutor . " Please be seated again , Malcolm , and let us be calm . " The boy sat down . " We will begin again , if necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in front of the stone chair . Malcolm muttered something between his teeth , but the look of intensity on his face was so incredible at that moment , that Girard Girard took out a handkerchief from his breast pocket and wiped his face carefully . " In all humbleness , Malcolm , " the older man began again , " consider my offer . "  | " But what is your offer , sir ? " the boy was severe . " Come live with me and my new wife , accept all we have to offer , feel secure and loved with us . Ask whatever you wish of us . " " But I had everything until just a few days ago , " the boy cried . " And suddenly , having left the bench entirely . . for reasons I do not recall  --  I have nothing . " " But you have me . You have us . " " I have lost everything ! " the boy said , and then his violence disintegrated into a sudden calm and even sweetness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girard Girard said . Malcolm shook his head . " You wish to go to Madame Girard ? " the older man wondered , somewhat stupefied . " No , no , " the boy responded . " But then what are you going to do ? You can not go back to your hotel suite . It is rented . . . And no longer being a pensioner there , so to speak , I fear the bench is barred to you likewise . . . " The boy shifted in his hard seat . Perhaps at last the realization of his position became clear , for turning to his would-be protector , he demanded : " Would you repeat what you just said , please , Girard Girard ? " " I will repeat anything you may wish , " the older man said . " However , I have forgotten my exact words . . . " " You said , I believe , sir , that I had nothing to go back to ! " " Ah , yes , of course . You see , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiresome affair of the divorce . Of course , I remember . . . It was simply that the hotel can never take you back , as I said . " " I am barred to it ? " " Well , not barred , but that expensive period of yourp164life is simply over , dear boy . As over and done with as those days when your father came home from a long businesstrip and tucked you in at night . You 're nearly grown up ! " " Grown up ? Why , then , whatever will I do ? " " You can go ahead alone , of course , " and here Girard Girard gave the boy a look of pity mixed with horror , " or you can come with me , and allow me to open all doors for you. , , " All doors , " Malcolm repeated . Going up to Malcolm now in a manner uncommon for the financier , he seized the boy by the shoulders vigorously and shaking him , said : " You ca n't go on by yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me more addresses ! " the boy got out while still being shaken . " More addresses ! " Girard exclaimed , letting loose of the boy . " Do you know what you are talking about ? Obviously not . Then listen : Mr. Cox has no more addresses . . . " " No more at all ? " " Not a single one . No , that old dodge is out . And besides , how could he give them to you when you 're so friendly to me ? And besides ! " but here Girard stopped , owing to the look of panic on the boy 's face . But he continued anyhow , despite Malcolm 's expression : " And besides , " he finished , " Mr. Cox would hardly give you another address since you are off the bench . " " Off the bench ! " the boy cried , realization pouring into his eyes . " Choose me , dear Malcolm . Choose us . " " A wedding , " the boy mused . " And so many things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yes . " Malcolm nodded , gravely smiling.  | " I knew you would give in , " Girard cried , happy . " I will make things up for you , let me tell you . And I will try never to replace anybody either . I have learned my lesson there , too . " Malcolm sat back now on the stone chair . " But I have not a minute , " Girard Girard told him . " A most important engagement . I must leave at once . But you stay here , Malcolm , for I will be back in an hour at the most to pick you up . Do n't go away , do you hear ? Now that I 've found you , I do n't want to lose you for anything , you see . " " Please do not go away without me , " Malcolm stood up , and Girard Girard had never heard the boy speak with such strength , though his voice cracked a little , for it was changing . " Take me with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . " My engagementis of the utmost importance , and you would only be in the way . Stay here , as I say , and within the hour I will be back again . And we will both begin life together ! " Malcolm smiled . The two friends shook hands , and in another moment , Girard Girard had left Malcolm to thoughts and expectancy.  |p166Malcolm  waited in the horticultural gardens . An hour passed , then two . He grew hungry , but he saw no place where he could get anything to eat . For a while he strolled about the grounds , always beingcareful to be within earshot of the stone chair on which Girard Girard expected to find him on his return . But after a while , the shadows of evening began to fall , and still no sign of his great and powerful friend . At five o'clock , an attendant appeared , informing the boy that the horticultural gardens were about to close . Malcolm waited therefore outside the building on the greensward , but in a short while another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire grounds were about to be closed , and that he should go out through the gate and stand on the sidewalk near the arterial , if he was waiting for somebody . " But Girard Girard is expecting me here ! " Malcolm told the attendant . The attendant , who recognized immediately the name pronounced by the boy , thought for a moment , then said : " But he would never return now ! It is not his way . You had better go at once to his house . " " He has no house now that he has left Madame Girard , " the boy replied . The attendant clicked his tongue . Malcolm was already walking in the direction of the sidewalk and the arterial . As he reached the walk , he heard from behind the closing of the tall gates of the horticulturalgardens , and the snap as they locked themselves against him . Standing waiting there , Malcolm was surprised at how quickly night came , and a cool breeze from the west reminded him that summer was over . " Girard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone pole which was covered with posters announcing the appearance in the neighborhood of a popular singing star . He perhaps dozed a little , then was awakened by the sound of a motorcycle whizzing past . When the motorcycle had gone past him , it stopped suddenly , wheeled about dizzily on its own tracks , and returned dead level to Malcolm . The driver , who was even darker than Estel Blanc or George Leeds , stopped , removed his goggles , and opened his mouth to say something to Malcolm , but at the very last second , did not speak at all , merely showing his even ivory teeth . Malcolm took , therefore , the initiative , and wished the motorcyclist a good evening.  | " You one of the contemporaries ? " the motorcyclist said , not replying to Malcolm 's greeting . Malcolm said he begged his pardon . " If you one of the contemporaries , get on behind me , and we 'll go right over to Melba 's , and if you ai n't , it do n't matter too awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Malcolm was about to tell the motorcyclist that he was waiting for Girard Girard , but with the command " Stow it ! " the boy next found himself behind the motorcyclist headed away from the city , in a whirlpool of rushing air . Occasionally he would hear the name Melba come from the driver 's mouth , blown to him by a torrent of air , but the rest of the man 's words were carried away by other currents , and never reached him . And Malcolm was too downcast and even embittered by Girard Girard 's failure to show up to feel any wrongdoing in leaving the horticulturalgardens . Apparently Girard Girard was more interested in his coming wedding and his present divorce than he was in Malcolm , and with Mr. Cox and the addressesand the bench and Kermit , all swallowed up in the past , he was more than pleased that he could be driving off with someone like this who showed every friendly intentionand interest in him personally . And the new driver had a most pleasing perfume of nasturtiums about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rich as the baritone depth of Estel Blanc , was much more warm and friendly . After driving very fast for a good many miles , during which the entire landscape flashed past them a soft dissolvingmass , the motorcyclist brought the vehicle to a dizzying halt at a gasoline pump , which had no attendant , and which was not illuminated clearly . Taking out a small flashlight from his hip pocket , the motorcyclist with his other hand held a key to the gasolinep169pump , and having opened the pump , proceeded to fill his tank , and then seeing the quizzical look on Malcolm 's face , said : " This here tank belongs to Melba and the contempo-raries . " Before Malcolm again had time to inquire about Melba and the contemporaries , they were again flashing through the landscape . After another hour or more of travel , they drew up to a roadhouse , which bore no sign of life of any kind , and appeared without the faintest illumination . " If you need to fresh yourself up , you can go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clump of trees behind the roadhouse . Malcolm shook his head . " You is a contemporary ? " the motorcyclist asked with a sudden desire for confirmation . Malcolm was about to answer , but the driver had alreadyturned away from him , headed for the door of the roadhouse , and said : " Melba will know anyhow if you is or is n't . " They now opened the heavy front door and walked into a small room , where ten or twelve men and women were seated drinking , while a very young woman , standing on a platform , was singing to them . " That one singing there is Melba , " the motorcyclist pointed out to Malcolm . Melba stopped singing briefly to examine the two new arrivals , her eye resting a long time on Malcolm , then questioningly to the motorcyclist , and finally she nodded to the latter , and made a quick gesture with her hand . " You made it ! " the motorcyclist slapped Malcolm on the cheek with vigor , and then shook hands with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who were seated listening to Melba , who had againp170begun to sing , some of the words drifting over to where Malcolm and the motorcyclist stood : When you said goodbye , dark daddy , Did you know I had not yet said hello ? Malcolm and the driver sat down at a table to wait for Melba to finish her number , after which , Malcolm was informed , she would join them , and give them some pointers about what they could do next . A young man wearing a tight sash about his middle came up just then and asked them what drink they wished to choose . " Do you have a preferential ? " the driver asked Malcolm , and when the latter said that at the moment he did not , the driver told the man with the sash to bring the usual . " I 'm so glad I did n't make a mistake when I done drew you , " the driver told Malcolm . " What if you had n't been the right one waiting there ? " he laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Malcolm his name , Gus . " Who are you ? " Gus wanted to know next . " Malcolm , " the boy replied . " What a non-usual name , " Gus commented . Their drinks arrived , and Gus said that they should toast the contemporaries , and they both raised their glasses briefly . When you said goodbye -- the final notes now poured forth from Melba 's throat , and in a sea of applause she trod directly through the audience to the table at which Gus and Malcolm were waiting for her.  | " Meet a contemporary , " Gus told Melba with some excitement . " Of course , Brownie , of course , " Melba said impatiently . " I recognized him im-med-i-ate-ly . He 's just about my age category . " Malcolm looked at Melba more closely , and he was surprised and pleased to notice that actually she was not much older than he . While Melba ordered a drink from the boy in the sash , Gus whispered in Malcolm 's ear : " She worth her weight in cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brownie , " Melba told Gus . She took Malcolm 's hand in hers . " What if he had n't been a contemporary , huh ? " Gus laughed nervously now , exchanging a look with Melba . Malcolm was about to ask them what a contemporary was , but suddenly his old desire to ask questions deserted him . He found that he did not care now what anything was . Too much had happened , too many people had come and gone in his life , and feeling a sudden warmth and pressurefrom Melba 's hand , he mechanically brought this hand to his lips and kissed it . " I have had such a short long life , " Malcolm said , meaningthis remark to be silent and for himself , but by accident the words came out loud and strong , and Melba , extremely pleased by what he had said , immediately drank a toast to him . " I could marry you , " she told Malcolm . Malcolm pressed her hand again . " You ca n't get married again , Melba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That will do , Brownie , " Melba said . And when Gus began to speak again , she cried , " I SAY ! " Gus looked down at his drink , and Melba explainedp172more softly , " Brownie was my first husband . Old No . I , as we sometimes call him . " " I 'm not ashamed of it , Melba , " Gus said . " I 'm so glad he found you , " Melba turned again to Malcolm , and she kissed him warmly on his mouth . " Do you think you could find happiness with me ? " Melba said . Malcolm was suddenly sure . " Yes , " he said , " Melba , I do . " " Is n't it all wonderful ? " Melba turned briefly to Gus . " Are you sulking again ? " she criticized the driver . When he did not answer , she posed her question : " Would you marry me , Malcolm ? " " It 's too sudden , " Gus told Melba . " Wait till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday to me , " she was highly critical of Gus again . " I gave up the days of the week after Freddie 's time , and after you did all those dirty legal things to me . . . Why should Tuesday matter ? " she complained , angry tears in her eyes . Melba pressed Malcolm 's hand again . " You 're the first real find Gus has ever made , " Melba explained to Malcolm , her lip quivering still a bit . " Do you really care for me ? " she inquired now of Malcolm after a pause in which they had all finished their drinks . " I do , Melba , " Malcolm replied , and he did . Having lost Girard Girard and Mr. Cox , Kermit , and the bench , he held more tightly to Melba than he had ever held to any other human being , with the exception , of course , of his father . " Melba , I DO ! " Malcolm cried suddenly , and he kissed the girl on her throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly happy ! " Melba began , but at a look from Gus she began complaining again : " You begrudge me this happiness , do n't you ? Answer me , do n't you ? You begrudge me thisp173tiny tiny bit of happiness in my life of pettiness and struggle . . . " " Melba , honey , happiness is the last thing I be-grudge you , " Gus told her . " But I do n't want you to rush into matrimony this here time . Think of how many other old times you done got stung . Think of the courts , Melba , honey . " " He begrudges me , " Melba explained to Malcolm . " How did you know he was a contemporary ? " Melba inquired suspiciously of Gus now , cocking her head in the direction of Malcolm . " I have some tendencies ! " Gus became somewhat riled . " I think it was all just a . . . a beautiful accident . . . for which you do n't have no thanks or credit coming ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempest of her breath . Gus put his fists in his eyes and said goddamn it all to hell , she would try to take away his credit . " All right , all right , " Melba said apologetically to Gus . " I will give you this credit . I wo n't harp needlessly on things that ca n't be proved . You found this baby , and I will be eternally grateful to you . Eternally . " She patted Malcolm 's hand . " God , we will be happy , " she whispered . " Everything will be taken care of , " she winked , omniscient . Malcolm made a sound , which resembled a coo , and which he had never heard come from himself before , so that he sat up straight , startled . " Is n't he beautiful , Brownie ? " Melba called Gus 's attention to the boy now . " Have you noticed his three dimpleswhen he smiles ? " Gus made the strange little groaning sounds again , and began to put his fists in his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang.  | " But you 're beautiful , Melba , " Malcolm was telling her . " You 're . . . the beautiful one ! " " Nobody has said that to me since I was twelve , " Melba dabbed at her cheek briefly with her napkin . Gus covered his eyes with his palm now . " If you feel you want to marry me , dearest , " Melba told Malcolm , " we can have Gus here announce it . Everybody here , almost , is a contemporary . " " Melba , sweet Jesus ! " Gus cried in a voice which had broken to falsetto . " Resume your normal baritone when you wish to communicate with me , " Melba spoke to Gus . " Malcolm , " Melba turned her full attention to him again , " I do n't even care if you are a contemporary or not . Of course , I knew Gus lied to me about you . But I 'm willingto marry you if you are willing to marry me . I 've simply got it is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . well , I 've been got . " " He ai n't OLD ENOUGH ! " Gus cried , in his regular voice now . " Do n't listen to him , " Melba said , tapping on the marbleof the table . " Besides , everything is always arranged . Brownie feels he has to be a little more careful than I do , though he 's the most daring man in the world . Six weeks of marriage teaches you an awful lot about a man . But our marriage , Malcolm , will just last on and on , precious . . . " Leaning over the table , she kissed him a long time now on the lips . " Breath like a hay-mow ! " she pointed out . She shook her head , tears standing in her eyes again . " I think Brownie should announce the engagement and/ or marriage , " she said sotto voce to Malcolm . " I have some more numbers to sing tonight , you know . " A trio had taken the place of Melba as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been just given that she was to resume her part of the program . " I think just a short announcement of our engagement is in order , " Melba said to Gus . " Darling , you do love me , and you want to marry me  --  before they announce our betrothal over the loudspeaker ? " Melba said anxiously to Malcolm . " Melba , yes ! " the boy said . " Oh , Brownie , " Melba turned to Gus , " I 'll never forget you for having brought Malcolm to me , dearest . Do n't ever let me forget this great favor you have committed for me . . . " When Gus , however , did not get up from the table to announce the engagement , Melba became very upset again . " Did you not hear me tell you ? " she commanded the motorcyclist . " You are to announce our engagement and/ or marriage . Kindly do so at once . The trio has played its last number minutes ago . . . . I 'm nearly ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his leather riding jacket , from under which a handsome watch chain of the last century was suspended , and clearing his throat , his immense rich voice informed the entire room of contemporaries of the coming marriage of Malcolm and Melba . " On Tuesday next ! " Melba , standing up , informed the room . Owing to his having drunk perhaps more than was his custom , or perhaps because he had stood so long on his feet in the horticultural gardens , Malcolm had some special difficulty in getting up , but with Melba and Gus 's assistance , he finally did rise and acknowledge the applause and recognition of the audience . After which he and Melba kissed one another in front of everybody.  | " This is to be a serious and life-long affair , " Melba informedpeople , tears again in her eyes . Malcolm then sat down again at the table with Gus , while Melba went up to the stage microphone and sang again her three numbers , including the one which , Gus explained , had made her internationally famous : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain  --  ! At the end of her last number , Melba hastened , after only a perfunctory acknowledgement of applause ( so rare to her ) to Malcolm and Gus 's table , where she kissed the boy passionately , but with perhaps a slight bit more restraint . " My only one , " she explained to Malcolm , and she handed him a roll of bills , " now that our marriage is a fact which only time will make final , I want things to be all up and above board . We could so easily consummate everythingthere is to consummate here and now , as Brownie and I once did so long ago , and Freddie , too , but as I told the contemporaries a few minutes ago , I want this marriage to last . It 's to be the real thing , Malcolm , precious , " and here she placed a napkin to her eyes . " I 've got the real thing is all , Brownie , " she turned weeping to the motorcyclist . " Lightning , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got control of her voice , she went on : " Brownie will take care of you . He 'll be like a father to you . . . Do n't interrupt me ! " she warned Malcolm when the latter made vociferous sounds of interpolation . " I have to sing another number in a minute owing to that mammothapplause I am getting , and I just wanted to say that I want Gus here to take awful good care of you . Tuesday will be here before we know it , but we must n't meet again till then . . . "  |p177Kissing  Malcolm again on the mouth for the last time , Melba turned briefly to Gus , to whom she handed a small fat package of something , and whispered : " Mature him up just a little while you 're gone , " and without another word or not to either of them , she made her way to a small door marked AUTHORITY , and opening it , disappeared.  | " How the A-all am I goin ' to mature you up by Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode off again together on the motorcycle , this time in the direction back to the city . " You motherless bastard , " Gus complained , turning his head around . " My father is the one who is missing ! " Malcolm shouted to Gus through the wind , but Gus did not let on he had heard a thing from him . " Do you know the honor you have all just received ? " Gus inquired , turning his head back to Malcolm . " Marriagewith her . "  | " I think I do , " Malcolm shouted into Gus 's ear . " She 's the greatest now , and will be the greatest then , " Gus said . In their heated conversation Gus had forgotten to stop at the private contemporary gas pump to refill his tank and , as a result of this oversight , near the edge of the city his motorcycle stopped , out of fuel . " That 's what distraction will do for you , " Gus complainedpeevishly . " Hop down , and let 's go hunt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink glow of the city . " We got only till Tuesday , mind , " Gus kept repeating . " Only till Tuesday . " " Will it be a big wedding , sir ? " Malcolm inquired . Gus paused , staring at him . " What you call me sir for if you a contemporary ? Is that a code word you picked up in some other society ? " Gus stopped dead in his tracks . " What you call me that for , Malcolm ? " He relented a little when he had studied the boy 's face . " Just for the usual , " Malcolm explained , fancying his speech now did sound like that of a contemporary . " Then do n't ! " Gus warned him . " Do n't sir me . " And then without another word Gus sat down on the curb and began making sounds which resembled sobbing a great deal . " I ca n't give up that damned bitch ! " he said . " Who ? " Malcolm comforted him , putting his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ? " and Gus 's voice broke again into falsetto . " He asks me who , " Gus shook his head , seeming to be talking to his shoes . " Melba 's in my blood , " he sighed  | " It 's like that awful kind of malaria they ca n't do nothing for you with . . . " Gus began to quiet down then a little . Then , getting up slowly , he said : " Come on , Malco , we got to go through with this . I would cut off my right arm right up to here for her , but I will make you her husband or bust in the attempt . . . You keep full confidence in me now . " Malcolm nodded . After they had walked a few more blocks , Gus said he had to rest again , as he was not a walker , and they sat down on the curb . " Look at all this money Melba give me to mature you up with , " Gus said , pulling out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill curlin ' around my thumb there is a thousand dollar one . " Malcolm glanced briefly at the bill . " You not impressed , " the motorcyclist said . " I hope this wedding ai n't goin ' to waste on you . " Down the street a little way , its many-colored lights moving and gesticulating like a brightly lit kaleidoscope shone a sign with the wordsR O B I N O L T E ' S T A T T O OP A L A C EMalcolm read off the words . " That 's the place now to be matured , " Gus said , ironical . Malcolm exclaimed : " My father had a tattoo , and he often said to me ,  --  " and in his excitement the boy spit on Gus 's face , for which he immediately apologized , " my father said to me , One day you must be tattooed , son . ' " Gus looked off , disgust and weariness on his face.  | " Are you tattooed , by any chance ? " Malcolm inquired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question answered . Gus looked at him with pity . " I been admired by women all my life for my chest and arms , and my body in general , " Gus began . " Why have them chopped up by needles , or disjointed by designs ? " " But one or two tattoos for a wedding is surely . . . well , usual , " Malcolm brought out , swallowing hard , and wondering at the same time where he had ever heard what he had just said . Gus replied immediately : " But I BEEN married ! Three times ! " " Get tattooed with me , " Malcolm said , unaware again what prompted him to say these words . " Do you know what you are ? " Gus inquired , a strange equanimity and warmth coming over him . " Persuasive , that 's what . " " You agree then ? " Malcolm cried , his enthusiasm mounting . " If we should get tattoos , " Gus began , opening his jacket and taking out his nineteenth-century watch for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattoos , we must have the real ones , you know : the spread-eagle one on the chest , especially . The rest do n't really count . Real men have to have the chest tattoos or nothing . " " My father  --  " Malcolm began , but Gus put his hand over the boy 's mouth . " I got the floor , kiddy , " Gus went on . " Now you do n't need the peter tattoo , say , " he explained in his deepest voice , " on account of Tuesday , but we could easy get fixed up for all the rest . " " Hurray ! " Malcolm clapped his hands together . " You a brave boy ? " Gus asked him , and he smiled forp182the first time at Malcolm , and his ivory teeth flashed in the dark between them . " As I say , " Gus went on , " I done been there before , and I know Professor Robinolte , the tattoo king , but before , you com-pre-hend , I only was to watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ventured . Gus thought for a moment . " I did n't see much blood . . . More the sight of white lips and occasional screams . " He laughed . " A few fainted that day . Mostly sailors . " " Well , I should be more scared , but somehow I 'm not , " Malcolm told Gus . He yawned . " For one thing , " the boy said , " I 'm too sleepy to be scared . " Gus studied Malcolm . " I wish I could be sleepy , " he said . " I been wide-awake all my life , and I need some rest . I could take a long long rest . " " Should we have a drink before we go ? " Malcolm wondered . " No , " Gus answered . " I think a man has got to simply surrender to them needles and the pain . " " I always thought that . . . Abyssinians were braver than other people , " Malcolm said , bringing his face closer to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here Gus broke off into a snort and a laugh . " You do me up , " he said after a moment . " But why fear a little needle ? " Malcolm wondered , perhaps to himself . " You wait and see , " Gus told him . " I been everywhere . One war and then Korea . . . But when it comes to lie still and be dotted on by the old tattoo man , that 's a kind of bravery I do not got . But we got to mature you , like she say , that 's the thing . . . And you know what I think of Melba , not to mention what I owe her . . . " Gus stood up and pushed out his chest , perhaps alreadyp183feeling the beginning of the tattoo professor 's art upon him . " Say , how about you , " Gus finally said . " You TERRIBLEyoung it seems to me to be de-corated . " " I 'm not so young now anymore , " Malcolm told him , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change , you see . I like a certain amount of change . The only thing about a tattoo is , once it 's done , I do n't suppose you can undo it away again . " " That 's so , " Gus said . " But you was the one asked now , hear ? " The Tattoo Palace was both severe and cosy  --  severe because it bore every witness to the painful operations enactedwithin  --  the electrical tattooing needles , the bloody rags , the bottles of disinfectant and smelling salts , and the bloodstains on the floor ; cosy because Professor Robinolte himself , the tattoo artist , was a pleasant blond young man who exhibited four front gold teeth , and cared for all his customers like members of his family , sending them annualbirthday and Christmas greetings , and often advisng them on their domestic and professional careers , while somewhere behind him soft music poured forth , and the air itself was sprayed with moderately expensive eau de cologne . However , an air of terrible expectancy weighted the atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret one , which Gus now whispered in the professor 's ear . " Meet Melba 's husband-to-be , " Gus next pointed Malcolmout to Professor Robinolte . " Not again so soon , " Professor Robinolte cried , but nevertheless congratulated Malcolm . " I used to think that Melba was young , " the professor said taking a better look at Malcolm . " But this one  --  ! ! "  | " How about decorating the bridegroom up a bit , " Gus got down to brass tacks . " Melba would like him a few months older anyhow . " " You know the law , Brownie , " Professor Robinolte was a bit coy . " Do n't give me no law talk now , " Gus said wearily , and he sat down on an ice-cream chair . " I 'll tell you what , Brownie , " Professor Robinolte toyed with the largest of his electrical needles , and blew something off the tip of it . " I 'll tattoo the kid if I can tattoo you in the bargain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " What I ai n't done for Melba . " " I 've never got a real good tattoo on anybody with your special color skin , " Professor Robinolte complimented the motorcyclist in strictly professional tones . " I 'm so tired of pink and tan skins . " Gus spat on the floor . " All right , " the motorcyclist began , " I wo n't chicken on either Melba or her here-bridegroom . " And he peeled off his leather jacket and would have taken off the shirt beneathit , had Professor Robinolte not halted him with a gesture . " Grooms first , please , " the professor said . Then : " Rememberwhen you were Melba 's husband , Brownie ? " Gus made a significant sound with his lips at the professor , and moved his ice-cream chair back out of the main arena . " As far as I 'm concerned  --  did you say your name was Malcolm ? " the professor began , " as far as I 'm concerned  --  in case we should both of us ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of eighteen years old tonight . . . Is that clear ? " The thought of being eighteen years old was pleasing top185Malcolm , and he agreed now that he was . Eighteen , unlike fifteen , was full of promise and adventure . At a signal from the professor , Gus assisted the latter , and in the twinkling of an eye , lifted Malcolm up and put him in a kind of reclining chair , and removed all of his clothes , depositing these in a basket behind them . The professor quickly traced on Malcolm 's chest the outlines of a black leopard which was the design Gus had , after a moment 's study , chosen for the boy . Malcolm laughed a good deal while the tracing was done , so close to his nipples , and Gus turned a peculiar shade of indeterminate color while watching . When the actual work with the needle began , with its accompanying bouncing ominous sound , Malcolm looked more grave , but at the same time amused . " Do n't you feel anything ? " Gus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily to spunge off the blood from where it had obscured the design . Malcolm shook his head . The professor exchanged looks with Gus . After the long but highly successful session of putting the black panther on Malcolm 's chest , during which Malcolmseemed to have dozed off , Professor Robinolte shook the boy and asked him if he was prepared to have the carnationsplaced above his right biceps , and the daggers on his forearms . Malcolm said he was , and these designs were perpetrated , too . The entire difficulty came with Gus who , of course , later felt very small and ashamed . While stretched out on the same chair , submitting to the black panther tattoo on his chest , Gus fainted three times , but always insisted on the tattooing being resumed again  --  over Professor Robinolte 's protests . However , only one carnation was given the motorcyclist , and the professor was pleased , at the end of the operation , at the triumph of color on Brownie 's chest , despite the countless difficulties which beset them . Gus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his having first watched the savage needlesat work on so young a man . But Professor Robinolte told him brutally and often that Gus was simply not the type who could be tattooed , his two war-records notwithstanding . Bandaged and dressed again , the two men stood taking their leave of Professor Robinolte who  --  after promising to send them birthday greetings and Christmas cards for the rest of their lives  --  warned them not to use water on their fresh tattoos , not to expose the tattoos to the unprotected sun , and above all , take it easy and not touch or scratch the wounds . Professor Robinolte then complimented Malcolm on his amazing bravery which , he said , he had never quite encounteredbefore , and congratulated him on his coming marriage to Melba . " You could hardly be in more competent hands , " ProfessorRobinolte told him , though a certain air of dubiety and concern crossed and re-crossed his face . " You will be the pride of all women and some men , to half-quote somebody , " the professor called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Malcolm walked off toward the center of town . " And good luck ! " Professor Robinolte shouted . " Christ knows you need it , " he said in lower tones to himself.  |p187They  walked slower and slower toward the city , owing to the fact , as Gus explained again , he had been a motorcyclisttoo long to know how to walk , and he did n't actually like to be seen walking any more , it kind of hurt his selfrespect , and another reason , he would not deny it , he was a bit knocked off by those electric needles of Professor Robinolte . Clearing his throat and putting his arm around Malcolm , then , in tones of fatherly intimacy , Gus said , " Kiddy , I did n't bring you out here for you just to have your hide embroidered . I got to ask you a plain question now on account of there is Tuesday . "  |p188Malcolm  nodded , smiling . " To put it delicate-like , Malco , " Gus stopped now in his tracks , " have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " Malcolm remembered , " in a brief kind of way . " " Brief , huh ? " Gus said , snorting . " Now see here , " but just then a twinge of pain in his chest made him stop for a moment . " See here now . . . On account of who you are marrying , kiddy , you got to be ready . . . An old tattoo ai n't any number-one preparation . If anything it may make you too sore to be a good groom . No , Malco , what I am talking about is good old solid Nature . Have you been joined to a woman the way Nature meant ? Yes or no . " Malcolm opened his mouth , but it closed immediately again . " I can see you ai n't , " Gus said . " Well , that 's what Melba sent us out for , to mature you up . " Gus then pointed with his arm to a large house in the near distance . " Do you see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where I 'm going to take you . Rosita 's . Madame Rosita 's , they used to call her . You heard of her ? " Malcolm shook his head . " You ai n't heard of any-thing , " Gus complained , and then he said well , that was what he was for , et cetera . They went up to the house before which was a sign that readPRIVATE AND TURKISH BATHSCABINETS AND OVER-NIGHT COTTAGES$2.00They went down a flight of stairs , and Gus rapped lightly on a small wooden partition , which immediately opened , and a man with a green visor looked out.  | " Gus , is that really you ! " the man said . Then , looking at Malcolm , he exclaimed : " Where did you find him ? " " A Turkish bath for me , and a room upstairs for the boy here , " Gus explained . The man was about to say something , perhaps in protest , when Gus handed him part of the roll of bills which Melba had given him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsequiously , " if you had observed that that boy has blood stains on him . " " They just tattooed him , " Gus retorted . " This way , " the man replied , coughing nervously , usheringthem into a waiting room down which tall coat-hangers were lined like trees , and off each coat-hanger was the door to a room . Gus , turning to Malcolm , said , " Now downstairs here , kiddy , is the Turkish bath department , and upstairs is where you are going to go . When you through , come down here and wake me . Which is my room , Miles ? " he addressedthe attendant . " You pick one out . Nobody here tonight at all , " Miles replied . " All right now , " Gus fumbled about , almost as if he had lost his sense of balance , and then looking straight ahead of him , almost blindly , he said : " What number is this now . . . " " Twenty-two , " Miles said . " That will be me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm twenty-two . " Just then a woman of indeterminate age , with purple markings beneath and on her eyelids , entered , bringing with her the mixed perfumes of , say , bay rum ( domestic ) , and lily-of-the-valley . " Brownie , darling , it 's been years ! " the woman cried , and she hit him playfully with her fist on his chest.  |p190Gus  bent double under the blow , coughing loudly . " It 's Professor Robinolte 's needles , " Malcolm explained to the woman , who was staring at Gus with a puzzled twist of a smile on her lips . " Fine shape you 're in to come to see me , " she said , after a pause of uncomprehension . Gus resumed his normal standing position again , and whispered , " It 's the boy this time . . . I 'm just going to take a brief shower and a snooze . . . . Ai n't had no sleep in a week , you know . . . " " Let me get this all down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( she pointed to Malcolm ) " upstairs for you . " " Break him in , for Christ 's sakes will you ? " Gus said , coughing wearily , and he sat down on a chair near his coathanger , and began taking off his shoes . " You do like I told you now , back in the street , " Gus admonished the boy . " I want you to go through it all just like I told you Nature meant . " The woman made a contemptuous sound with her lips at Gus . " Come on with me , honey , " the woman then told Malcolm , and giving Gus a last severe look , she and Malcolm started off together without another word . " And do n't come back without you had it , " Gus managed to shout at Malcolm . He coughed very loud , and then he tried to say something else , but the words could not be heard . Four or five hours had passed when Malcolm tiptoed back to Room Number 22 of the Turkish Bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened the door softly , and peeked in.  |p191Gus  lay on a small cot , unclothed now except for his tattoobandages , which were , however , nearly coming off . Malcolm sat down on a small white chair which was next to the cot . " I did just like you said , Gus , " he told the motorcyclist . " All the way through three times ! So it looks like I 'll be a bridegroom after all . " Malcolm thought that Gus smiled , and he was pleased . " Do n't you think we should be getting back to our motorcycle now ? " Malcolm inquired . The rays of the morning sun were pouring in from a tiny window above Gus 's cot . " Time to get up , " Malcolm yawned enormously , and he tapped Gus gently , being careful to choose a place that was not tattooed . Malcolm went on talking , meanwhile , about how MadameRosita herself had complimented him , and given him tea , and presented him with a little keepsake , namely an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American flag , which he now showed to Gus . But Gus slept on . Blood had hardened and caked through the bandages over his chest . Looking a little more closely at his abdomen , Malcolm started a bit , for he thought he could observeno rise and fall of that part of his friend . Malcolm looked at his mouth , too , which was strangely drawn and silent . " Gus , " he said rather loudly . " Brownie ! Morning ! " Malcolm drew out a small piece of paper from his pocket , and put it in front of Gus 's mouth and nose , for his father had always told him that this was the sure way of determining whether a person was alive or dead . But nothing came out from the motorcyclist to stir the paper.  | " Gus , " he shouted now , and he puts his hand on the dark man 's forehead and on the tight black curls of his head . " Gus , " he said , feeling the cold of the man 's body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attendant , Malcolm dropped his new gift of the shaving mug , which fell into twenty or thirty small colored pieces to the floor . He had some difficulty in arousing the attendant , and when the attendant did come out from his small cubicle , he was not the one who had been called Miles at all , of the night before . " Gus is dead in Room Number 22 ! " Malcolm cried . " Who ai n't at this hour ? " the man replied gruffly and suspiciously . Malcolm took hold of the attendant 's arm , urging him to come . " Look , Lord Fauntleroy , " the man said . " Get out of here before there 's any trouble . You 're too goddam young to be in here in the first place . Who let you in ? " " Gus . . . the dead man ! " Malcolm cried . Coming clear out from his cubicle , the man took hold of Malcolm and ushered him to the front door . " Now get out , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door on him , after giving him a further kick . " Get out and stay out ! " Malcolm stood , however , outside the door , knocking and gesticulating in the direction of Room Number 22 . " It 's Gus , " he cried to the attendant , who had already disappeared back into his cubicle . " Gus , the motorcyclist ! Ca n't you understand ? "  |p193For  the first time since his father 's disappearance , Malcolmshed not just a few , but a torrent of tears . He cried all the way back to the edge of the town , a flood of weeping which he had never thought could possibly come from a human being . He no longer felt he was a man at all , as he had at Madame Rosita 's , and at times he whimpered like a five-year-old child . He stopped near a telephone pole , on which there was a picture of Melba before a microphone , and a caption under the picture , AMERICA 'S NUMBER ONE CHANTEUSE , and vomitedfor a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchiefwhich he believed Gus himself must have given him , he carefully kissed the picture of Melba on the telephone pole . " So long , lovely , " he said . It never occurred to him then , in his despair , that he would ever find Melba again , and the thought of marriage was as remote as any other thing in his past , his father 's voice , or the bench . All he knew he could do was keep walking.  |p194Malcolm  's adventures might have been continued indefinitelyhad it not so happened by chance , days later , that Melba , driving in her second ex-husband 's Daimler , stopped at a roadside drugstore for cigarettes and mascara , when she caught sight of her husband-to-be at the soda fountain spooning up the last of a strawberry soda , while telling the clerk , who seemed to hang helplessly on his words , what was an involved story . " Precious ! " Melba cried in stentorian tones . Everyone in the drugstore recognized that voice . Before Melba could take another step toward Malcolm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her signature on matchboxes , hot-dog wrappers , and soda-fountain straws , while a gasoline attendant asked her to write her name with lipstick on his forehead , which she immediately did . " Gus is dead , Brownie is dead ! " Malcolm cried , having got off the stool to the soda fountain , but unable to advancetoward Melba owing to her crowd of admirers . Melba nodded , meaning , it seemed , she knew all about Gus . When the crowd had once dispersed a little , Melba went up to Malcolm and kissed him quietly . Someone flashed a bulb from a camera . Back in the front seat of her car , the leather being so badly torn it was difficult to sit still in comfort , Melba explained to Malcolm the trouble she was having with her Hollywood manager . Melba knew all about Brownie or Gus 's death , and would not talk about it for a good stretch . Then turning her attention to Gus briefly , she said : " But have n't you seen the newspapers , for crying out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before Malcolm could say more , Melba had kissed him fifteen or sixteen successive times on the mouth . " Oh , angel , is it ever good to see you , " she said . " Anotherfive minutes , and I would have never found you . I would have ended up marrying someone else . . . sure as fate . " Pulling open a compartment in the car , Melba then brought out a packet of letters . " From your friend Madame Girard , " Melba said . " She 's trying to prevent us getting married . " " You know Madame Girard ! " Malcolm exclaimed . " I know everybody , " Melba said , rather severely , and Malcolm suddenly felt the gulf which separated him from fame . After all , of course , everybody knew Melba , even ifp196she did n't know everybody , and she was as famous in Japan and India as she was in Paris and Chicago . " Now how about that wedding , " Melba said , starting the motor . " Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I got the license , with a little bomb or two at city hall , and I got the justice of the peace under wraps . All we have to do is appear . How about this PM ? " Malcolm cried yes , and bent over to kiss Melba , but she said not while she was driving , and that she had spent one year in a California hospital for kissing a marine while driving . Malcolm then mentioned Gus again , and Melba was again severe . " Do n't give Brownie another thought , if you value my time and my love . For one thing , he was jealous of you , anyhow . But for Christ 's sake , it was his time to go and all , good grief . He 'd had it , and it was his time . " " His tattoos did n't kill him ? " " Tattoos , your mother . Why , Brownie had been halfdeadfor years . Most of his guts were blown out in Korea . Still , he kept on going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a thought , precious . He was sweet , and of course I married him at one time , but it was his time to go , " she said , narrowly missing a curve , " and there just is n't anything to be sorry about . When it 's your time , well , it is . " " We 'll be terribly happy together , " Melba went on . " But you 'll have to give up this Madame Girard woman , though Christ knows why she 's called that , and whatever she may have meant to you . She 's dangerous ! " " But what about Girard Girard ? " Malcolm exclaimed . " Oh , why ever even think about him , " Melba was firm . Both Madame Girard and Girard Girard made several attempts to communicate with Malcolm . Girard Girard himself wrote a letter on embossed stationery so thick thatp197it had burst through the envelope , and part of it was lost , in which he explained the reason for his having failed to keep his appointment with Malcolm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Malcolm . Malcolm and Melba were married in Chicago , after a good deal of difficulty owing to Malcolm 's lack of a birth certificate , and his general appearance . After the ceremony had taken place , they flew to the Caribbean , as Melba said she loved to be in countries where everything was blowing up , and the USA was much too quiet for her in any case . Also , she wanted to meet some of the new Cuban musicians , who put us all so to shame . After a week in Cuba , however , Melba grew homesick for her country house , which , as yet , Malcolm had never even seen , and as Malcolm , too , was nostalgic for the environsof those places where he had had his bench , and had met Mr. Cox , Kermit , Estel Blanc , and the Girardsalthoughall of these persons Melba had forbidden Malcolmever to see or communicate with again  --  the couple returned to begin their matrimonial career . Madame Girard telephoned four or five times daily , and as Melba was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old life , although Madame Girardwas drinking so heavily , she seldom told him much , or actually said much herself . Malcolm told Madame Girard that he liked marriage very much , though it took a great deal out of him . He hoped that Madame Girard would come soon , to visit , and he told her about his new tattoos . Melba had brought back a young Cuban man to be Malcolm 's personal valet , but as the latter spoke very little English , Malcolm 's only verbal communication with the outside world was largely on the telephone with the weather/report operator and , when she was sober enough to know that she was talking with him , Madame Girard . Madame Girard finally broke the news to Malcolm that Girard Girard had secured a divorce from her and finally married Laureen Raphaelson , and that Laureen was alreadypregnant . " Marriage for him , " Madame Girard explained , " was not emotion , but to produce an heir to his fortune . " About the fourth month of Malcolm 's marriage , the Cuban valet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , but the singer was quick to assure the Cuban that he must remember American men did not weigh so much as the easier going Latin peoples , and the subject was not brought up again . Melba was extremely busy that fall and winter , and seldom came home except to sleep when , as she said later , every joy of marriage was tasted , though rapidly , to the full . A strange thing did happen , she remembered later , long long after Malcolm 's time . It was on one of her few free evenings , and she and her young husband had gone to a well-known night club . As usual now , Malcolm drank a great deal too much , and talked a good deal more about his father , Mr. Cox , and Kermit , and Melba complained , as she now did more frequently , that the more she heard Malcolm talk the less she realized they had in common , except , as she was hasty to add , that one thing , dear , and after all , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't marry you for your mind , " Melba always said , " and you do get better looking every day . I like you thin , but I suppose I would like you fat , too . And though you 're not exactly the type I would spot on the street , once I'vep199come to be with you , you 're the only one out of a large as-sortment . " She kissed Malcolm several times . She had had her hair tinted a different shade for this evening and was wearing special immense dark glasses designed specially for her , so that she could pretend nobody recognized her , and could let herself go a little bit more . Malcolm kept excusing himself to go to the men 's room , which always annoyed her , and yet these little breaks from his talk were not unwlcome . " You 're annoying , kiddy , " Melba said , " but you make up for the whole crumby thing back at the house . " Their drinks that evening were the usual rum sours , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did n't tell Malcolm what . It was after their tenth or twelfth rum sour with Melba 's own little special recipe thrown in that Malcolm cried out in the loudest voice she had ever heard him use --  -- the voice almostof a man now : " That 's HE  --  my FATHER ! " Melba tried to restrain him , but he got up quickly from his table and went in the direction of a middle-aged **27;992;TOOLONG man , who might have posed for sparkling water advertisements . The man went into the lavatory , and Malcolm followed . " Father ! " Malcolm cried , stretching out his arms to the man , who was washing his hands gingerly in a deep bowl of water . " Where did you go all this time ? " The man looked up briefly , unflustered and calm . Havingwashed his hands , he examined his mustache closely in the mirror . " Do n't you recognize me ? " Malcolm cried to him . " I would recognize you anywhere ! " The man now opened his mouth and examined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , a particle therefrom . Going up close to the man , Malcolm touched him gently on his shoulder . " If you will only allow me , sir , I can identify you . . . By the small bullet hole you carry beneath your collar bone . " " Would you allow me to pass , " the man told Malcolm , and he made an effort , aiming at equanimity , to go out . " You are pretending not to recognize me , sir ! " Malcolm cried . " Is it because I married Melba , or because I left the bench ? " " Allow me to pass , " the man said , greatly disturbed . " If you will not allow me to recognize you , let me show you your own identification mark . Remember , father , you always told me that if any questions were ever asked in a fatal emergency , you could be identified by this small gunshotwound which you suffered in the armed forces . " Grasping the man , then , by his collar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure of the bullet would would prove beyond cavil that he was his father and that Malcolm was his son . Becoming now seriously alarmed , the man cried for assistance , which only led to Malcolm 's seizing his " father " more securely , while the latter , now panic-stricken and feeling Malcolm seize him not only about his chest , but also securely about his leg , in a sudden paroxysm of anger and terror , knocked the boy heavily to the marble floor , just as a policeman entered the room . " Arrest that pederast ! " the man said to the officer . " He attacked me ! " " Sir , " Malcolm cried , addressing perhaps his " father " and the police officer together , " oh , sir , I am NOT Mr. Cox . . . I am MALCOLM ! "  |p201The  " father " seeing perhaps now that Malcolm was indeedtoo young to be anything , snorted , wheeled , and walking out of the lavatory , disappeared into the inner recesses of the night club . But what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policeman from his position on the floor , he saw that the officer was the very same man into whose arms he had rushed that evening long ago on the occasion of his visit to Estel Blanc 's . The police officer , who had recognized Malcolm even more promptly than the boy had recognized him , helped him up from the floor . " Again I find you in suspicious surroundings , although older , " the officer said , and he examined the bump on the boy 's scalp . The officer shook his head seriously , ignoring the babble of thankyou sirs , et cetera which came from Malcolm 's lips . " What did that gentleman call you ? " the officer wondered . " My father ? " The policeman gazed wonderingly at Malcolm . " Why , a pederast , " Malcolm answered the policeman 's question . " Are you one , sir ? " the officer asked in a thin grave voice . " Why , I do n't believe I 'm old enough , am I ? " Malcolm replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to study the stars a good deal to be one , you know , " Malcolm added for the policeman 's information . " Mr. Cox , the astrologer , would be able to tell you . " The policeman 's jaw moved slightly up and out , but as he did not say anything , Malcolm continued : " Would you care to meet my wife , sir ? "  | " You 've gone and got married , in the bargain ? " the officer exclaimed . " Yes , " Malcolm admitted , a bit shame-faced , " though I had to tell the marriage bureau I was 18 . But do please come and meet Melba . She 's awfully famous . " The policeman pinched off some lint which had become attached to his handsome uniform , and then told Malcolm that he would not be able to accept his invitation but how pleasant , actually , it had been running into him again after all this passage of time . He then shook hands with the boy , and as a last gesture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave like a man , Malcolm , and you 'll have nothing to regret . " Just as the boy was about to leave , the officer , struggling and reluctant , but earnest , called him back again , and clearing his throat loudly , said : " If I were you , Malcolm , I believe I would look up that word the man you called your father ' used about you in this lavatory . I do n't think you know what a good many words mean , as I recall our interview of some time past , in the station  --  probably all owing to you not having gone to school enough . " " I see , " Malcolm considered this advice . " But I do n't know , sir , whether I will have the time to look the word up or not , you see . I 'm awfully busy now that I 'm married . " " You take the time , Malco , " the policeman said . " And now run on back to your wife . " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Malcolm had gone , the police officer went over to the same wash basin which the " father " had employed , removed his smart hat , and then quickly lowering his head , allowed water to trickle over his scalp and forehead.  | " My father refused to recognize me , " Malcolm told Melba when he had returned to her table . Melba looked glassy at him . She had drunk a good many of her special concotions while he had been gone . " Look , kiddy , " Melba said . " I 've been meaning to give you this speech , but the long and the short of it is : grow up a little . That was n't your father . I 've known that old pot since I was ten . He 's nobody 's father . And what 's this idee unfix about your father . Who wants a father ? It 's been old hat for years . That old pot , I repeat , was nobody 's father . " " But he looked like him to a T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Millions of men look like millions of men , especially Americans , " Melba said , beginning on a new drink the waiter had just brought her . " In fact , most men look like most men . That 's why I go for you , kiddy . You 're unique all over . " She kissed Malcolm wetly on both his eyes , and he flushed with excitement . " He was n't my father ? " Malcolm inquired from her after a while , and he shifted in his seat several times . " With my fame and money , " Melba told him , " and your special gift , blow your father , " and she motioned for him to sip her drink . " Blow my father ! " Malcolm echoed , and then hearing his own voice , his jaw dropped loosely . " Say , kiddy , are you all right ? " Melba said , somewhat concerned . " Blow my father ! " Malcolm said . " Do n't say that again , " Melba adjured him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not focussing on , Melba . Looking at her bridegroom a bit more closely , she asked : " Say , kiddy , who gave you that knock on the head ? And you got a real shiner coming ! " " Blow my fath  --  " Malcolm began , and then put his hand to his mouth to show he should not say that . Melba put her fingers to the boy 's scalp , and bringing her hand down saw it smeared with the well-known fluid , as she called it , which at her touch had begun trickling down his forehead and face , like a rivulet in spring . Melba quickly staunched the flow with a napkin she took from the empty table next to them . " Have a drink , kiddy , " she said . " It 's wonderful for cuts and bruises and abrasions of all kinds . " " Maybe my father never existed , " Malcolm said , and his tones were now like those of Melba 's . " Who the hell knows if anybody ever existed ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You relax now , kiddy . Forget what happened in that lavatory , and drink up . Last call for alcohol , like they say . Drink up . "  |p205When  Malcolm woke up the next afternoon , his hair , except for where the blood had dyed it a startling crimson , was snow white , whiter indeed , as he remarked to Melba , in bed , than he had ever remembered his father 's being . " You look simply grand , " Melba said , " not to mention it 's a miracle of some dumb kind . Jesus , are you beautiful . I want to just stay in bed and look at you . Jesus , white hair , kiddy . " " I am O. K. , then , Melba , girl ? " Malcolm wondered , and his voice again did not quite sound like his own . " You ai n't never been better , kiddy , " Melba assured him . " Let Mama kiss her white-haired angel boy . "  |p206Melba  kissed him on his new hair . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chest . He tried to return the compliment by kissing her hair , but his head hurt too much when he moved it . " Your white hair goes so good with your pink skin , " Melba remarked . " It makes you look both dark and light . " " Melba , honey , ring for the coffee . I 'm awful excited over you like always , but I seem too dizzy to make love . " " I 'll ring for the coffee , " Melba said , still entranced . " And I 'll make all the love today . Do n't talk about making love . What did I buy you for , kiddy ? " She kissed his chest again . " Answer me that , " she said . " What did I buy you for ? " " You bought me ? " Malcolm groaned a bit , under her caresses . " Down-payment , lock , stock , and barrel , " Melba replied , leaving a watery kiss behind . " Mmm . Talk about plums for texture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she walked up and down the room , occasionally darting a glance at Malcolm , who remainedquiet and still in bed . Practising her new repertoire , she sang one of her favorite songs , especially now for Mal-colm : I 'm a little bit of this and that , But I 'm all one solid piece for you ! Malcolm smiled weak but appreciative from the bed . If there is one thing that is fatal to most men , Mr. Cox alwaystold his followers , it is marriage . Malcolm was not precisely a full-grown man , but he was a man , and marriagein his case may have proved fatal.  |p207Not  one of the circle surrounding Madame Girard and Mr. Cox had ever thought that Malcolm , who had been with them such a short time , would go from them in the particular way he did . But after it was all over , everybody agreed that it was almost the only way he could have gone from them . Too young for the army , too unprepared to continue his schooling and become a scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him but marriage ? And in his case , marriage supplied him with everything that he had up to now lacked , and also gave him his unique way of leaving the world , in which he had perhaps never belonged ( as some people said ) in the first place . Marriage which ushers most people into life , in Malcolm'scase , therefore , ushered him into happiness  --  and death . Whether Melba sensed that Malcolm was dying , no one ever knew . She was too busy ever to talk with anybody , and besides , she did not know Madame Girard and Mr. Cox and their circle , and they were the only ones who would have been able to tell her what state Malcolm was in . Melba 's chief source of interest during this period was that after so many weeks of incessant marriage , she found she was still not pregnant , and could therefore continue both her professional career and her marriage duties to Malcolm without fear or constraint , and what is more , they could , husband and wife , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the night he had recognized his " father " and cut open his head , Malcolm found himself too weak ever to be out of bed , and in this state the happy thought hit him to write down all his conversations with Mr. Cox , Girard Girard , Kermit , and others in English , but shortly after he began this , he caught an extremely bad cold , which his Cubanvalet said was really pneumonia , and after that , Mal/colm wrote down everything in French , as this seemed the easier language in his increased weakness . Melba knew French very well , but , as she explained , since she had begun to read his " conversations " in English , she lost all the little interest she had had in them once he switched to another language , and so nobody ever saw them again until Malcolm himself was no longer counted among the living . As Malcolm felt his strength ebbing rather than returning , a fixed melancholy stole over him , and the sight of the falling leaves and November skies fixed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink more and have more frequentconjugal duties with her . He tried both of these , and actually became even more addicted to them , but his melancholy , far from disappearing , grew more pronounced and virulent . He continued to lose weight , although his mental vigor , such as it was , remained unimpaired , and he spent all his time now recording his " conversations " with his former friends , who were still unable to see him owing to his marriage . A few evenings before he died , he called Melba to his room and informed her that he had been bitten by a small buff-colored dog . Melba greeted Malcolm vaguely , as she was nursing a hangover , and was still also a bit puzzled at having wakenedup that morning to find herself in bed with Heliodoro , the Cuban valet , whose extreme handsomeness must have won her over to him in her cups . Leaving the sick room almost immediately , and a bit fed up being married to someone who would be sick , Melba decided on a longish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nerves , and it was already morningp209when she remembered Malcolm 's remark about the dog bite . To be on the safe side , she summoned a physician . But it was , of course , as she remarked later to Heliodoro , just her luck , and a bit of a bit too late for medicine . The physician , a man , who , as Melba noted immediately , looked fatally ill himself , gave this diagnosis : Malcolmwas dying , he claimed , from acute alcoholism and sexual hyperaesthesia , and all that could be done for him now was give him every comfort and a quiet bed to himself . Melba was going to tell the physician that nobody today died of the things he was accusing Malcolm of , but she felt there was no use having an argument if bereavement should come to the house . " He is not dying , then , from a dog bite ? " Melba inquired , taking the physician to the car which , she saw , was what must have at one time been a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his body , " the physician said , after a lengthy pause . " He insists a dog bit him , " Melba said , and she looked at her drink , which she had carried out with her to the car . The physician , excusing his near forgetfulness , then hastily wrote out a prescription which he handed to her . Melba still waited on , her glass in hand , why she never understood later , until the doctor got into his broken-down car and drove off . She even waved to him from the drive with her glass . Melba went into Malcolm 's room and sat down quietly on the bed by him . When she looked into his face , she felt the physician might be wrong in the diagnosis , but right about his taking a trip . " Am I going to lose my little Number 3 ? " she inquired softly so as not to disturb the boy too much.  |p210Malcolm  opened his eyes briefly and smiled . " Do you know what is happening ? " Melba asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drily . " I ca n't remember all of my conversations with her , and ca n't get it written down , you see . Mr. Cox , I know , would n't come , because he is so happily married , or I might call him . " " You are going to die , kiddy , " Melba said , taking his hand , which bore her ring on it . She kissed the ring . " Call Madame Girard and tell her to come , " Malcolm repeated . " All right , kiddy . Can do , " Melba said vaguely . On being informed of Malcolm 's grave condition , MadameGirard left the the party which she was giving , and which she had planned to last for three days , and drove to Melba 's country house . Going in without announcing herself , Madame Girard walked past Melba without so much as a greeting , and sat down on the bed beside Malcolm . Melba herself had taken a drug which would not allow her to feel extreme grief or unpleasantness of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband together while she went into the front room to practice her repertoire for an evening performance . Madame Girard wished , above all , to have Malcolm recognize her , not only because she now saw that it was Malcolm who was the idea of her life  --  despite their short term of friendship  --  but because she had so many things yet to tell him , including Girard Girard 's message of friendship to him , and his plea for forgiveness for not having returned to the boy in the horticultural gardens last summer. 211Madame Girard kept placing cold compresses on his forehead to relieve him of some of his fever . As a reward for her patient care , there came a moment when he opened his eyes , and looked at her , but almost immediately closed them again . A few minutes later , he said in his usual loud voice : Estel Blanc on a white mare ! " Sometimes also he shouted " Hurrah ! " but he never gave any evidence again that he had seen Madame Girard . Several times during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous number : I 'm a little bit of this and that But I 'm all one solidso that finally Madame Girard got up and closed the heavy inner door between the sick room and Melba . Madame Girard had come to stay , until everything was over . Once , near the end , she thought that all of her patient waiting and care was indeed to be rewarded with " recognition , " with a word to her , from Malcolm , for the boy started up in bed , opened his eyes , and stared at her . " Malcolm , " she whispered . " It 's NOT twenty years ! " he cried , and fell back again , without even seeing her . Toward morning , Madame Girard heard Melba go out the front door , and a moment later the sound of the Daimler 's motor . Madame Girard had gone to the window to see if the Cuban valet was in the car with Melba , but in the dark she could not tell . Returning to Malcolm 's bed , she put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called out , feeling the iciness of his flesh . She had missed , she saw immediately , his last single minute : Malcolm 's short long life was at an end . As Melba did not return that day , nor the next , nor did Madame Girard ever see her again , she herself took charge of the funeral ceremonies . The florists of the town discussed Madame Girard 's funeralexpenditure for years to come . She had , for instance , ordered  --  even if she perhaps did not quite get  --  a quarter ton of roses , and an equal amount of violets , so that Malcolm'slast hours above earth were passed in a green house of sweetness and foliage . One anonymous spray also arrived in what was perhaps meant to be the simulacrum of a bench . Madame Girard , however , informed no one of the funeral . It was completely private so far as she was concerned and , so to speak , a command performance , with herself as the only audience . She was greatly displeased , almost annihilated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby vicinity , and since the ketchup season was at its peak at the time of Malcolm'sfuneral , the burned saccharine smell of tomatoes struggled desperately with the evanescent perfume of violetsand roses . Horses with black plumes in the European tradition carriedthe corpse to a small private burial ground purchased for the occasion by Madame Girard herself . A trumpetervoluntary  --  ayoung military person who happened by chance to be in the neighborhood  --  was asked to perform , which he did creditably . The only flaw in the ceremony was the repeated insistenceof the local coroner and the undertaker  --  later they were both silenced , it is said , by money  --  that there had213been no corpse at all , and that nobody was buried in the ceremony . Thus , the only proof that Malcolm had died and was buried , rested with Madame Girard herself , and in time her story became full of evasions . But nobody could deny that there had been a ceremony , and that a casket had been lowered into a special plot , and that Madame Girard herself had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , Madame Girard saw , coming down the dusty country road on foot , none other than Girard Girard . They exchanged looks , but did not speak , and then with a short glance at the freshly-dug grave , Girard Girard accompaniedhis former wife back to an inn , where after a long silence , punctuated only by the sounds of their spoons moving in their coffee , Girard Girard excused himself and returned to the city . Madame Girard , in any case , had long ago forgiven GirardGirard , since she never gave up her title or name , and continued to be the most effective individual force of her society . She remained in the country until the following morning , looking over Malcolm 's papers , and taking as many as she could find into her custody . Since that day , Malcolm 's grave , which has no marker beyond a stone bearing his name , has been poorly cared for , and fallen into complete neglect , though since it was purchased in perpetuity one can believe that his remains , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whatever portionof time may be reserved for the earth and the world . A few years after the preceding events , Mr. Cox , through one of those rare second strokes of fortune , found anotherp214young man  --  a bit older , it is true than Malcolm  --  who became his pupil and went through over 25 addresses with the elder gentleman  --  and finally , much to Mr. Cox 's surprise and even jealousy , took up an independent life-study of astrology , and entirely eclipsed his master . Kermit , about two weeks after Malcolm 's death , met a young , though retired , and very wealthy motion picture star , who was immediately taken with the little man , and they were married in a somewhat ostentatious ceremony in a suburb of San Francisco . Eloisa Brace was awarded a life-pension by an anonymousdonor ( who almost surely was Girard Girard ) and was thus able to devote her entire waking life to painting , but her sudden security , many believed , destroyed her last vestiges of talent , and both she and her husband occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . Estel Blanc became the successful entrepreneur of a small opera company , giving selections from the best modernoperas , with Cora Naldi as permanent guest star . Girard Girard , after a time , became the father of six male children  --  and this was for him the realization of a vague ambition and yearning which he had had , unconsciously , all along : the founding of a dynasty perpetuating his name . Madame Girard was the constant companion of a young Italian biochemist , who shared the Chateau with her , and wished to marry her , but she refused to give up her " title , " as she continued to call her name . The closeness of her association with the Italian , which became permanent , led ( many believe ) to her giving up the bottle entirely . Melba was married in Yucatan to Heliodoro , the Cuban valet , with whom she had disappeared shortly before Malcolm'sdeath . To everyone 's surprise , she found herself reasonably contented and happy with him , remaining hisp215wife for over five years . Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly . A year or so after Malcolm 's supposed death , there was a somewhat convincing rumor that he was alive again , and the " favorite " of a circle much more advanced than the Cox-Girard-Brace consistory , but the rumor proved to be , finally , without foundation . Everybody was surprised , nevertheless , after the talk about his being alive again had died down , to realize that Malcolm , in the interim , had been almost entirely forgotten , and was no longer a subject of conversation anywhere . Madame Girard , however , though she never mentioned Malcolm  --  indeed she had no one to mention him to , since her new friends , such as the Italian biochemist , had never heard of him  --  Madame Girard continued to read with interestand surprise the 300 pages of manuscript which Malcolm had left behind him , in French and English , his " conversations " with his friends , and although they had been written at times in delirium , and always in high fever , they continually held her attention , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ever had with all whom he had ever met.
