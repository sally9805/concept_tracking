The unidentified rebel , who. owns 3,800 shares in the name of King &; Co. , made a bid for stockholder support in the company 's proxy material mailed last week in advance of the May 7 annual meeting . Management said in the same , proxy that it opposes the idea . The proposal appears to be a token slap at Daniel K. Ludwig , one of the world 's biggest ship owners , who holds beneficially 149,990 shares , or 59.43% , of American-Hawaiian stock . Mr. Ludwig can defeat the *oposai simply by casting his huge holdings against it . Since managethent is considered to reflect his views , that 's what he is expected to zio . The dissident stockholder 's proposal would require the company , within 60 days after the annual meeting , to purchase all stock not held by Mr. Ludwig " at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth within 90 days " a specific plan for complete liquidation " before the end of 1958 .

This would enable a stockholder to multiply his number of shares by the number of directors to be elected , and then to divide up his vote among the directors as he pleased . " The system of electing directors now in effect enables one stockholder who owns 59% of the company 's stock to elect the entire board , " the dissident said , " thus denying representation to minority stockholders who own the aggregate 41% of the stock .
