From Los Angeles ' International Airport one morning last week , a Scandinavian Airlines DC-6B roared up through the smog and headed north . Its destination : Copenhagen , via the Arctic . To trim roughly 650 miles off the regular California-Europe flight distance , the four-engine plane , with 13 crewmen and 22 passengers aboard , was going to fly where no commercial carrier had ever flown . That afternoon the plane stopped at Edmonton , Alta . After touching down early next morning at the big U.S. Air Force base at Thule , Greenland-a scant 900 miles from the North Pole-the plane was soon airborne again , driven toward Denmark by 95-m.p.h. tail winds . Scandinavian 's route-blazing flight ended at Copenhagen , after a flying time of 23 hrs. 34 min. ( plus stopovers of 4 hrs. 43 min. ) from Los Angeles . Time in the air was 3 hours less than the present commercial flight time by way of New York and Newfoundland . <P> Although the airline has not yet applied for U.S. and Canadian permission to fly the new route on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By next spring , they predict , Scandinavian 's timetables will list two or three weekly flights over the top of the world .
