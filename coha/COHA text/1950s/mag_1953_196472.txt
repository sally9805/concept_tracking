Racing to get their horror pictures to moviegoers , two producers ran head on into title trouble last week . The opponents : Albert Zugsmith , producer of a forthcoming work called The Great Green Og , and Ivan Tors , producer of Gog . <P> Og is described as twice the size of a man , has green blood , and rules the planet Aphrodite . Gog is an aluminum , electronically controlled mechanical slave with five arms . He moves about on a treadmill like a tank , and , with a chum named Magog , works with atomic material . <P> After a bloodcurdling production conference . Producer Zugsmith , green with rage , announced : " I registered my title long before Tors got it into his head . We have priority . Tors was planning a picture called Space Station , U.S.A. , and he shot it . After he finished it he started to register a new title , Gog . Naturally , I protested the similarity between Og and Gog . We 're trying to be friendly enemies about this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other night . But my feeling is , if he comes out first with Gog , that ruins our title . . . His Gog is a mechanical monster . My Og is a missing-link monster . But they 're both monsters . " <P> Said Tors : " Gog and Magog were in my script all along . The original title was Space Station , U.S.A. , but the robots were so spectacular that I registered both Gog and Magog as two additional titles . " <P> This week in Manhattan , a Motion Picture Association committee was busily trying to unsnarl the whole gog-awful mess . If they fail , according to one Hollywoodian , there are only two courses open . Zugsmith and Tors will be forced to 1 ) join forces and shoot Og Meets Gog , or 2 ) forget the monsters altogether , since shooting may be too good for them .
