Flood control is vital in California , where the nightmare is water-too much in the rainy north , too little in the arid south . Key to California 's burgeoning economy is a multimillion-dollar system of dams and reservoirs that channels northern water into the fertile but dry Central Valley and the water-starved cities of the booming south . But no flood-control program is watertight , and California 's is far from complete . Last week , in the wake of northern floods that cost $170 million and 74 lives , Californians were grateful for the dams they have , but bitterly regretted a three-year lapse in starting more . <P> Triggered by moist tropical air , which the Pacific jet stream freakishly shot in from Hawaii over cool northern Califor nia , a tremendous downpour began at mid-month . The downfall deposited as much as 31.5 inches of rain by Dec. 26 , melted Sierra snowpacks like a blowtorch , streamed off steep hillsides in the rugged redwood country . Swollen mountain streams burst out of the woods like furious brown snakes , swallowing topsoil and drowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ten Mile , Navarro and other rivers picked up speed , boiled out of gorges toward the Pacific , wrecked railroads and cut coastal U.S. Highway 101 . <P> As far east as Reno , rain sent the peaceful Truckee River on a binge , cut the city in half . Undaunted tourists kept yanking undaunted one-arm bandits in Harolds Club , joked about floating crap games . Though no lives were lost , the Reno region suffered $5,000,000 in damages . In southwest Oregon , the heaviest rains in 78 years brought floods that killed twelve people and flung huge fir logs off cliffs like harpoons . <P> Berserk Feather . Near the headwaters of California 's two most important river systems , the Sacramento and the San Joaquin , great dams such as Shasta , Folsom , Friant and Pine Flat curbed angry water that might have caused infinitely more damage and death . At flood 's height , more than 200,000 cubic feet of water a second poured into the reservoir back of the Sacramento 's Shasta Dam , which shrank the downstream rush to only 16,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> There was no such barrier on the Feather River , where the proposed $400 million concrete Oroville Dam , planned as the world 's largest , is still a paper dream tabled by legislative inertia . The Feather went berserk . It swept madly to its confluence with the Yuba River in the peach country just southwest of Marysville ( pop . 12,500 ) and Yuba City ( pop . 8,000 ) . Advised to flee across the river to their sister town , the people of Marysville quickly found themselves scrambling for their lives in Yuba City , where the flood demolished levees while dikes held fast in Marysville.
