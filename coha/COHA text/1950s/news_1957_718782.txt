txt Letters to The Times ALAIN C. ENTHOVEN.PAVEL KORBEL.ABRAHAM FLEXNER . Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The maxim " penny wise , pound foolish " was illustrated perfectly last week by the Bureau of the Budget when it dealt a serious blow to the future efficiency of the armed forces . It rejected the recommendations of the Cordiner committee ( New York Times , April 27 ) . From the point of view of economy and national security it would have been better to cut the military budget in any of a large number of other places rather than in the area of military pay . All of the services face a serious manpower problem : re-enlistment rates are extremely low , For men in " hard skills , " such as electronics , they are usually well under 10 per cent . Only a quarter of the junior officers remain in the services beyond their obligated tours of duty . There is a serious shortage of experienced officers , especially in the four to fourteen years of service group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon whom the effectiveness of the whole military establishment depends . There is a critical shortage of skilled technicians in the services . For lack of sufficient numbers of pilots and experienced repairmen many of our expensive bombers are needlessly out of commission . Yet the combat readiness of these aircraft is a cornerstone of our national security . As General Le May has ceaselessly pointed out , it is foolish to buy more and more bombers and then refuse to provide the manpower to fly and maintain them . Personnel Policies Our present military personnel policies are enormously wasteful . The Strategic Air Command must spend over $100,000 to train a bomber pilot but it is not permitted to offer hint enough money to induce him to make the service a career . Most of our younger pilots return to civilian life at . the first opportunity . The military skills of these men are totally lost to the Air Force . Combat readiness requires constant training . In this jet atomic age , reserve bomber pilots can contribute very little to our standing force . As another example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bombing system repairman during his first four-year enlistment . He is able to provide the Air Force with a year and a half of productive service . During much of this time he must be carefully supervised because of his inexperience . These men are constantly being offered very attractive jobs by civilian industry , but the service is allowed to offer them no more than about $2,500 a year . It is not surprising that 90 per cent of them return to civilian life at the end of their first enlistment . The special Department of Defense on military pay , headed by Ralph J. Cordiner , recently proposed a set of eminently reasonable recommendations for the amelioration of this situation. , Naturally the recommendations included substantial pay increases . But the proposed increases were designed with economy in view . Rather than wastefully giving an across-the-board pay rise in all categories , the Cordiner committee suggested that salary increases be granted only where needed  --  that is , in categories in which the services face shortages and in which pay increases would lead to budgetary savings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis . By offering more attractive salaries to skilled personnel , the services can retain more of them , thereby saving on training costs , reducing accidents and improving the over-all experience and quality of the force . Public Interest Involved Many people tend to think of the military pay problem only front the point of view of the recipients of the pay . The important point of view is the public interest . Could the nation buy a better military establishment for less money by increasing the salaries of highly skilled members of the armed services ? The answer to this question is yes . If the services do not pay technicians and talented executives enough , they will continue to lose them . It is to be hoped that the Congress will demonstrate an appreciation for the difference between true and false economy and that it will pass legislation implementing the recommendations of the Cordiner committee . ALAIN C. ENTItoVF , N. Santa Monica , Calif. , May 2 , 1957 . Voting in Soviet Satellites To THE EDITOR Or THE NEW YORK TIMES : The claim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are scheduled for June 23 are democratic is similar to a great number of recent statements in the Czechoslovak regime pt+ss . A comparison of the Czechoslovak and the East German election laws shows that their basic provisions are identical . A National Front dominated by the Communist party not only picks all candidates and presents them to the voters but it also has the exclusive right to register them with the election commissions . Only these " registered " National Front candidates may appear on the ballot c papers , This state of affairs is not surprising . The Soviet Constitution regulates the electoral system in Chapter XI . Under Section 141 " the right to nominate candidates ( to all elections ) is secured to public organizations and societies of the working people : Communist party organizations , trade unions , cooperatives , youth organizations and cultural societies . " This form of " democratic elections " is indispensable for the maintenance of all regimes in the Soviet orbit . PAVEL KoeBEL , New York , May 4 , 1957 . To Finance Medical Schools Revival of Pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter is director emeritus of the Institute for Advanced Study . A former director of the division of studies and medical education of the General Education Board , he has written widely in his field . To THE EDITOR OFT HE New York TIMES : One of the boasts of higher education in America in the yeare approximately 1920 up to perhaps 19-10 was the prosperous state of our medical schools and the enormous increase in America of highly trained physicians , followed by a similar experience in the field of public health . For this development the funds of the Rockefeller Boards  --  the General Education Board and the Rockefeller Foundation  --  led the way . Their technique was simple . They dealt with one school at a time and almost inevitably found that millions were needed . They developed a pattern of giving a portion , provided the institution and its friends raised the balance . By this simple method he situation existing in 1910 , when the country had one excellent small school , the Johns Hopkins Medical School , was within two decades at most converted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all admirably and generously financed . Let me repeat the technique that brought this about . The Rockefeller organization estimated in one school after another what was needed . It offered one-third , sometimes one-half , provided the institution raised the balance . In the course of ten or twelve years the situation was transformed . The situation today is bleak . Practically every medical school in the country is in the red . In the April 11 issue of a New York newspaper there is an estimate that an additional income of ten million a year is needed for eighty-two schools . Report on Grants The last quarterly report of the Rockefeller Foundation states that during the first quarter of 1057 the foundation had made grants totaling $2,714,000 . The amount given to medical education and public health amounted to approximately $571,000 . I do not understand the additional items of biological and medical research , for medical research and medical education are identical . However , toward that queer combination grants amounting to $806,640 were made . The total is somViing like a million and a half dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , it would yield a negligible amount . If it is spent as income it . would have to he repeated year after year , making very little difference in the total situation . For all practical purposes Dean Rusk and Dr , Warren Weaver may just as well surrender medicine and devote their total income to some educational field that can prosper on small doses . Fortunately , the Kress Foundation has taken the bull by the horns . Mr. Kress announced at a recent luncheon a gift of $5,000,000 to the Bellevue Hospital Center of New York University to be paid when New York University through its own efforts raised an additional $5,000,000 . Thus the resources of the Bellevue School will be increased $10,000,000 . It is to be hoped that one by one other institutions can be similarly aided and the pattern abandoned long since by the Rockefeller Foundation can once more be made operative . Of course the final responsibility for such matters of basic policy rests on the shoulders of the Rockefeller and other foundation trustees . ARRA HAM FLEXNER .
