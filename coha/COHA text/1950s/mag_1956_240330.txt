It is dark at last in the Kyrenia Mountains of Cyprus and the British Commando officer has no appetite for the task he must now perform . He assembles his squad for a patrol , but his mind is on another night like this , 14 years ago . Then he was the hunted , a fugitive from the Nazis who had poured into Greece . Three young Greeks sheltered him , then carried him in a tiny caique away from Greece to safety . Now the officer is the hunter , and it is time to hunt down Greeks as brave and as passionate for freedom as those who saved his life . " Things have certainly changed , " the officer sighs . He slaps a clip into his Sten gun and orders his men forward . <P> <P> It is time for divine services in the small Protestant church in Nicosia . Sir John Harding , a brave soldier and brilliant commander has fought two wars , led whole armies-including thousands of Cypriots who fought in British uniforms . But he dares not worship alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar , the Bible , the pews and chancel for planted explosives . Harding arrives in a bulletproof sedan . Armored cars bristle outside as Sir John , Governor General of the Crown Colony of Cyprus is at his devotions . <P> <P> The authorities have at last found the Cypriot whose paintbrush adorned a wall with a slogan offensive to the Governor . Such scenes at police headquarters suggest a boys ' game gone terribly wrong- the young , pink-faced British soldier looks almost as scared as the culprit he drags in , squirming and nauseated with fear . This criminal is a schoolboy of 14 ; the message he painted was " Harding come down from your helicopter . " The punishment for the boy 's crime : three months in prison . <P> <P> A handsome British major of 34 is decorated with the coveted George Medal for his bravery in breaking up an ambush of terrorists . But Major Brian Coombe has killed a man and he is not proud . " My driver was killed by one of them and it was my duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says softly . " As a result , one frightened , pathetic young Cypriot was killed . It is tragic . The Cypriots now are acclaiming the dead man as their hero , and the British press is acclaiming me as theirs . You may think I am talking like a grandmother , but there is far too much hatred here . There is al ready too much death , pain and tears in Cyprus . " <P> <P> History may place the death , pain and tears as but passing stages in the 20th-century 's long funeral procession of British colonialism . There came Ireland , India , Palestine , Kenya , Malaya , and now Cyprus . But the special tragedy of Cyprus is that it involves friends , and that the suffering should be so simply avoidable . A clear statement from the British government promising the right of self-determination at a definite time in the near future to Cyprus ' 520,000 people could halt overnight a conflict that daily grows more violent and more dangerous . Week by week it becomes more apparent that Britain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the just solution , but the inevitable one . " One wonders , " wrote the conservative London Daily Telegraph 's Cyprus correspondent last week , " if we have not arrived at a point of no return . "
