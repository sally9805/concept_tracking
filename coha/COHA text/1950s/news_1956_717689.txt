txt A high-support , high-cost farm bill such as the Senate Agriculture Committee has turned out faces almost certain White House veto in its Present form . How much Congress will modify the gilt-edged measure remains to be seen when the measure goes to the floor around the 20th of the month . But this proposed return to a high , rigid , wartime price support system squeezed by on an 8-to-7 committee vote  --  a fact which indicates Senate passage iis by no means assured . Bountiful Promises President Eisenhower has told the Congress that jacking price supports up again will " defeat the main object of the Soil Bank . " In an obvious veto warning , he has said he would be " gravely concerned " if Congress places before him a Soil Bank bill " coupled with the restitution of prodUctibri ' incentives certain to nullify the great benefits that the bank can bring . " The omnibus measure promises just about all things to all farmers , from a return to high supports to higher parity for figuring such supports , higher level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank relief program , , higher Soil Bank payments , and so on . It is , in large measure , therefore , a highly political bill , but this is a highly political year . Farm aid is needed , to be sure ; so is the farm vote . There is genuine cause for concern to the whole country , as economists see it , in the steadily declining rate of farm income . At some point  --  and soon  --  that de  --  line should be checked , all agree . But the cost of such ac , tion , obviously , will be high . Exception on Wheat The real nub of the issue Is : How high ? How much should the government pay to put the farmer back in step with the rest of the country , prosperity-wise ? Or how far , many legislators will ask , are constituents ready to go along in the allocation of their taxes to bolstering the farm economy ? The proposed legislation would boost the cost of the farm program to an unprecedented figure . The Soil Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,350,000,000 . The administration program had been estimated at $1,000,000,000 . The committee , in voting for a return to the wartime 90 per cent of parity for the so-called " basic " commodities made a new distinction in the case of wheat . It is . specified that only high quality wheat  --  that is , wheat of milling quality  --  shall be eligible for the higher rate , along with corn , cotton , and peanuts . Lower grade wheat would still be supported at lower rates , but never lower than 75 per cent of parity . Butter Surplus Mounts For dairy farmers , whose " self-help " efforts have been lauded and fairly successful , the nc .. v measure would jack price supports from 75 to 80 per cent of parity . The support rate heretofore has been optional with the Secretary of Agriculture within the 75 to 90 per cent of parity range . Secretary of Agriculture Ezra T. Benson dropped dairy supports the full range to the minimum some time ago . His action came when the government found itself neck-deep in surplus butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of pounds a month to keep support at the required 90 per cent level . Two alternatives have been proposed for the support of rice prices : ( 1 ) a two-price system under which this commodity would bring 90 per cent support in home markets and go for the world market price elsewhere ; ( 2 ) or 90 per cent support for high quality rice under the same kind of a proposal suggested for wheat . Another gimmick which would make high supports higher is the proposal to return to the dual parity system  --  that is , to give farmers the benefit of either the modernized or the old version of parity , whicnever would give him more . The old system was terminated in the last farm bill on the ground that it did not take into account the lower labor costs of the modern machine-age . This would figure out at about 13 cents more a bushel for wheat farmers and about one-half cent more a pound for cottongrowers . It is also proposed to include tobacco in the acreage reserve portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of parity under a separate program . With an assurance of high supports farmers would almost inevitably pour on more fertilizer to grow more on the remaining acres  --  a practice which has helped to defeat the purpose of the acreage reduction which has taken place under the current support program .
