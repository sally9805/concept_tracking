txt John L. Lewis offered today to advance $10,000,000 to the striking United Steelworkers of America , C. I. 0. , to fight " the rapacious and predatory interests that oppose you . " Mr. Lewis , president of the United Mine Workers of America , made the offer in a telegram to his former friend and aide , Philip Murray , president of the steel workers union . The miners ' leader made his message a vehicle for an attack on Senator Robert A. Taft and the Taft-Hartley law , which the Ohio Republican Senator cosponsored . The Ford Motor Company announced that its plants would go on a four-day week Friday because of the steel strike . Another development in the , tangled steel story today was a virtual acknowledgement by Roger L. Putnam , Economic Stabilization Administrator , that the Government was ready to break its price line if the steel industry reached a wage agreement with the union . The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow on a provision in the Defense Production Bill calling on President Tru- man to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel strike , now in its third week . Expert guessing is . that the House will ? do ase.the . Senate did and support the request , and that President Truman will accede to it . A final vote on the Defense Production Bill to extend economic controls also may be reached tomorrow . A group of Republican and Southern Democratic leaders of the House met behind closed doors this afternoon to discuss the type and order of the amendments dealing with labor that will be offered to the Defense Production Act . The character of the meeting suggested a coalition was being formed on the controversial labor elements of the bill . Mr. Lewis ' offer of financial aid in the steel strike was one of ' those surprise gestures in which the miners ' chief takes delight . In October , 1949 , he publicly proposed that . nine big American Federation of Labor unions and the United Mine Workers pool funds and give the striking steel workers $250,000 a week . William Green , president of the A. F. L. , rejected the suggestion . In March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid a strike of the United Automobile Workers of America , C. I. 0 . Walter P. Reuther , president , declined it but said in effect he could use a gift . A telephone workers union several years ago did accept a $100,000 loan from Mr. Lewis ' union . Murray 's Check Is Recalled Mr. Murray played the same game himself once by sending a check for $500,000 to the United Mine Workers during the 1949-50 mine strike . The check was returned with a polite reply . Today 's offer , as Mr. Lewis is aware , is likely to be declined , too . The big unions do not pay strike benefits to members out of their international treasuries , and their funds are adequate for other strike expenses . The message to Mr. Murray , signed by three officers of the United Mine Workers , said : " It is of course the fervent hope of these interests that they can crush your strike through the utilization of the infamous TaftHartley slave statute . They are aided and abetted by certain groups and individuals in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Any attempt to crush your strike , through the device of the Taft-Hartley machinery , for the benefit of the rapacious and predatory interests that oppose you , would be a-heinous crime against American labor , anti-social in its concept , and perilously destructive of confidence in the principles of our American republic . " It would be equivalent to the creation ' of a Neo-Fascist movement in America , of which R. Alphonso Taft , , , with his jack boots and velvet ' pants , would be the willing tool and symbol . " Our union is in this fight with you . Indicative of that fact and as a preliminary step , United Mine Workers of America has today established financial credit for the United Steelworkers of America in the National Bank of Washington , D. C. , in the amount of ten millions of dollars , subject to your draft and order , as your need warrants and circumstances require . Any draft made by you against this credit can be repaid by your union when you have achieved victory and convenience permits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The union 's assets are not a matter of public knowledge , but they amount probably to five times the sum Mr. Lewis offered to advance to the steel workers . ' Mr. Murray said in Pittsburgh he might comment tomorrow on the offer . Putnam Tells of Price Talks The question of steel prices came up at a news conference held by Mr. Putnam . He said be and Dr. Steelman had discussed a $4.50 a ton increase when the steel industry leaders were in Washington for the wage negotiation more than two weeks ago . - But , said Mr. Putnam , that figure was mentioned " among other things , and nothing was settled . " He said the amount of the increase would be decided after the wage agreement was made and management brought in its reasonsl for a price increase . " They may be compelling reasons , " he said . " I do n't know whether I would be impressed $3 worth , or $4 worth or $5 worth . It depends on what showing is made . But we have let the steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing when they have made a settlement . " This was the first time Mr. Put , nam publicly mentioned a figure above $3 as a possible steel price increase . The price of steel now ' averages about $110 a ton . The steel companies may raise Prices $3 a ton at any time simply by notifying the Office of Price Stabilization . A few have done so . This is permitted by the so-called Capehart regulation , which permits the companies to charge for cost increases that occurred in the first thirteen months of the Korean war . Any price increase above that figure would be more than present stabilization standards would allow the steel industry .
