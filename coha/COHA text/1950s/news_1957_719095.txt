The amendment , accepted by the party leadership in both chambers , would qualify the right of jury trial in civil rights . criminal contempt cases . The Senate has insisted on such right of jury trial . Under the House rules , the legislative order limits general debate to one hour . The measure is the first item of business tomorrow for the House . Representative Ray J. Madden , Democrat of Indiana , as the senior Democrat of the committee who favors the plan , will be floor manager during the bill 's brief appearance . Speedy Action Likely Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to the Senate for probable passage within two or three days . The imminent disposition of , the most vexing issue of this , ' session gave Congress a sense lof relief and turned all energies , to the task of cleaning , up the , rest of the legislative work . The most important remaining item , appropriations for the foreign aid program , emerged from the Senate Appropriations Committee and will go to the Senate floor no later than Wednesday and possibly tomorrow .

The reconciliation between the two houses ' figures on for2 eign aid , plus the final passage ' of the civil rights legislation , // will signal the beginning of the end of this session . Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , the Senate Democratic leader , pledged " every possible effort " ! to adjourn by Saturday and ! scheduled sessions for 11 A. M ? an hour earlier than usual , tomorrow and for 10 A. M. on succeeding days . The House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and appeared in position easily to finish up everything of consequence by the week-end . The Rules Committee 's action in clearing the civil rights bill , was the first official step on that matter since the Senate adopted its version on Aug. 7 . For many days , the committee had immoblized the issue simply by not meeting . Its right-wing Southern Democratic chairman , Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia , had refused to call a meeting . In this position he had the support , of another right-wing Southerner , Representative William Colmer of Mississippi , and the four Republican members of the committee . Representatives Smith and Colmer wanted no meeting because they wanted no kind of civil rights legislation . The four Republicans had wanted no session because the Republicans in general were attempting to exact concessions from the Democrats to reject the Senate text in favor of something approaching the original Administration version . This Administration text was approved intact by the House in June . The impasse was broken , in all but the formal sense , on Friday by an agreement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jury-trial compromise . This retained the principle of the right of jury trial in criminal Contempt cases arising from violation of civil rights voting injunctions , as the Senate had demanded . ? It provided , however , that a Federal judge could try a violator without a jury trial , bat that if he did so and subsequently assessed penalties greater than forty-five days ' imprisonment and a $300 fine , the defendant , could then demand new trial with a jury . Once the bargain had been struck , the House Republicans agreed to join in forcing a meeting of the Rules Committee . This they did this morning by adding the voice of Representative Hugh Scott , Republican of Pennsylvania , to the voices of the six Democrats who had been demanding a meeting . This broke what had been a 6-6 tie . Senator Johnson told the Senate this afternoon that this accommodation had been necessary to obtain any action , and that he hoped Congress next year would return to the unqualified jury trial guarantee that the Senate had wanted . The Senate bill would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . Establish a special civil rights division within the Department of Justice . mpower Federal prosecutors , with or without the victim 's consent , to obtain injunctions against actual or threatened interference with the right to Note . A person refusing to obey such an injunction could be imprisoned for civil contempt by a Federal judge , sitting without a jury , and held until he agreed to comply . Cripinal contempt cases would be those in which the motive of the judge was not to force the carrying out of a court order but simply to punish . The Administration had want- , ed no kind of jury trial guarantee and no distinction between civil and criminal contempt . The House had gone I along with this approach . This morning 's meeting of the House Rules Committee was in a sense anti-climactic . The chairman , Mr. Smith , arrived twelve minutes late ? at 11:12 A. M. ? to demonstrate his reluctance to the end . Voting to clear the bill for the House floor were : Democrats ? Representatives Madden , James J. Delaney of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas , Richard Bolling of Missouri and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr . of Massachusetts . Republicans ? Representatives Leo E. Allen of Illinois , Clarence J. Brown of Ohio , Henry J. Latham of upstate New York and Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania . Voting against clearing the bill were Representatives Smith and Colmer.
