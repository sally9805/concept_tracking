Not long ago many scientists feared that the public was forgetting the menace of the atom bomb . What many responsible scientists fear now is public hysteria caused by exaggeration of the destructiveness of the hydrogen bomb . <P> Last week , on a radio round table sponsored by the University of Chicago , Associate Professor Harrison Brown sprang a chiller to top all chillers . The blast effects of hydrogen bombing , Brown told his nationwide audience , will be only the beginning ; the radioactive aftereffects will be far worse . Hydrogen explosions , he said , will fill the air with fiercely radiating isotopes . They will drift with the wind , he believes , like a swarm of invisible locusts , killing people , animals , insects , plants . <P> Take a Continent . Warming to his subject , he told just how the U.S. might attack the U.S.S.R. All that is necessary , he said , is to explode large hydrogen bombs on a line extending north &; south across Europe . The radioactivity " would be carried eastward by the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extending from Leningrad to Odessa , and 3,000 miles deep , extending from Prague to the Ural Mountains . " <P> Brown also described how the U.S.S.R. might attack the U.S. The bombs could be exploded in the Pacific , 1,000 miles west of California . Their radioactivity , drifting eastward , would lawnmower the whole U.S. , reaching and sterilizing New York in about five days . <P> Tons of Neutrons . This week , on a similar broadcast , Brown repeated his shocker . Physicist Leo Szilard of Chicago added that 50 tons of neutrons released by hydrogen fusion could ring the earth with a radioactive dust layer capable of killing the earth 's entire population . Physicists Frederick Seitz of the University of Illinois and Hans Bethe of Cornell , appearing on the same program , were more moderate , but they went along generally with their emphatic colleagues . <P> To this sort of talk , other equally informed physicists react with astonishment or distaste . They point out that no one knows accurately how much continued radiation is needed to kill a man . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H-bombs will work or how soon they can be made to work . Kindly critics say that Brown , Szilard et al . have been led by emotion to confuse the worst possibilities of the future with the sufficiently alarming present . Some , not so kindly , charge that the alarmists , however well-intentioned they may be , are helping to frighten the U.S. public into forcing dangerous concessions to Russia. * <P> No scientist pooh-poohs the hydrogen bomb . The uranium bomb itself is a fearful weapon , capable of cutting the guts out of a great city . Hydrogen bombs , if they work as well as expected , will be many times more fearsome than uranium bombs . But there is an enormous difference between a bomb that will disrupt a city and kill its people and one that will wipe all life off the face of a continent or the earth . <P> Both uranium and hydrogen bombs will leave some radioactive residues . If a uranium bomb is exploded near the ground ( as the first one at Alamogordo ) , the " fission products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But most of the fission products rise high in the atmosphere . When the bomb is exploded 1,80b ft. above the ground ( as at Hiroshima ) , virtually all the fission products are carried up , where they do no damage .
