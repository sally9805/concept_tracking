the commander , who must tell that soldier when to fall back , when to turn and fight some more . Any infantry officer at times must be ruthless . Part of the job is to send men into places from which you know they are not likely to come out . This is never easy , but it 's an especially soul-searing business when you 're fighting a delaying action , and the only thing you can buy with men 's lives is a little more time . I mention all this to explain a little  --  although not to alibi  --  some of the things I did that day when time got lost . There is one hour I remember : 6:30 A.M. Then , Lt. Arthur M. Clarke , one of my aides , relayed to me a report that North Korean tanks were in Taejon itself , although the battle line was supposed to be well north and west . With less than a month of war behind us , this sort of report was already an old story . Tanks , said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their men marching south without tiring their weapons in the opening hours of the war , Tanks had fired point-blank at our emplacements at Osan in the first American action . A tank had killed Col. Robert R. Martin , my old friend and one of the 24th Division 's best leaders . All of us were deathly sick of hearing about those big T-34 Russian-built tanks . This morning , Clarke , Jimmy Kim , my Korean interpreter , and I started out to look for those tanks . At the moment , we could n't do anything about the fact that the 34th 's headquarters had lost contact with its leading battalions , or about the war in general . But we thought we might do something about those tanks . We found them easily enough . Two T-34 's were knocked out at one road intersection ? they 'd come in all right , but would n't he going out again . One of our own ammunition carriers was burning behind them , with much phosphorus smoke . Another tank was in a nearby field . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be high explosive . We located a truck of ours with a 75-mm. recoilless rifle mounted on it , and directed this to back toward the tank in the field . But the gunner either was unfamiliar with his weapon or too nerv-18 ous , because none of the four or five rounds he fired scored a hit . This exhausted his ammunition , and the truck pulled away . Still the tank did n't move . We discovered , much later , that it actually was already out of action , although it looked perfectly sound . It was an old story . We had nothing with which to fight this or any other tank . Lieutenant Clarke long ago made a report of this day , and in it said that we returned to the regimental command post and ate breakfast . But 1 remember little about it , although very shortly food was to mean more to me than it had ever before . I do remember that presently we went tank hunting again . This time we located two more enemy tanks behind the burning ammunition carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite close . But as the tanks started to turn around , there was nothing we could do to stop them . Some people who escaped from Taejon that day reported that they had last seen me firing a pistol at a tank . Well , they did , but I 'm not proud of it . As those two tanks turned around , I banged away at them with a .45 . But even then I was n't silly enough to expect to do anything with a pistol . That was just plain rage and frustration  --  just Dean losing his temper again and doing something foolish . Presently , we received another , even more surprising report . A lone enemy tank , without visible infantry support , had calmly rumbled through the town  --  coming from the wrong direction and going up toward the battle line . It passed near the command post and the artillery area , not firing on either one or being fired on . It waddled all the way up to the front line ; then calmly turned around and came back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post a second time that tanker must have seen more Americans milling around a building than he 'd ever seen before , but he just kept going . We could only conclude that this tank had come all the way around our left flank , through the town of Kumsan , leaving roadblocks of infantry as he came . I think he went up toward the battle line to report to his people , " Well , I 've got these boys hooked from the rear now . Come on and make your attack . " We decided to chase this tank too . Clarke , a division liaison captain named Richard Rowlands , a Korean ordnance officer and some casuals made up our party . On the waywe also located a bazooka man and his ammunition carrier . When we finally located the strange tank , it was parked at an intersection of streets , perhaps half a mile south of headquarters . When we approached  --  going through store buildings and into the back doors of other stores only a few yards from the tank  --  rifle fire hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We withdrew through the stores and tried again at a different spot , but again the rifles found us . I think this time our position may have been given away by a fat Korean woman , who calmly stood beside a building on . the street while all this firing was going on . One of the soldiers wanted to shoot her , but I could n't be sure enough that she was a lookout . On the third attempt at the tank , we moved directly behind the building at the corner  --  so the tank should have been just on the other side of it . To get to the second floor of that store building from that back courtyard , I had to chin myself on a window ledge , then clamber in . Moving very quietly , the bazooka man and I entered a plastered room about seven by eight feet . Very cautiously , I slipped up to the window and looked around the side of it with one eye ? directly into the muzzle of the tank 's cannon , not a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I signaled to the bazooka man and pointed to a spot just at the base of the cannon , where the turret and tank body joined . The bazooka went off beside my ear . Plaster cascaded from the ceiling on our heads and around our shoulders . Concussion shook the whole building . I do n't think I 'm normally a brutal man , but I had only one thought . From the tank came the most horrible screaming I 'd ever heard  --  although I heard its equal later and under different circumstances  --  but the tank still was not on tire . I think I said , " Hit them again , " and pointed to another spot at the side of the turret . The bazooka fired and more plaster cascaded . A third time the bazooka fired , and the screaming stopped while smoke rose from the tank . It was very quiet in the street . As I 've said , time got lost this day and I had no sense of its passing  --  but now it was evening as we came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be decided . A counterattack force was organized from kitchen police and clerks to chase snipers away from the artillery area , and the guns moved toward the rear . All day , Capt . Raymond D. Hatfield , the division transportation officer , had been worrying about his supply train . All our supplies were on this train , so they could be pulled nut fast when we had to retreat again . Hatfield was trying to get the train out of Taejon , but reported that . Korean engineers had uncoupled the locomotive and fled east with it . We got on my telephone line to division headquarters , and headquarters promised to send the locomotive back . Hatfield went down to the railroad yard to meet it , but presently returned , almost beside himself . The locomotive had come into the Taejon yards , then suddenly backed away east again at full speed . Once more we called headquarters . This time they said a sniper had killed the engineer , and the locomotive had been taken out by the fireman , but they would send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as protection . The last I saw of Hatfield  --  who belonged at division headquarters , not up here in the burning town ? was when he made another trip toward the railroad yard . still refusing to leave until the train did . When American troops retook Taejon , much later , Hatfield 's body was found . He had been wounded , then bayoneted . I added his name to a list I 'd been keeping . There were about fifteen names on that list  --  men to whom I intended to award medals the moment I got a chance  --  Bronze Stars or Silver Stars for heroic action or gallantry . I even had a dozen actual medals ? all the Bronze Stars the 8th Army possessed  --  in my jeep , so I could pin them on , personally and on the spot . I knew I had been far too chintzy about awarding medals in World War ! Land it had n't been fair to the men . This time I did n't intend to make the same mistake again . ( Confirmed on Page 82 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MY THREE YEARS AS A DEAD MAN ( I.:wing ICA front Pap . 19 ) About this time , eight tanks from the let Cavalry Division came up . We organized a column of vehicles to start out under their protection . Col. Charles Beauchamp , commanding the regiment , took this group out But only moments after they left the schoolhouse we heard them in a fire fight . By dusk , Maj. Robert L. ! Poppy ) Wacilingion , executive of the regiment , suggested it was time to go . He showed me a last message he proposed to send , but I rewrote it because I thought it sounded too much like asking for rescue for me , personally . As a substitute , I wrote : Enemy roadblock eastern exit Taejon . Send armor immediately . DEA N If I 'd realized that was the last formal order I was to issue for three years , perhaps I might have phrased it better  --  one of those ringing things that somebody would remember . The only trouble was , I did n't know  --  and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . We organized the remaining headquarters vehicles into a rough column and started . But as we pulled through the city , we ran into the tail of the previous column , which had been am-hushed . Some trucks were on fire , others slewed across a street between buildings in flames . Our own infantry , on one side , was in a vicious fight with the enemy in higher positions across the street We drove through . careering between the stalled trucks . The street was a solid lane of fire  --  an inferno that singed us in spite of our speed . A block farther on , my jeep and the escort jeep roared straight past an intersection . Almost immediately , Clarke told me we 'd missed a turn . But I looked at a map and decided we should go on ahead , south and east. , on another road which might let us make more speed than the main escape route . I had to get back to my headquarters . So we went on down the road , in the general direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . We were all by ourselves . Right here 1 would like to digress a moment to tell you something about the fellow who is telling this story , so you can judge its worth . I 've spent most of my adult life trying to learn to he a decent infantry officer . I was horn in 1899 , in Carlyle . Illinois , where my father was a dentist . I went to school there and later to the University of California , where I was in the Students ' Army Training Corps as an eighteen-year-old ; and , in my spare time , a beat-pounding patrolman on the Berkeley , California , police farce . I should have received an A.B . degree in 1921 , but flunked a course in legal contracts , and so did n't get it until a year later . I never did get the doctor-of-laws degree toward which I was aiming , but I never cared too much . I 'm always disturbed by victories of technicalities over equity , and would have made a bad lawyer . Our whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in California : my mother , Elizabeth Frishe Dean , in Berkeley ; my sister , Mrs. Leonard Ver Mehr , at Antioch ; and my brother , David , at Kenwood . Our daughter , Marjorie June , is married to no Army captain , Robert Williams ; and our son , Bill , is a cadet at West . Perhaps it was my mother 's German blood beginning to tell  --  anyway , I just could n't keep away from the Army . secured a commission by examination on October 18 , 1923 , and my first post was with the 38th Infantry Regiment . at Fort Douglas , Utah . During my three years there , the most important event was that a young lady fell off a horse on her head . This was in a riding group organized to cement Army relations with Salt Lake City civilians . I 'd assigned this girl , Dorothy Welch , to the horse  --  an elderly Army crow bait that I thought nobody could arouse to enthusiasm . Somehow , though , she got him into a gallop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went into a coma from which She did n't recover for twelve days . I felt terribly responsible , and went often to her home to see her . There I met one of her friends , Mildred Dern , also of Salt Lake . That old horse , Dick , was no friend of mine , because after Miss Welch recovered and I bad started taking Mildred riding at Fort Douglas , old Dick ran away with her too . But Mildred married me , in spite of him . There followed the usual Army routine of service with troops and a lot of school courses at Fort Benning and Fort Leavenworth , among others . I 'd been lucky to make captain in 1936 and major in 1940 , when I was assigned to a series of staff jobs in Washington . I finally got what r wanted  --  another job with troops  --  in 1944 , as assistant division commander of the 44th Infantry Division . I took command in December , 1944 , while we were along the Saar River , in Europe . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . The 44th came home soon after V-E day , and never did go to Japan as planned . Instead . I went to the faculty at Fort Leavenworth , then to South Korea as military governor in October , 1947 . I held that job during the elections of 1948 , and became commander of the 7th Division when the Koreans took over their own government . In Japan , Lt. Gen. Walton Walker called me to Yokohama as chief of staff for the 8th Army . But in October , 1949 , I managed to talk him into letting me go back with troops , commanding the 24th Division , with headquarters at Kokura , Japan . I 've run through this history because it all made some sense in relation to the outbreak of the Korean war . I was an infantry officer , I knew quite a bit  --  although not so much as I thought  --  about Korean geography and people . And ours was the American unit closest when the fighting started . / do n't suppose it signifies anything , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the people who do not work  --  on the night before the war 's outbreak . The occasion was a fancy-dress ball at the Kokura Officers ' Club , so Mrs. Dean and I got out costumes I 'd brought back ! , the long white robe and stiff black hat which are standard parts of the South Korean scenery ; Mildred , a very fancy dress such as the wife of a yang-ban wears . ( Just for the record , one of the things the communists outlawed first in North Korea was the yang-ban . So we dressed up as Koreans that night , and the next morning news of the North Korean attack reached us . I told Mildred , " Well , this is a bad one . This is the beginning of World War Three . " Main elements of our division were all in Japan . Our job , outlined long before for possible emergencies in Korea , was to receive and transship refugees civilian employees , missionaries , families and other Americans . These people started coming to us by air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I 'd known in Korea when I was military governor . They had only meager belongings and were badly distraught . Women had been ordered out first , on a Norwegian ship from Inchon . But some of the men who left later , by air , arrived first . The ship did not dock on schedule . When hours dragged by , I became more and more nervous . I thought . Oh-oh , a Russian sub But we found the ship , finally , lying ? offshore in a fog . But after the refugees nothing went according to plan . I think the 24th Division gave a good account of itself in the fighting . But there is no denying that war was a nasty shock to these barracks soldiers at the beginning . Living in Japan was soft . and easy , and the rude ending hit quickly . I received orders to move the whole division to Korea , but they specified that an advance task force should be sent on ahead immediately . So I sent Task Force Smith , some 406 infantrymen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lt. Col. Charles B. ( Brad ) Smith , selected because of his South Pacific record . They were on their way to a landing field outside Pusan by July first . Task Force Smith climbed aboard the railroad at Pusan and rode northwest to report to Brig . Gen. John 14 . Church , who had been sent from Tokyo with only a headquarters force . I flet to Korea the next day in a big plan , with some of my staff and a jeep . But heavy planes had ruined the field at Pusan ; we could not land and had to go hack to Japan . I then got into a smaller plane and tried again , without jeep . We reached Pusan and transferred for Taejon . I thought I knew how Taejon looked from the air but when I signaled to an airfield below , the pilot shook his head . It was too short  --  now I 'm sure it was n't Taejon but Chonju ? so we had to fly back to Japan once more in the dark . We got about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . This time , thick clouds hung over Taejon . In desperation , we finally went all the way out to sea , down through the cloud layer , then came back up the valley to Taejon , staying under the clouds and dodging mountains , I never thought I 'd have so much trouble in getting to a war . The detailed account of the next fifteen or sixteen days belongs in military histories . But it was a period about which I was to do a great deal of thinking later , so I should write down the gist of what happened . excellent position , and I told them to stay there while the 34th Regiment shipswas choandi agn dijl ) fred them . mrn .

Somehow . t hough , I he prisoners they said they were taking never got hack where we could question them . The most demoralizing thing our men had to face was that mass of ROK soldiery all going south without any fight . The 34th moved in at Pyongtaek . Task Force Smith remained up north , at Osan . I breathed a little easier , but only for linurs . On the evening of July fifth , I heard there was fighting at Osan and we 'd lost contact with the task force . My aide and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackout . Brig . Gen. George Barth told me there still was no word from the task force , and that a patrol of the 34th had run into North Koreans . who apparently had by-passed Osan . I went back to Taejon , arriving just before dawn , and immediately plunged into a day of trying to organize our own forces and fend off ROK officers and politicians , all of whom wanted me to do something about each other  --  this one , they said , was a communist ; that one would n't light . Then I got word that men from Task Force Smith were coming out . They 'd been surrounded at Osan , but had formed a truck column and fought their way out . Over half the force , in-chiding Smith himself , came through . In the end our losses were much less than we 'd feared . I waited for the enemy to hit the 34th . But the only trouble was , the 34th didn't. wait . Maybe I did n't give orders clearly enough or somebody misunderstood . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there 's a misunderstanding . But I was astonished when I got word that afternoon that the 34th had pulled out and now was clear down past Chonan , twenty miles hack and well south of the spot where the sea anchored their flank . We had nobody on the left except some " Northwest Youth Group " people-1000 or so young , male anticommunist refugees from North Korea , armed by the south . I was so disturbed that I jumped into my jeep and rushed to a point south of Chonan ? and there the 34th was . I know I should have said right then , " Get going on back north . " But they were exhausted , and I decided to wait until morning . I said , " All right hold here until I give you some more orders . " In the morning I told them ti go north until they made contact with the enemy , and then to fight a delaying action . That was the most discouraging development of the whole two weeks of fighting . Before I was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Things got steadily worse . Col. Robert R. Martin and I had served together , and I knew the way he ran a regiment . I 'd asked Tokyo for him by name . At three e.m . on July eighth , I gave him command of the 34th . His command po-st. was south of Chonan . But when I tried to reach him at ten P.M. , his headquarters said he 'd gone up to Chonan proper to straighten out a had situation . Now Chonan was cut off and Martin was missing . Again , I did n't get much sleep . You ca n't avoid extra worry about your friends , even when men are dying all around . But about four in the morning word came that Martin had returned . The Chonan situation was better . Thal morning General Walker dew in . We rode up to see what was happening at Martin 's command post . Again he had gone up to Chonan . We drove on and reached a spot from which we could look down on the town , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire in a dozen places and a tight was going on . North Korean tanks were in the town . Colonel Martin had gathered the bazookas and was leading his men in person . They had most of the tanks on the run , but then another tank came around a corner and shot him in two from twenty-five feet . The American resistance then collapsed , and they were getting out of the town . I had , undeniably and definitely , killed one of my best friends . The first . elements of the division 's tank battalion were just coming up then . I wo n't forget General Walker with the Quail/lender of that first platoon . He stopped this young man and asked him , ' What are you going to do ? " The young lieutenant said , ? ' I 'm going in there and slug it out . " You could see this young man was resolved that he was on his way to death . He knew how little one of these light tanks could do against the heavi:ai of the communists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Now , our idea is to stop those people . We do n't go in there on the charge and slug it out . You take positions where you have the advantage , where you can fire t he first shots and still manage a delaying action . " In five minutes he gave this officer better tank instructions than you could hear in any military classroom . We still pulled back , day after day . There is small point to the rest of the detail . We established a new line on the Kum River . with the 34th and 19th regiments side by side . Finally , the 34th , spread around a bend of a small river tributary to the Kum , was once more the only regiment in actual contact with the enemy . This was just north of Taejon and I gave them orders to pull out the night of July seventeenth . My own headquarters moved out , but I stayed in the town myself . You always think you personally can do a better job than anybody else  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Taejon . The 1st Cavalry was getting close , so I decided to see if we could hold the river perimeter . We stayed until the twentieth  --  which was the day Clarke and I finallyputled out of town on the wrong road . This may be a good point to make a couple of things clear . In the fighting , I made some mistakes and I 've kicked myself a thousand times for them . I lost ground I should n't , have lost . I 'm not proud of that record and I 'm under no delusions that it was any masterly campaign . But the rest of this story perhaps should not tie told at all . No man honestly can be ashamed of the Congressional Medal of Honor . For it and for the remarkable kindness of people to me when I finally came home , I 'm humbly grateful . But I come close to shame when I think about the men who did better jobs  --  some who died doing those jobs  --  and did not get recognition . I would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the only thing I did which mattered to anybody  --  my family , perhaps a few others ? was to stay alive . Other men resisted torture , but I was n't tortured . Others bluffed the communists steadily , whereas I was lucky enough to do it only once in a while . Others starved and I was fed  --  even learned to like kemchee . Others died for a principle , but I failed in a suicide attempt . The best stories are going untold , except to the friends of the men involved . I can justify writing this only because it was an adventure ? without a hero . And because I did see the face of the enemy close up , have time to study his weaknesses and his remarkable strengths , not on the battlefield , but with men and women hack of it . I saw communism working , and it was a Frightening thing . If you do read further , you do so fairly warned .

I ought to know , I swatted 411,671 flies in three years and counted every body . There were times when I was batting Leagues . and deserved to make the big As we left Taejon , snipers fired . on us from both sides . The jeeps tried to barrel on through , but the fire blocked us again and again . At one spot a truck lay partially on its side , but the driver still slumped behind the wheel . We stopped and I ran over . The driver was dead , but under the truck were two men talking about . surrendering . o said , " We might as well . There tan t any use in this . " There were some walking wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and motioned to it and to the escort vehicle to go on . Then I started talking to the men under the truck . A communist silhouetted himself on top of a hill , so 1 grabbed an M-1 rifle and fired . I hate to admit I 'm no great shakes with an M-1 , and I do n't know whether I hit him . But he did drop , and the two men under the truck crawled out to join me . Just then an artillery half-track rumbled up . I think that was the moat heavily loaded vehicle I ever saw . So many men were in it already that we could n't get in  --  we just got on , hanging on to it . We rumbled ahead and presently caught up with my two jeeps , which were stopped . The road made a slight 5 bend here , and on it the communists had set up a roadblock ? riflemen and a machine gun at a bridge . We were under such heavy fire that we had to hit the ditch . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been left on the half-track , and my pistol had been jolted out of my holster somewhere . Clarke was in the ditch . He had been an air officer , but here he showed infantry ability . When I asked him to make an informal muster , he counted seventeen Americana . We started crawling back from the road the communist fire covered through a sweet-potato field , and finally to the bank of a little river . On the riverbank we lay in a circle . I remember that I delivered a small lecture  --  about keeping off the tops of hills , and using halazone in the river water the men were putting into their canteens , and about patience . I said we 'd have to wait until full dark to go on , and patience was very important . ( A couple of years later , I did wonder a time or two how patient a man was supposed to be . ) The group had only a few canteens  --  neither Clarke nor I carried one  --  and even fewer arms . Clarke had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pistol . He said , " I ca n't use it anyhow . " In full dark we crossed the river and started climbing the steep slope of a mountain , I was leading . It was rough going , and then Clarke worked his way up to me and said , " We have a wounded man behind us . " Clarke and I went back to help the wounded man . Two soldiers were already carrying a third between them , and another man staggered along beside . At the first opportunity Clarke used his first-aid kit to bind the man 's leg wounds , although his own shoulder wound had not been treated . This was a sandy soil , very loose ; and it was rough to carry a man between two others . I said , " Hell , get this man up on my shoulders . I can carry him easier that way by myself : ' But Dean always forgets how old he is . That carry did n't last long .

The wounded man was delirious now , drank all available water and called for more . Even though we wanted to catch the lead party , we had to stop and rest very often . During one of those rest stops , I thought I heard water running off to one side in the dark . It was just off the ridge . hut , I was sure I heard it . I started off in that direction .

I was down in a dry creek bed with very steep sides , and all I could think of was , My God , what 's happened to those people up on the hill ? I do n't know where I am . I do n't think I had walked more than twenty yards or so from the rest of the party , but I could n't tell how far I 'd run down the bank or rolled in my fall .

I crawled along the stream bottom and finally found that trickle  --  a little water just oozing out of the rocks . I scooped out a hollow with my hands and when it tilted with water , I stuck my face in and drank  --  not worrying at all shout halazone tablets . I know I then started up the hillside , perhaps on my hands and knees or just scrambling , but then I do n't know what happened next . I must have passed out , because when I became conscious again I was lying on my side  --  and an eight- or ten-man North Korean patrol was no more than ten yards from me . This was false dawn ? just a faint glow over the eastern hills  --  but even in the improved light they failed to see me . I ca n't imagine why they did n't .

Walking seemed to do something to my insides , and it was especially hard to get to my feet after I 'd been sitting down to rest . I walked a long time , but did n't get far . The trail led down to an escarpment. a sort of shelf on the side of the mountain , and then down to another . These were not high , only ten feet or so , but it was murder trying to make the steep inclines between . got down to the foot of the second when rain started to pour down . It came in torrents , and I was overcome by the desire for something to drink . I found a big flat rock , perhaps six feet across , sticking up a foot or two above the level of the ground , and lay down beside it . I stretched my handkerchief out on the rock in the pouring rain . When it . would get soaked with water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few drops at a time . I think I spent most of the night doing that .. I was still lying there in the morning when I heard a noise , like something coming down the same path I 'd used , 1 got around behind the rock and pulled my pistol , thinking it might be a North Korean . But the man who lurched into my view was an American . He had not seen me yet he was too busy making his nay down that brutal path  --  when I called to him . I said , " Who are you ? What outfit are you from ' ? " He jumped when he heard me , but sighed with relief when he saw that I , too , was an American . He said , " I 'm Lieutenant Tabor  --  Stanley Tabor ? from the Nineteenth Infantry . Who are you ? " I tried to get up from behind my rock , but , had trouble . Then I said , " Well , I 'm I he s.o , h. who 's the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battalion of the 19th Infantry which / had thrown into the line to bolster the river perimeter . In the retreat , he 'd been cut off and had started walking south , We started walking again that morning , Tabor carrying his carbine and 1 with a pistol banging against my leg . I 've enjoyed walking all my life and normally can outwalk ninny young people . But not on this day . I had to keep stopping for rest because of the pain under my ribs and in my abdomen , After each rest . Tabor would help me to my feet and we 'd make a few more yards . I said , " You go on ahead . One person can get . through a lot quicker . I 'm stove up , and there 's no use in your pooping around here . " But he 'd always say , " No , two have a better chance , " and would refuse to leave me . About one o'clock that day we found the highway again . But it was bordered by open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would see vehicles or soldiers of the North Korean People 's Army . So we kept on going south through the brush toward Kumsan . That afternoon we stumbled into a tent , put up beside a stream by a mother and two teen-age sons , refugees from Taejon . None of them could speak English , but they gave us some rice and made us understand we should stay out of sight under the canvas until dark . We got the idea that a lot , of North Koreans were in the area . Both of us got some sleep . But when we asked the family to guide us toward Yongdong , they made us understand that this town , too , had been captured by the communists . If this news was true  --  and we had to assume it was ? we were in a bad spot . I knew it would be terribly hard to get all the way east to Kumchon . We would have to pass through a defile , and the hill country around Yongdong had always been full of communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine deer country because of the many guerrillas . So I said , " We 'll have to head south toward Kumsan , then try to get to Muju , thence east to Taegu . " In other words , I thought we 'd make a big swing south , Ihen cut to t he east well below the main invasion route . That evening we started south again . But there were no stars or any other method for holding our direction , and we were n't making much time . I was still not in full control of my thinking , and there is a period which is almost blank in my memory . It may have been a day or three . But finally we did come to a small town . In a few minutes the whole town was around us . We asked for food . Someone brought us water with some kind of uncooked grain ground up in it . They also gave each of us two raw eggs . Two men in the crowd spoke some English  --  one well and one just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered them a million won ? the exchange then was about 860 to one American dollar , so this amounted to about $1100 ? if they would take us to Taegu . Even when Koreans speak English fairly well , they usually confuse figures , ? 10 drew this million-won figure in the dirt . Of course , we should have noticed that the one man who spoke English best had disappeared , but we did n't . The one who spoke less well said , " O.K. , O.K. Come with me . " He indi-cated we should come to his house to get some rest , and that he would take us toward Taegu in the morning . He led us to a house on the far edge of the village , where we took off our boots and entered an unfurnished room . The Korean sat on the floor with us , and in his very broken English asked who the village people should support . He diagrammed it : the Americans pushing one way , the North Koreans the other . He indicated it was all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his confusion much . We all went to sleep on the floor . Several hours later  --  it must have been early in the morning ? we heard a rifle shot just outside the house . At that , shot , the Korean went out one door just like a rabbit out of a box . Tabor said , " This is it , " and reached for his carbine . Outside , a voice called , " Come out , Americans ! Come out , Americans ! We will not kill you ! We are members of the People 's Army ! Come out , Americans ! " The English was the beat I 'd ever heard a Korean speak . But we did n't " came out . " I said , " Come on , get your hoots on , " and we both did , in a hurry . Then we went out another door  --  away from the rifle shot ? and jumped into some high weeds which were right beside the house , then crawled up a little bill . I said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than I can cover you with a pistol . I 'll be the point . " I remember I also said , " I 'm not going to surrender , Tabor . There wo n't be any surrender for me . " He said , " That 's the way I feel too . " There were more shots . They heard us in the weeds and shot at the noise . Then we almost crawled right into a man on the hill , and saw others in that direction . So we reversed our course and went right back to the village . The village was in pandemonium  --  everybody in the street and everybody yelling . We went right through town , right past those Korean civilians , but none of them did anything . Crossing back lots and skirting around hoiiaea we finally came out at the other edge of town , into a paddy . These paddies are built in small cells with high dikes between . We hit the rice and the water , crawling on our bellies and using our elbows to inch us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of soldiers on a dike almost paralleling our route , but they had not seen us . We crossed one dike and another , going up and over when they were n't look-ing . I led out and got across the third dike . Then , from the middle of that cell , I looked hack . Tabor was n't there  --  and I was n't to see another American for three years . This is the first of a eerie , by General Dean . In next week 's Post he tells the thrilling story of a chase  --  his dramatic attempt to return to American lines .
