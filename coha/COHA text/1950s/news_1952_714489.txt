Lance , 56 , advertising manager for the Sentinel Radio corporation , settled down for a few drinks in his second floor apartment in the Evanshire hotel , 860 Hinman ay. , Evanston . His companion , Clarence , a canary , joined him and twittered contentedly on the arm of a nearby chair . But after awhile Clarence decided things were pretty dull . When Lance opened the window , Clarence took off into the night . Lance , in his smoking jacket , dashed out of the hotel in hot pursuit . He hailed a passing cab driver , Edward Sholin , 1705 Jonquil ter. , and explained his plight . Sholin , with the deep understanding of human nature peculiar to cab drivers , swerved the spotlight of his cab , a couple of times , motioned Lance inside , and moved off .
