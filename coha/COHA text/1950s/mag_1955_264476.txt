Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> At a London rally of Britain 's Temperance Council of Christian Churches , twinkly-eyed Dr. Geoffrey Fisher , Archbishop of Canterbury , carefully explained why he is only a 99 44/100% teetotaler . Though voicing distress about the " amount of pressure to have something " to drink at present-day social gatherings , Dr. Fisher forthrightly said that he tries not to offend hostesses who serve spirits . But those who place all manner of grog before him are treated to no crass bacchanalian spectacle.When the festivities wind up , the liquor level in the Archbishop 's glass is never lowered by more than " one-sixteenth of an inch . " Confessed Slight Sipper Fisher : " It is no virtue on my part . It happens that I do n't like it . " <P> After grittily ignoring his sneezes and sniffles for several days , West Germany 's Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , 79 , was bedded down in Bonn with bronchitis , a fever of 104 , a later complication of bronchial pneumonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved , " but his countrymen were chillingly reminded that der Alte can not lead them forever . <P> India 's aging ( 69 ) Nizam of Hyderabad indicated that he intends to stay put there , even though next year 's dissolution of his realm will put him out of a job . As unemployed potentates go , the adamant Nizam will get on pretty well . When Hyderabad agreed to union with India in 1949 , the Nizam wangled some lofty guarantees of the style to which he is accustomed . Items : the continued right to be called His Exalted Highness , a taxfree privy purse of $1 million a year , plus a yearly $500,000 to run his menage and another half million partially to make up his loss of income from his sprawling estates taken over by India . Although the Nizam already has an estimated pile of roughly $500 million in cash , jewels and three palaces , the annual petty cash will come in handy to maintain his three wives , 42 concubines , 33 children and some 3,400 palace guards and flunkeys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated hotfoots from New Delhi , official hints that he ought to pack up his whole shebang and trundle out of Hyderabad to his flossy mansion in Bombay . India 's Premier Nehru himself has penned some politely worded eviction notes to the Nizam , but for reasons beyond India 's tottery postal system to explain away , the Nizam never seems to get them-even though he is the only Nizam in Hyderabad . Settling down to enjoy the winter last week , His Exalted Highness murmured languidly : " Come what may , I am not leaving . " <P> In his customary proletarian mufti , Red China 's pudgy Chairman Mao Tse-tung , looking like a reasonably good insurance risk at his age ( 68 ) , emerged from Peking to make an inspection tour along the Yellow River , where the Communists say they are undertaking monumental flood-control projects .
