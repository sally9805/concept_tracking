txt An almost audible sigh of relief went over the nation when news came on Friday that President-elect Eisenhower had completed his visit to Korea and was safely on his way home . As far as possible the timing of the trip had been . kept secret , but many people must have noticed that fresh photographs of the General ceased to appear in the newspapers and that there was a slight ambiguity in the communiques from Morningside Heights . One could not help fearing some untoward event . The President-elect put out from Guam into the teeth of what promised to be heavy weather , but reports indicate that he is a good sailor and that , with the more adventurous part of his journey behind him , he was able to settle down to a few days of quiet , hard work . No one becomes an expert about a country or a war in three days . Yet General Eisenhower did accomplish much by his visit to Korea .

" All along the way the President-elect showed himself a kindly , modest man who could without pretentiousness eat an outdoor lunch with three private soldiers and who went out of his way to express sympathy for troops who through a misunderstanding had had a long wait in the cold on the day of the review . There was some skepticism in this country as to whether the Korean trip was wise and fruitful . We think now that most Americans will admit that it was . The President-elect , as he said , went to " get a grasp of the feeling in this part of the world . " He seems to have achieved that end , and in doing so has again revealed himself well and favorably to his countrymen .                @ @ @ @ @
