One of the toughest problems in biology is how to take a microscope picture of a healthy living cell . Most tissue cells , whether animal or vegetable , are transparent to ordinary light . To make them visible they must be stained , and the stain either kills them or sickens them . They can be seen with special ultraviolet microscopes , but strong ultraviolet is also deadly to cells ; only the picture of a tiny corpse appears in the photomicrograph . <P> Dr. Robert Barer of Oxford University , England , is sure he has licked the problem . He uses monochromatic ( single wave length ) ultraviolet at an intensity which is too low to hurt the cell . It is also too feeble to make a useful impression on a fluorescent screen or photographic plate , so Barer focuses the invisible image , enlarged with a reflecting microscope to about three inches in diameter , on a screen . Then , by means of a rapidly revolving mirror , he " scans " ' the image , throwing the ultraviolet light from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint glimmer of ultraviolet is thus changed into a fluctuating electric current that is powerful enough to form a bright curve on the face of a cathode-ray tube . <P> A series of these curves taken from successive slices of the image can be turned into patterns of light and shade , and built into a picture in ultraviolet of the still-healthy cells . But Dr. Barer is after bigger game . The curves show how much of the ultraviolet is absorbed by each region in the cell . These figures , in turn , give a strong hint of what chemicals are present in each of the cell 's parts . Dr. Barer hopes that his apparatus will allow biologists to watch fragile , transparent cells as they live their normal lives and to chart the chemical reactions that take place inside them . When science can take a closer look at living cells , it will know much more about the delicate , mysterious chemical processes that are called life .                   @ @
