txt Now that the immediate question of commutation for convicted murderer Henry P. Arsenault , Jr. , is out of the way , Massachusetts can move ahead with its long-range study of the abolition of the capital penalty in the Bay Stale . Significantly , at the very hour yesterday that the Massachusetts Executive Council was voting 5-4 to commute Arsenault 's sentence , the special study commission on capital punishment set up by the Legislature held its first public hearing in the State Houk This timing , although not premeditated , was " fortuitous , " one commission member said this morning . " It clears the air , " he commented , " and will get much of the emotionalism around one individual case out of the way , so we can go ahead with our investigations . " Noticeable Trend The trend away from capital punishment in the Bay State is noticeable . During the past 10 years only 15 convicted murderers have been given capital sentences in Massachusetts , and in all 15 cases , Bay State Governors and Executive Council members have voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tics in with a national , and even an international , movement away from the capital penalty  --  clearly observable during the past quarter of a century . But individual cases , such as the Arsenault one , generate much emotion and often do not permit a clearly calm , and cool study of the moral , legal , correctional , and social aspects of capital punishment . Principal speaker at yesterday 's hearing was Arthur T. Lyman , Massachusetts Commissioner of Correction , who is a long-time foe of the capital penalty . He said he opposes this form of punishment because of what he called " the lengthy period between conviction and execution . " Two-Year Delay " In many cases , " Mr. Lyman observed , " this amounts to more than two years during which time the prisoner is under great mental strain and is rarely visited by prison officials . " He added that he does not consider the capital penalty a deterrent against murder . Mr. Lyman commented that " electrocution is a tough ordeal , " but noted that each of the 14 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference for death in the chair to life imprisonment . " It was evident that part of their reasoning , he said , was based on the long wait they suffered in the so-called " death row . " Two other Department of Correction officials , Edwin Powers , deputy commissioner in charge of personnel for 18 months , and Nelson N. Cochrane , director of the classification division , stated their opposition to capital punishment during the three-hour afternoon hearing . Change in Attitude Mr. Powers gave a brief history of the capital crimes laws from 1630 , explaining that 25 crimes calling for the capital penalty have been reduced to one  --  murder . Among these were piracy and arson . He said that " changing times have sometimes called for a change of attitude . " But Mr. Powers told Representative Alexander J. Celia ( D ) of Medford that he felt the capital sentence was not a deterrent to murder . " Essentially , " he added , " my basic objection is the sanctity of life which should not be taken even by the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to the commission in which he said that capital punishment has not been proved to reduce the murder rate : it is a " primitive , barbaric operation " inconsistent with the level of culture and civilization in the Bay State ; it is " man 's attempt to usurp " powers not belonging to him ; it is irrevocable and " a mistake which can not be rectified " ; and it " lowers the dignity and honor of the commonwealth since it defies the principles of justice and statesmanship . " Following the public hearing , the study commission went . into executive session . Representative Charles W. Capraro ( D ) of Boston , commission chairman , said that two more public hearings will be held , Nov. 18 and 25 . The Nov. 18 meeting will be devoted to testimony by phychiatrists who practice privately , The Nov. 25 hearing will be given over to lawyers who have served as counsel in homicide cases . Meanwhile , reaction to the commutation of Arsenault 's capital sentence has been swift and varied , Council Reverses Vote Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not conceive that clemency was merited in this instance , This applies in like measure to my previously stated conviction that Arse= nault 's two accomplices in this murder . were not deserving of consideration . " On the other side , Mrs. Herbert Ehrmann of the Massachusetts Council for the Abolition of the Death Penalty , commented that " our state does not want to take the life of a human being needlessly . " ? She said that Arsenault 's life " had been spared " because Governor Furcolo and four councilors " placed humanity and enlightenment before vengeance . " The Executive Council vote yesterday afternoon came on the basis of an 11th-hour plea for commutation by Arsenault 's attorneys . The nine-member council , called into session by Governor Furcolo , met in New Bedford , at the home of Councilor Joseph P. Dupont ( D ) . In the 5-4 vote for commutation 111 .. Dupont changed his mind and Councilor Michael J. Favulli ( D ) of Worcester who did not vote last month also voted in favor of commutation . The five councilors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dupont and Favulliwere Joseph R. Crimmins ( D ) of Somerville , Raymond F. Sullivan ( D ) of Springfield , and Lt. Gov . Robert F. Murphy ( D ) . Voting against ' commutation were CouncilOrs Patrick J. ( D ) of Dorchester , Charles J. Gabried ( R ) of Hingham , Augustus G. Means ( R ) of Essex , and Christian A. Herter . Jr. , ( R ) of Newton . Furcolo Present Governor Furcolo , although he did not take part in the voting , was present at the meeting and has long indicated his inclination to support commutation . In this regard . he is much like his t WO immediate predecessors in the Governor 's chair who have urged commutation of all capital sentences to come before them over the past 10 years . The two previous Governors were Paul A. Dever ( D ) and Christian A. Herter ( R ) . The latter is father of Mr. Herter who voted against commutation . Arsenault 's two accomplices in the slaying of Cambridge attorney Merrill P. Lovinger in 1933 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October Executive Council meeting . Arsenault now joins the pair  --  Arthur L. Devlin and Russell P. LeBlanc ? as lifers in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole .
