Among variegated practitioners of talk-it-out treatment for emotional problems , Chicago 's Psychologist Carl Ransom Rogers , 55 , has long been a maverick . He calls his method " client-centered therapy , " tries manfully to define it : " We see therapy as an experience , not in intellectual terms . We treat the client as a person , not as an object to be manipulated and directed . " Snorts a Chicago psychoanalyst of neo-Freudian persuasion : " Rogers ' method is unsystematic , undisciplined and humanistic . Rogers does n't analyze and does n't diagnose . We have no common ground . " To Rogers that is fine . <P> Illinois-born Carl Rogers started at the University of Wisconsin as an agriculture major , finished with a B.A. in history . At Columbia University 's Teachers College he plunged into psychology , emerged with a Ph.D . and headed for Rochester , where he worked with juvenile delinquents for twelve years . Rogers did not realize that he had developed a distinctive method of treating patients until , in 1940 , he described his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . By 1945 he had established himself at the University of Chicago as professor of psychology and set up a counseling center in a drab , three-story house on Drexel Avenue , half a block west of the campus . To the center trooped clients ( Rogers avoids the term " patient " ) of all ages , from all walks of life . It has been going full blast ever since . <P> At top capacity ( 400 clients a year ) the center has operated with two dozen staff counselors ( all Ph.D.s in psychology from the university faculty ) . Each counselor takes seven or eight clients a week for two or three 45-minute visits each . Most clients are so disturbed that they have difficulty carrying on in their occupations , though not so severely ill that they need hospitalization . <P> Without Dreams . While giving credit to Freud as a pioneer , Rogers vigorously resists the tendency of analysts to worship the father-figure of psychoanalysis , and the parallel tendency to put the theory and the method of treatment ahead of all else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rogers may have exaggerated the differences between his method and that of other therapists who follow Freud but with modifications . Radical Rogers likes to talk about " treatment with no couches , no dream interpretations . " <P> As Rogers describes his method : " The therapist has been able to enter into an intensely personal and subjective relationship with this client-relating not as a scientist to an object of study , not as a physician expecting to diagnose and cure , but as person to person . The therapist has been able to let himself go in understanding this client , satisfied with providing a climate which will free the client to become himself . "
