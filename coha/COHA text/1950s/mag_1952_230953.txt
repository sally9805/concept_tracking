Canada 's pioneer hunter of Communists retired last week . Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent John Leopold had spent seven years ( 1921-28 ) as an undercover agent in the Canadian Communist Party , had helped convict eight Communist leaders of sedition in 1931 and presented the chief evidence against the Red espionage ring in 1946 . Last week John Leopold let fly against the " apathy , indifference and complacency " of the Canadians who feel that Communists are less dangerous now because party membership , has dropped . Said he : " You ca n't gauge a potential fifth column in terms of numerical strength . The Communists have stripped away their dead wood and are more dangerous now than ever . "
