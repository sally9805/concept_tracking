txt Peering at photographs snapped at 13.000 feet up in the sky , Massachusetts conservation experts are taking stock of the state 's vegetation , acre by acre , right down to Farmer 's apple orchard . They are working on an ambitious project which by the end of spring will provide a picture of just how extensive woods , meadows , and inhabited areas are , the types of trees these woods contain , how tall they are , and how thick they grow . Already more than 75 per cent of the Bay State has been mapped this way . Describing vegetation in areas as small as 8 to 10 acres , the project is believed to be the most complete and detailed in the United States . Turning into aerial detectives saves these experts thousands of hours hitherto spent tramping thorugh the country , which has been the traditional method of determining what is growing where and how . ( Three-Dimensional View Their basic material consists of hundreds of aerial photograhphs which reduce the state from areas of 912 square miles each to glossies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlap , each pair of photos presents two views of the same area taken from differing points in the photographing airplane 's flight path . When viewed through the stereoscope , the two pictures merge into a three-dimensional bird's-eye view which makes trees and buildings , valleys and hills , stand out in lifelike realism . The young man who is able to tell the story of Bay State vegetation at a glance through the stereoscope is Lester Garvin , leading staff member of the Massachusetts Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit which administers the project . Its quarters are located on the campus of the University of Massachusetts here . He has developed this ability through the past two years of the project in which he has painstakingly compared his photogrammetric findings with the real thing outdoors . Detailed Skillfully At first , Mr. Garvin used to spend seven days driving and walking through the countryside for every day of photo scanning in the laboratory . Now he stays at his desk eight days for every one day he travels around spat checking the land . After a look at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cryptic pronouncements as " HS 5 A. " He follows up by penciling his findings into the area on the photo he is inspecting , tracing its borders carefully . The symbol " HS 5 A , " broken down into conservation language , means : A mixture of hardwood trees ( H ) and softwoods ( S ) with hardwoods predominating and varying in height between 81 and 100 feet , with good stocking or density of growth . Next to this spot , he may mark ** spelling out to the trained interpreter that this is a land covered by softwoods ( S ' , less than 20 feet tall ( 1 ) , with a " crown closure " of 51 to 80 per cent in an abandoned field or pasture ( F ) . After covering the photograph with hundreds of black pencil symbols inside 4undreds of small and large areas , Mr. Garvin passes his work ont to another young man who transfers the photo to the scale of a standard map issued by the United States Geological Survey , by means of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this map , it goes on to the man who , through a system of superimposed dots , determines the area size of each vegetation type and then colors each category differently . The multicolored map makes it easier for him to add up the 72 different combinations of land cover and tabulate them . Finally . the maps are photo-stated . One hundred copies of each of the 183 maps will be available when the project is finished . Useful to Many Groups As word of the project has spread , lumber companies , soil conservationists , state foresters , urban planners , and wildlife experts have become interested . In fact it was the field of fish and wildlife study which started off the program . Dr. Sheldon , a wildlife specialist , wanted to make a survey of how many deer and pheasants there are in Massachusetts . Animals choose their habitat . To find out which animals could be expected in a given area , it was necessary to determine the species , size , and height of existing trees and shrubs .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
