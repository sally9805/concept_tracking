ON MY OWN CONCLUSION Of Sievenson , Truman and Kennedy Ihave been intensely interested in political affairs most of my adult life , from the time of the Republican Bull Moosers to the day of the Democratic Eggheads , and I have been able to study at firsthand the successful as well as the unsuccessful campaigns of some of the ablest leaders of our time . My own participation in political campaigns was interrupted after the death of my husband in 19+5 , partly because I became a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations and took great pains not to mix politics with my official duties . I felt that the questions we were dealing with at the United Nations under the leadership of Ambassador Warren Austin , a Republican , were of greatest importance to our country 's world position and should not he approached from a partisan point of view . In I952 it was my opinion that Governor Stevenson would probably make one of the best Presidents we ever had , but I also believed that it was practically impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero worship surrounding . General Eisenhower , I did make a speech on the United Nations at the Democratic convention that year at the request of President Truman , and I came out for Governor Stevenson , but I did not intend to be active in the campaign and / was not . Why , then , did I re-enter politics in 195G ? For one thing , I was out of the United Nations delegation by that time and I had no feeling that as a private citizen I was barred from taking part in a political campaign . In addition , I believed as strongly as before that Adlai Stevenson would make a good President . After his defeat in 1952 he had taken a trip around the world to study conditions and , during my own world travels , I had been greatly interested in the impression he had made on foreign statesmen . Again and again , they told me that Mr. Stevenson was the kind of man who listened , who wanted to learn all the facts . I came to the conclusion that it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening and if we did not try to ram our own ideas down other people 's throats . After Governor Stevenson had traveled around the world and made a special journey to study African problems , he came to call on me one day to talk about whether he should again seek the Democratic nomination fur President . He is a very intelligent man , but he is also a humble man and there were questions he was trying to resolve in his own mind . " Do n't you feel , " he asked , in reference to the coming , national convention , " that there arc others who would do better than I as leader of the party ? " I pointed out that perhaps the most difficult problems of the day were in the field of international relations , and I added , " I can not think of anyone else who has the ability to do the job you could do in meeting the most vital needs of today . " But I could tell there was some other question he really wanted to ask inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Franklin had the advantage of getting to know all of the people of the area at an early age . He rode his pony everywhere , with or without his father , and he talked with all kinds of neighbors and friends . Later , he drove his automobile all over the district in political campaigns as a young man . He listened to the people and , most important of all , he got the " feel " of the people . You might say that he " felt " their attitudes . This , however , was a knowledge and a feeling of the country people . Later , he had to make an effort to achieve the same relationship to city people and their problems . I remember when , before we were married , I was working at the Rivington Street settlement house in New York City and Franklin called for me there late one afternoon . I was n't ready to go with him because there was a sick child in my class and I had to see that she was taken home . Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child to a slum area not far away , and Franklin went up three flights to the tenement rooms in which the family lived . It was not a pleasant place and 1 could see Franklin looking around in surprise and horror . It was the first time , I think , that he had ever really seen a slum , and when he got back to the street he drew a deep breath of fresh air . " My God , " he whispered , " I did n't know people lived like that . " I told Governor Stevenson that I thought he would not he making an error if he got a small automobile and traveled leisurely in various sections of the country . I suggested that in each arca he should be accompanied by a man who knew the local people , and that he should talk to them and find out how they were living and what they were thinking . " You should stay in each area , " I added , " until you can feel what they are feeling . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I can ever do that . " As it turned out , he did n't try . Or perhaps his advisers did n't let him try . I suppose that in modern political campaigning it is becoming more and more difficult really to get to the people , to let them see their candidates face to face ; old to enable the candidates to draw strength and ideas from the people . In the future , there doubtless will be more and bigger television appearances by presidential candidates and fewer whistle-slop train tours of thecountry . But my opinion is that nothing can really take the place of whistle-stop appearances bccausc voters will always want actually to see the men for whom they vote . Of course , some candidates make more votes by whistle-stop appearances than others . Franklin enjoyed such campaigning , hut , more important , he got a great deal out of it . Seeing the people , being close to large crowds was important for him and gave him ideas . It did much to help him know the needs and the mood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Stevenson did not have the same easy feel of political crowds , and it seems to me that President Eisenhower gets nothing at all from such campaign appearances . I had , of course , urged Governor Stevenson to run , but I did not expect to take an important part in political affairs and decided to go to Europe with my two grandsons at the time of the Democratic national convention . To my surprise , this horrified sonic of my friends . " It ' you fail to attend the convention . " one of them said . " everybody will think you have changed your mind about supporting Adlat . You must be there . " So , finally . I sent my grandsons off alone on the boat and arranged to spend a couple of days at the Chicago convention before flying to Europe . When 1 arrived at the Chicago airport 1 was met by several supporters of Governor Stevenson who were upset . They hurried me to an automobile and , instead of going directly to my hotel , said they would drive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most important thing going on was that , while I was en route to Chicago . former President Truman , who had begged Mr. Stevenson to run in 1952 , had come out in favor of the nomination of Gov . Averell Harriman , of New York . Icertainly was not thrilled by this news for various reasons . President Truman always had been especially considerate toward me . I had reported to him personally after the various meetings of the United Nations and I learned that he had a remarkable understanding of the office and duties of the President . He was a student of the Constitution and it was important to our nation that he was a jealous guardian of the ideas of the founding fathers . I felt that he had to make more than his share of big decisions as President and that he made very fess mistakes in times of crisis . The mistakes he did make were human mistakes in smaller thing  --  the mistakes all of us make in our everyday lives . But one of the sad things about being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are permitted to a President the quality of complete , unquestioning loyalty to friends , so admirable in private life is not permissible for the Chief Executive . That morning in Chicago , however , I was thinking of President Truman 's great ability as a campaigner and I was dismayed by the idea of publicly pitting my political judgment against his . Finally I was told that I was going not to my hotel but to a press conference . When we drove to the hotel where the newspaper people were waiting , I had to face more reporters and more cameras than I had ever seen before I was fearful of the ordeal of justifying my judgment in opposition to President Truman . but actually it turned out to be no ordeal at all . I said , as simply and frankly as possible , what I believed and it was no more difficult than an ordinary press conference . The reporters , of course , made as much as possible of my opposition to President Truman because it is more interesting to write about disagreements than about routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had previously asked President and Mrs. Truman to luncheon that day . Mrs. Truman could not come , but immediately after my press conference . I met the former President in the grill of my hotel . The reporters scented another story . Were we going to make a deal ? In no time at all , newspapermen had taken over a large table about three feet from my elbow . They did n't get much to write , even if they had keen ears . We talked about everything except the convention until we had finished luncheon , and then our differences were mentioned only indirectly . " I hope you will understand that whatever action I take is because I think I am doing the right thing , " President Truman said . " Of course , " 1 replied . " I know you will act as you believe is right , and I know you will realize that I must do the same . " President Truman nodded and grinned . " What I want to do is make this convention do some real thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had gone to my hotel room , l felt that 1 was a fish out of water and that I really had nothing to do at this convention . Hut I did attend a reception Governor Stevenson gave in my honor and I accompanied h:m on visits to various state delegations to seek their support . I saw ' many persons in my room , attended a luncheon for women delegates and went before the Platform Committee twice to speak on civil rights and education . Paul Butler , the Democratic national chairman , also asked me to speak briefly to the convention . When I arrived there was such pandemonium that I do n't believe any speaker could have been heard , with the possible exception of Gov . Frank Clement , of Tennessee , whose keynote address prosed that he had a strong voice . However , w hat I said could be heard over radio and television ? and later many persons were kind enough to say that my words gained considerable attention in the contest for delegates . In any event , I was pleased when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the vice-presidential nomination between Sen. Estes Kefauscr and Sen. John Kennedy , a friend of Senator Kennedy came to me with a request for support . I replied I did not feel I could do so because Senator Kennedy had avoided taking a position during the controversy oser Sen. Joseph NIcCarthy 's methods of investigation . Senator Kennedy was in the hospital when the Senate condemned Senator McCarthy and , of course , could not record his position . But later , when he returned to the Senate , reporters asked him how he would have voted and he failed to express an opinion on McCarthyism . " Oh , that was a long time ago , " the senator 's friend told me . " He was unable to cote and it is all a thing of the past . It should not have anything to do with the present situation . " I replied that I thought it did . " I think McCarthyism is a question on which public officials must stand up and be counted , " 1 added . " I still have not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure of the political future of anyone who does not willingly state where he stands on that issue . " Later , Senator Kennedy came to see me . I told him exactly the same thing . He replied in about the words he had previously used in talking to reporters , saying that the McCarthy condemnation was " so long ago " that it did not enter the current situation . But he did not say where he stood on the issue and I did not support him . I did not stay in Chicago for the balloting on the vice-presidential nominee , but flew back to New York the day before my plane left for Europe . That evening I had for dinner several young people who had come from Nottingham , England , on an annual scholarship established in honor of Franklin . It was a confused evening because the tight on civil rights was still going on at the convention and I talked on the telephone with various persons in Chicago at frequent intervals . It all seemed utterly unreal and unrealistic , because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my understanding , but my young English guests were deeply interested . On the day I flew to Europe I felt a sense of great relief at leaving politics behind . I would be away three weeks and then , I thought , I would return to keep a number of lecture engagements and perhaps take some quiet role in the presidential campaign . It did n't work out that way . The two months after my return proved to be among the most hectic in my life , because I ended up doing far more than I had expected in the campaign , and I had to keep my lecture dates at the same time . In connection with the campaign , I would like to make clear that I do not believe I qualify as an Egghead . I always remember the time when a young man made a study of American columnists for his college thesis and concluded that a reader should have at least two years of college to understand the columns of Walter Lippmann and Arthur Krock . But , he added , you need only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I am not an Egghead , but I am in favor of Eggheads if that means the application of our best intellects to the problems of government . I believe most voters feel the same way , and I do not think that the description of Governor Stevenson 's advisers  --  or some of them  --  as Eggheads was detrimental to his campaign . 1 do n't believe the voters want their candidates to be dumb . Let me cite a couple of Egghead ideas that were bitterly attacked by the Republicans during the campaign . First , the question of abolishing the draft . We need a small career army , but since 1956 it has become more and more obvious that drafting young men for a big standing army is unwise and unfair . The draft takes too long a time out of a young man 's life at an important time . A big standing army is obsolete , costly and not what we want . We need a well-paid , well-trained professional atomic army with a big reserve of trained citizens . If young men received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of training each year for the next ten years , our system would be more in keeping with the times . And I think girls should receive similar periods of training in civil defense and other emergency duties . During the 1956 campaign I always got a warm response from audiences when I discussed this problem . Governor Stevenson did not generally get a good reaction to the same subject , but it is noteworthy that since then the Republican Administration has been forced to move more and more toward consideration of adjustments in the draft system . Another Democratic issue in the campaign was the continued test explosion of atomic bombs . This was derided by the Republican leaders as just an Egghead idea , hut , as everybody knows , it has since become a problem of great concern to people everywhere . Of course , I believed there were numerous other reasons why Governor Stevenson should have been elected or why the Eisenhower Administration should not have been re-elected . I thought , and I still think , that a good business executive does not necessarily make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen necessarily make for good government . A businessman needs certain qualities-for success ; a government official needs a wide variety of qualities and some quite different ones . He can not really be successful unless he has a knowledge of people and politics , and there is no doubt that a number of Eisenhower appointees had to learn this in a slow , difficult manner . Often businessmen go into government with the idea that they will be the men at the top and that their orders will be carried out . That is probably the correct approach in business . but they soon find that in government it is necessary to persuade others that what they want to do is best . Unless Congress goes along with them , they ca n't get results . President Eisenhower evidently felt he could establish an administration in the pattern of big business , but such an approach to the complexities of government is not necessarily either democratic or successful  --  as I believe he has discovered . In the same way , I do n't believe that because a man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to direct the Department of State . Outsiders like myself , of course , do not have all of the facts at their command in regard to international affairs , but surely it was blundering rather than planning that carried us into the mess in which we found ourselves in 1956 ? and still find ourselves  --  in the Middle East . Secretary Dulles served in all but two of the United Nations Assemblies in which I served , but he was then the ranking Republican , or minority , member . l often observed that he was rarely inclined to take a stand , to say that this was right or that was wrong . I thought little of it at that time because I supposed it was due to the fact that he represented the minority party and thus felt he was not in a position to enforce his views . Since then I have changed my mind as to why he shied away from decisions . Now I feel he just does n't like to make himself responsible for a definite position , right or wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , also the reason he has not come to the defense of loyal public servants in his department when they were under bitter and often unfair attack . And naturally it has led to low morale in the State Department . I might add here that I do n't believe there is much question that Vice President Richard Nixon will succeed Mr. Eisenhower as party leader , regardless of the opposition of some Republicans . I regard Mr. Nixon as a very able and dangerous opportunist , but since 1952 he has learned a great deal . He now knows the importance of gaining the confidence of the people , and he has worked hard at it and made progress . This still does not make me believe that he has any strong convictions . I remarked earlier that I did not believe President Eisenhower profits from such contacts as he has with crowds . I believe he also misses a great deal because of his disinclination , as frequently reported in the press , to read the daily newspapers . As 1 understand it , he prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefed orally on the news . That , I suppose , is a military habit . But I do not believe it is an effective system for the Chief Executive of a great and divergent country to form opinions on the basis of what his assistants think is the important part of the news . I remember that when Louis Howe was an adviser at the White House he was ill for a long period , but he received daily newspapers from all parts of the country and read them carefully in bed . He not only knew what was important news , but he knew the different points of view held in various sections of the country or by people in different economic circumstances . Almost always when I was starting on a trip , Louis would ask me to come and see him . He would look over my itinerary and say , " Now in this city you will find people are thinking about flood control " Or in some other city about something else . He could tell me in advance how each audience I might face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such knowledge is of great importance to the President because it enables him to understand the issues of the day in terms of how they affect the people . One of the important duties of the President  --  and one that the Republican administration neglects  --  is to be the educator of the public on national problems . Most people do not have the time or inclination to inform themselves fully on the complex and perhaps seemingly remote problems that must be settled by government . But , if he knows the issues and explains them clearly , the President is in a position to make the people aware of what must be decided and to make them feel their responsibility as citizens in reaching a decision . Without such education of the public , democracy can become a dangerous kind of government because voters are called upon to make decisions or to support decisions without having sufficient knowledge of the factors involved . I have said a great deal here about the Republicans and not much about the Democrats . I think there are many able young men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in selecting a strong presidential nominee in 1960 , but the next national convention will be guided by much that is still to happen and I would hesitate now to try to guess who might emerge . In fact , I hope very much that 1 will have no particular preference or feeling that some one person must be supported in another campaign because my enthusiasm for Governor Stevenson in 1956 led me into a period of such intense activity that I have no desire to try it again . To get back to the subject of that campaign , I had gone late in September to Oregon to do anything I could in behalf of Sen. Wayne Morse 's race for re-election to the Senate  --  this time as a Democrat instead of on the Republican ticket . I had to work my political appearances into a tight schedule so l could also keep my lecture engagements , often in distant cities . It was hectic , and 1 will cite my schedule for a few days on the Pacific Coast just to show what I mean by that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-sixth , after an all-night flight from New York . I went to the home of Congresswoman Nan Honey-man and took advantage of the chance to sleep a little before lunch . That afternoon I went to a television studio for a fifteen-minute interview and then to a cocktail party of a political character and then to a dinner in my honor attended by a thousand persons . I do n't remember , but the record shows I talked on conservation and several other issues . At 9:30 P.M. , Senator Morse and I went on the radio for fifteen minutes , and then rushed to a reception at the Masonic Temple . At 11:00 P.M. , 1 made a recording , to be broadcast later , with four high-school students . When I got back to Mrs. Honey-man 's I talked for a while with her guests , but 1 soon had to go to bed . The next morning not long after , eight o'clock I got on a plane and flew to San Francisco . There I borrowed a stenographer and wrote two newspaper columns before going to Oakland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor at a dinner at the Athens Club , where my dinner partners changed every ten minutes because the people giving the dinner wanted me to talk politics to a maximum number of guests . I got back to San Fran cisco late that night and was up at seven o'clock the next morning to catch a plane for Los Angeles . The plane had mechanical difficulties and the trip was delayed two hours . throwing my schedule into confusion . It had been planned for me to introduce Governor Stevenson over the television for a speech he was making that night in Milwaukee , but I also was scheduled to go to San Diego to appear on a television program , hold a news conference and attend a reception . Despite the delay in my schedule , the political managers awaiting me at Los Angeles were planning to carry out the program in some way , but I got a little tired and temperamental , and told them it was impossible and that I would not make the television introduction of Governor Stevenson . Far behind time , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-hour speech , and then to a press conference and a tea , and then on to a reception where there were at least a thousand persons on somebody 's lawn . I had hardly walked across the lawn when a breathless messenger arrived to say that all was in readiness for me to make the introduction of Governor Stevenson ! I accepted my fate and was rushed with a police escort to a studio where the script of my introductory speech was ready for me . The studio directors had hoped there would be time for me to go over the script , have make-up put on and do a rehearsal before the television program started . They tried nervously to rush me into these preliminaries , but I observed that I had a little time to spare , so I demanded a stenographer and took her into a dressing room , where I dictated two more newspaper columns . The studio directors kept watching the dressing-room door and wondering when I would reappear . To their surprise I emerged promptly at 4:45 P.M. and , while the make-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its final form and was ready to go on at 5:30 P.M. I am glad that I learned long ago the kind of discipline that enables me to avoid sitting on the edge of my chair and cnewing my fingernails in such a situation , because I felt that was what the television studio people had been doing while they waited for me . I had time to hear only the first sentences of Governor Stevenson 's speech before dashing out to the airport to get aboard a private plane for San Diego . We did not arrive there until approximately the time I was supposed to be appearing on another television program for a debate with Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel , of California . We lost no time in racing to the television station and , fortunately , I arrived just as the Republican senator was concluding his seven-minute speech . I walked in , the announcer introduced me in ten words and I began my seven-minute speech . 1 do n't suppose the listening audience knew I had barely made it in time . From the studio I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed reception where some two thousand persons went through the receiving line . The confusion was so great that the crowd alfnost crushed me against a stand before the police leaped to my rescue . At 10:30 P.M. I was at the airport again and caught a plane to Los Angeles . An hour later , I was happy to lie back in the seat of another airplane  --  headed for New York with my shoes off ! That was just a sample of what happened to me during the 1956 campaign . Later there were a good many other days almost as crowded . There was , too , the night I learned that vanity is a mistake during a political campaign . I attended a dinner of about a thousand people at Clarksburg , West Virginia , and I foolishly wore some rather nice-looking but uncomfortable shoes . That might not have been so bad , but I had to stand to shake hands with the whole crowd , and for several days afterward one foot was so swollen that I had difficulty in keeping a smile on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gout . The worst experience of the campaign , however , may have been in New York City , where a series of outdoor meetings was held one evening . All of them were poorly attended and one of them  --  close to the Brooklyn Bridge  --  was ruined by failure of the loud-speaker system during the speeches of Governor Stevenson , Sen. Herbert Lehman and Mayor Robert Wagner . I felt that Tammany Hall , the New York political organization in charge of arrangements , had no enthusiasm for Governor Stevenson and had deliberately sabotaged these meetings . Tammany is an organization that can arrange such affairs as it wishes to arrange them . In any event , I was pretty tired of riding in motorcades by the time the campaign ended , and was glad to get back to Hyde Park to cast my vote . The returns , of course , were unhappy from my viewpoint , but I suppose that a long time spent in politics has inured me to disappointments . I felt sad because 1 believed Governor Stevenson 's abilities were needed to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I knew that somehow those problems would be met . I was pleased that 1 could at least say to myself that I had done all I had been asked to do and all I could do . I am glad to be out of politics now . I ca n't forget that sometimes my feet hurt during that campaign and that for weeks I had to snatch such sleep as I could get on airplanes or at odd hours , and I seldom got enough . My children keep telling me that I will soon have to slow down , that 1 will have to stop working and that I should not do any strenuous campaigning in 1960 . But I notice that I can often keep going longer than they , and it is not easy to know what one will do or not do in the future . At seventy-three , I sometimes feel very old and sometimes very young !
