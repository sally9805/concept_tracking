Assigned to do a term paper on television critics , Iowa State University Coed Elisabeth Dwight recently sought help from her father , Ogden Dwight , who happens to be the TV critic for the Des Moines Register ( circ. 224,337 ) . How much influence , she asked , does the television critic possess ? Replied Dwight : " Not a damned bit . " <P> By last week , with the television industry undergoing an agony of self-reappraisal in the lurid light of the quiz-show scandals ( see SHOW BUSINESS ) , many a journalist working the TV beat as reporter-critic was busy appraising his own job . And to many a critic , it appeared that Des Moines 's Dwight was not far off ; the television reporter-critics have precious little influence . The quiz shows themselves are a case in point . For years , the nation 's TV critics flayed the quiz programs as phony , valueless , and taste-degrading entertainment ( " Immoral ! " cried Jack Gould of the New York Times ) . But aside from an occasional dark hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fixing that had been taking place under their uplifted noses . They were thus left with the meager consolation that their abstract judgment had been correct-even though nobody seemed to be listening when they tendered it . <P> Secret Chuckles . Throughout the U.S. , several hundred newsmen spend 30 to 35 generally dreary hours each week watching TV as part of their jobs as critics . They reach an impressive , if not impressionable , newspaper readership that rivals in number the legion of comic-strip fans . The New York Herald Tribune 's John Crosby is syndicated in more than 90 papers , the Los Angeles Mirror-News ' ' s Hal Humphrey in 87 ; in San Francisco , the <P> Chronicle 's TV columnist-reviewer , Terrence O'Flaherty , is read by Californians who do not even have TV sets . <P> What little influence the TV critics do have is generally exerted within the television industry itself . A handful of top critics-Gould , Crosby , Humphrey , O'Flaherty and Variety 's George Rosen-are regularly read by network executives , program sponsors and advertising agencies . Such critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the 1956 Suez crisis , several blistering columns by the Times 's Gould shamed all three networks into covering the U.N . Security Council debate on the Mideast . After John Crosby rapped CBS for vapid programing , CBS Board Chairman William Paley postponed a European vacation to help whip up something better . This fall , before putting on the air the new private-eye program called Staccato , the producer invited Los Angeles ' Humphrey to appraise the opening show . After Humphrey passed judgment- " a miserable piece of junk " - it was scrapped , another episode substituted . <P> But such successes are the exception rather than the rule , and most of the critics admit it . The Times 's Jack Gould even declines to take credit for getting the Security Council sessions onto the networks . Says he : " I only confirmed a general attitude . " Says a network vice president in Chicago : " A lot of network brass would say , ' Oh , yes , we take the critics ' opinion seriously , ' but they get nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
