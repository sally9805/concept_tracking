The U.S. " Project Vanguard " for launching small earth satellites has passed the talking stage . Last week the Department of Defense announced that it has signed a $2,035,033 contract with Glenn L. Martin Co. of Baltimore for the launching vehicle , the three-stage rocket that will set the first satellite in its orbit . General Electric Co. will supply the rocket motor , and other suppliers will be called on as the project develops . <P> Martin was presumably chosen because it builds the Navy 's Viking rockets , which hold the single-stage altitude record . The Navy will have overall supervision of Project Vanguard . The satellite itself is the responsibility of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation . Its size has not been decided , but the Department of Defense promised that it will be big enough to carry instruments and will be tracked from the ground by optical and electronic devices .
