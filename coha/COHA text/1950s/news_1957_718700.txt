txt Laws , laws laws . Laws for everything . And laws for nothing . Many savings bankers are highly in favor of laws limiting savings bank dividends , which are the interest paid on accounts , even though they , are in favor of a free market in the rate they charge borrowers . It seems that the New York State legislature passed a bill  --  still to be signed by the Governor ? which would have limited these dividends to a maximum of 3 percent . However , the bill also provided that one extra dividend a year could be paid at a time designated by the State Superintendent of Banks , on accounts which are two years old or more . But it appears that some savings bankers are upset . It develops there was a joker in the bill as passed . As we get it , the bill may be phrased so a saver could keep $10 on deposit for two years and then suddenly add $10,000 just before the dividend date , and get the dividend on the full amount . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remedied . But we wonder why such a law should be passed in the first place . A free market should be just tliat  --  free . For savers as well as lenders . And the whole incident should point out a lesson in the futility of trying to legislate all the mechanisms of the marketplace .
