THE VICE PRESIDENCY Let Dick Do It John Adams , the first Vice President of the U.S. , was sure he occupied " the most insignificant office that ever invention of man contrived . " When Theodore Roosevelt was nominated for the post in 1900 , he wrote that he had been " forced to take the veil . " Woodrow Wilson 's two-term Vice President , Thomas Riley Marshall ( " What this country needs is a good five-cent cigar " ) , often told a story about two brothers : one was elected Vice President , the other ran away to sea ; neither was ever heard of again . <P> Richard Milhous Nixon , the 36th Vice President of the U.S. , also takes a modest view of his job . " Vice Presidents should be seen and not heard , " he says , and during his six months in office the public has heard him seldom indeed . When 1954 congressional elections draw near , he will stump for Republican candidates , but meanwhile he wants to remain inconspicuous . He turns down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2,500 a session ) , keeps his press conferences off the record , abstains from public pronouncements . <P> Handshakes Across the Sea . But while avoiding the public ear , Nixon has quietly made himself an exceedingly useful Vice President . Besides performing his ex-officio functions of presiding over the Senate ( a highly important job in a Senate that is exactly 50% Republican ) and attending the weekly Cabinet and National Security Council meetings ( he presides in the President 's absence ) , he has taken on numerous unofficial chores . He fills in for the President at ceremonial and social functions , serves as greeter for all sorts of visitors , from high-school kids to foreign chiefs of government . <P> Last week the White House announced that Nixon will do some handshaking abroad next autumn : " He will visit the Far East and South Asia . .. accompanied by Mrs. Nixon and representatives of the Department of State ... to become acquainted with leaders of the countries visited , to hear their views , to gain first-hand impressions , to carry the sincere greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stops tentatively planned : Korea , Japan , Formosa , Indo-China . the Philippines , Indonesia , Siam , possibly India and Pakistan . <P> Vein of Iron . Nixon 's most important unofficial task is liaison between the White House and Capitol Hill . To that chore he brings six years ' experience as Representative and Senator from California . He tries to explain and sell Administration policies to individual Senators and Representatives , smooth ruffled congressional feathers , build up good will for the Administration . Much of his diplomacy is conducted at the breakfasts he holds for groups of Congressmen . Still fairly young ( 40 ) . Nixon pays particular attention to the younger men in Congress . <P> One of his continuing problems is Investigator Joseph R. McCarthy . Among Nixon 's missions last week was warning McCarthy against subpoenaing Central Intelligence Agency officials ( see above ) . Temporarily at least , Troubleshooter Nixon got his point across .
