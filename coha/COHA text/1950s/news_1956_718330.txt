txt MORE ABOUT DELAYS ON THE PIERS ANNA H. ROTHBART.M.D . SCOTT.A.H . SAKIER.EDWINA COONS.JANET K. SMITH . pg . 163 MORE ABOUT DELAYS ON THE PIERS An article by Morris Gilbert , published in this section last Oct. 14 , dealing with the delays homebound travelers encounter on our piers , has called forth , numerous letters from readers . Some of these were printed in the issues of Oct. 21 and Oct. 28 . Following are further communications on this subject . To the Travel Effitor : MAY I add my experiences and . impressions in defense of , Customs men ? I am so dismayed 6Y the accounts of discourtesy . I have come into the United States at least one-half dozen times by plane or ship . I have never met a discourteous - agent . On the contrary they have always been so pleasant that I took it for granted that that was normal procedure . - Last June I came from South . o.merica on a Dutch ship . I was tr. and nervous and therefore sensitive to sins of omission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came back on the Icelandic plane to Idlewild . The guard was pleasant , exchanged some pleasantries and gave me some information I needed . He had been kept overtime because the plane was many hours late . He was utterly civilized . I do not know his name . I feel that since my pleasant experiences have been so many they can not be extraordinary . ANNA H. ROTHBART . Long Island City , N. Y. " ONE BIG JUMBLE " To the Travel Editor : On Oct. 3 , 1956 , I arriv , ed in New York City via the Queen Mary from France . The boat docked at Pier 90 as usual . We had visited seven countries in Europe and had checked through the Customs of each country as we entered it and left . In not one single entrance were we asked to open any of our bags , and we were worked through Customs with courtesy and dispatch . During the past five years I have had to pass through United States Customs at New Orleans , Boston , Niagara Falls and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each and every instance it took me from ong hour to two and a half hours to clear . When I arrived in New York the . story was repeated . It took one and a half hours for the luggage to reach the dock , another half hour standing in line waiting for a Customs officer . Letters From Travelers Contain a Variety ' Of Opinions Then another half hour wait for a porter to take the luggage to the street and a twenty-minute wait for a taxi . W6 had purchased an extra bag in Europe , in which . we packed all our purchases made during our two-month trip . We had all our bills in one envelope , told the Customs agent that we had nothing in our other five pieces of luggage . He made us open each one and then never looked inside them . The Customs shed at Southampton , England , is a beautiful set-up . It is easy to find your luggage ; it is on a raised platform where the bags are all set in neat rows . When you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one big jumble on the pier . During the past thirty-five years I have made- twenty-six ocean crossings , thirteen round trips to Europe . At Boston , New Orleans , as well as New York , there seems to have been very little thought given to comfort for incoming passengers or any attempt to expedite the handling of the passengers ' luggage . Why so ? M. D. SCOTT . Metairie , La . TIPPING EVIL To the Travel Editor : As one who has occasion to travel , I was interested in the letter of Waldo E. Cohn- of Tennessee about his unpleasant experiences with longshoremenporters at the New York docks , who , although their services are supposed to be free to returning travelers from abroad , and are advertised as such , nevertheless demand , under pain of insult , high tips . May I say to Mr. Cohn that this is a natural consequence of tipping in general . Mr. Cohn says that everybody gives tips to these porters . But unless travelers take a proper stand on the tipping evil , it will not end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his employer ( in this case the steamship line ) , you put the workman in the position of having two loyalties , one to his employer and one to . the man from whom he is maneuvering to get a second payment , the passenger . A workman should have one loyalty , to the man who pays his wages and the public should look to the employer for adequate service , expecting that the employer pay the employe adequately and expecting to pay adequately for the service . In that way , you can hold the , employer to good service from his employes . But if , by tipping . you make the workman look to you for his payment , then you interfere with the employeremploye relationship on which good service depends . We must develop the courage to stop tipping . A. H. SAKIE8 . ' New York , N. Y. VERILY To the Travel Editor : " Tipping demands * * * irritate travelers . " Amen ! EDWINA COONS . New York , N. Y. UNLOADING To the Travel Editor : Your article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States for ships ' passengers , and the pleasures and comforts of those abroad , does not mention one aspect which is a keynote . I returned from a summer of travel and study in England , enjoying the passage on the Queen Mary , Tourist Class , and having made out my baggage declaration for Customs and seen my luggage properly and . elaborately tagged , started off from the cabin , and thought the rest would be simple . As a matter of record , the Customs inspection itself took less than a quarter of an hour by very tired but most amiable officer . None the less , I spent more than five hours on the Cunard dock , watching for each successive piece , ( five in all ) of the hand luggage which I use in preference to one or two of greater bulk and weight . The chaotic unloading was responsible , I feel . The dock was crowded , for the ? first three hours , but not frightfully so . But piles of luggage sent out from , the ship apparently at random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and overflowed , andl mostly the newest arrivals were skimmed off the top of the piles , while those beneath sagged deeper toward the floor of the pier . I was actually the last passenger able to leave the dock , and I had been in the first thirty off the ship . I have determined that , if and when I can go abroad again , I shall go and return by plane . JANET K. SMITH . Tallahassee , Fla.
