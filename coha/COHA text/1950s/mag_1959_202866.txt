Until recently , there seemed no end to the relentless parade of slick slabs marching in monotonous array down the Main Streets of U.S. cities . But now there is slow-gathering revolt against the tyranny of the grid with its curtain wall , which can make an office building look like a library , a courthouse like a morgue . Turning to engineering for a new excitement , architects are trying their hands at long-span , wafer-thin concrete shells . As more and more unfamiliar shells set their concrete sails to the wind , they may well provide 20th century architecture with the focal points that it has long needed to accent and offset the grid 's severities . <P> Even shell purists do not claim that thin membranes of concrete soaring up into space are the answer to all ills ; for short-span buildings , post-and-beam construction is as economical and easier to build . But for building meant to enclose large , pillar-free areas , shell construction is made to order . <P> Images in Concrete . It is being used to provide a large foyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to house a college library . Spain 's famed Engineer Eduardo Torroja and Italy 's Pier Luigi Nervi have proved that strictly utilitarian race-track stands , exhibition halls , ware houses and factories in shell concrete can become objects of surprising geometric beauty ; Mexico 's Felix Candela has shown that the hyperbolic paraboloid is versatile enough to use for churches , restaurants and bandstands . Already built , or on the way , are a host of equally new evocative shapes . <P> France 's Le Corbusier used interlocking hyperbolic paraboloids to build the Philips Pavilion at last year 's Brussels Fair , produced a building that looks like wildly flapping tents frozen in the wind , yet is basically nothing more than mathematical surfaces in concrete . U.S. Architect Hugh Stubbins tried a saddle-shaped shell delicately resting on two points for his Berlin Congress Hall ( TIME , Sept. 30 , 1957 ) , achieved a building that seems to float yet looks ( from certain angles ) like a hooded owl . Designing an opera house to be built on the harbor front at Sydney , Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Joern Utzon developed a whole family of shells that poetically echo the sails of passing boats . Recognizing the new impulse , Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art last week had on view a four-architect show of concrete structures . Outstanding was Eero Saarinen 's design for the T.W.A. terminal , Idlewild , which masses huge vaults cantilevered out to suggest some great bird poised for flight . <P> Future Unlimited . Playing with a whole new world of conoids , cylinders and spheres , in single , double and compound curvatures , shellmen think the future is unlimited . The nearly completed French National Industrial and Technical Center , now abuilding on the outskirts of Paris , soars up 165 ft. , spans 720 ft. , covers 25 acres and will hold 60,000 visitors . Already research centers at M.I.T. and North Carolina State are exploring a whole range of fantastic new shapes ; concrete shells have already been built with a thickness-to-span ratio ten times less than a chicken egg's.                   @ @
