txt Though some Republican members of the Senate have done their best to help the public forget about it , the President last January submitted to Congress a comprehensive program of legislation on which he has said that the Republican party would have to stand or fall in the elections this November . Nearly three months have now gone by since the present session began , and the legislative accomplishments have been disappointingly small . A Washington report to this newspaper ' yesterday included the following observation : " On controversial issues not one quarter of what * * * the President has sought has been acted upon . And if the Republican Congressional leaders maintain their determination to adjourn in July it will be necessary for Congress to do in less than four months three times more than it has done in about three months . " It will be necessary , that is , unless the Republicans are willing to face the country this autumn with a record that will make previous " donothing " Congresses look like beehives of activity . What has the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public is ' concerned , about all it has been doing is to wrangle over the fatuous Bricker and George amendments and then to permit itself to be diverted and distracted by the activities of the junior Senator from Wisconsin . The socalled Republican " leadership " in the Senate has contributed to the dismal picture by its apparent inability or unwillingness to get down to the hard pick-and-shovel work that President Eisenhower 's two hundred legislative proPosals demand . Even in the case of the George amendment- the " leadership " in the person of Senator Knowiand turned tail at the last moment and voted against the Administration , which was saved by the hairbreadth margin of one Democratic supporter . The general revision of the tax structure , one of the basic fiscal programs of the Administration , has just come over ' to the Senate . A decision is at least six weeks away , although action will be taken sooner on the excise tax bill that u411 deprive the Government of almost as much revenue as it will retain . No final legislative action has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on revision of the Taft-Hartley Law , on extension of social security , on housing , on the reciprocal trade program , on postal , rates . The ? Administration 's foreign aid and domestic defense programs are , so far as Congress is concerned , still only in the talking stage . Even Hawaiian statehood , promised in the Republican platform , has been bogged down ? ln the Senate ( though it lia.s passed the House ) by political maneuvers that have attached it to the companion proposal for Alaskan statehood . The House has still to approve the St. Lawrence Seaway bill . Neither body has done anything concrete about establishing uniform rules of fair procedure foe investigating committees . All these ? and many more ? are important matters that ought to be settled before the adjournment of Congress in July . It is perfectly true that the Republicans have only a bare majority- in the House and a merely nominal one in the Senate . Considerable Democratic support of Presfaent Eisenhower will be necessary , since a number of Republicans will desert the Administration on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshing to get the feeling that the Republican " leadership " on Capitol Hill is really trying , and trying hard , to get down to brass tacks on the Administration 's program .
