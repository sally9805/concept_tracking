Red China , beset by internal troubles , last week made plain its determination to cause friction and perhaps war all along its southern borders . That intent became unmistakable even to India . The long unrealistic era in which the two largest nations on earth coexisted peaceably because one of them saw no evil or heard no evil seemed at last to be ending . <P> Rising in India 's lower house of Parliament , Jawaharlal Nehru , 69 , gripped the teakwood Prime Minister 's bench and described , in blunt language he had never used before , the " continuing aggression " of Red China 's troops against India 's northern borders . The frontier incidents were clearly a Chinese testing of India 's willingness to defend itself . " We must not become alarmist and panicky and take wrong actions , " cautioned the ever-cautious and neutralist Nehru , but then he added ringingly that " there is no alternative to us but to defend our borders and our integrity . " M.P.s in white homespun thumped their benches in stormy agreement . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nehru , 38 Indian soldiers had fought with 300 Chinese invaders and barely escaped encirclement . An Indian plane had tried to drop munitions to the surrounded men but failed . That incident had occurred at Longju in India 's North-East Frontier Agency ( popularly called NEFA ) . It was not the first one . A thousand miles to the west , in the Ladakh district of Kashmir , Chinese Communists have repeatedly ambushed and captured isolated Indian patrols , said Nehru . As recently as July an Indian detachment ( an officer and five men ) was taken prisoner by Chinese troops that had established a camp " well within Indian territory . " <P> Asked why the border was not better defended , Nehru replied that it is 2,500 miles long , remote , mountainous and scarcely accessible . What about Chinese claims to the tiny Himalayan nations of Bhutan and Sikkim ? Said Nehru : " Our position is quite clear . Any aggression against Bhutan and Sikkim will be considered as aggression against India . " <P> The Indian press , which had wakened to Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand at last . " China 's cynical attitude toward India , combined with the hard realities of Communism at home as experienced in Kerala , is forcing on this country an ' agonizing reappraisal ' of fundamentals in our foreign policy , " said the Indian Express . The Hindustan Times called for a radar screen along the northern frontier . <P> Some editorialists also turned their attention to Nehru 's old buddy and longtime apologist for Communism , Krishna Menon , Minister of Defense . Wrote top Columnist A. D. Gorwala in the Indian Express : " Let it be remembered that in complete contradiction of his usual practice of jumping eagerly into the discussion of any foreign affairs matter , Mr. Krishna Menon has kept his lips sealed in public about Communist Chinese aggression in Tibet . Not one word of condemnation of brutalities practiced , promises broken , suffering inflicted , has escaped his lips . What confidence can the people of India have if their armed forces are left under such direction ? "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
