TELEVISION-A NEW CAMPAIGN WEAPON OW THAT Howdie Doodie , Rootie than $200,000 . The Democrats reby Paul Seabury frained from retaliating in kind for non-partisan servants of the public weal ? have reasserted their rightful claim to their deserved Neilson ratings on TV , there is time before the next election to weigh the words of Gov . Thomas E. Dewey that " television and radio are the most effective means of campaigning . This statement , like any other premature attempt to assess ' factors in this , the first Republican Presidential victory since 1928 , leads us to inquire about the role which these two media of . mass communication did play in the election of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower . Were radio and television " impartial " in the campaign ? We must await definitive expenditure statistics from the Senate Elections Subcommittee , and other sources . But there is little doubt . that the multi-million dollar campaign was the most intensive and expensive in American history . And in the distribution of the air waves between the General and - the Governor ? Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected . Television costs money , and the big networks ? Columbia , NBC , Mutual and Dumont ? are not in business for the common weal of the two-party system . The economics of this industry , not partisan preference , were decisive in determining the relative ratio of air time distributed between the two candidates and their proponents . A United Press dispatch from Washington on November 4 quoted Sen. Paul Douglas in estimating that the Republican and Democratic parties ? on federal , state and local levels ? together incurred expenses this year of about $75 million . Of this amount , the dispatch added , " considerably more than $3 million was spent by , both upon the purchase of radio and television time . " This latter estimate is likely to fall far short of the final mark . Sidney Shalit , in the New York Daily News of November 5 , has estimated that the Eisenhower " spot blitz " on radio and television " my Mamie gets awful mad about high taxes , too ! " , which blanketed the air over 50-odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone cost more than $1 million and was originally underwritten for $2 million . The hour-and-a-half election eve GOP rally of November 3 ( the program sadly caricatured by Vice-President Barkley as the " two slices of stdle bread " surrounding that one-half hour slice of good " Democratic meat " ) was placed on all coast-to-coast major networks at a cost of probably more the barrage of " Ike " spot commercials on Korea , Communism and Corruption , not from considerations of taste or lack of prior preparation , but from last minute fiscal decrepitude . Democratic spot recordings still lie untouched in a downtown New York advertising office . Advertising Age , the adman 's bible , states without reservation in the November 10 issue that saturation of radio and TV spots seems to have paid off for the GOP . Eisenhower won in 39 of the 40 states in which the Republicans concentrated on spot announcements to be seen or heard by the voters . A " highly placed " Republican gave Advertising Age the following how-to-win-acampaign summary : 1 . The Republicans spent between $1.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars was spent ' in New York City alone on " the biggest saturation of all time " ? with Ike spots going at the rate of perhaps 120 a day . 3 . " Saturation " campaigns of unusual intensity were staged in 11 states : New York , New Jersey , Illinois , Massa-chusetts , Michigan , Maryland , Indiana , California , Pennsyl-vania , Texas and Connecticut . Eisenhower carried them all . 4 . " Heavy " spot schedules were run in the Southern states of Florida , Virginia and Texas ? all of which were won by Ike . Voters resident " on the Eastern seaboard ? particularly in New York City ? were treated to the most violent saturation bombing by campaign oratory . Governor Dewey , at a disc jockey post from 6. a.m. until 10 a.m. on election eve , conducted a telethon to educate the public in the mysteries of a straight Republican ticket , and to convince New Yorkers that " we deserve more than a prosperity based on the broken bodies of young Americans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor program that evening . And both the Governor and the General were amply covered by television and radio in their respective appearances in New York in the eight weeks before November 4 . And in the eight-day October 27 ? November 3 period , the Democratic Party and its affiliates bought 13.5 evening television hours to the Republicans ' 19 , to lag not far behind the GOP ; in radio time , the Democrats had 14 hours to the Republicans ' 18 on seven major Ne-W York stations in the final week , exclusive of spot commercials . The New York ratio , however , was not typical coverage . What . was true of New York City was apparently not , true of many parts Of the interior . In Minneapolis , Minn. , for example , during this same period , Eisenhower forces purchased more than twice as much evening radio time as the Democrats ( 14.5 hours to 6.5 hours ) and almost twice as much evening television time ( five and a quarter to three hours ) In Dallas , Texas , ( a bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratio was equally unfavorable to the unregenerate Democrats , Stevenson , Connally and Rayburn ( 14 to seven-and-ahalf radio hours ; 12 to five-and-three-fourths TV hours ) . In Chicago , Advertising Age reports , the broadcasting industry received a real " bonanza . " The Eisenhower forces " were spending $8,000 for time on one radio station as compared to $900 by the Democrats . On one Chicago TV outlet the GOP spent $25,000 . Another TV station got $27,000 , most of it for Ike . " Volunteers for Stevenson reported that their whole Illinois budget came to $10,000 , according to the magazine . If these cities , chosen at random , are typical of how the two great political parties fared on the publicly owned airwaves of the Midwest and South , the Republicans were able to purchase twice as much air time as were the Democrats in this recent campaign . But the potency of television as a political medium can not be measured just by total air time purchased by political parties . At best , both television and radio merely furnish facilities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to recall that Neilson TV audience-ratings of the Republican and Democratic conventions this summer showed both of them far less " popular " than the show , I Love Lucy . Governor Stevenson 's inflation speech at Baltimore on September 23 ? televised by CBS in 48 " station areas " throughout the country ? had to compete , not with the Governor 's GOP opponent , but with NBC 's Original Amateur Hour . From all reports ( if the Neilson Survey is correct ) he reached only an estimated 45.8 percent of all sets then in use . On September 25 , General Eisenhower , speaking over Dumont , encountered similar buyer resistance : while his address was carried in 62 " station areas , " it reached only 40.9 percent of activated TV sets ; the other 59.1 percent , presumably , were turned chiefly to Mister Peepers ( NBC ) and CBS ' Big . Town . This congenital unwillingness of most of the listening public to forego habitual spectator habits , even in a political campaign , is a problem which neither Republican nor Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , quite possible that , despite the preponderance of . Republican purchased time on the American airwaves , Governor Stevenson benefited far more from this new medium , television , than did his Republican rival . The General . himself was exhibited to the public primarily via the traditional whistle-stop tour and the press . He traveled an estimated 18,000 more miles cross-continent than did Stevenson . His candidacy was espoused by about 81 percent of the nation 's daily newspaper circulation , and his praises were sung by an equally partisan group of nationally circulated magazines . Stevenson , however , traveled ? and was " sold " chiefly by air . Soon after the beginning of the campaign , he and his managers decided that the Governor could better and more quickly be introduced to the American public on the air waves than on the exhausting whistle-stop route . Even after his defeat , Stevenson 's managers seem not to question the wisdom of this choice . Wilson Wyatt , in an interview published in US News and World Report ( Nov. 14 ) went so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would have been one , two , three or four million votes fewer for Adlai Stevenson . " For one thing ? a curious quirk of the medium ? the Governor proved far more " telegenic " than his rival ; and for another , his speeches were far better composed and delivered . Within four months a man unknown to the American public became , largely by virtue of television , a celebrity in his own land . ( The same , incidentally , could have been said of Sen. Richard Nixon and of his dog Checkers . ) Without a careful examination of the transcripts of radio commentators and a measured review of the news films used during television news broadcasts , One can not begin to analyze bias , or fairness , in this important part ? of the air waves . There were complaints by many Democrats , that the business-sponsored newsreels were trained for many more minutes on Eisenhower than on Stevenson during news roundups of the campaign . And that radio commentators , such as Walter Winthell , possibly violated FCC regulations by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Eisenhower . Winthell 's unprecedented Sunday night act over ABC brought an immediate charge by Democratic National Committee Chairman Stephen A. Mitch ell that " Winchell 's radio and TV broadcasts . . . can not by any conceivable stretch of the imagination be classified as news reporting or commentary . . . This was nothing more nor less than a partisan political speech for Eisenhower which was broadcast without cost to the Republican Party . Accordingly , pursuant to Section 315 of the Communications Act , we demand equivalent and comparable time . . . without cost to the Democratic Par ABC did not believe the law required ABC to give the Democrats equal time , and did nothing . The matter is now in the hands of the Federal Communications Commission . There is little doubt that television ? the new and revolutionary medium of American politics ? contributed to the , unusually heavy turnout of normally non-voting citizens ; it may , as has been charged , have brought irrelevant personal and emotional elements of the campaign ? e.g. , the Nixon soliloquy ? much closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have desired . But heavy turnouts and irrational appeals to the citizenry are not novel in American politics . Like all other media , of mass communication , television is ambivalent . Turned to a high moral and educative purpose , we have seen that it can uplift ; turned to sordid expediency , sloganeering and manipulation , it can do great damage to our political processes . The public 's embrace of Richard Nixon after his nationwide TV appearance . is indicative of advertising technique effectiveness . James A. Kearns Jr. , who - went behind the scenes to report the show for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , came up with some interesting facts . The man who rehearsed Nixon and actually produced the show was Edward A. Rogers , on leave from a large Hollywood advertising agency and former production supervisor of The Lone Ranger , Beulah and Mystery Theatre . As Nixon 's paid , full-time television expert , Rogers worked with representatives from two New York advertising agencies ( BBD &O; and Knudner ) who flew to Hollywood in the crisis , and these high-powered admen whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived they were ready to work on him . Kearns reports : The TV experts had him sit at the table , then stand next to it , and then do the same thing again and again . Under their deft prompting , the candidate practiced posing with his right hand on the table , then with his left hand in a trouser pocket . . . . Mrs. Pat Nixon , nervously clasping a handkerchief , was carefully coached to keep a relaxed pose in her chair , her head turned at a certain angle , her face arched in a close-mouthed smile . The dress rehearsal , with the star going doggedly through the directed motions , continued almost to the moment of curtain time . In the last minute , the coaches ducked behind an off-stage screen . Here is a partial list , according to Kearns , of Nixon 's carefully calculated appeals to the same sentiments ad writers depend upon to yield their profits : Love , of Pets : " The kids . . . loved the dog , and . . . regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it . " Mother Love : " My mother and dad had five boys and we all worked in the grocery store . Horatio Alger : , " I do n't happen to be a rich-rnan . . . We had a rather difficult time after we were married . . . . " Dishpan Hands : . . . Pat does n't have a mink coat . But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat , and I al .. * ways tell her that she would look good in anything . " Patriotism : " I was just there when the bombs were falling . . . I love my country . . . . Stiff Upper Lip : " It is n't easy to come before a nationwide audience and bare your life , as I have done . Undaunted Crusader : " . . The purpose of the smears , I know is this : to silence me , to make me let up . For this performance , Nixon and the GOP received 400,000 telegrams and fan letters . There are certain long-range questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there a political danger in the extraordinary financial burden which televising Presidential candidates places upon our two parties ? It is certain that ? barring some unexpected drastic revision of our . FCC regulations ? the preponderance of air time will continue to go to the political party able to raise the largest campaign funds . It is also certain that , because of television , campaign expenditures will continue drastically to rise . Who will foot the bill ? Can either party ethically afford to continue entrusting its fiscal destiny to a few wealthy contributors ? Both parties might well benefit from another look at Beardsley Ruml 's $5 certificate plan , which this year after a late start helped to democratize the financing of Governor Stevenson 's television appearances . Spreading out the cost of political campaigns by methods such as this may prove not only morally imperative but financially necessary in the future . We also may well inquire whether the present duration of the Presidential campaign is unduly long ; or whether , due to the advent of television , less physical strain need be imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now results from eight strenuous weeks of stumping the country . Pessimists among us may perhaps wonder also whether the impact of television upon political techniques may ultimately reduce the Presidential campaign to the set routine of pushbutton warfare , managed by teams . of " idea men , " script writers and admen in their soundproof metropolitan offices , far removed from the voter and even the ward-heeler . It has yet to be demonstrated that candidates for high office can be purveyed , like Duz , Rinso and Lucky Strikes , solely on the manipulative principle of George Washington Hill : constant repetition and annoyance . The neurological patterns of the American voter are far more complex than those of Pavlov 's dogs and still are subject to many far more conditioning influences than television and radio alone . This may be so , but it will be a long time before anyone underestimates the power of an adman . As one Stevenson supporter ' put it when the - votes were in : " Chalk this one up for BBD &O.";
