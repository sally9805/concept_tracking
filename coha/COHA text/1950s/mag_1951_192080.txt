This week , for the first time in almost three centuries , a Pope was beatified. * Giuseppe Sarto , Pope Pius X , was that rarest of combinations-a holy man and a great statesman . <P> The son of a Lombard village cobbler , young " Beppo " Sarto was as bright as he was poor , but he never lost his humility . Even when he was a fledgling country priest , his powerful sermons attracted attention beyond his own parish . He was raised to be a monsignor , then Bishop of Mantua , in 1893 Cardinal Patriarch of Venice . He made a point of giving away everything that he had . In his will he wrote : " I was born poor , I have lived poor , and I wish to die poor . " <P> Cardinal Sarto 's election to the papacy in 1903 came as a surprise to him . When he saw the balloting swinging in his favor , he rose to plead passionately with his brother cardinals not to elect him to a post for which he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed with decisions that have proved historic for the Roman Catholic Church . <P> Synthesis of Heresies . " The sole aim of Our Pontificate , " he wrote , " will be to restore all things to God . " Among his actions : <P> His encyclical Acerbo nimis revived the importance of the Catholic catechism , established the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish to teach it . <P> His Apostolic Letter in 1905 set forth principles for the laymen 's movement known as Catholic Action . <P> His decree calling for " frequent and even daily Communion " settled a longstanding church controversy , silenced those who had argued that man was unworthy to take the Eucharist except at long intervals . <P> His encyclical Pascendi in 1907 condemned , lock , stock &; barrel , the theological trend toward Modernism , which tended to look upon religion as a subjective experience and the church as a purely human institution in the process of evolution . Pius X called this " a synthesis of all heresies , " cracked down so hard on Modernism that some Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If in the days of Luther and Calvin the church had possessed a Pope of the temper of Pius , would Protestantism have succeeded in getting a third of Europe to break loose from Rome ? " <P> Ora pro Nobis . In August 1914 , heartsick at the World War then beginning , Giuseppe Sarto died at 79 . Even during his lifetime he had been spoken of as a saint ; soon after his death , steps were taken to proclaim him one . In his case , the " process " toward sainthood , which sometimes takes centuries , has moved in double-quick time ; only last fall ( TIME , Sept. 18 ) he was declared " venerable . " <P> Last week his blackened body was exhumed from its tomb in St. Peter 's and the face covered with a silver mask replica of his features . The body was dressed in new papal vestments , then placed in a gold-leaf sarcophagus with a glass top for public view . As it was unveiled this week , at the height of the beatification ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cardinal Frederico Tedeschini , spoke for the first time the words of public veneration , to which only saints and blesseds are entitled : <P> " Beate Pie , ora pro nobis Blessed Pius , pray for us.
