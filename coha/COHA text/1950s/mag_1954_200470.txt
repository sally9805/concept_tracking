When Adlai Stevenson showed up last week in Charlotte . N.C. , newsmen noted his heavier tan and lighter humor ( compared to his showing in Miami last month ) , but few other apparent changes . If not running for office , he was at least a man in motion . He was still glad-handing party pols and casting pearly wit before crowds ( on his bothersome kidney stone : " A subversive element " ) . It was only in his major speech , wildly cheered by some 3,500 Carolina Democrats , that a bigger change showed . <P> In his Miami speech , Stevenson had set his sights on Ike ; the Democratic tar get for ' 54 , he indicated , was to be the President himself . In Charlotte last week , Ike was all but praised . Stevenson 's target became the men around Ike and the G.O.P. itself . " When our President bestirs himself , ignores the expedient counsel of small-bore politicians and clears the high-pressure salesmen out of his house . " said Stevenson , " I confidently predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But I fear he will have to make his choice between uniting his party and uniting his nation . . . He can not do both . " <P> In his shift of emphasis . Stevenson has returned to the line of Democratic Senate Leader Lyndon Johnson , who believes that it is politically fruitless to attack Ike directly ; that the best Democratic strategy is to praise Ike , attack " the men around him .
