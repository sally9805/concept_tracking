In the opinion of Alabama 's Racist State Senator Sam Engelhardt Jr. , if you ca n't lick ' em , the best thing to do is scatter ' em . Panicky because Negro vote strength was rising in his county seat of Tuskegee ( pop . 6,700 ) , Engelhardt last May authored a gerrymander that jig-sawed more than 400 Negro residents-and the respected Negro Tuskegee Institute-outside the city 's limits . Forthwith , the city of Tuskegee was hard hit by a Negro boycott ( TIME , July 8 ) that slashed white merchants ' business 50% , shut down stores that depended primarily on Negro trade . Incensed at the boycott , alarmed because Tuskegee-encompassing Macon County is 84% Negro , Senator Engelhardt , officer in the lily-white Alabama Association of Citizens ' Councils , hatched a king-size gerrymander . Last week , by a 21,012-vote margin , Alabama voters approved his constitutional amendment to abolish Macon County . <P> Opposition to the Engelhardt proposal was strong , not because many Alabamans were suddenly reconciled to Negro voting , but because they agreed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions as to division of tax moneys and the responsibilities for the areas of Macon which may be divided . " Nonetheless , the Engelhardt plan can now run its course . Whenever they choose , commissioners of Macon County can meet commissioners of abutting Tallapoosa , Elmore , Lee , Bullock and Montgomery Counties , apportion among the other five Macon County 's 618 square miles . Then , when the legislature approves , Macon County will disappear .
