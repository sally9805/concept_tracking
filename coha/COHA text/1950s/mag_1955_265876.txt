At the tavern called Swyndlestock , they ordered wine , but when John de Croydon brought it to them , they decided that it was no good . De Croydon said it was ; the scholars said it was n't .

" Welcome town , welcome gown . <P> After a service at St. Mary 's , the procession resumed its march to the town hall . This time , it was the mayor 's turn to do the honors ; for the first time in history , he gave the vice chancellor the freedom of the city . After all , said he .
