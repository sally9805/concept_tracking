The iron fist of Brigadier General Antonio Kebreau , Haiti 's new boss , fell on the black republic last week , bringing temporary calm . After a weekend of arson and terror , the sullen followers of exiled provisional President Daniel Fignole went back to work . Kebreau jammed the jails with political prisoners . <P> Black Revolt . In the Maryland-sized republic , just three air hours from Miami , the weekend of turmoil only topped off a chaotic political record . In the 153 years since independence , Haiti has had two emperors , one king and 30 Presidents , only two of whom peacefully turned the office over to their successors . Haitian rulers have been fed arsenic , dynamited , driven to suicide , torn to pieces . <P> The violence stems partly from the manner of Haiti 's birth . While revolution tore France in 1791 , half a million black slaves rose against France 's colonial rule . In two months they massacred more than 2,000 whites , razed more than 1,000 plantations . Haiti never recovered . The world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorhouse . Only 23,470 Haitians out of 3,500,000 engage in middle-class occupations . As the economy strangled , politics turned into a business venture , with revolution the key to the treasury . <P> Marine Interlude . The 1915-34 occupation by the U.S. Marines reversed the trend , gave Haiti hospitals , telephones and political peace . The paradoxically gentle side of the Haitian nature emerged . From the Marine departure to President Paul Magloire 's ouster last year , Haiti had only four Presidents , a modern record . But as the occupation memory faded , the technical services and the civic sense declined , and chaos reclaimed the land . Seven regimes have ruled in the past six months . <P> The result is a wrecked economy : <P> The coffee crop is the poorest on record , down an estimated $9,000,000 from 1956 . <P> The public debt pushes $65 million . <P> The tourist trade hit a severe slump . <P> Domestic business sagged sharply . <P> The U.S. is prepared to give assistance , and experts in Washington stood ready last week to fly to Port-au-Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of aid could go very far . Sending the Marines was out of the question in the era of the Good Neighbor , but the U.S. Embassy might call in the Haitian politicians and hammer the desk , then sweeten the harsh words with promises of large-scale aid if they would unite patriotically to save their country .
