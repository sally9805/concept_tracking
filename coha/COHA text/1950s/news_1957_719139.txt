By BENJAMIN FINE Rnecht/ to The New lrork Times . LITTLE ROCK , Ark. , Sept. 10 ? The United States Government began court action today against the Governor of Ar-kansas , The Government served Gov . Orval E. Faubus with a summons to appear in Federal court on Sept , 20 , He must explain his use of National Guard troops in the dispute over racial integration of the schools of Little Rock , The Governor called out the National Guardsmen after the original court order to integrate the school . Negroes have been prevented from attending the all-white Central High School since it opened Sept. 3 . Several hundred rhembers of the Natioxall Guard and Air National Guard have surrounded the school . The nine Negro students who tried to get in were turned back . Guard Will Remain In the two weeks since he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald N. Davies has issued three separate orders against any interference with the school board 's program of gradual integration . At a news conference in the late afternoon , Governor Faubus said that the National Guard would remain in front of the school through Sept. 20 . It will be lessened in number , he said . Governor Faubus insisted that he did not intand to defy the courts . He said he would not be a " process dodger . " Asked about the possibilities of outside contacts , perhaps with the White House , to resolve the islue before the court action begins , the Governor answered : " If there were any negoUations I would not , disclose them now . " Governor Gets Writ , The petition citing Governor E'aubus for his interference with the Federal , Court was delivered by Tepeementatives of the Attorney General of the United States at 1.0 o'clock this morning . Within an hour Judge : Davies had signed a summons , asking for a temporary injunction s.gaintit the Governor 's us , of troops , and demanding that it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served on the Governor at once . Similar orders were also served on Maj. Gen. Sherman T. Clinger , s'cate militia head , and Lieut . Col. Marion E. Johnson , unit commander . The Governor has insisted that the troops were rushed to the high school on the eve of its opening to prevent violence and bloodshed . He said that caravans of people were descending upon the city for that purpose . Judge Davies has re // jetted the Governor 's arguments . Yesterday the/ judge ordered Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. , to'seek an injunction against the Arkansas Governor . The judge acted after receiving a 400-page report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation , describing conditions . that exist in this community as they relate to integration and violence . The Governor has been in virtual seclusion in his heavilyguarded mansion since Wednesday morning . Shortly before non United States Marshal R. Beal Kidd drove up to the executive mansion , closely followed by reporters and photographers . The marshal carried the legal document with him . Marshal Is at Ease The marshal , dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , walked to the gates of the well-guarded mansion . He came face to face with Lieut . Col. Hobart Copeland of the National Guard . Mr. Kidd showed the officer his credentials . " Come in , sir , " the colonel said . The marshal entered slowly . The gate closed quickly behind him , leaving reporters clinging to the iron picket fence , peering at the palatial home of the Governor . As Mr. Kidd stared along the gravel driveway in the yard , the front door of the mansion opened . Governor Faubus , dressed in a blue suit and tie to match , suddenly came into view . He walked across the lawn , heading toward the man with the summons . About halfway from the mansion the two men met . The United States Marshal handed the Governor of Arkansas what may become a historic legal document . They shook hands and departed . Governor Faubus turned and walked slowly toward his mansion . The marshal returned to the curving gravel walk and went through the gate . He seemed relieved ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . The two men are friends . Before the Governor reached his mansion door , several of the reporters called out : " How about a statement , Mr. Governor ? " Governor Faubus turned around , waved a hand toward the reporters , and with his characteristic broad smile an-swered : " I 'm more afraid of the press than of the marshal ! " Thus the United States Government had taken the first step to break the impasse that has created tension and strife in this Southern city . The fight between the United States and the State of Arkansas would now go to the courts . While the Governor was being served , two deputy marshals , Bob Powell aria Ira Butterfield sought out the National Guard officers who had been named in the suit of United States versus Governor Faubus . The marshals rode to the Central High School , the scene of all this disturbance . The ' guardsmen were lolling in the ' noonday sun . They ? rested , easily , under the shady trees in front of the school . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached the officers that the marshals were approaching . The men cam , quickly to attention . They lined the sidewalk in front of the school in proper military precision . Colonel Johnson got up from the tree stump where he had been sitting , chatting with Guardsmen and reporters . As the marshals approached , Colonel Johnson arose and said , " Hi , Bob . " " Hi , colonel , " Mr. Powell answered . " I have something for you . " He Teed the court orde ... The colonel and the men around him listened attentively . " Do you know where General Clinger is ? " Mr. Powell asked when he had finished . " No , I do n't , Bob , " answered Colonel Johnson . " It 's been a long time since I 've seen you , " Mr. Powell remarked . " Yes , it has , " the colonel answered . That was all . The marshal then left . Service was later mande on General Clinger . The petition of the United States was signed by Osro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States as amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) . The petition , stripped of its legal language , cited the Governor on these counts : 1 . The court had approved the integration of the Little Rock schools on Aug. 28 , 1956 . The order had been approved by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on April 26 , 1957. 2 . The Governor had ordered General Clinger to keep Negro students out of Central High School . 3 . The court on Sept. 3 , 1957 , issued an order against interference with the integration program . 4 . On Sept. 7 , 1957 , the court denied the board of education a delay in putting its integration program into effect . The petition of the United States said : " The acts of Governor Faubus , General Clinger and Lieutenant Colonel Johnson in preventing , by means of said units of the Arkansas National Guard , Negro students eligible under said plan of school integration to attend said school , from doing so , obstruct and interfere with the carrying out and effectuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sept. 3 , 1957 , contrary to the due and proper administration of justice . " The action against ' the Governor and the National Guard officers , the petition said , is taken " to protect and preserve the integrity of the judicial process of the courts of the United States and to maintain the due and proper administration of justice . " In his order , Judge Davies asked that the Governor and Guard officers be prevented from " the continued obstruction of , and interference with , the carrying out and effectuation of the orders of this court . " He said : " Summons and a copy of said petition and of this order shall be served forthwith upon said Governor Faubus , General Clinger and Lieutenant Colonel Johnson . " The hearing was set for 10 A. M. on Sept. 20 . On Sept. 19 the court is to hear the case concerning the four Arkansas integration laws adopted at the last session of the State Legislature . Ten Negro ministers have challenged these laws as unconstituClonal and as circumventing the United States Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davies left for Fargo , N. D. , this afternoon . He said that after he disposes of some court business there , he will attend his daughter 's wedding and return to Little Rock on Sept. 19 , in time for the hearings on integration . Many questions remain to be resolved before the Little Rock integration problem is finally settled . The Attorney General in his petition , and the judge in his order , did not ask for a temporary restraining order . As a result , the Negroes will continue to he barred until the 20th at least . If the judge grants the temporary injunction at that time , he can follow that with a hearing on a permanent injunc-tion , Because no restraining order was issued , the Governor can , as he has decided to do , keep the guard in front of the school and bar the Negro students . It is not known what will happen to the Negro students in the meantime . If they are barred from Central High School for the next several weeks or months , their education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak 270 Guardsmen were at the school . During the quiet week-end a token force of fifteen was stationed there . The Governor said that he could reduce the number now because tensions had decreased . It is ** that : any of the Negro students will attempt to enter the white school until the court action has been settled . In addition to the nine who attempted entry , there was a tenth student who was eligible but did not join in the entry attempt . Even the granting of a temporary injunction on the 20th will not remove the final legal resource of the Governor . He can appeal to a higher court . If the appeal is won , the troops will then remain here as long as the Governor wants them to , the Negroes can be barred permanently . It would mean , authorities here indicate , a complete victory for the Governor 's segregationist policy . However , if Governor Faubus loses his appeal , Judge Davies could cite him for contempt of court . Two courses would then be open : to try him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he obeys . Or lie could try him for criminal contempt , and give him a jail sentence . If Governor Faubus ignores the judge 's injunction , and refuses to go to court to defend himself , the judge might still sentence him . However , the question would then remain to be answered : who would see that Governor Faubus actually serves his jail sentence ' ? Who would escort the Governor to the jail ? The Governor has indicated , on several o7casions even as late as this morning , that he is willing to meet with responsible authorities to find a solution . He quickly accepted the suggestion of the Governor of Massachusetts that a committee of governors he created to help find an answer . The situation at the Central High School was quiet this morning . Less than 100 persons attended the morning demonstrations , which have taken place daily since the school opened on Sept. 3 . There were about 200 gua- ? is present , thus having two guards for each person here . The tension of yesterday seemed to have dissipated itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst of jeers and catcalls . A Negro reporter , Moses Newsom , of Memphis , Tenn. , who said he was a correspondent of The Afro-American News in Baltimore , tried to get on to the school grounds . He was greeted with an outburst of such shouts as : " Go home , you black nigger . " " We do n't want you here . " The guards quickly escorted Mr. Newsom from the area . The guards had also removed a Negro reporter who said he was from The Amsterdam News of New York , Alvin Nall , when he appeared here yesterday . It was made clear that no Negroes , whether students or others , would be permitted into this area . We want to avoid an incident , " the officer said . " The presence of any Negroes here will excite this crowd . " Governor Faubus announced that he would give a report to the people of the state tomorrow . Every radio station in Arkansas will broadcast a fifteen-minute address at 12:15 P. M. This will be followed by forty-five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
