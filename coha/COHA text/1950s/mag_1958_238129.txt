If set too low , a strict ceiling on military spending could disastrously weaken the nation 's defenses . But a ceiling that is merely uncomfortable can have beneficial results : it can force military leaders to cut down on overlap , make choices between concepts and weapons . Defense Secretary Neil McElroy , backed up by the President , has tried to hold the 1960 defense budget to a distinctly uncomfortable $41.6 billion , i.e. , this year 's level plus a 2% inflation factor . And one result of the painful ceiling is that the Pentagon is taking hard-eyed looks at duplication and obsolescence among the U.S. 's twoscore missile programs . <P> The Air Force announced last week that it is canceling its air-to-ground missile Rascal , now surpassed by the longer-range Hound Dog . Due soon , on orders from the President , is an appallingly long-delayed decision between the rival liquid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missiles , the Air Force 's Thor and the Army 's Jupiter . Last week 's splendid 6,300-mile performance by Atlas may also firm a tentative decision to slow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile Titan . Also to be cut back or discarded : the Navy 's unreliable Vanguard , the Army 's reliable but bulky Redstone . <P> But the big decisions that budget-making forces upon military leaders are not choices between similar weapons but choices between radically differing weapons , differing concepts . This year more than in any year since the New Look ferment of 1953 , fresh concepts are shaping the defense budget . Among them : <P> Leaping a Generation . Nagging the Air Force is a vast and worsening aircraft and missile obsolescence problem . Today the heavy-wallop weapons are the B-52 and B-47 . Around the corner is a new generation : the B58 bomber , Atlas , Titan . But a few years beyond these , the Air Force sees a radically different weapons system of Minuteman solid-fuel missiles , ready for rapid launching from invulnerable underground nests ( TIME , March 10 ) . Under the pressure of the budget ceiling , Air Force brains are asking : Why sink most of our development and procurement funds over the next few years into B-58s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builds up ? Why not divert some of that money into speeding up Minuteman ? With that idea in mind , the Air Force wants to spend more than ten times as much on Minuteman in 1960 as it is spending this year-$250 million v. $22 million . B58 procurement will probably slow down ; the Titan program may shrink drastically . <P> Downgrading the IRBM . With NATO allies except Britain and Italy showing scant enthusiasm for U.S.-offered intermediate-range missiles , the Pentagon is reappraising the worth of the IRBM , designed for launching from overseas sites , as against the intercontinental missile , designed for launching from U.S. bases . Trend : more reliance on ICBMs , less on IRBMs , which would be of little use in a limited war and would be vulnerable to Russian attacks on overseas bases in an all-out war .
