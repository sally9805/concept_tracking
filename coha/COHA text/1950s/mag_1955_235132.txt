Vaccine Snafu <P> Sir : <P> I suggest that the article on the mishandling of the Salk vaccine , under the heading " Medicine " May 16 , would have been more appropriate under " National Affairs , " " Business " or " Theater " - for obvious reasons . Should not the whole tragic circumstance point a moral-that medical problems be handled by the medical profession and not by pressure groups , large organizations with axes to grind , or politicians who are always willing to " rush in " ? <P> R. K. BEHRNS , M.D. Mount Vernon , Wash . <P> Sir : <P> ... Is it not ironical that a few supposedly " intellectually acclimatized " politicians are able , in a few short weeks , to make a shambles of the painstakingly thorough job of research Dr. Salk and his staff conducted during the vaccine trials ? <P> As an educator , I feel that we face one crisis greater than the shortage of scientific personnel ; that is a surplus of politicians . <P> ARTHUR F.

TIME FAILED TO MENTION , HOWEVER , THAT HIS HAMMY ANTICS ARE JUST INCIDENTAL TO THE FACT THAT HE IS THE MOST CAPABLE GOVERNOR IN THE 48 STATES . <P> HAROLD F. EBERLE PRESIDENT <P> OAKLAND YOUNG REPUBLICANS OAKLAND , CALIF . <P> SIR : <P> I DISAGREE WITH YOUR STORY ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA . THE STORY WAS COMPLETELY WRONG IN SAYING " KNOWLAND IS ... LEAST FAVORITE SON . " SENATOR KNOWLAND HAS HELD MORE PUBLIC OFFICES AND PARTY POSITIONS THAN NIXON AND KNIGHT PUT TOGETHER . HE HAS BEEN AN OFFICEHOLDER LONGER AND BY FAR THE BEST VOTE-GETTER , INCLUDING THE CHIEF JUSTICE , IN OUR STATE 'S HISTORY . . . <P> ROBERT HUBBELL PRESIDENT <P> UNIVERSITY YOUNG REPUBLICANS U.C.L.A. LOS ANGELES <P> Sin in Galveston <P> Sir : <P> What does Stockholm have that Galveston May does n't have ? Why not legalize all crime and make Galveston the cleanest city in the U.S.-with no crime rate at all !

E. MCCLELLAND GALVESTON , TEXAS <P> Sir : <P> Rarely has an article aroused so much public criticism as " Sin &; Sweden " . . . <P> I wonder whether the American readers ponder as much about " Sin in Galveston . " Or is this different since " sin is good for business , " and since it is a " biological necessity " for some places . . . ? <P> HANS-MARTIN BURKHARDT Pforzheim , Germany <P> Sir : <P> The sin-loving residents of Galveston who justify licentious behavior by discarding the basic precepts of morality can only be pitied . <P> Their double-standard democracy based on materialistic philosophy might be welcomed by our Communist neighbors but not by a Government and society that believe in the integrity of Christianity . <P> BARBARA R.
