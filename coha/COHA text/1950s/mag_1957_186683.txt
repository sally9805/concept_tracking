Little as he may have sought the distinction , no man in recent years has done so much to stimulate European progress as Gamal Abdel Nasser . Living luxuriously on the memory of the day when Britain and Western Europe between them produced three-quarters of the world 's industrial energy , most Europeans complacently accepted the fact that Britain must import 12% of her total energy requirements and Western Europe nearly a quarter . But when Egypt 's Nasser seized the Suez , he forced all Europe to face up to the significance of these imports : Europe had lost her industrial independence and , with it , much of her power and security . <P> Shortly after the Suez invasion , and quite independent of it , Europe 's Little Six , the Euratom countries , * set up a committee of three experts to study Europe 's future energy supply . Last week the three brought in a surprisingly bold 20-page report . <P> By implication they went far beyond U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold , who recently suggested that " an appreciable proportion " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydroelectric and other conventional power sources . Europe today abounds in such schemes , including one for an interchange of electricity between Britain and France by submarine cable ( Britain 's peak load occurs at 8 a.m. , France 's at noon ) . Even if all these schemes were exploited to the fullest , warned the three experts , the six European nations would have to double their fuel imports within ten years , treble them within 20 . <P> The answer is the atom-which , declared France 's Louis Armand , one of the three , " will change our way of life just as much as the introduction of the potato . " Noting that Britain has already launched a nuclear-energy program which by the end of 1965 will be producing roughly a quarter of Britain 's electricity , the three experts said that the Euratom countries must do likewise . Since their population is three times Britain 's , their target must be substantially greater . They called for 15 million kw of nuclear electricity by 1967 . <P> To meet their ambitious target , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ante up more than $6 billion . Even so , a decade hence , Europe , said the three , will still be far from self-sufficient in power . <P> <P> * West Germany , France , Italy and the Benelux nations .
