Every season or so there is a box-office phenomenon like South Pacific , The Music Man or My Fair Lady , and a yowl is heard across the land  --  " It 's impossible to get tickets ! " The season 's new favorite is THE SOUND OF MUSIC ( LUNT-FONTANNE , 46TH STREET west of Broadway ) , about which I will have more to say next week . The show has one theater party booked , by the Bowater Paper Company , for next June 27 . For this month alone 29 parties and benefits have been booked  --  and there will be only 35 performances ! Up to now 300 parties have been scheduled , and more are coming . This does not necessarily mean that the entire house has been sold to groups ; sometimes only the orchestra or part of the orchestra is taken . But , still , how do you get tickets ? // The most direct thing to do is to go to the box office and offer the man your money . Another way of doing it is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of the theater . Send it to the theater with a self-addressed , stamped , return envelope . Specify alternate dates  --  or , best of all , say " for the first available performance . " Do n't be too choosy , either . Mail-order staffs are as literal as baseball umpires , and if you say " fifth row center " you may have your check returned to you . Remember that every seat to a hit is a good seat and give the box office some leeway if you want fastest action . // Another method is to go to a broker  --  best of all , I think , when you plan a night on the town and want to see a show . Not one particular show , but one of several . This keeps you from making a decathlon event out of it , and it saves taxi fares or shoe leather shopping from theater to theater until you get what you 're after . If the broker is all out of one show he 'll have another , and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will charge $1.38 over the price of each ticket . // In a case of desperation or what-the-heckishness , like entertaining a big client or being so rich you do n't care , there 's the speculator who can magically turn up a good , fast pair for $25 or $50 or $100 . The scalper is hounded by the law and is supposed to be an outcast , but he is a handy guy to have around in an emergency , and I have always thought he should be permitted to operate legally for big sports events and Broadway . After all , the speculator does n't take money from you at the point of a gun  --  you offer it to him . How do you find him ? Ask your friend  --  everybody has one  --  who tells you on the sly the outlandish price he paid the last time he went to the theater. // The ticket-getting business started to become complicated when do-gooders started doing good . In a fit of righteousness we outlawed the brokers ' " buy , " and I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys  --  Leo Newman , one of the McBrides and others  --  would go to Atlantic City for the tryout of a new Ziegfeld show . If they liked it they would tell Ziegfeld that they would buy , cash in advance , half or maybe three-quarters of the orchestra for eight weeks or 16 weeks . This gave Ziegfeld , or any other manager , the money to pay off with . // Sure , some of the tickets were scalped , but about 95% of them were sold for the legitimate fee plus commission , which used to be half a dollar , no tax . // When the buy was outlawed a new kind of scalping was created  --  the theater party for charity . I would be happy to see it outlawed . So would show people ( except those in the business end ) , who hate benefits . They say the organized audiences are too noisy , too unresponsive or too resentful . I have my own further objection to them : benefit prices are too steep for young people , so the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun to sit in a theater filled with old poops like me. // The theater-party business has been developed by , and is in the hands of , a small group of women . These include Anne Herschkowitz , Elsa Hoppenfeld , Mildred Kaplan , Annette Schein and Lenore Tobin . They are shrewd judges of box-office values , and they gamble on their judgment by buying tickets in blocks . Sometimes they get a small discount from the theater . Tickets arranged for or in hand , they go to their clients  --  which may range from the Vassar alumnae to Octavus Roy Cohen 's legendary Sons and Daughters of I Will Arise  --  and they will say , " Why do n't you have a benefit ? " // I have before me a list of all the parties slated for The Sound of Music . For next month it starts off : January 4 E for evening Hoppenfeld ; January 5 Hoppenfeld ; January 6 M for matinee Hoppenfeld , Herschkowitz ; January 6 E Larric ; January 7 Tobin ; January 8 Hoppenfeld ; January 9 M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is down for 21 performances during January and February . Of $2,250,000 reported already on hand or promised for Mary Martin 's show , $1 million comes from theater parties . // My tickets for the opening of the musical were free , of course , but they were marked $9.90 . If I need a pair for January 9 I know where I can get it  --  for $70 . The " scalper " is the very social and wealthy Lucia Chase  --  but she is doing her scalping for a worthy and tax-deductible cause . She is having a benefit for the American Ballet Theatre , of which she is codirector. // Most of you receive theater-party invitations , and it is one way of getting tickets . And most of us have some pet charities or belong to social or religious organizations which will be throwing parties . The price will be steep , but the bait is this : you can use your " contribution " as a legitimate donation on your tax returns . // So if you are desperate for tickets you ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't latch on to you . // Two of this new season 's plays which have been enjoying considerable public favor have strong male leads . One is THE GANG 'S ALL HERE ( AMBASSADOR , 49TH STREET west of Broadway ) in which Melvyn Douglas gives a carefully and admirably studied portrait of an easygoing United States president . In the other , GOLDEN FLEECING ( HENRY MILLER , 43RD STREET east of Broadway ) , Tom Poston plays a slick but likable scamp who has figured a way to let the Navy help him break the roulette bank at the Lido in Venice . // Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee , who had a solid success with their semifactual account of the Scopes " monkey " trial , Inherit the Wind , have again gone to history for The Gang 's All Here . This is the story about a man who gets maneuvered into the White House even though he does not want the job and does not consider himself qualified . Once in office , he appoints his poker-playing cronies to high positions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors have carefully made everything look fictitious , but there is an obvious parallel between the plight Douglas finds himself in and the troubles " the Ohio gang " got Warren G. Harding into . Douglas ' performance is splendid , and the rest of the cast have high ability . // In Golden Fleecing , Tom Poston is playing with all his drollery in an out-and-out farce by Lorenzo Semple Jr . Semple has imagined that some ships of our Navy are visiting Venice and one of the vessels contains a fabulous electronic computer . By ship-to-shore signals he puts the high-voltage brain to work figuring out the odds on rouge et noir . One girl and Poston fall into the Grand Canal , and absolutely everybody gets into hot water with the admiral . Poston is just right in such slippery monkeyshines , and he voices a statement that has become one of my mottoes . He calls it Murphy 's Law . It is : " If something can go wrong , it will .
