ONE steaming day in the summer of 1947 , the kind when humans wilt like a New England boiled dinner , Capt . Joseph F. Meskill was wilting worse than most . The captain had to make a speech , which he does well enough , but unhappily . It was far better than being on a seventy-five-foot ladder fighting a seven-story fire , but the captain would have felt more assured there . For a modest man , he had a tough assignment . He was talking to the Philadelphia Safety Council about an outfit called Rescue Squad No. 1 , of which the forty-six year-old fire captain is commander . The generalities were easy enough . Rescue 1 is a special unit of the Fire Bureau , which deals in snatching humans out of all manner of perilous and painful fixes . A steeplejack goes limp in his bos'n 's chair on a chimney high above the city ; Rescue 1 gets him down and revives him . Fumes from a refrigerating system spread through an apartment house , a factory or an entire neighborhood . Rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen to all who need it  --  it may include an excited bystander or two  --  finds the leak and seals it . A carboy of carbolic acid breaks ; the squad spreads soda . Somebody fumigates a building and is tardy about getting out ; exterminators get wrapped up in their work and all but exterminate themselves . Rescue 1 brings them to safety . An apparently strong man pitches over at the breakfast table with a heart attack ; a young girl with lungs weakened by polio is suffocating from pneumonia ; a blue baby must be rushed to a hospital  --  they are all in Rescue l 's line of duty . Fire breaks out in the hold of a ship , and the firemen are overcome ; a rescue squad goes in after them , damning all general cargoes , which can combine the most innocent materials and produce fumes that would do excellently for chemical warfare . The. , tiquad 's work , Meskili could say , is a fanciful mixture of the rugged and the delicate  --  work one day for a lumberjack , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of safety engineers , and what he needed was a couple of simple examples of rescues in industry . Something to show that trouble takes sudden and wily forms these complex days , and is best handled by professional rescuers , with their special equipment and their skill in improvising solutions when minutes mean lives . Meskill was wearing himself out trying to think of hypothetical examples of the unexpected , and except for fiction writers , that 's tough . He finished , went back to Fire Headquarters and met Rescue 1 just returning from a call . The run would have served admirably as the illustration Meskill needed , except for one fact . Armed with $3000 worth of assorted hardware to breach walls , to pry , pull , lift , cut , burn , to untangle any snarl of timber or metal , often with a human being as part of the puzzle , Rescue 1 had used only the most primitive tools . Two workmen had been emptying a tank car of transformer oil  --  tricky stuff that can give off dangerous fumes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped inside to clean the car . The railroad siding was only slightly cooler than Death Valley at high noon ; inside the car , the heat and fumes were literally unbearable . The workman looked blank and fell on his face in the oil . His companion yelled for help and went to his aid . In proof of the point Meskill had been trying to make  --  that rescue is for professionals  --  he passed out beside his mate . Somebody ran for firemen from a fireboat moored nearby . The first fireman went in without a gas mask . Now there were three in the oil , which was deep enough to drown a fallen man . A second firemandonned a mask , but it was the wrong kind or got knocked askew . He added himself to the stack . Rescue 1 got there with the proper masks , but , as usual , there were unusual complications . The breathing bag and canister on the cheat made a man too bulky to go through the hatch . Time was everything ; four men were in imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a lasso . Another seized a ceiling hook , carried to pull down plaster and lath in getting at fires . He used it now to fish for prisoners . As he raised one of their arms or legs , his mate dropped the loop over it . Head first or feet first , the four were hauled out . Put under resuscitators and drained of oil , all four came around fairly quickly . All firemen deal in rescues , just as all doctors sometimes treat accident victims . Rescue 1 simply specializes in them . It is the oldest of four such outfits in Philadelphia ; there are similar units in almost every big city . Rescue 1 is stationed in Fire Headquarters at 1328 Race Street , a few blocks from Philadelphia 's City Hall . The twenty-six square miles it covers include the principal business district , the most heavily populated office buildings , the biggest stores , many of the largest industries . The Fire Bureau calls this the " high-value district , " which is another way of saying it is the region where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meskill 's crew is thirty men , divided into three platoons , each on duty eight hours . When the man on watch bawls , " Hike-out , rescue ! " an officer and six or seven men pile into the squad 's big red van . They get into it fast , it being Meskill 's wry observation that the only place firemen are sure of making speed , these days of big-city traffic congestion , is in the firehouse itself . If a few seconds count , they gain them there . " Hike-out , rescue ! " is an announcement rather than a command . A hike-out is a run ; " rescue ! " simply designates the outfit that will handle this particular foul-up . Equipped , the van cost $25,000 , but there is nothing to show for it . The thick walls are compartments ; this is a big rolling tool chest with one compartment allotted to the men . On the scene , the rescuers snap open the right bins and haul out rope , sledges , hammers , chisels , mechanical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pneumatic drilla to pierce metal or masonry . Other compartments hold gas masks and oxygen , asbestos Suits to fight fires of tremendous heat , acetylene torches , cable , bolt and rivet cutters , resuscitators , stretchers , blankets and heating pads . Rescue 1 is ready to cope with everything from the marsh gas that kills sandhogs tunneling far below ground to fires that trap victims beyond the reach of the longest ladders ; for that the van carries a life gun like those used by the Coast Guard . The van 's own generator provides power for drills , saws , searchlights and floodlights . Better by far than any of this equipment , the van carries men who can improvise and ad-lib . Most of them know a trade ; the roster Includes a former railroad brakeman and a locomotive engineer , handy in case of railroad , subway or trolley wrecks , an ironworker , a welder , a molder , a machinist or two , a carpenter , a life guard , a ahlpfitter and a tree surgeon . Resourcefulness and that uncommon quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a thousand pieces of equipment aboard , the rescue may have to be performed with somebody 's penknife . That was the case about midnight one night in the grounds of a big refinery . It was a fairly typical auto-wreck rescue , although every wreck is a freak . This was a cautious race to free a man who should have been dying . He was n't , but there was no way to know that . He had driven a company truck on the railroad track exactly in time for s Diesel locomotive to hit it as squarely as a ballplayer connects for a home run . What the squad found could be identified as a truck chiefly because the back wheels had stayed on . The locomotive had seized the cab of the truck and pushed it along like a snowball ; the cab lay Partly on and partly off the tracks , crumpled like an empty cigarette package . The driver 's seat was bottom-up and still recognizable . Now it was a roof for the driver , who had traveled at least the last Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prePosterous shuffle of wreckage had kept something under his head in this savage slide . Knives and Cleavers of broken glass , spears and needles of metal , had missed him . Outside of a broken leg , he was remarkably intact , although the only way to determine that was to get him out as fast as possible . Meskill 's men could squeeze into the wreckage , at one point , and look down on the victim 's face . After some work they could take him by the shoulders . But they could n't free him ; a snarl of metal held one foot close to the locomotive , the leg raised as if he had been doing calisthenics . Lt. Bob Herd crawled in beside the locomotive wheels and began lifting the wreckage with jacks , shoring it with blocks of metal and wood . in time he had a tunnel a man could slide into . Then they saw that the wreckage was gripping the heavy sole of a work shoe . That was cut loose with a penknife , and they snaked out the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrific impact , let alone how he survived that wild ride ahead of the locomotive . Being caught by a foot is surprisingly common , and more trouble than the wrecks in which someone is pinned by the steering wheel . The squad usually can get at the steering column with a saw . When brake and clutch pedals have folded into a tight trap it 's more awkward ; the rescuers sometimes have to cut those with a torch . No Iwo wrecks are much alike . At times the whole car can be lifted off the victims in one jumbled piece ; at other times it must be taken apart like a perverse pile of jackstraws . Very often the whole thing , including the passengers ' clothing , is drenched with gasoline . Often it is necessary to use torches in spite of the danger of fire . A hose company stands by , but it 's nerve-racking for all concerned . A job over which Rescue 1 held its breath must have looked exceedingly innocent to by-passers . A car had nosed up on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat there motionless . He did n't move because he could n't . Two weeks earlier he had been injured in a more serious accident . Now something had snapped out of place in his back . Almost totally paralyzed , he did manage to turn off the ignition . Police were afraid any attempt to move him might be fatal . Rescue 1 did it by sliding a light strong board behind him , lashing him firmly at hips and arms , and lifting him out as cautiously as if handling the most sensitive high explosive . The job won them a boost , as they say , from doctors at the hospital . As craftsmen in first aid ? " Some of our fellows are artists , " Meskill says with satisfaction  --  that is praise they relish . It makes up , too , for the berating they often take from indignant citizens who think the rescuers are a little slow in getting somebody out , when they take time to splint and bandage before they extricate . Accounted an expert at his unusual trade , Meskill has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEATH EVERY DAY ( Continued from Page 21 ) like a doctor 's bedside manner , a cultivated calm assurance that gives confidence to the victim . The best medicine , he is convinced , is to see the rescue squad going about its work with obvious competence . He and his men are fairly tough-minded ; a rescue worker who let suffering unnerve him would be no good . But a rescue in which a child is involved gets them , and they never work more nimbly . Often it 's a little heart-rending . One raw March day , Rescue I was called to the edge of the Philadelphia mill district , where the Reading Railway tracks run down the street . Boys had been playing near the tracks , and as a freight train rumbled past , one gave another a playful shove . The push sent the boy reeling and he fell backward across one of the rails . The train was stopped with one wheel on him ; one leg was off below the knee , the other would come off above it . His tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shock as an opiate . The job , clearly enough , was to prevent him from bleeding to death in the course of rescue . The squad always keeps it in mind that the rescuing itself can be fatal unless adroitly handled ; this was such a case . Two firemen crawled beside the boy from opposite directions . Others put the van 's heaviest jacks under the train to lift the wheel . Amid these preparations , the boy asked what hospital he would he taken to . " Good , " he said when they named one nearby . " That 's only a short walk from home . " A few minutes later he asked the firemen to pray with him , " for my legs . " They prayed , although it was a prayer that would n't be answered . One of the rescuers lay beside the boy 's right leg , the other beside the left . As the wheel rose , they clamped on tourniquets . Then they eased a stretcher under the boy and hurried him to a hospital . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it any better . To make speed cautiously , to do heavy work with sledges and torches , and yet do it delicately , is the toughest part of their work . " You ca n't rush , much as you 'd like to , " says Meskill . " You 've got to be so terrible careful . " Often , to make it tougher , they ca n't see the prisoner they are trying to rescue . A freight elevator broke the chains with which repair men had lashed it while they removed the cables . Knocking one of the men into the pit , the elevator slammed on him like a massive cork . The mighty swat had n't killed him and he could make himself heard through the thick plank flooring . The elevator could n't be jacked . Explaining what they were going to do , " Ho the electric saw would n't scare him to death , " Meskill 's men cut out a plank against the elevator wall , working gingerly , because there is no telling what position the injured may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man located , they ripped half the floor out fast . It was Easter morning , and the whine of their saw drowned out the bells calling well-dressed crowds to downtown churches . Elevators provide some of the hardest rescues and some of the easiest . Getting passengers out of a stalled car is not much of a trick . " There 's no danger at all unless they get alarmed and hurt each other , " is Meskill 's reassurance to those who worry about this misadventure . Often the squad can raise or lower the car manually to the nearest floor , sometimes the marooned riders are taken out the escape hatch on top . Rescue 1 is prepared to breach any wall and cut its way into any elevator car , but never has had to take action so drastic . It has removed prisoners from the small space between car and wall , accomplished by springing the car with jacks . It 's rarely that anyone comes out of that trap alive , and even rarer when he can tell what happened to put him there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release one screaming man pinned in the shaft of a department-store freight elevator took an hour . The elevator was a platform without walls of its own ; the injured man had been carrying merchandise from an opening in the sidewalk to a subbasement . Getting on at street level , he pulled a heavy package truck on behind him  --  a high-sided box on wheels , almost as big as the elevator itself . Beside it , not in front of it , was the safest place for the operator , but like so many of the squad 's clients , he took a chance . Turned a little cater-cornered , the package truck would jam in the shaft . It was n't on straight , and as it scraped the building wall , it turned sharply . The man 's body served as a wedge . He turned to see what the trouble was and a corner of the truck pinned him to the wall of the shaft . Pinned him so tightly , indeed , that man and truck hung there as the elevator went on down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street ( Continued on Page 51 ) ( Continued from Page 52 ) level . The solid front of the truck held him from chest to ankles . Meskill called for a fire truck and , using the ladder as the boom of a crane , put a rope under the victim 's arms and more rope about the package truck . He was lashing them even more firmly in place because the firemen would have to work in the package truck itself ; he did n't want their weight adding to the victim 's injuries , nor did he want the injured man to fall when released . His back to the wall , the prisoner watched , helpless and in great pain , as the firemen attacked the wood and reinforcing iron of the package truck with saws and acetylene torches , ripping it apart as if unpacking a big crate . The victim had been crushed into a space of not more than four inches ; he had served an hour as a living wedge , but he was taken out alive , and subsequently recovered from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all expectations . Rescue 1 must get prisoners out , dead or alive . Often there 's no telling and the squad races against time in a sort of disciplined frenzy . The odds were a thousand to one that a chimney sweep had died like a singed caterpillar in the long kitchen flue of a hospital . Something struck a spark or he may have tried to light a cigarette . Grease flared into flame , the rope of his hos'n 's chair burned , and he plunged to the bottom . The squad hopped to it and cut him out , but he was dead . It was the same story when they pried open the jaws of a big hydraulic dump truck ; the body had smashed down on the driver 's head and shoulders , catching him like a mouse in a trap . Another hopeless job took Meskill into the coal bunkers deep beneath a store to free a mangled man who had been dragged under a bucket conveyor . He was released , but only to die . But the work is not all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of victories  --  men and women hauled out of everything from grain elevators to the chimneys of outdoor fireplaces . The squad took four smart men from fourth-floor window ledges when a tank of ammonia cut loose  --  smart , because they chose the ledges , closing the windows after them , in preference to a gas the firemen hate because it can burn sweaty parts of the body like scalding water . Rescue 1 works at releasing the dead with almost the same care that it frees the living . But by far the majority of its customers live to thank their rescuers  --  the leather-factory worker with both arms caught in a buffer , the insulating man who passed out in a tiny air space beneath a roof one blistering day , the fencer with a sword through his neck , and dozens of others . Including one milk-wagon horse , one of the calmest of the lot , which seemed grateful . The horse gave the squad a surprisingly tough job at sunrise one April day by rearing in fright and plunging his right front foot between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would free the hoof , which fitted the space as if machined for it . Finally the squad cut the bumper with a torch , in spite of the fact that they were working next to the gas tank . The horse , which had been lying on its belly , got up uninjured and went about its business . Rescuing animals is n't part of the squad 's regular duties , but it had been assumed , incorrectly , that the horse was in great pain and badly frightened . The finest tool in the rescue kit is the resuscitator , the sensitive machine that supplies oxygen and takes over the job of breathing . Most of the lives saved are saved with that . Dozens of the squad 's hike-outs are to treat men and women in the throes of heart attacks , asthma , infantile paralysis and , more rarely , spinal meningitis . It is with the resuscitators that they revive the drowning , bring around fellow firemen who have taken too much smoke or fumes , and keep gas victims on this side of eternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  rescued , often , before they knew they were in danger . Typical of hundreds in rescue-squad reports is the narrow escape of Mr. and Mrs. William Justice , on a pleasant Sunday evening which might have been their last . Very much by chance , a neighbor dropped in and found Justice and his wife unconscious in the living room . Four children , the oldest nine , the youngest two months , were ill and faint in other rooms . Gas had accumulated so slowly  --  the old story  --  that by the time the Justices noticed it , they were too drowsy to save themselves . Neighbors carried the six to the lawn and began artificial respiration . The good neighbors of Rescue 1 took it from there . The squad carries enough resuscitators to work on eight persons at a time ; it clamped masks on all six of the Justices as they lay in a row . In thirty minutes all were out of danger . It was an entirely routine operation , ( Continued an Page 5(i) ( Cont Pant Page 54 ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfying one . Simply by doing its work well , Rescue 1 had averted headlines saying " Four Orphaned " or , very probably , " Six Dead . " " We never take it upon ourselves to pronounce anyone dead . " That is Meskill 's way of saying the squad will work for hours on persons fished from rivers or unconscious from gas or electric shock . The six-year-old boy who ran into a high-tension wire while frolicking atop a boxcar was burned half bald , his clothes were burned away and he was hurled to the ground . Rescue 1 could n't bring him back to life , but it sees the resuscitator perform too many near-miracles not to try hard . A deputy fire chief keeled over at a lumberyard fire from overexertion . Refusing to quit , Rescue 1 brought him back long after a competent doctor had pronounced him dead . It was to rescue fellow firemen overcome by fumes , heat , smoke or gas that the rescue squad was established in 1926 , and though its field has widened to helping citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primary duty . In fires likely to produce terrific heat or dangerous fumes it is often a rescue squad that runs in the first line . Firemen are no longer too proud to call the specialists ; the old " I can take as much smoke as you can " spirit is dying , as did too many of its exponents . No sensible chemist would mix the ingredients thrown together in many a fire  --  when a big drug house or chemical factory goes up in flames , for example  --  and it is Meskill 's opinion , as a respectful student of gas , that fumes no chemist could predict develop in the hold of a ship or in a burning warehouse . Its gas masks have always seen Rescue 1 through in safety . Even so , its men go into action wearing a line , so they can be reeled in if they topple . The squad 's " meanest jobs , " as Meskill calls the most hazardous , are those involving poisonous gases , a fairly common hazard these days . To cap leaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmetlike cap that can be drawn over the valve end of a cylinder and chained . That was added to the kit after the striking accident in Brooklyn when a tank of chlorine broke beside the air intake to a subway , affecting hundreds . The squad used this strait jacket almost the day it was unpacked , but against fluorine , when a tank of that even more savage killer cut loose on the fifth floor of a textile mill . The gas masks are some comfort in another ticklish job  --  that of destroying tanks of unidentifiedchemicals bubbling and fuming in a burning building . Meskill and a mate pitched one small drum out of a window just in time for it to explode with flames that reached the roof . An experimenting chemist had blown up his shop , and was n't around to tell them what this spirited stuff was . Rescue work is obviously risky , but then , so is every branch of fire fighting . John Rumig left Rescue 1 for an engine company . A few weeks later his old buddies lifted fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ceiling 20 by 150 feet fell on four firemen who stopped in a clothing store to investigate a simple sprinkler leak . The terrific blow broke Rumig 's back , but he lived . So far , no member of Rescue 1 ever has had to be rescued by his own teammates . They take risks , but they develop a wariness about traps . Surprisingly enough , considering how many fools he takes out of jams of their own making , Meskill has a pretty high opinion of the race . He sees a great deal of patient fortitude , for one thing , from men pinned in wreckage like butterflies on a collector 's board , from women caught in machines or buried in rubble . He likes rescue work partly because he has a fellow feeling for men in hazardous occupations . The son of a battalion chief , and the one holdout in a family of fire fighters , Meskill spent ten years as a sheet-metal worker . That took him into dozens of plants , familiarized him with industrial processes of many kinds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue work . That job , too , had its anxious moments . At work in a bos'n 's chair , Meskill fell seven floors in a department-store package chute . To make a wild ride wilder , he had been looking for a jagged edge of metal that had been knifing the strongest packages , and was scared to death he 'd find it . Meskill meets a few maniacs , but seems to feel the incidence is lower than might be expected these days . A shell-shocked veteran holed up in an office-building elevator was the challenging problem Rescue 1 encountered one night . Their quarry had beaten the building superintendent badly , but they found him sitting quietly in the closed car at the first-floor level , praying . To polite appeals to open up , he paid no attention at all . Hoping he was unarmed , except for the operator 's stool , the squad broke the glass window as discreetly as that can be done , reached in , opened the door and rushed the demented man . Intent on his praying , he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continued on Page 58 ) THE SATURDAY ( Confirmed from Page 5() That was a pleasant twist . The rescue worker 's lot , like that of the peacemaker , is not a happy one . Those the squad is saving often reward the rescuers with a clip on the jaw . Suicides who find themselves frustrated by firemen do n't always sob piteously . Some come out fighting , with an indignant yell of " Why do n't you mind your own business ? " The mildest of people slug and more often kick when being revived from gas . They 'll be grateful later , and astonished at their own behavior , but meanwhile , they 're tigers , and hard to handle . The perversity of inanimate objects has a corollary : they sometimes respond meekly to the simplest treatment , if you can hit on it . Meskill 's Little Dandy Kid Remover is one of the most useful tools in the squad 's kit . On thousands of lawns there are small iron-capped pipes leading to valves which will cut . off the water or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a toe to see if a foot will go in there . It will . The shoe catches , the child straightens himself in fright , and is caught more firmly . The firemen tried grease and oil , which rarely worked , EVENING POST and then attacked the pipe with hacksaws and chisels . It could be long , hard work , and Meskill was pestered by the conviction that there must be a simpler solution . Finally he borrowed a poker from his landlord , bent the end to a right angle . The landlord never got it back . His poker has freed dozens of trapped and frightened children . The firemen slide this simple tool down the pipe , turn it so the bent end is under the heel of the child 's shoe , and give a gentle tug . It works as neatly as a key in a lock . Children who put washers , bolts or rings of gears on their fingers invariably choose the finest steel there is . Rescue 1 removes many of these ornaments with saws , shears or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in breaking engagements , a service performed for young women who want to throw an engagement ring back into somebody 's hateful face , but ca n't get it off . Love has dwindled , they have n't . Rescue 1 obliges with its grinder . A twenty-year-old University of Pennsylvania fencer was skewered one night when the button came off his opponent 's epee . The blade pierced his neck almost to the hilt . Because the February 11 , 1950 steel was within half an inch of his spinal column , the doctors were afraid to move him , and asked Rescue 1 to trim away as much of the sword as possible . In a tense little operation , Meskill and a helper did it with the squad 's best bolt cutters . Cases like that are what Meskill means when he sighs that " you could lecture to a man twenty-one months on what he 's likely to encounter , and on his first run he 'd hit something you have n't mentioned . " And it would be just as well not to mention some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , letting loose a landslide of coal . When the dust lifted , three workmen had disappeared . Rescue 1 shoveled at full speed for three backbreaking hours . Then three grimy spectators detached themselves from the audience and approached a cop . " Are we the ones they 're looking for ? " they asked . They had stepped away , just before the supposed tragedy , to do a little loafing . The cop advised them to keep on stepping away while he broke the news . He figures he 's responsible for something distinctive in the way of rescues  --  saving three men from an infuriated rescue squad .
