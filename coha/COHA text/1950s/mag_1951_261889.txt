Parliament reconvened in somber mood last week after a five-week recess . A dark , lowering sky turned afternoon into night , and a damp mist crept into the House of Commons . M.P.s had plenty to worry about-a coal shortage , a meat shortage , the shock of rearmament on Britain 's bareboned economy . But one urgent question overshadowed the others . <P> Rumbled Winston Churchill : Did the Prime Minister have " any statement to make about the present position in the Political Committee of the U.N . General Assembly in respect to its policy towards China ? " As Clement Attlee rose to reply , M.P.s could barely see across the chamber through the gloom . A member uttered the traditional parliamentary call : " Candles ! Candles ! " Electric lights blazed . During Attlee 's ten-minute statement M.P.s sat anxiously silent . Churchill leaned forward intently , cupping a hand to an increasingly deaf ear . <P> Grave Dangers . Attlee said that Britain joined in condemning Red China 's intervention " in support of an aggressor " in Korea , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet come to consider further measures . " When Attlee finished , Churchill warned against the " grave dangers " that would result from " any serious divergencies ... between our policy and that of the United States . " Churchill was interrupted by Laborite Ellis Smith , who shouted : " We are not going to be trapped into war . " Smith and many other Britons fear that " hysterical " or " angry " U.S. diplomacy might land the U.S. ( and Britain ) in all-out war with Red China . <P> The wave of anger in the U.S. at Attlee 's statement alarmed and pained Britons . Supporters and opponents alike urged Attlee to do something quickly to soothe America . Three days later , at a Labor Party gathering in the London suburbs , Attlee foreshadowed Britain 's new defense campaign . <P> " No government can escape its responsibilities , " Attlee said , " and assuredly the Labor government will not seek to do so ... " Attlee ticked off Russia 's military might : " 175 active divisions with supporting artillery ... 25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air force of nearly 20,000 planes and the largest submarine fleet in the world . " <P> Eased Strain . Said Attlee : " A gentle Swiss philosopher who loved his fellow men summed it all up a good many years ago . He said then : ' What terrible masters these Russians would be if they should spread their rule over the countries of the south . They would bring us a pure despotism-tyranny such as the world has never known , silent as darkness , rigid as ice , insensible as bronze , decked with an outer amiability and glittering with the cold brilliancy of snow-slavery , without compensation or relief . ' That is what they would bring us. " * <P> British opinion was shifting in favor of rearmament . Said the Archbishop of York in a diocesan letter supporting rearmament : " There is no alternative unless we are prepared to be the slaves of Russian Communism . This is a time for plain speech , for there are still many who believe that fervent desire for peace is sufficient to secure it without any sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
