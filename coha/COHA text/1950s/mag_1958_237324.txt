SAIL Ho ! ( 288 pp. ) - Sir James Bisset , written in collaboration with P. R. Stephensen-Criterion ( $5 ) . <P> The bark County of Pembroke was running her easting down in the roaring forties off the Cape of Good Hope when she shipped a monstrous sea over the lee rail . Tailing onto the heavy rope of the main brace was a runty , down-cheeked lad of 16 named Jimmy Bisset . His feet swept from under him by the surge of boiling green water , he was washed overboard . His shouts were drowned in the roar of wind and sea . But he held onto the rope 's end . And the next sea washed him back aboard . As Jimmy clutched the fife rail and spat out the brine , the first mate roared : " The next time you do a thing like that , I 'll log you for attempting to desert ship ! ' ' <P> There was no such next time , and young Bisset graduated from sail to steam , eventually ( 1944 ) became the gold-encrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's greatest sea queens , Mary and Elizabeth . Now 75 and living in well-fed Australian retirement , Sir James Gordon Partridge Bisset sits in the lee of the longboat and spins a salty yarn of life in an oldtime square-rigger . On his first voyage , Bisset was seasick . The mate gave him an old-fashioned cure : a pannikin of sea water poured down his protesting gullet . Though he has never been seasick since , Commodore Bisset notes ruefully : " I have always hesitated to recommend this old-fashioned remedy to passengers in luxury liners . " Another old remedy was devised for Bisset 's dysentery . The captain 's remedies were numbered , and No. 15 was for dysentery . But the captain ran out of it . So he gave the green-faced Jimmy an arithmetically compounded dollop of No. 5 and No. 10 . It worked . <P> Bisset had six years in sail , scrambling out on the swaying yards to clew up a topgallant sail , growing calluses on his knees from holystoning the wooden decks with " Bibles " ( big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Though experiences in a square-rigger would seem to be of small use to the master of a modern liner , Bisset insists there is no better training . Any man in sail had to learn to make right decisions instantly , he argues . That Jimmy Bisset learned his lesson well is shown by his accident-free later service . On the Queen Mary he carried as many as 15,000 U.S. soldiers at a clip through the Atlantic 's sub-infested waters , ferried Winston Churchill to rendezvous with President Franklin D. Roosevelt-enough adventure for another volume . When Cambridge University gave him an LL.D. , its orator called him " navigatorum principem , tempestatum hostiumque irrisorem " - prince of navigators and scorner of danger , from both storm and foe .
