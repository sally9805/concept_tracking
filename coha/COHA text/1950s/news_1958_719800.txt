txt Two Republican Senators looked upon Sherman Adams today as a Republican political liability unless he refuted reports that he had accepted expensive gifts from a New England business man . This view was shared by Senators Charles E. Potter of Michigan and Barry Goldwater of Arizona . Both are up for reelection this year . The White House and Mr. Adams continued to decline to say whether the Assistant to the President had accepted a $700 victina coat and a $2,400 Oriental rug from Bernard Goldfine , a Boston industrialist who paid nearly $2,000 in hotel bills for Mr. Adams . James C. Hagerty , White House press secretary , refused repeatedly at a news conference this morning to go beyond " No comment , " and " I refer you to my previous statements . ' Mr. Hagerty also said he had " no comment " on the statements by the Republican Senators , who are regarded as facing rough fights for re-election . Senator Potter , a member of the Senate Republican Policy Committee said in a statement : " I campaigned against the mink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes for vicuna coats and Oriental rugs , too . Unless Governor Adams can present al fuller explanation than in the ! letter published yesterday he , has lost his usefulness to the Administration . " Mr. Adams , former Governor of New Hampshire , acknowledged in a letter to the House subcommittee investigatino ? Federal regulatory agencies that he had communicated three times with two Federal agencies on cases involving Mr. Goldfine , but said that he had neither sought nor received preferred treatment for the Bostonian . ? Senator Goldwater , former chairman of the G. 0 . P. Senatorial Campaign Committee , also noted that he had campaigned against the gifts to officials in the Administration of President Truman . Secs ' Political Liability ' In all fariness , he said , Mr. Adams should have a further opportunity to reply to the reports of the gifts . But , he went en , if there is no fuller explanation forthcoming then the chief aide to the President will become " a political liability , " and " then that becomes a problem fa : - the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no way in the world of defending Republican activities like this any more than Democratic activities , " he said . " If these charges are true , I ca n't condone that kind of action in a Republican in a position of responsibility any more than I condone similar actions among the Democrats . " We who have campaigned so much on the issue of ' cronyism ' among the Democrats can not condone such actions in our own party . " More Democrats leaped to the attack . Senator Joseph S. Clark of Pennsylvania said he lid not think Governor Adams " did anything illegal or crimir al but he acted with extremely Zad taste . " He told the Senate that the Democrats did not want " to assassinate character or be unduly critical until all the facts are in . " However , he said he failed to see any " difference between the actions " of Mr. Adams and those of Maj. Gen. Harry Vaughan and Matthew J. Connelly , former appointments secretary for President Truman . Mr. Connelly was convicted in 1956 for conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States District Court in St. Louis for a reduction in his two-year prison sentence and $2,500 fine . General Vaughan , military aide to President Truman , defended the home freezer gift on the ground that he had received it from an old friend . Mr. Hagerty said yesterday that he saw no similarity between Mr. Adams 's acceptance of hotel hospitality from an old friend and General Vaughan 's position . Senator Ralph Yarborough , Democrat of Texas , said Mr. Adams ' actions were the " highest-placed impropriety " in Washington since the Teapot Dome oil scandals of Republican President Harding 's Administration of the Nineteen Twenties . He criticized Mr. Adams for making speeches about political morality and the " mess in Washington " in the 1952 Presidential campaign . Now , it appears , he said , that instead of coming to Washington on the " good ship Mayflower ' : he was borne to town on " the gravy train . " Meanwhile , it was learned that the Special House subcommittee on Legislative Oversight had information confirming that Mr. Goldfinq had paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Massachusetts resort for Mr. and Mrs. Adams , Mr. and Mrs. Goldfine and another couple . Letter to House Inquiry Mr. Adams said in his letter to Representative Oren Harris , Democrat of Arkansas and chairman of the subcommittee , that he and Mrs. Adams were the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Goldfine at the Mayflower Hotel in Plymouth , Mass. , last year . It was understood that this occasion was in July of 1957 . Mr. Adams 's letter resulted from the disclosure by the House subcommittee that Mr. and Mrs. Adams and their son and daughter had been guests of Mr. Goldfine on several occasions in the Sheraton-Plaza Hotel in Boston from 1954 to May 5 and 6 of this year . The vicuna coat gift was raised by a reporter to Mr. Hagerty Thursday on the basis of reports from New England , where Mr. Goldfine controls several textile mills . The rug was reported by The New York Post yesterday to have been purchased by Mr. Goldfine at Macy 's , a New York department store , after it was selected by Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by a check drawn on Mr. Goldfine 's Strathmore Woolen Company of Boston , the same company whose name appears on one of Mr. Adams ' hotel bills that Mr. Goldfine paid in Boston . Strathmore was on of three Goldfine companies cited by the Federal Trade Commission in 1956 for violation of the Federal Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 . Mr. Adams conceded he had asked the then chairman of the F. T. C. , Edward F. Howrey , to make an appointment for Mr. Goldfine on this case . He also said that two years earlier , in 1953 , he had sought information from Mr. Howrey on another case for Mr. Goldfine , and that in 1956 he had the Special Council to the President , Gerald Morgan , communicate with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Two real estate companies controlled by Mr. Goldfine , the East Boston Company and the Boston Port Development Corporation , were cited by the S. E. C. for failure to file annual reports and pertinent financial data over a period of eight years . The S. E. C. carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , Mr. Hagerty was asked again whether he thought the American people had a right to know when an Assistant to the President of the United States was rumored to have received gifts of more than $3,000 and accepted hotel bills of nearly $2,000 . " I covered that fully , I believe , yesterday , " Mr. Hagerty said . " I told you what the issue was as I saw it . " " The issue " as Mr. Hagerty saw It , was the " insinuation " laid before the House subcommittee that Mr. Goldfine had received preferred treatment from the Federal agencies because of his friendship with Mr. Adams . Mr. Hagerty asserted that the " insinuations " of improper influence had been " knocked into a cocked hat . " Asked how he knew that no influence had been brought to bear , Mr. Hagerty replied , " because the Governor said it , and I believe the Governor . " Mr. Hagerty was asked about an article in The New York Herald Tribune that the Department of Justice was investigating Mr. Goldfine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I have no comment on it . I know nothing about it . But any matter like that would have to come from the Department- of Justice , not from me . " Officials available at the Justine Department said they had not heard of any investigation and could neither confirm nor deny the published report . The subcommittee will resume its hearings on Monday to question officials and former officials of the Federal Trade Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission , with which Mr. Goldfine had difficulties .
