Milivoje Arsenijevic , chief pilot of the Yugoslav airlines , eyed the horizon , paced the pavement of Zurich 's Kloten Airport , barked pointless orders to his ground crew and lived a lifetime for every minute that passed . Three years of patient planning and dreaming were at stake . The margin of error permitted one hour , the maximum time Pilot Arsenijevic could delay his plane 's flight back to Belgrade . <P> Pilot Arsenijevic did n't want to go back . People with jobs like his , which put them in frequent touch with the West , are constantly under suspicion and scrutiny behind Marshal Tito 's private iron curtain . The sight of Belgrade 's big Glavnjaca Prison , which looms just opposite their apartment , and the night screams they sometimes heard from it , had made Mrs. Arsenijevic as chronically unhappy as her husband . Their friends , the Kavics , felt the same way . Kavic was a junior pilot . Three years ago , Chief Pilot Arsenijevic had seen a way out for all of them , if only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots ' flight schedules last week revealed that the moment had come . Arsenijevic was down for his regular Belgrade-Zurich run on Tuesday . Kavic was set for an inside Yugoslavia run <P> from Ljubljana to Belgrade-on Wednesday . If both pilots ' wives and sons could be on Kavic 's plane , if the weather was right , if Kavic could alter his course and head for Zurich without attracting too much attention and if Arsenijevic could stall his take-off for one hour , then both pilots and their families could get to neutral Swiss soil . Chief Pilot Arsenijevic eyed his watch ( 30 minutes to go ) and paced . <P> Five minutes later he heard the drone of engines . A big DC-3 circled the field once and landed . Pilot Arsenijevic jubilantly rushed up to embrace his wife and their son , Dragolub , 19 . <P> Shots in the Ceiling . " We had to pull a real American gangster trick , only better , " said grinning Pilot Kavic after he had disembarked his own wife and son , 6 . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanic to go back to the luggage compartment to make sure all the baggage was safely tied down . Then I signaled young Dragolub to come to the pilot 's cabin . We locked the door . Then I pulled out my revolver and stuck it under the radio operator 's nose . He was surprised and indignant , but stopped sending . I ordered the co-pilot to change course and head toward Austria . Dragolub tied the radio operator to his seat . <P> " At this point , the mechanic , back in the luggage compartment , and the hostess noticed that something was wrong . They both rushed forward and began pounding against the door of the pilot 's cabin . I was afraid they might break their way in , so I fired three shots through the ceiling to scare them off . The passengers grew alarmed and got up from their seats . I ordered Co-Pilot Bjelanovic to do some mild acrobatics , to drive them back into their seats . Some were sick , too , I guess . <P> " When we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to contact the Kloten Airport . We have no money-we brought nothing from Yugoslavia but our clothes and our freedom . " At first , said Pilot Arsenijevic , they had thought of seeking asylum in West Germany or Austria , but finally decided on Switzerland , " to spare the American occupation forces any possible complications with their new ally , Tito .
