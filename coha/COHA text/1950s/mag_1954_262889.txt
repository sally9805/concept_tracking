Los Angeles ' independent KTLA , the first station to televise an atomic-bomb explosion ( TIME , May 5 , 1952 ) , last week unveiled what may turn out to be a fissionable little package for TV 's idea-starved programmers . The show is nothing more than good old Bingo , dressed up in a new name-Marco-and given a dog-food manufacturer ( Thoro-Fed ) for a sponsor instead of the Ladies ' Aid Society . But it has one great advantage over most audience-participation shows : every home viewer can compete every week . <P> To play Marco , a viewer picks up a special card ( limit : three ) at his grocer 's , fills it out by writing his own combination of numbers in the blank spaces ( e.g. , in the five blanks in the " M " column he may write any numbers from 1 to 25 ; under the " A " column , any from 26 to 50 ) . He sends the completed card to KTLA , keeping a duplicate for himself . <P> On the air the M.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he calls out each number , his assistant ( " Miss Marco " ) posts the number on a giant Marco card on the wall . When a line is filled , the M.C. calls it a game and announces a special phone number ( different for each game to avoid jamming circuits ) . Viewers call in if they think they have won , are kept hanging on the line until their cards are checked , then are announced as winners . ( Some first-night prizes : a TV set , a dishwasher , a trip for two to Hawaii . ) <P> KTLA 's General Manager Klaus Landsberg was amazed when the mail brought 20,000 Marco cards before the first program . After the show he began to get telegrams and calls from other TV stations asking how to set up the game . Commented Los Angeles Mirror TV Columnist Hal Humphrey gloomily and probably accurately : " . . . Intuition and past experience with the sheeplike tendencies of TV program directors lead me to believe that we have n't seen the end of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
