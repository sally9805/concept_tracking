Clip-clopping on high heels , a smartly dressed girl turned into a narrow alley behind Tokyo 's famed Ginza one morning last week , passed half a dozen tawdry sake shops and headed for a three-story building with an imposing marble entrance lettered in gold : " Jujin Hospital . " Smaller but more significant was the legend : " Home of the Japanese Society of Cosmetic Medicine . " By going to Jujin , patients can not only gain face but new faces . <P> The girl was pretty , but like most Asians she had a heavy-lidded look . At their widest , her eyes did not appear to open as wide as a Caucasian 's ; half-closed , her lids showed no crease or fold running across them , and her lashes always pointed down . Like other Japanese girls , she had been impressed by the postwar flood of U.S. movies and magazines . Instead of the traditional Japanese ideal of beauty-sloe-eyed , smooth-featured , flat-chested-many of them want to be more like their Western cousins with high noses , round eyes , curly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was 10 a.m. when Tomiko took her place in the busy waiting room . Within 15 minutes she was explaining to a doctor that she would like a double eyelid operation . Examination showed no reason why the girl should not have the operation ( technically , blepha-roplasty ) . A nurse rubbed a local anesthetic ointment onto her eyelids . By 10:45 she was in the operating room . <P> With a small hypodermic , the surgeon injected a second anesthetic , procaine , into the upper eyelid . A nurse peeled the lid back . The surgeon gripped the muscle on the inside of the eyelid with pincers , pulled it out slightly , and clamped it to the skin near the roots of the lashes at the edge of the lid . Then , with hair-thin nylon thread , he stitched the muscle down . The eyelid was rolled back , covered with a cold cloth as the surgeon went to work on the other eye . Total operating time : five minutes . <P> Tomiko waited half an hour in the recovery room for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon . He explained that her eyes would be puffy for a day or two , asked her to return each of the next two days for a check . At 11:30 the girl walked to the cashier 's window in the lobby , paid $8.33 - full price of the operation . The change in Tomiko 's face was marked . <P> Rounder &; Bigger . What Westerners think of as the slanting set of Orientals ' eyes can not be entirely changed by minor surgery , but it becomes less conspicuous after the eyelid operation ; by exposing more of the eyeballs , the operation makes the eyes seem rounder and bigger , also forces the eyelashes from slanting downward to pointing upward . Within a couple of days , Tomiko was telling her friends : " You 've got to go , too . It 's so simple , it 's almost unbelievable . " <P> Had the patient been her mother 's age , with bags under her eyes , she could have had these removed for $13.88 . Building up the bust , sometimes done with tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $83 . The Jujin surgeons ' success is attested by the fact that they do 20,000 cosmetic operations a year-70% on the eyelids , 20% to build up the bridge of the nose , often with a plastic insert ( which costs. $27.77 ) .
