In France , where literature can be a hot front-page issue , the biggest story of the week-and the year 's liveliest press brawl - raged around the blonde head of an eight-year-old poetess .

Teenager Franchise Sagan. whose short , sexy Bonjour Tristesse is an international bestseller . He brought Minou from Brittany , along with 49-year-old Spinster Claude Drouet. who had adopted the child at age of two . Then he brought out a slim limited edition containing ten poems and ten poesy-struck lett &rs.; Sample : I picked in the sky <P> One by one <P> The softest stars <P> They slipped like tears <P> On the cold cheeks of the night <P> And when there were enough <P> To flower the pillow <P> Where you roll your head <P> I tied my bouquet <P> With a slick ribbon <P> Of anguished blue . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into front-page bouquets : " Ravishing poems , sparkling with spontaneous sensations , new tingling images . " Rhapsodized Professor Pasteur Vallery-Radot , of the French Academy : " She is simply a being of genius . This is art in all its purity . " Overnight , little Minou 's reputation rose higher than the French cost of living . <P> Glory or Money ? Then the Pierre Laza reffs ' Elle ( circ. 700,000 ) , the country 's biggest women 's weekly , sent a reporter and photographer on the story . What they found made headlines not only for Elle , but also for the Lazareffs ' daily France Soir ( circ. 1,110,000 ) . <P> Under the headline : L'AFFAIRE MINOU DROUET : CHILD PRODIGY OR PRODIGIOUS IMPOSTOR ? Elle described how Mile . <P> Drouet 's tales about Minou had failed to check with neighbors , teachers and the parish priest , and how she kept prompting the moppet in the interview .

Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber 's L'Express ( circ. 75,000 ) promptly slashed at the Elle charges with double-page center spreads in defense " of that most fragile of human mechanisms : a poet . " The paper ran photostats of Minou 's green-inked scribbling , complete with its own expert 's handwriting analysis ( " imagination , energy , naive assurance " ) and psychological deductions ( " harmoniously developed , neither stupid , nor poor nor vulgar " ) . <P> At week 's end , Elle dropped all caution and prepared its coup de grace for this week 's issue . Charged Helene Lazareff : " A cruel hoax . Mile . Drouet not only thought up all of Minou 's poems but we have evidence that she also wrote them herself , in pseudo-childish handwriting .
