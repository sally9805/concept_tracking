 | " Do n't be vulgar . Oh , it 's you ! I was outside , I heard the phone , I dropped my key , I was frantic ! " " I had visions of you back at Harkness with Clif . " " I stopped at the club for a nightcap . I hated to come back here . It 's lonely . Wait till I take off my coat . You 're lonely , too ? That 's why you called . " Anice told him about the impertinent telephone girl . " You ca n't bully an institution , " said Linton . " You 'll learn . " Anice leaned again into the pillows , staring at the shadowed ceiling , rummaging for some pretext to keep Linton at ear's-length . " Linton , I wanted to ask you ? ( she had it ) ? did Clif send any word to the children ? To Guy or Marian ? If anything happened to Clif and Marian had n't been told , she 'd blame me . " " Clif would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and he said no , he did n't want to see them , there was n't time anyway , wait till he knew . " " He did n't tell me not to tell them . I could reach Marian by phone , it 's not terribly late . " " But you know what Clif wants ! " ( Dramatic , an outlet for this restlessness , her voice in the night , " Your father is in the hospital , emergency operation , it may be malignant . " She wondered whether the doctors had really said that , or whether Clif 's fear had supplied that detail ? ) " What 's the good in telling them tonight ? Giving them a bad day tomorrow ? Or is that what you 'd like , a little more suffering than you and I can do by ourselves ? There 's not an earthly thing they can do for Clif , surely they would n't comfort you much , or is it your idea to make a wake of it , the more the merrier ? Marian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours waiting for Clif to be wheeled down from the operating theater is n't the 50  | right place for an expectant mother . And Guy 's in the middle of his exams , you want him to drop everything ? Ile would n't hold your hand if he did come . " " I wo n't be blamed for not telling them ! You 'll have to take the responsibility . " " They 'll appreciate Clif 's desire to save them part of the trouble . " " Urn . " Anice gave half a laugh . " Anyway , I 'd hate to have Marian glaring at me all those hours we 'd have to sit in some dreary waiting room , no , I could n't stand it . You 're right , we 'll wait . " " I 'll stop by for you in the morning , if I may . Not much use in getting there at nine . " " You should have insisted that they tell you when they would operate , of course they knew ! " " Did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't care when you go . I mean to be there at nine .

As a matter of fact , I wish I was back there right now . I 'd feel better . Nearer Clif . Oh , Holy Christttias ! " He was blowing his nose , a ridiculous fanfare over the wire . " Good-night , " said Anice abruptly . She sat up to slide the telephone back on the lower shelf . She would n't allow Linton to cry into her ear , upsetting what control she had mustered . With a sudden movement she dropped the manuscript to the floor , snapped off the light , and flung herself full length , face down against one arm . In the morning she dressed for the day before she went Out to breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | in the small holder and then drooped . Anice tossed it into the wastebasket , turned the vial in her fingers and then laid it aside . Better not to wear a flower , a small oblation . She carried the hall telephone into the dining room , warning Kathleen not to trip over the long extension cord , and called her secretary as she drank her coffee and crumbled toast . " Mary ? I 'm sorry to disturb you at home , but I have to be at the hospital by nine . Yes , an operation , we do n't know how serious . " She paused for Mary 's shock and sympathy . " Yes , but I have n't time now ? " She gave instructions about the detouring of her appointments , Winston could handle some of them , the others would have to wait , she 'd finish the book she 'd taken home and send it down later today , she could n't say just when she 'd be able to return to the office . She 'd call toward the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary could try to reach her at the hospital , Harkness Pavilion . " I do n't know whether they allow telephone calls to a patient 's relatives , " she said . " The office force has a very cavalier way with outsiders . " Mary 's indignation salved the sting of last night 's rebuff . " Anyone as important as you , Miss Lang ! Why , they 'd have to see that you got your calls . " " I do n't feel important at all , Mary . Not in that place ! " " Oh , is n't it too bad ! " " And Mary ! I had a  --  not exactly an engagement , call it half an engagement  --  for luncheon with Mr. Burke , that new man for our western territory . He wanted me to go over the list with him . Will you leave a memo on his desk ? I think that 's all . If any promising manuscript shows up , send it to the apartment . I 'll need work to do , it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but firm , dauntless . Anice heard the admiration in Mary 's final nasal and somewhat incoherent assurance that she would carry on as well as she possibly could . The desk clerk announced that Mr. Webber was waiting . Anice packed the manuscript , her reading glasses , aspirin and handkerchiefs in the attache case , and called Kathleen as she walked down the hall . The girl had n't said a word this morning , not even to herself . She 'd wanted to hear everything Anice said to Mary . Her face , as she stopped at the doorway of the dining room , had a heavy misery in eyes and mouth which seemed to hide t lie girl 's youth . " Do n't worry , Kathleen . I 'll call you the moment I can , as soon as I see Mr. McReal . Is n't there someone you can visit ? Go to a movie . Do n't stay here mourning all day . No dinner tonight , I can stay at the hospital until nine . " " I do n't feel for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely , it 's a fine chance with both of you out . " " As you wish . " Anice made sure she had her keys , and tang for the elevator . Linton was silent , too , as the taxi rolled up the Drive , arrying them in the wrong direction , away from work , I corn life , against the heavy downward flow of all the lucky , busy men and women who could go about their ordinary affairs . Different faces at the desk and switchhoard in Harkness , the daytime shift , with the same superior indifference . Different faces and figures in the chairs of the waiting room , no group so tragic as last night 's , perhaps it was too early for tragic news to reach this floor . " There 's a room for visitors on each floor . " Linton had made some inquiry . " Clif 's room is on the fifth floor , we 're to go up there . " The fifth floor had two corridors at right angles , a I - shaped arrangement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper end of the T , as Linton pointed out at once , so chosen in order to deprive the visitors of much chance to watch what went on . " Who wants to watch ? " Anice seated herself in one of the wicker chairs , her attache case on the table at her elbow . " I 've seen too much already . " " I 'll give our names to the nurse in charge of this floor . Do n't want any delay . " Anice lifted the manuscript from the case . She had n't marked the end of her reading . None of the pages seemed familiar , she might as well start over . When Linton carne back she read steadily on , jotting down an occasional note . She knew that Linton fidgeted in an opposite chair , leafing through old magazines , rocking one foot , looking over letters from an inner pocket . Finally Anice said , not lifting her head , " You are driving me crazy , Linton . Go take a walk , go get coffee at the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble-hearted female ! How you can sit there working ! With Clif ? " " Discipline , which you do n't know the name of ! " Linton went . She heard his dry prattle to the nurse at the desk , heard the elevator door close , cutting off his voice . The rest of the morning he was in and out a dozen times , with Anice reading doggedly through the pages of the long manuscript . She refused to go out for luncheon . Linton reappeared the next time with coffee in a container , and a sandwich . " They 're sure taking their time , " he said . " Five hours , now . The nurse says everything 's okey , just a long job , transfusion , et cetera . I offered a pint and she says I 'm too old . Are you the right type ? " " No . " Anice finished the coffee , dropped the sandwich into a wastebasket.  | " Must n't be wasteful . " Linton fished it out , smoothing the waxed paper envelope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . Anice worked on , aware under the process of reading and judging of the complex varying activity in the building ; she did not once glance through the door , but sound and smell accumulated steadily until she felt she had been absorbed into a different texture of living . Perhaps she dozed there over the pages , a driver too long at the wheel . She came back with a jerk at the touch of Linton 's hand on hers . " They 've brought Clif down , " he said gently . " You an see him . He wo n't recognize you , he 's too doped . " Anice put away her work and rose . Linton seized the case , he slid one hand under her elbow and steered her along the corridor to a door , the placard DO NOT DISTURB like a fist thrusting her away . The door opened , and a nurse , finger at her lips , beckoned Anice . Warmth , darkness , and heavy , strange odors rose in a tide to drown her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , in a moment Anice could see the high hospital bed with the long , motionless mound , an effigy , not ( ; lifi She bent over him , her hands curved around the shape of his head , not touching him . Slowly , as if the weight was more than he could bear to lift , his eyelids crawled up , and far down in his eyes , like a transparent and all but invisible minnow far beneath the surface of the sea , flickered a shadow of consciousness . ( My flesh would hear you and wake , what was that line ? ) The eyelids closed , the nurse signaled , and Anice left him . " Dr. Priest will see you in the office , " said the nurse , before she closed herself in with Clif . " This way , Mrs. McReal . " A young practitioner led her down the hall , past closed doors , past an opened door  | with laughter and flowers and human voices floating around the screen which concealed the bed . " In here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor nurse , with the white-jacketed doctor seated behind another desk . Stocky , with a blond , baldish , expressionless face bent over a sheet on which he set down quick notations . He motioned to a chair at the desk corner with a jerk of a square-fingered , scrubbed left hand . Impregnable , impervious , without humanity ! Oh , this was no better than a huge factory , all routine precision movement , run them through , run them out ! " Dr. Priest , please ! I 'm Mrs. McReal . I can take it , whatever it is , but I ca n't endure this eternity of waiting ! " " Not quite that . " Dr. Priest set the pen back in its holder and looked at her . His light eyelashes made no frame for his eyes , they stared at her like windows so lighted that they reflect only what passes , and reveal nothing of what is within . " The operation was long , a transection of two ribs , removal of the right lobe , so badly infected we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McReal , is it Professor ? yes , came through very well , strong heart . We shall have the report from the laboratory in the morning . " " Ca n't you tell  --  with all your experience  --  you must have some inkling ? " Anice twisted her hands together at the top button of her jacket , approximately over her heart , a gesture indicating agony under control . Surely she could win some sympathy , even from part of this Gibraltar . Dr. Priest pushed back his chair and examined his finger-tips , running his thumbs over the slightly puckered surfaces . " I 'll see you by ten o'clock , " he said , dismissing both the inkling and her .  | " Does it mean another operation if the report is bad ? " Not at present . A positive report would mean radium treatment . " He rose , a square , heavy man , no taller than Anice , and moved with the lightness of fine coordination around her and out of the room . Anice followed , seeing her way through tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weariness . She rounded the outer desk and fled along the hall to the waiting room at the end . Linton stood there , holding her coat . He helped her as she fumbled for the armholes , he picked up the case . " I packed up everything . I 'll ferry you home . It 's not too had , they just have to make sure . " Anice took her gold vanity case from her purse and snapped it open . She dried her eyes carefully and dusted powder over her face with vindictive little pats . She looked as if she 'd spent a day in hell . " He 's a brute . " She snapped shut the case . " lie 's the best surgeon in town for this sort of thing , " said I , inton. " 1 le 's a Nazi sadist . " All right , he 's a brute . You do n't pay for sympathy , you pay for skill . He ca n't crucify himself for all the families of all his patients . " You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too exhausted to know what I 'm saying ! Let 's get out of this place . I 'll go mad in a minute ! " Anice moved quickly within the circle of his arm , laying her cheek against his shoulder . " I 'm sorry , Linton . I do n't know what I 'd do without you . " She felt his chest swell in a long breath , felt him shake himself into action .  | In the cab Anice drooped against Linton 's shoulder . She could n't afford to hurt his feelings , not now . He was too useful . Not once had he intimated in all the long day that only yesterday had she announced she was through with Clif . He had n't really suffered as much as she had . She hated illness , death , the terrible autocracy of disease . Linton rather enjoyed funerals , she thought , at least he always attended not only the rites for his friends but those for any distinguished personage where he could gain admission , and he insisted on detailed accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives and public enemies among the audience pleased him . There went her brain , free-wheeling again . She 'd like to blank out for a few hours . " Will you mind if I do n't come up with you ? " Linton stood at the door of the cab , his face grayish and puckered . " We 'll be better off for a respite from each other . " Anice took the case from his hand . " And tomorrow ? " she asked . " Tomorrow . " He seesawed from heel to toe . " Tomorrow 's the day my masseur comes , wonderful Swede , have I told you about him ? I ca n't bear to miss his hour , after today I positively ache from head to foot . I 'll meet you at Harkness , I 'll be more useful if Fred overhauls me . I 'll see if I can get him in early , say eightish . " Before Anice could reply he had darted around her into the cab and slammed the door . So , for all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that ! Or had she offended him ? She shrugged and went in to the elevator . The new night man had come  | on , he had other passengers , and no conversation . Kathleen came from the kitchen at the sound of the door , behind her the apartment smelled of furniture polish and wax and soap . She listened intently to Anice 's curt report . " Till the morning , " was all she said . " Open some windows and air out this place , " said Amite . " And just bring me a tray , soup , anything light . I want to bathe first , get the awful smell out of my skin . " " That phone 's been ringing all afternoon . Keeping me from work . " " Who called ? I hope you got the names . " " Some of ' em . " Kathleen handed her a fan of slips from the pad beside the telephone . " Some of ' em would n't say . And this come . " A satiny square florist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproachfully . Should be for Mr. McReal , she meant . Anice deliberated , as she read the names Kathleen had set down , asking what this one was supposed to be , and that one . Men in Clif 's department , his secretary , her own secretary ( she must call her soon , explain tomorrow was out , too ) , names that stood for no one . She might call up some of them . For a moment she felt herself there on the small stand , her voice muted , such a terrible clay , he was resting comfortably , she could say there were complications , avoiding the horrible word , yes , she was very tired , it had been such a shock . Would she find a kind of release , an excitement in shocking the listener , in playing up the danger ? Kathleen would listen to every word , she would have that brooding disapproval under her dark eyebrows . " If anyone else calls , please tell them everything 's going as well as expected , I mean as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am trying to  | get a little rest , I have to be at Harkness very early in the morning . " She carried the florist 's box into her bedroom and opened it at once . A spray of small orchids , golden with brownish centers and one lip of scarlet . A card in the envelope she ripped open , her little finger digging at the flap . Better luck tomorrow , B. Anice laid a finger on the furred mouth of an orchid , tingling at the delicate feathery touch . She knew Burke 's type . There was a timing in the growth of  --  oh , nothing so coarse as an affair  --  call it a joust , a tilting match . If you were n't on hand , shield lifted against the clash of his lance , he was off in search of another adversary . Instead of riding into this exciting fray she had to plod along a dusty road of duty . She had too clear an image of what was expected from her , by a great crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I 'll see you by ten , no question as to her intention ) , by Clif 's friends , even by Linton in spite of his equipment of knowledge , by the men in her firm for all they gave her , if grudgingly , high place , even by Mary , her secretary , who adored her . Kathleen was just watching to see her slip . And the children , Guy and Marian , when they came . She tucked the waxed paper around the spray of orchids , and set the box on the seat under the east window . Cool enough there , she would n't let Kathleen have a chance to peer at them as she would if Anice put them in the refrigerator . Tomorrow she could send the news to Guy and Marian , surely when they came they could spell her for part of the day . Something , the orchids , a restless twisting within the bonds imposed by this image of expected conduct , sent her into a spurt of activity . She bathed quickly , she ate quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broiled chicken served as salad ) , she opened the typewriter on its table and copied briskly the notes she had made as she read the manuscript . She slipped manuscript and her typed comment into the heavy envelope with its printed office address . Lucky the book was poor ; she would have hated to deal out praise tonight . She could n't get to sleep . Instead of sheep , unbidden images from the day behind her , the day to come , made a jumping parade over the stiles of her mind . Finally she *h ( 1 out of bed and went to the window , her toes curling into the nap of the rug , the cold air like water on her flesh , and picked up the box . She could n't wear orchids tomorrow , she might as well enjoy them tonight . She propped the uncovered box against the base of the lamp , having turned on the faint night light . She poured water from her carafe over the cotton which bedded the Rower stalk , and then lay , one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes , holding her consciousness to nothing but the colors , the texture , the plunge into the fringed corolla . No wonder Georgia O'Keefe had painted orchids . At noon the next day Anice stood in a telephone booth a drugstore on upper Broadway , calling her secretary . " Mary ? " Anice never identified herself over the telephone Ix ( e  --  pt to a stranger , expecting immediate recognition of Iier voice . Mary , of course , gave her that small homage . " Oh , Miss Lang ! I 've been so worried ! " " Good news . Nothing to worry us . Just a common virus infection . All Mr. McReal has to do now is to get well . "  | She went on with instructions , her voice deeper than usual , suggesting that although its surface flow carried these run-of-the-day commissions , it ran over depths of relief , of suffering endured , of hope . Would Mary send a messenger to the apartment for the book manuscript and report , yes , she 'd finished it . Could Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , not to the hospital , she 'd be at the apartment by six , surely . Telephone to Mrs. Blair , Marian , Mr. McReal 's daughter , Anice gave the Princeton telephone number . " Do n't alarm her , just tell her what 's happened , her father 's in Harkness for perhaps a fortnight . Say she does n't need to come in , he 'll be under opiates for several days . And my son , Guy Harrison , in Boston . " Anice poked another coin into the metal mouth , heard its clink silence the annoying " Your three minutes is up ! " " Are you there , Mary ? If Guy is n't in , leave a message . You can now imagine me on a stool in a corner drugstore having lunch . " Anice glanced through the glass of the door . " The counter-man has hairy arms and how he slaps around ! Yes , Mr. McReal was conscious this morning , he knew me . Get those calls through at once , there 's a good girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't reach me . " No one seemed to notice the incongruity of Anice Lang with her heels hooked over the rung of the stool , crinkling her nose a little at the tooth-picked toasted sandwich , the thick cup with its black coffee . She was surprisingly hungry . The unaccustomed walk down the long block from Harkness with a north wind clearing her nostrils of hospital odors , perhaps . " If you do n't mind ! " A girl with incredibly bright hair and a green coat over a crumpled white uniform waited for Anice to clear the next stool of purse and gloves . Anice  | deleted page  | its door and discharge its occupant . She slid in quickly , and let the door close enough to flash the overhead light . She could sit here in privacy while she waited . Voices rumbled in the booths on either side , and when a hand tried the handle of her door she picked the receiver off its bracket and pretended to dial the dead instrument . They could wait , she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this awful place . She made a little pile of coins on the shelf , and at the half hour dialed the office . Mary 's line was busy . She fitted a cigarette into the mother-of-pearl holder . She was stifling as it was in this upright coffin , no use filling it with smoke , too . After five minutes , and several heads looming urgently against the glass , she tried again . Mary answered . She 'd got through to the Blairs , in Princeton . Mr. Blair came to the phone . Mrs. Blair was in bed , nothing wrong , doctor 's orders , keep off her feet at least a month . " I had a friend , " said Mary , reassuringly , " who had to stay in bed the whole nine months , but at the end she got a lovely baby boy . " " If she 'd stood up I suppose she 'd had a baby girl , " said Anice , crossly . What a time for Marian to pick ! She 'd been counting on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . Try to speak distinctly , I 'm in one of these damned air-tight booths . " " Mr. Blair said he 'd try to get in on Sunday , if Marian is well enough . Please keep them posted , he said . " " What about Guy ? " Mary could n't reach him , she 'd left a message with the landlady , at least she supposed " Did you ask him to call me ? " " Yes , Miss Lang . Tonight after six at the apartment . And I 'll be there , I 'll have a bite first , I can work as long  | " Anything new at the office ? Yes , operator . " She clicked in a coin . " Cressman 's agent , Hinckleman , was in , he 's dickering with an English firm , and Reader 's Digest is interested . He wants to know when he can see you . " " That ca n't wait . Winston will try to take over . I 'll call Hinckleman . Get his home number for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the corner outside the drugstore Anice looked for a cab . An empty one stood at the curb , its driver at some lunch-counter . She felt for the long plunging stretch of shop-lined Broadway the hatred an alien might feel , distrustful of its people , ignorant of its customs . She could n't stand here and freeze ! Her coat fluttering , her chin down in the soft collar , the wind beating at her head and cheek , she hurried down the endless block toward the hospital entrance . The lobby was full of people , small , dark men and women and children , twittering softly in a foreign tongue , massed at the door of one of the elevators , their faces turned up as if the descending pointer magnetized them . The pointer indicated the ground floor , the door rolled back , the twittering swelled into an halleluiah chorus . A dumpy woman bulging in a greenish-black coat , heavy black hair straggling from its coil , was bending over , tucking a blanket in place . She backed out of the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel-chair in which , blanched to a pallor that separated him from the race of the others , sat a middle-aged man , a long moustache drooping past his trembling mouth , a green cap on his head , tears rolling down his cheeks . He pulled his hands , yellowish-white , from under the robe and extended them toward the waiting , suddenly hushed little group . " At last ! I come home ! " Like a benison , like a  | king passing . An old woman pushed forward and kissed his hand , crying , " Grazie ! Grazie ! " Others laid their hands with the orderly 's on the back of the chair , the rest made an aisle for his passage . Anice watched them , and blinked , her eyelids aching . Like a scene in a play , drawing easy tears . Only it was real . An ordinary little man " Going up ! " Anice stepped into the elevator . On the fifth floor the desk nurse said , " Mrs. McReal , the nurse was asking for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half hour or so . " " I do n't know whether she wishes to see you now or not . " Oh , Lord , thought Anice , walking with deliberate slowness toward Clif 's room . Blaming me because I have to eat . Linton might have stayed , dropping in for ten minutes to collect the news , going off to his so important engagement . No one I can depend upon , no one . Ahead of her an orderly trundled an enamel cart laden with strange equipment . He knocked at Clif 's door . A nurse opened it , and stood aside for him to push the cart into the room . She saw Anice , and swung a hand up in warning . She was competent and forbidding , all black and white , black hair and eyes , young white skin , white crisp uniform . The nurse yesterday had been an older woman . Did they have a new one every hour on the hour ? " Mrs. McReal ? Not just now . I 'll call you . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows repeated on a black and blue spot . What did they expect her to do ? The desk nurse was chatting with one of the doctors , not even looking at her . Anice thought , if I dare go into the rest-room , I 'll get in wrong again . She went , anyway , and spent a long  | time , running her comb through the waves of her dark hair until they lay back just so from her temples , redoing her mouth , adjusting the jade pin at the neck of her satin blouse . Then she settled in the same wicker chair where she had spent the morning yesterday in the room named ap I ) u ) priately Waiting Room . What a fool she 'd been not to bring along something to read , letters to write ! Had she thought she could look in at Clif and then escape to the office ? How long since she had sat thus in a daytime hour , empty-handed , empty-headed ? The afternoon sounds had a different tempo , livelier , more varied , patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if everyone ( except Clif ) was out of danger on the high road to recovery . By hitching her chair forward Anise could watch the elevator door gape open and people step out , eagerly , hesitantly , a few ( mothers or fathers , perhaps ) clumsy with age in their bones , most of them with a large cornucopia of green or white held in a Crook of an arm , some of them even at this distance with u ' flashing arrow of reunion forereaching toward their goal , in their faces , in the very posture of their bodies . ! lien she saw the nurse coming , her skirt switching shove neat ankles . If you wish to come now , Mrs. McReal . Mr. McReal sleeping , but you may sit in his room . He may wake for minute or two . I could n't find you this morning . You 'd ' ter bring your coat . " She preceded Anice into the room , cooler , less dark than yesterday . " There 's a chair beyond the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , push it if you want me . " Her voice was as quiet as her closing of the door . A nice crept around the foot of the bed and looked down at Clif , a long flat mound under smooth white , his head  | tipped back , the cords of his throat stretched , his jaw more prominent , his eyesockets hollow around his shuttered eyes . He seemed scarcely to breathe , except for a faint intermittent sibilance . Anice located the bell-push , at the end of a cord , laid between two covered glasses . She sat down , easing herself with caution into the wooden armchair . Had he asked for her when he woke earlier ? Lying there he seemed as unreachable , as impenetrable as if he had indeed died . She crouched in the chair , pressing her knees together , afraid to have him open his eyes . With the swift timelessness of a dream , the moment transmuted itself into a great Ferris wheel , with Anice swinging alone , the solitary passenger , up and up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made the circle of their life together and returned to herself , waiting in fear for him to wake . She made the circle not in thought , not in images , so much as in shifting feeling . Not a Ferris wheel , but the shifting , unaccountable almost imperceptible flickering alterations of Northern lights . The encounter , the recognition of attraction , the admission of passion , the days when passion was alive between them all the time , a glance across a crowded room , his voice over the telephone , his hand on her arm on a street corner , his knee against hers at the theater ( they stayed until the final curtain because the agony of delay was the heightening of delight ) . Then what ? He had withdrawn , he had begun to criticize her . ( You make a good story of my shortcomings . ) He had accused her of  --  oh , all sorts of crimes . Disloyalty , for one . A desire to play him down , to outshine him , not only at the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend , and to which , less and less often , he would accompany her , but also at the  | dull faculty receptions and dinners to which he tried to drag her . You think I do n't know it was you who queered my book , my ten-year opus ? Winston gave me to understand the decision was in your hands . " He had thrown that out as lie sulked homeward after a spring English dinner at which several professors had taken bows for new books . Books put out by University Presses , subsidized , all honor and no money . He had been jealous , of course , and she had tried to soothe him . " You know Pearl Harbor shot the publishing business to bits ! We had to play things differently . Why not get at the manuscript now , bring it up to date , something con-temporary " Too late , Parrington , Van Wyck Brooks , Canby . They 've said it all . Just a bunch of hay you dandled in hunt of the donkey 's nose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had said whatever happened about his book , the years he had spent on it were like Jacob 's seven years for Rachel . A queer sound , not a groan , a sort of animal protest ' rum a level of consciousness below that of words , parted his colorless , dry lips and movement , a ripple of pain , altered slightly the long mound of his body . Anice strained forward . Was he waking ? No . The soft , infrequent sigh of his breathing set up its rhythm again . Anice eased herself back in the chair , the Ferris wheel swung earthward in the final quadrant of its cycle . He had accused her of an indifference to everything about him except when , less often , she needed him in bed . Then he had stopped accusing her of anything , but he had stopped not because he had found he was wrong about her . He  | had stopped short as if the mainspring of his passion had snapped . She had really tried to keep things going . He was attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern they had established , it had advantages . What then had levered her decision to break the pattern by divorce ? She had implied to Linton that Clif 's affair with the girl was reason enough . She had n't seen the girl , but knowing Clif , his scruples , his ridiculous sense of guilt , she also knew the affair to be one of those sentimental flurries , what Clif as a professor would no doubt describe as a marriage of true minds . She knew the reason , and again that wave of arid , bleak emptiness engulfed her , just as it had that morning in late December . She had been out of town for a fortnight , in Chicago , in Boston , in Philadelphia , a dovetailed sequence of conferences and luncheons and cocktail parties for authors ; and flying back from Boston , exhausted nervously from the really wonderful performances she had put on as representative of her firm , she had felt herself splintered into a million bits of colored glass , she had turned herself into a kaleidoscope . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the prow of the plane , it was a great bird with strong wings cleaving the air , drawing the plane after it more swiftly than its roaring motors . Clif 's arms about her would bind her whole again . She had taken a taxi from the airport , her eagerness higher octane gas for its engine , she had practiced a magician 's levitation as the elevator rose to their floor . She had opened the apartment door , the momentum of her need breaking through her usual overquiet way of entering , and had sung out his name in the dark hall . Midnight , but Clif read all night anyway . She called a second time before the door at the end of the hall into  | his small study swung open and Clif appeared , a tousled , bulky silhouette , his shanks thin under the shrunken old Hansel bathrobe he would not discard , book in one hand , the light behind him catching on one lens of his spectacles , suggesting an elderly one-eyed owl . " Hello , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a pleasant trip ? " Anice fumbled for the electric switch . Her speed , her Hight homeward had brought her to the edge of an abyss , had shot her over and down . She was falling as one falls in a nightmare , down and down forever . The lights bloomed overhead , she twitched herself upright , the cluster of purple orchids ( which she loathed , present from the committee on arrangements ) quivered , and she walked down the hall . " It was all right , " she had said . " Rather wearing . " What had she been rushing toward ? Not this middle-aged man lounging against the doorpost , waiting to get on with his book . The circuit was broken . " Anything I can do ? Hot milk or Scotch and soda ? " " No , thanks . Nothing . " She had closed the door of her own room , let the traveling case drop from her hand , and stood in darkness , bewildered and then aghast at the emptiness around and within her . Bleak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the Ferris wheel had completed its cycle and grounded her , the rays of the aurora borealis had flickered out , you could strain your eyes to aching and see no gleam in the dark starred sky . Yet here she sat beside Clif , waiting for him to come back into this husk . She was here because in Mnne queer way she had to be . No one else could do it for her , everyone expected it of her . Just convention . No , not convention , something more . She recognized  | the moment upon her , when the handpress clamped down on accumulated impressions , extracting the bitter wine of new wisdom . All these faces Anice had watched the past days , and others which had impinged upon her without her willing reception ? Why , someone had to be on hand to make sure the human being came back to earth , out of the ether and the suffering and the almost-death . Someone had to be on hand to hold the end of the string or he would take off skyward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these people thronged the lobby , the waiting rooms , came with gifts , signs that they tugged at the kitestrings , that they meant to haul these soaring kites back again . That Italian family and the old father ? Someone should make a profession of kite-holding , leaving busy folk free to go about their business . Ministers , perhaps . Sisters of charity . Gray ladies . Anice relaxed . Foolish of her to feel apprehensive . This was Clif , she knew him , every inch . He had asked for her this morning , when , unfortunately , she had stepped out for a half hour . Boy being frightened , wanting his mother . Not that she meant to mother any son of Adam . He had n't turned to her the night he had entered this place . The Devil sick , the Devil a saint would be . That was it . He 'd want her around , a symbol of his connection with the human race . She leaned forward , intent upon his face . He did n't look asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The angle of his head ? As she watched , his eyelids folded back , and his eyes , soft , luminous blue with pinpoint irises , recognized her , accepted her . No surprise , no delight , just acceptance . " Clif ! " Anice drew a quick , gasping breath , startled almost as if she 'd been caught peering through a keyhole . " Clif , darling ! "  | " I 'm thirsty , " said Clif , slowly . " Thirsty . " Anice looked around wildly . " But you ca n't sit up , oh , God ! " She seized the cord and laid a thumb on the button . " I 'll get your nurse ? " " Thirsty , " repeated Clif . " Just a minute , darling . " Anice dove frantically for the door , and stepped aside as the nurse appeared . " He 's thirsty , " Anice said , accusingly . " I do n't know ? " The nurse brushed past her . " We 'll have to show your wife how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass with its bent pipette to Clif 's lips . She pulled down a triangle of the slickly folded-over sheet and laid her fingers on his wrist . " Enough for now . " She whisked the glass away , the pipette tinkling , without lifting her eyes from her wristwatch . " Comfortable ? " " No . " Clif made of the monosyllable a guttural complaint . " No ? " She tucked his hand under the covers . " What do you expect ? " She said , not turning her head , " If you will step outside for a few minutes , Mrs. McReal . " Anice walked the length of the corridor and back . Silly of her to feel incompetent , she was n't supposed to be a nurse . She did hate being pushed around . Of course she was sorry for Clif , he must be suffering . But she was no use whatever here , how could she stand days and days of this ? Clif would n't sleep all the time once they stopped sticking needles into him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brief morning interview , grudgingly , that Clif would be hospitalized at least a fortnight . With Marian in bed , too  --  all nonsense , this idea of keeping horizontal while pregnant . She had n't stayed in bed for Guy . Touring the corridor again she held her elbows snug against her waist , buttoning in unseemly laughter . Why , she had n't thought of that episode with the Furnento family for years ! Guy Sr. , Major Harrison , had  | been off in the mountains as always , growing tough and bronzed with his bridge building , leaving her . She wished she could feel now as she had felt then , tingling with vitality and well-being , the secret processes of her body working a magic of fulfillment . Guy had curled high in her womb so that for months no one guessed she was pregnant . She had to have something to do ! This boy , Carlos Fumento , hair and eyes with the bloom of a black plum , she 'd met him at a consular party , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was coming to the States the next year , some middle-western university . Afternoons in the salon of the great stone house , with his fat , jowled mother pricking at her everlasting needle-point , with his father ( the bloom rubbed into swarthiness ) bowing her into the limousine in which they sent her home , his soft fingers repeating the bold inquiry of his eyes . She had n't known Spanish well enough to interpret all of the final explosion , she gathered that Senora Fumento had detected her interesting condition and thought her presence indecent . Of course the Senora had been jealous of both son and husband . Perhaps she suspected one of them of being Guy 's papa ! Guy Sr. had in some way heard about it , he had been furious . " If you have no modesty , you should respect their customs and my position ! " he had roared at her . Anice had cried softly , watching him between her fingers . She had been so lonely . " You just do n't understand this Latin temperament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite forgiven him . As for temperament , Latin or otherwise , men were men , and amusing . That brought her back to Clif 's door , and she stood near it , hands thrust into the pockets of her jacket . Men were men . She moved her hands , flapping the pockets silently together . She had it ! She 'd send word to that girl of Clif 's , tell her Clif wished to see her . Now , that was  | magnanimous , or was n't it ? Not for a day or so , later , when he needed to be amused . His girl could spell her . The nurse opened the door and pulled it almost shut behind her . " He 's drowsed off again , " she said , her black ryes cool and appraising . " Could n't even stay awake for the bedpan . If you have other things to do ? " " My coat , please , " said Anice . If she had other things to dol The nurse slid in and out again , handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to take the long trip back here this evening . Could I telephone ? " " It is n't necessary . We will notify you of any change . " Anice found Mary Keston waiting for her at the apartment . Kathleen 's sturdy rear disappeared through the ( lining room as Anice entered . Mary poured out solicitude , Miss Lang looked so tired , did she think she should try to work ? Miss Lang did think so . Mary had been there about an hour , spelling Kathleen at the telephone . Miss Lang 's son , Guy Harrison , called . Unless necessary , he could n't come until Sunday , he 'd take the midnight from Boston . Mr. Linton would see her tomorrow at the hospital . Would she call Mr. Blair , Mrs. Blair wanted the latest bulletin . " Read a book or something while I clean up . Tell Kathleen I want a pot of coffee , nothing else now . " She heard the telephone bell as she shut herself into the bedroom . She picked up . the extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just returned from the hospital , she could n't come to the phone , this was her secretary . Mr. McReal was resting comfortably . Anice  | laid the arm clickless in its cradle . Someone from the university . She bathed , tied a gold cord about a soft white dressing gown , thrust her feet into gold mules , brushed her dark hair with hard pummeling , sniffing to see if hospital odor lingered . Kathleen came with the tray of coffeepot , cups , and a plate of intricate small sandwiches . " They 're having a party two floors down , " Kathleen explained . " I helped a while , the caterer gave me these . You try ' em , they 're tasty . " She waited . " Did Mr. McReal say anything ? " " He really knew me today . " Anice drank from the cup Kathleen had filled . " All he said was he was thirsty . " " Ah , the povreen ! " " He 's got a day and night nurse , someone with him every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary settled herself at the desk , notebook on her knee . She ran through the letters she had answered , the notes she had made of calls . Anice listened with indifference . She must be dog tired to care so little . " You can run that place without me perfectly well , ca n't you ? " she asked , just to hear Mary 's protest . Everything seemed of little moment ; perhaps these items needed office background . There had been something ? " You have n't mentioned Cressman . Did you get his agent 's home telephone ? " Mary looked up , her eyes unhappy , a slow color creeping to the roots of her dun hair . " He switched to Mr. Winston 's line when I told him you were at the hospital . Mr. Winston said he 'd take care of ? " " Oh , damn ! " Anice set down the third cup of coffee . " When you know Winston 's been trying to muscle in on Cressman ! How could your " I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went right to him . " Anice leaned back in the chaise-longue , gold mule  | dangling from her toes . Cressman had been injured that day she 'd sent him to the publicity office . Purdy had said so . Winston had n't had a jackpot for months . If she did n't get back to her job " You tell Winston ? " " He 's in Baltimore this week end , " said Mary . " There 's a doctor there , a psychiatrist , who 's got a book , case histories of some of the big government men , Winston 's gone alter it . " " I wo n't have Cressman 's book used in any kind of digest . It 's too early . I have bigger plans than that . Now make that clear to anyone who asks . " " Yes , Miss Lang . " Anice dictated several letters with crisp brevity . Then she extended one hand toward Mary . " Never mind , child . I suppose you could n't have prevented it . But you ought to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strident , in her eagerness to assure Anice she would act as watchdog . " Where 's my purse ? " interrupted Anice . " ' There , on the dressing table . Help yourself to taxi fare home . " " To Flatbush ? Oh , Miss Lang , it 's too far , I can take the subway . " " It 's on the house , " said Anice . " I do n't want you on the subway this time of night . Why do you live in Flatbush anyway ? " " Why , my folks live there . " " You 're a big girl now . " Mary blushed again . Funny how unbecoming her frequent rise of color was . Her whole face looked chapped , exposed to the wind of imagined censure and disapproval . " You could take a little apartment nearer the office . " Anice did n't care where the girl lived ; she just wanted to make sure there was no brooding over her reproof about  | Winston . One disadvantage of devotion was its obverse of easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in smooth working order . " I 'd be lonesome . " Mary was packing notebook , pencils , letters into a large envelope . " Anyway ? " She glanced at Anice , soft , relaxed against the cushions of the chaise longue . She caught her too-short upper lip between her teeth , and then burst into a rush of confidence . Her brother , the one that wanted to be a doctor , was in a Veteran 's Hospital , he had t.b . contracted in a German prison camp , they thought he 'd get better . His wife had run off with another man ; of course her brother had been gone almost four years . " We have the little boy , he 's nine now , smart as a whip , but is he a handful ! He 'll probably be awake when I get home , wanting to know just where I 've been . My sister 's in Barnard , she 's so pretty you 'd never know she was awfully clever , too , she 's majoring in science . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too much for Mother , she 's brought up one generation ? " Mary drew on her heavy gray coat , her flush deepening . " I ought not to bore you with family history ? " " You 're not boring me . " Anice sat up , swinging her feet to the floor . Time for the girl to go , she did n't want too many confidences , this setting invited them . " You ought to watch out , my dear Mary , or you 'll never have any life of your own . " ( Not a word the entire evening about Burke , had n't he bothered to ask Mary , her secretary , her line of communication , a single question ? ) Mary was standing , her face in the shadow above the lamps , her really good brow and eyes diminished by the emphasis upon her protruding upper lip , her wide nostrils . " The life I have is my own , " she said , with surprising  | sharpness . " I like my folks . And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning whirred in Anice 's head as the girl 's body swayed toward the chaise longue , toward her , oh , no , do n't declare your devotion , don'tl ? " about my job , " she finished . " Good , " said Anice , getting quickly to her feet and widening the space between them , walking to the eastern window . On the floor lay the small florist 's box . She had left the orchids there as a sign to the overinquisitive Kathleen that they were nothing to her . " Oh , Mary . " She had to put the question . " I meant to ask you , did Mr. Burke have a conference with you about our special books ? " " He came to the office . " " Well ? " " I did n't mention it because he was so  --  silly . " The stridency of her voice increased . " I did n't think you 'd like " It might amuse me , " said Anice . Mary clipped her elbow tight against the large envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd brought in your rose , " she said . " I hoped you might make it , maybe by afternoon . I had it in the little vase on your desk . He pretended he was going to take it for his buttonhole , I told him he should let it alone . He said  --  I do n't know  --  a lot of nonsense . He asked impertinent questions , too , about who your husband was , was he really sick ? " " Go on , tell me . " Anice put a note of amused tolerance in her voice . " He 's a new man , anything that gives me light on his personality is useful . " " He 's too big for his britches . " Mary 's giggle exploded nervously . " That 's what my Dad always says . Well  --  the thing that made me maddest , he said , Mr. Burke , I mean ,  | I see the Vestal virgin keeps the fire burning . Not that I 'd call Miss Lang a prototype of Vesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know , goddess of the home or something . " " The hearth . Anyway , he had no business to say anything like that . Or anything else about you ! I do n't know why it made me so mad , only when a man like that calls you  --  not you , anyone  --  a virgin it sounds like an insult . " Mary repeated the nervous giggle . " I hope you do n't mind , Miss Lang . I 'm glad he 's gone for a while . Mr. Winston took him along , he said he 'd introduce him to some of the booksellers in the Baltimore-Washington district . " " You handled him just right , " said Anice . She made a rush across the room , hands extended , sweeping Mary to the door . " You must go , it 's late , your Billy will be waiting for you , thanks so much for giving me your evening . " " I loved it , Miss Lang . " The girl 's eyes filled with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth , as she vanished behind the door Anice pushed quickly shut . If she has n't anyone else to feel romantic about , it might as well be me , Anice told herself , irritated . If she 'd happened to work for Winston or  --  yes , or Burke  --  she 'd feel the same way toward them . I do n't encourage her , I 'm no collector of female hearts . It was Burke , really , to whom Anice defended herself . Vestal virgin . No wonder he had made Mary mad . At her age it was an insult . Oh , well , she just had an adolescent crush on Anice , the nearest object . Sentimental , not intense . Office wife . Her antagonism toward Burke had the barbed point of jealousy . What a nuisance , having to be so discreet ! Kathleen knocked . She had some decent hot food ready for Mrs. McReal in the dining room . Anice carried the extension telephone to the table . She dialed the hospital , and had time enough to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that Mr. McReal was resting well . No , he would n't eat yet , he 'd had an intravenous . Anice told Kathleen only that he was resting well . " God be praised , the worst is over ! " Kathleen removed the dishes , and came back , treading solemnly , bearing a Pyrex dish with the delicately browned mound of lemon souffle . Anice arched her eyebrow over the mouthpiece as she repeated the Princeton number for long distance . " Eat it now , before it sinks on me , " urged Kathleen . She was serving Clif by proxy , thought Anice , ladling a jagged spoonful to her plate , sniffing the acidy steam . Keeping up my strength for him . I know . But the souffle was good . She had to gulp a hot mouthful as Lorimer Blair 's precise voice said , " Hello , Lorimer Blair speaking . " His stay as Rhodes scholar at Oxford had made a curious hybrid of his original middle-western accent . " This is Anice . How 's Marian ? " Marian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip in to see her father , the news had been a great shock . She was actually much improved since they 'd put her to bed , the symptoms that threatened miscarriage had subsided . He went into some detail about the symptoms quite as if he shared them . She 'd been especially shocked not to know a thing until the operation was over , in case something had gone wrong " She could n't have come in , " said Anice . " Clif would n't have anyone told . " " I could have come in , " said Lorimer . " I had a seminar that day , but Marian felt someone should have been there . " " Guy 's coming down from Boston Sunday , " said Anice . " Will you be in then ? My secretary said something to that effect . " " We  --  ll " ? a little hacking sound , Lorimer deliberating  | in his throat ? " if Guy 's there Sunday , perhaps Monday ? Sunday traffic 's such a drawback , Monday 's my free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she can look out for Marian , perhaps I could get to the library ? " " Monday is fine . Tell Marian all goes well , not to worry . " Anice could see him , his face ending in the point of his neat little beard ( concealing what lack of chin , she wondered ) , the dome of forehead with its prominent temples , the carefully brushed-back wave of fine hair shades darker than the beard , the light blue eyes magnified by the spectacles , the firm , small mouth , the tweed suit . He was in residence this year at Princeton , lecturing on criticism . Regular income , hence , no doubt , the baby . He contributed articles to quarterlies , he published an occasional poem , he lectured Anice on the decay of the novel . Clif said he had brilliance , and Anice said it has a wave-length too high for me ! He was older than Marian . They kept step together , with Marian hopping to catch up . Maybe she 'd married her father . Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gill 's worldly goods at the time of the divorce . Anice lifted a spoonful of the souffle , but for a moment the wry taste of Marian 's wedding puckered her mouth , she could not swallow . Shortly before the death of Elinor , Marian 's mother , Clif 's ex-wife . In a church somewhere on Cape Cod , where they 'd spent the summer . Anice had been invited , she expected to go . Linton Webber was going , too . She never knew whether Clif asked Linton to ward her off , or whether Linton thought it up himself . " A question of taste , my dear , " he had prattled . " If Elinor had married again , then you could go . But with Clif giving his daughter away , feeling being what it is , would n't you be more comfortable here in New York ? "  | When she had confronted Clif , he had tried to evade . Are you ashamed to be seen with me ? " she had demanded . She could hear Clif 's answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled by shame for myself . " She had been amazed at the anger which rolled through her . It had been a forecast , had n't it , a rumble of disaster through the first cleft in the mountain . She had told him he could go and he could stay ! He had gone . He had come back , of course , and they 'd had a marvelous reconciliation . Kathleen stood at the kitchen door , watching her . " You do n't want more coffee , " she said . " You wo n't sleep a wink . " " I suppose not . " Anice rose . " I feel much better , I must have been hungry . " She picked up the telephone , gathering the cord as she walked . " My son will be here Sunday . " Kathleen nodded . " The guest room ? " " I hope he can stay , it must be mid-year at Tech . And Mr. Blair comes Monday , I 'll ask him for dinner . He may have to go right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back , too . She 's going to have a baby , did you know ? " She had left Kathleen comforted , with meals to plan and a grandchild of Clif 's to sentimentalize over . She did n't exactly commend herself for being considerate , but as she returned to her bedroom she had a sense of comfort which was only in part a result of food . She woke in the night , flinging an arm across the empty bed , and thought , Clif ! There in the dark she saw his eyelids lift , saw his curiously contracted pale eyes meet hers in that quiet acceptance , there you are , not desire , not longing , not surprise , just acceptance , there you are where you must be , I knew it would be you .  | When Anice woke the next morning , she saw first the white mound on the tufted window seat , then the white furry ridges along the metal sashes of the casement window , then the luminous , unquiet opacity beyond the windows . A gust blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint brush of icy feathers . Anice pivoted out of bed and ran to the door , shouting for Kathleen . She watched , hugging her arms to her body , while Kathleen plowed her fingers along the window bars , scooped up the mound from the seat , spatted out the cushions , cleaned the sill , and snapped the window shut . " How long has this been going on ? " asked Anice , quite as if Kathleen had turned a button to start it . " What on earth am I going to do now ? " " It 's a grand storm , " said Kathleen . " A rare one . " Her face had the delighted animation of a child . " You 'd never know there was a thing beyont this window . Traffic is at a standstill " ? ( her voice imitated the radio announcement ) ? " an ' the Mayor advises all office workers to stay at home an ' avoid all unnecessary travel . " " As if things were n't hard enough ! " Just outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impenetrable background of snow , separate flakes wheeled lazily , clung to the glass , wheeled away . " I 'll have trouble getting a cab . " " You might at that . " Kathleen bent to wipe a puddle from the rug . " Not a drop of milk or cream did I find outside the door , and the paper did n't come . " " I take my coffee black , " said Anice , and shut herself into the bathroom . If the storm was as bad as Kathleen  | made it out , no one would expect Anice to show up at the hospital . Saturday , the publishing houses were closed . Stay home and rest . She needed it . Have a facial , a shampoo . But she could n't get to the hairdresser 's . A matinee . Out , too . She could n't stay cooped up in this place alone . She walked to the dining room with irritated swishes of her taffeta housecoat . " The milkman made it , " announced Kathleen , bearing in the breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His truck is stuck over on Broadway , that 's why he 's late , trudging back and forth as he has to with his load of bottles . He says it 's the worst since the blizzard of forty-seven . " " Did you ask him if any taxis are out ? " Anice sipped orange juice . " N 'm , Mis ' McReal . " " If you see any other waifs of the storm , ask them , will you ? " The telephone bell sounded . " Bring it here , please . " Kathleen banged into the hall , drama increasing her Iurnsy exuberance , she kicked the uncoiling cord aside as she hurried back . It was Linton Webber , a shrill , slightly manic note in his voice , his version of Kathleen 's excitement . " This is dreadful , simply dreadful , nothing can stir , what are you going to do ? I do n't see how the doctors can reach the hospital , I certainly am not going to put my head outside until the roads are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clif , but at least he does n't have to try to get about , I blame the weather bureau , not a word of warning , how are you , my dear , did you see Clif yesterday , I wanted to call you last night but it was so late when I got back , I was at the opera with the Badger-Hollidays , you know who they are , they have a box for Fridays . "  | Anice held the arm-piece at a distance from her ear , just where she could tell when the rataplan ended . Doctors and milkmen and Anice . If they could do it , so could she . " Of course I am going , " she said , astonishing herself as well as Linton . " It 's not snowing in the subway . " " But it 's miles to the subway , you never take it ! It 's no good for me , anyway . I 'm too far east . " " Get a dog-sled and mush out , then . " Anice looked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body jigging visibly . At last , however briefly , she had won the girl 's hearty approval . " Bye , Linton , shall I give Clif your love ? " She replaced the telephone , Kathleen withdrew , and as Anice finished breakfast she could hear the radio in the girl 's bedroom ( another of Clif 's ideas ) booming with submerged resonance , as if the waves it picked out of the ether rolled through the plaster walls and broke into wordless froth . There should be another morning sound , what was missing ? She glanced at the windows , the green ivy and philodendron like the interior of an aquarium against the dense moving whiteness of the storm . " Kathleen ! " she called . " Where 's that bird ? " Kathleen poked her head around the edge of the door . " In my room , Mis ' McReal . " " Is it sick ? " " Never better . But it was never you wanted him there , singing the way he does . " Anice tossed aside her napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood up . " Put it in here if you want to . " " Ah , but hear him goin ' it , " said Kathleen . Sure enough , above the radio sound curled his trill . " The radio 's company for him . " Anice dressed quickly . This little number should do for  | an Arctic expedition , she told herself , hauling out last year 's gray flannel suit , digging a soft maize-colored sweater out of a drawer . Kathleen tramped the length of the hall several times , offering aid , her excitement mountitn with fresh radio items . " Road crews have cleared and sanded approaches to the bridges . The East River Drive is closed . " Anice fumbled with the clasp of a pearl choker . " See if you can find that fur-lined coat , will you ? I do n't give a tinker 's damn what 's closed . And galoshes . I had a pair . " Kathleen returned with the coat , stroking its collar as she held it for Anice to put on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They 's not a galosh in the closet , I turned it out Thursday . " She got to her knees to explore the corners of the bedroom closet . " Not a one . Now what ? " She got to her feet stern first , elephant-effect . " Could you keep mine on , I wonder ? " She tch  --  ed at Anice 's suede sandals . " I lave you no shoes decent for such a day ? " She inspected the shoes ranged on the rack and picked off a pair of brogues . " Put ' em on and I 'll fetch my overshoes . I wo n't be needin ' ' em , " she said , before Anice had considered that . " I 'll pull on some old stockings over my shoes , I can dry myself when I come in , and you 'd be sitting all day with the wet feet . " The overshoes swallowed Anice 's feet , but zipped shut they could n't fall off . As a final indignity Kathleen suggested a scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an umbrella , you 'd catch your death bareheaded . " " I 'll founder in the first snowdrift , " said Anice grimly . " You ought to be the one to make this trek , you 're having all the fun ! " " I would an ' gladly if it would do any good . " The girl 's voice quavered , and large round tears rolled from the  | inner corners of her eyes down around her nostrils . " It 's not me he 'd want to see ! " Anice pretended not to see the tears , examining the attache case . " Everything but a little bully beef , " she said , dropping a coin purse into the pocket of her coat . Compact , cigarettes , one of the manuscripts Mary had brought last night , pencils " Must you lug that great thing ? " asked Kathleen . " Maybe I could go with you to the subway and carry it ? " " No , you can not . " Anice closed the case . " This will act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not lift her feet , rocking her shoulders with each push forward . She heard Kathleen sniffle behind her . Anice opened the door and looked back at the girl . Apron rolled over her hands and forearms , cheeks tear-streaked , her earlier excitement dissolved in a patient tenderness , Kathleen gave back her look without a word . Anice had a brief moment in which that patient tenderness seemed to flow around her , warming and enheartening her as if the girl emptied herself for whatever good her courage and her good will might be . " I 'll call you when I have a chance , " said Anice . " Just to let you know I made it . " The elevator operator said no , he did n't think she could get a cab , when he came at eight he 'd had to plow his way , prob'bly they had the streets shoveled now . The doorman , who lived somewhere in the Bronx , had n't shown up . The mail had not come . No one seemed inclined to protest at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . The street had only one note instead of the usual strident chorus of city sounds ; the one harsh , grating note of shovels burrowing under the snow carpet to grate against cement . In places a shovel-wide path , already layered again with  | fresh snow , made walking less a plunge and pull progress . On Broadway the plows clanked and screeched and left their long furrows with wind-tossed clouds of snow blowing along their curling piles . The subway steps glistened with black pools of trodden , melted snow . Anice descended slowly , hand on the railing , bracing herself against the pull of the heavy galoshes . Someone , somewhere , should say , " What , you ! Out in this storm ? " But in the long , white-walled tunnel the few men and women were too subdued in their own necessity , whatever beckoned or compelled them , even to look her way . One titan , his rough coat tied about his waist like a muzhik 's , bent dangerously forward to search the empty curving track where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; the tracks did climb above ground , snow had grounded the trains . Anice stood near a pillar , her breathing shallow , her heart thudding , her body too warm . And that exposed , endless block at the other end of the ride , if there was ever a ride ! She heard the train , she refused to turn her head lest the sound prove nothing but a hope . It roared past her , its noise rolling against the tunnel walls in furtows like the snow divided and cast up by the plow . The doors wheezed open on almost deserted cars . Even in the empty air stale morning odors clung , the stench of wet wool and rubber , of overheated human bodies . Anice sat in a corner near the end of a car , feet square and heavy on the floor . She could close her eyes , but not her other senses against the foray of metallic thundering propulsion . Too many decibels , she thought . I do n't know how people stand it , of course they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street station , with snow sucked under the roof overhanging the platform gyrating in ballet patterns . A slow gathering of  | speed for the plunge down under the great hill of upper Manhattan . A halt somewhere in the depths , the lights off in the car , the silence and immobility mounting in a wave of apprehension . Anice remembered news photographs of terrified passengers crawling along a catwalk . A south-bound train hurtled past , crowded , human faces a trailing blur of dirty white behind its windows . Again the lights flickered on and the train in which Anice sat picked a tentative start , gathered force . The long blurred trail of faces clung in Anice 's mind like heavy cobweb , an impressionist 's painting of dogged human endurance . I do n't know how they stand it , she repeated . The blur widened , it webbed the whole earth , patient , dogged human faces everywhere , like the always rising of the night in that poem of MacLeish , the vast and ever climbing shadow , not night , but people moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved her feet inside the huge overshoes , she pushed the damp scarf back from her forehead . In another minute she 'd be feeling sorry for poor , downtrodden humanity . In her head the rhythm of the poem moved , she could n't hear the words , Clif must have read it to her years ago , to feel how swift , how secretly the shadow  --  shadow of what , death ? night ? Oh , she did n't care ! If ever she got out of this mess , back to her normal life The train slowed , Anice peered through the grimy window , thank heaven this was her station , movement could take the place of all this footless thinking . She followed the others , two men and a ponderous colored woman , she stood with them in the great cage of elevator while it creaked slowly up toward the surface of the earth , she plodded up the flight of stairs to the street . The wind was behind her again for the long block , the snow  | was kneedeep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air had more light above her , the flakes fine and pointed on her face came from the raveling edge of the storm clouds as they moved out to sea . Porters shoveled the driveway under the porte-cochere , snow-domed tars ranged the curb . Anice stood in the sheltered doorway , trying to draw a long breath . She 'd made it . Like the postman . She snatched off her scarf and shook snow from its folds , she kicked her feet against the step , and pushed through the revolving door . Others had made it , too , and she had no burst of applause from the elderly man perched uneasily on the edge of a chair , from the desk attendants , as crisp and indifferent as yesterday . What was that phrase , for service over and beyond the line of duty ? No one in this damned place seemed to know there was a storm . Anice stopped at a telephone booth in the hall and called Kathleen . " I made it , " she said , and waited for Kathleen to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Have you seen the Mister ? How is he this morning , the povreen ? " " I just this minute got here , " said Anice . " I thought yin I 'd be worried . " She set the arm down hard on its hook . No one greeted her on the fifth floor . She hung her coat over a chair in the waiting room , stacked the galoshes near the radiator , mopped off the attache case , and sank own in the wicker armchair . She was exhausted , somene should come loping up with a St. Bernard . She held p one hand to see if it trembled from exertion . She felt weak , as if she 'd worn out the very marrow of her bones . Well , she could make a good story of it , she 'd make someappreciate it , Linton , or Guy , or even Lorimer . She tight tell Clif , if he came to enough to listen . She had time enough to rest , the patch of sky visible  | through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incandescence of after-storm tranquillity ( like a child recovered from a tantrum ) before the nurse came to the door . " Mr. McReal is waiting for you , " she said , her smooth skin like mother-of-pearl in light reflected from the long florist 's box she balanced against one shoulder . " I 'll get a vase for these flowers . " " I 'll arrange them . " Anice reached for the box . She was sure the girl clung to it before she released it so suddenly Anice had to scramble to catch it . " How on earth could anyone deliver anything such a morning ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know . They may have come last night . " . " And you left them in the box ? " " With my patient in an oxygen tent , flowers would n't ? " " You mean  --  my husband was worse ? ( Like extreme unction ! ) No one told me ? " " Oh , no , Mrs. McReal . Dr. Priest ordered it to give Mr. McReal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers , but she 'd won with her superior knowledge . Poor Clif , thought Anice , how does he endure her ? As soon as he 's better I 'll insist on a change . ) " Has Dr. Priest seen him this morning ? " Imagine that man plowing his way to a subway entrance ! " Oh , yes . Dr. Priest was in early . He was pleased with my patient 's improvement . " " How did he get here ? " " I believe he stayed in town . " The nurse turned to go . Even the way her black hair curled springily under her cap had an assured insolence . They just were n't human , any of them , nurses , doctors . Anice had an ironic picture of them , manikins hung on  | hooks in the basement for the night . Impossible to imagine them with homes or families . " I had hoped to see Dr. Priest , " she said , firmly . He had an emergency op. at nine . " And who do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly away . The door of Clif 's room stood ajar , the shades were drawn against the brilliance of the sky , the hospital bed still lay flat , but a small pillow under Clif 's head tipped his face slightly forward , and his balled hands rested outside the white cover . His eyes watched the door , and as Anice entered she saw the look of strain ( as if he watched for something beyond his range of vision ) loosen from eyelids and nostrils , saw the hands unclench . " Hello , darling ! Oh , you look so much better ! " Anice brushed a kiss between his brows , she touched the upturned palm . " Why , they 've even shaved the man ! " " Hello , " said Clif , and his voice had a shallow lack of resonance . " Do n't try to talk , " said Anice . " Are you more comfortable ? Let 's invent a sign language , one wink for yes , two for no , three  --  we 'll leave three until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how steadily they regarded her ! ) Did you know we 'd had a terrific storm ? I could n't even get a cab , I had to come by subway , Kathleen made ale wear her galoshes . ( Did he hear what she said ? His eyes followed her as she laid the long box on the arms of e chair and pried up the cover , but they held again that kook of yesterday , acceptance , quiet , almost indifferent . ) The nurse said she 'd bring a vase , she should have taken these out last night . Look , Clif , are n't they lovely ? " She tipped up the box , the waxed papers folded back . Gladioli , anemones , what 's this other , oh , godetia . All red and  | white . She opened the small envelope and read the card . " Wishing you a speedy recovery , from your Seminar . " Clif 's hand made a little flip of rejection . " Do n't you want them , darling ? " His hand moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , you never did like glads . " " Please omit flowers , " said Clif , and his mouth straightened in the beginning of a grin . " Take them home . " " I do n't want them , I could n't carry the damn things . Here ? " Anice picked up the box and thrust it at the nurse who had slipped in ( without a sound , the sly minx ! ) a vase in each hand . Anice dropped the box across her arms . " Give them to somebody , anybody , Mr. McReal hates glads , he does n't like cut flowers anyway . " " Much better for him , " said the nurse , " not to have them in the room , pollen , odor , irritating . " She backed out with her load . Anice settled into the armchair . " It was nice of the class to send them , " she said , tentatively . Did he want her to talk on and on ? Like dropping stones into a well , never hearing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than a hair 's breadth , but toward her . Anice reached forward to lay her hand across his . His fingers closed over hers , gently , a soft , relaxed touch , down moved his eyelids . He knows I 'm here , thought Anice . He cares that I am here . But that 's all . Of course , insulated in this cell , he could n't realize what difficulty she 'd had in arriving at this spot . No one could have blamed her if she 'd telephoned that she simply had to wait . He just took for granted that she would appear , he paid no heed to anything she said . Her hand twitched and at once his fingers increased their light pressure . Anice eased herself forward , resting her weight against  | an elbow so that her right hand could lie undisturbing , relaxed , within his grasp . His face looked curiously young , white , hollowed under cheekbones , reduced to its essential structure , grimy signs of the years erased . Timeless . She could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was over , the doctor was pleased . Perhaps if you were very sick you had to be completely engrossed . The way an injured animal goes off and hides . Only a person hides deep inside himself . Beyond ordinary communication . She had come into a foreign land , where nothing that she had to offer had any value . The language that she spoke meant nothing , she held no coins of the realm . Even touch  --  those cool , passionless , immobile fingers around her hand  --  had lost its familiar quality . It made a demand upon her which she could not interpret . But Clif had found in it whatever he had needed , he was sleeping now , his breathing light and irregular . For a baffling and humbling moment Anice knew that he had rejected everything she had intended to offer him , her charm , her wiles , her diverting talk , her determined gayness , and had taken instead just her being there . Not me , really , she thought . Just the guy that hauls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the world , out of what we 've had together , I 'm to one human being he can make into the answer to his need . I ca n't stand it ! It 's as if he put his fingers down to the very bottom of me and dragged me inside out ! She leaned away from the bed , drawing her hand from under his so slowly that movement seemed an illusion , so imperreptibly that Clif did not wake , until she had it free . The day moved on with a monotonous rhythm . At Intervals the nurse said , " Just a few minutes , please , Mrs. McReal , " and Anice walked along the corridor to the waiting room . She tried to work on the manuscript she 95  | had brought , but the nurse interrupted , her rite completed , Mrs. McReal could come back . In the long afternoon the fifth floor seemed very quiet , with few callers , with less cheerful convalescent talk behind the screens as Anice passed the opened doors . Clif had grown restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth in a grimace , and the nurse said , " I 'll have to give him a hypo , he 's done very well today , he 's tired and the pain is worse . " " I 'll see you in the morning , " said Anice . " Guy 's coming tomorrow , he 'll want to see you . " Again she was not sure that Clif listened . Galoshes in one hand , case in the other , scarf over her arm , Anice went down to the lobby . The desk attendant said she 'd heard taxis were running on Broadway . " You can go through the next building , you come out right on Broadway . Right back there . " She pointed . " Someone might have told me before this morning , " muttered Anice as she made her way down the long narrow hall with all the closed doors announcing unfamiliar and countless variations on the business of diseases . The street was a black river between grimy banks in the twilight , a taxi moved toward the piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave the address . " I do n't make no promises , " shouted the driver over the whang of a broken link of tire chain . " The side streets'ra mess . Sit back , will ya ? If I 'd of stood in the garage I 'd been smarter . " Anice leaned back in the corner , eyes closed , feet braced for sudden stops and skids and bursts of speed , ears assaulted by the strident voice of the city stirring out of its brief immobility . She would n't watch , she would n't drive the damned cab . What was that story about the  | Soviet trial , they put a tin bucket over the victim 's head and beat on it with metal bars until he screamed out a confession . The cab was the bucket , the tire chain flogged the fender , in a moment she would scream ! " What'd'you know ? " The cab slid around a corner . " They got your street cleared . " The firehouse , thought Anice , and could not break her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand the driver thrust back to press down the handle of the door and clambered out , ankle deep in a river of slush at the curb . I do n't know how long I can keep this up , she thought , standing well back in the elevator , paying no heed to the animated talk of weather which the other tenants exchanged as the car moved up . If I get a cold , I certainly could n't go near Clif , very dangerous for him . That nurse would think I 'd faked it . Dear Lord , I could use a day in bed ! And Clif would lie there watching the door of his room with that strained impersonal waiting . Oh , he had no right to send out such compulsion upon her ! But the foreign , unreachable territory into which he had moved had no code of right or wrong . Kathleen was at the telephone as Anice opened the door . The girl waved the ear-piece toward her , but Anice shook her head . " I 'm not here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even curious . Presently Kathleen appeared at the door , and Anice glanced up from stripping off wet shoes and stockings . Would Mrs. McReal mind if Kathleen went with her girl friend to the movies , there was this grand picture at the Olympia , she had dinner ready , with determined stubbornness ) she had n't been out the whole week on account of the Mister . If you want to go out such a night , why should I care ?  | " Ah , there 's nothing to it by now , the streets is cleared . An ' I 'll have my overshoes ? " " Oh , my God ! " Anice fell back in the low chair . " I forgot them ! I had them when I left the hospital . I left them in the cab . " " If you 'd put them on , " said Kathleen , stooping with an awkward and angry thrust of her rear to pick up the soaked brogues , " you 'd had dry feet and I 'd had my overshoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her purse toward the girl . " I could n't walk in them ! " " Where 's a shop near , " demanded Kathleen , " if any was open on a Saturday evening ? I 'll borrow the Mister 's rubbers , an ' tie them on so I 'll not be leaving them . " She turned in the doorway , each forefinger hooked into one of Anice 's shoes . " How did you leave Mr. McReal ? " she asked , stiffly . Anice answered her just as stiffly . She took her time about bathing , she ate the excellent dinner which Kathleen served , she heard the girl muttering away in the kitchen but she did not try to turn the sounds into words . When she said good-night , she considered a phrase or two , such as , " I hope the picture will improve your mood , " and then rejected it . " You have your key , of course ? " was all she said . " I 'm going to bed . " Anice detached the extension telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the small bottle onto a coaster , filled the carafe , and in the dark watched a single large star , its light splintered in the windowpane , move in almost imperceptible degrees in an upward arc , like a brilliant , slow , and deadly spider . Down the hall the telephone rang , its repeated intermittent signal merging into the clank of broken tire chain against a fender .  | The sun woke her , warm and molten gold on her eyelids . She rolled away from the window , the inverted after-image , black with gold bars , hanging behind her lids . Her head had the soggy aftermath from sleeping pills . Pheno-barb at night , benzedrine in the morning , as Clif had said , " You knock yourself out and then you jazz yourself up . What are you running so fast for ? " She had defended herself . Just because he slept like a log ? All , but now he did n't object when the nurse offered something much more potent than the harmless little pills Anice took . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to warn Clif . She twisted herself flat on her back and stared at the ceiling pied with prismatic light reflected from mirror and crystal flasks . Not Clif , he 'd never be any kind of addict , he did n't have that temperament . Probably today or tomorrow he would tell the nurse that the pain was n't too bad , she could lay off that st uff . Well , she 'd settle for coffee this morning , she did n't need much brilliance for the kind of day she had ahead of her . The air filled with sound , sudden incredible clangor of sweet-tongued bells , the notes piling one upon the other , Oh come , all ye faithful , come let us adore him . That Riverside carillon . Anice sat up in bed to listen , the tune went on inside her head but the bells no longer sounded . Just a trick of the wind , gathering a handful of bronze ! lords to drop around her . She cocked her head , listening hard , that sounded like  --  why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his laugh ? Anice opened her door a crack . Kathleen  | was talking , her voice going on and on with its intonations exaggerated , she was telling a story , and the man  --  why , that was Guy 's laugh ! Anice hesitated an instant . Hobnobbing with the maid instead of coming straight to her ! ( I did n't want to disturb you , he would say . If he 'd wanted to ? ) He could wait now until she 'd made herself more presentable . Although heaven only knew what that girl would tell him . Anice moved with deft speed , and only a few minutes later reached into the closet for a negligee , that yellow robe , very feminine , she used to wear it for Sunday morning breakfasts ? She rejected it . She should look more functional , more enduring . The green coat . Then she opened her door and stepped just over the threshold . " Guy ! " she called . Kathleen 's voice boomed on . " Guy ! Guy , darling ! " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Guy appeared at the end of the hall . Anice extended her hands , waiting , and he came striding toward her , with his loose-jointed , still youthfully awkward gait . His hands gripped hers , he gave her a quick dutiful kiss , he held her off and inspected her . " Oh , it 's lovely to have you ! " Anice slid a hand into the crook of his arm and leaned against him . " It 's so good to have you home . " " Yep , I 'm glad I got here . I wanted to come right away , but I had these finals yesterday . I could have passed them up , but the woman , your secretary I guess , said everything was under control . " " It 's all right , " said Anice . " There really was nothing you could do here . But I do n't feel quite so  --  well  --  abandoned , now you 've come . " They walked slowly along the hall , Anice fitting her step to his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ca n't imagine old Clif having anything wrong with him . " " It was a shock . But the doctor 's very pleased with his  | progress . ' I quote . But you can see for yourself , you 'll come with me , wo n't you ? " They had reached the living room , and Anice released his arm , swinging him slightly to face her . " Let me look at you , " she said . " You 're thin , you 've been working too hard . " Dark heavy hair , thick dark lashes and brows , like his father 's . Mat-white skin , very clear . ( He 'd been astonishingly beautiful as a baby , like alabaster . ) He did n't look like Guy Senior , his eyes niet yours with inquiry , not with boldness , and his mouth , except when he smiled , had a firm reticence . Of course he had n't changed in the few weeks since Christmas . Just her maternal instinct , like a cow sniffing at her calf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still was . His father had reversed that ratio . Funny how the aura of experience which Guy Senior had exuded ( and what a horrid word that was , exude ! ) had been the quality which had attracted Anice . Showed how young she was . She 'd had enough of it before she delivered herself . Her son was a sort of prodigy  --  not that he was eccentric or anything  --  and prodigies stayed young longer than dull boys , they had too much on their minds to get messed up with girls . It was nicer that way . Anice sighed , thinking how queer it was to have a baby turn into a boy and then a than , someone 's lover . " Well ? " Guy grinned at her . " Do n't I suit you ? " " You suit me fine , " said Anice . " Is it illegal or something to have your coat and trousers match ? " " Only when I pose for a man of distinction . " He patted his hands admiringly down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers . He swung into the dining room as Kathleen came from the kitchen bearing a tray on which the silver-domed cover announced pancakes . He drew back a chair for Anice and seated himself opposite . " Three cakes for a start , " he said . He tucked slabs of  | butter between the delicately browned disks and flooded the plate with syrup . Kathleen made a rush for the kitchen , her voice booming as she banged the refrigerator door open and shut . " It puts the heart back in my body to see a man eat again ! " She tramped back with butter replenishment . " Douse it on , " she said . " You need padding for your frame , you 've not filled out to full man size yet . " " You 'd make a grand wife for a man , " said Guy , waving his fork with a three-layered mouthful . " Are you spoken for ? " Anice could n't reach Guy 's foot under the table , she gave a little cough , intended as warning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded her arms at her waistline , rocking her firm , solid body , her face doleful . " Are you still carrying a torch for that guy down the block ? What did I tell you Christmas ? " " It 's a mortal sin you 'd have me committing . " " No worse than sitting around wishing death on a poor lunatic . " " Your cakes are burning , " said Anice , and Kathleen made another rush for the kitchen . Anice looked at Guy , lifting one shoulder in a little shrug . " Sorry , " said Guy , another forkful on the way up . " Did n't mean to ruin your discipline . " " That 's too strong a word , " said Anice . " But for breakfast table talk ? " she smiled , cajoling him ? " I 'd rather hear what you 've been doing . " Kathleen plodded back and set the covered platter in front of Guy . " They were n't burning , " she said , and stalked into the kitchen . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incited the canary to a freshet of song . Guy turned to watch the small yellow bird , like concen-  | trated sunlight in the window , every soft feather in vibration . " Peace , it 's wonderful ! " said Guy . " Now that 's something . He would n't sing a note at Christmas , remember ? I told Clif he 'd bought a dud , I wanted to take him back and swop for one with a voice . Listen to that ! " He had to get acquainted was all , " said Kathleen from the doorway . " Nonsense . " Anice could n't keep all impatience from her tone . " Someone put you wise to that trick with running water , the bird thinks it 's another bird . " " He 's got his feelings , too , " said Kathleen . " Will you be using more cakes , Guy ? " " Only for earmuffs . " Guy flattened one hand under his chin . " Way up to here ! " " Would you be coming home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . " " I 've been staying all day . " Anice paused , dangling hours and hours strung like beads on the cord of her devoted service ; did Guy notice ? " Yesterday was ghastly , once I reached the hospital I did n't even try to venture out , not even for lunch . Clif should be more himself by today . " Sunday , and Kathleen had the late afternoon and evening off . Dinner at one . After all , Clif would understand that Guy had to eat . " It really would n't take much longer to come back here , could you get a cab from the station ? " " A cab ? Me ? " Guy grinned at her . " Lucky I had me a ( lime for subway fare . The streets are all right , icy in spots but the sun 'll fix that . " " Count on us , then , Kathleen . At any rate I 'll see that Guy gets here . He 's worth getting a good dinner for , and I'Il @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the door into the  | kitchen . Behind it her voice rose in an animated , unintelligible monologue . " She 's a great girl , " said Guy , pushing back his chair . " I do n't wonder you discourage her amour with the janitor . " It 's the priest that interferes , not me . " Anice got to her feet . " Oh , it is good to have you here , Guy darling ! Everything comes alive , you 've no idea how dreadful it 's been , coming back to this empty house ! " " Yeuh , and leaving poor ole Clif stranded in the hospital ! I ought to 've been here the day they operated , I might of been some use . " " Clif refused to let anyone know , you or Marian or Lorimer . It was all so sudden there was n't time , anyway . " Anice clung to his arm , leading him away from the kitchen and Kathleen . " I 'll be dressed in a jiffy , you can look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nurses are forever driving visitors out of the room . " " Is it okey if Kathleen does some laundry for me ? " " She would n't have time today , with early dinner . I would n't dare ask her on a Sunday , anyway . " " She offered , " said Guy . " She just loses her head for anything in pants . What 's wrong with tomorrow , her regular day for laundry ? " ( I must be careful not to push the boy , too much , he 's always wanted his own way even in the most ridiculous small things . ) " As you like , " said Guy , " if you do n't mind shipping the stuff after me . " " Guy ! You 're not going tomorrow ? " " Yep . Have to get back . " " You really could help a great deal if you stayed a few days . " They had reached the door of the guest room . Guy 's traveling bag gaped open , crammed to the gills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly over the back of a chair , with a pile of books on the chair seat , a leather-covered notebook , a large thick book , probably Einstein 's latest , and a gaudy paper-jacketed mystery . " Sorry , Mom . But I 've got a kind of job , laboratory assistant , and the prof asked me to help with registration . " " I 've got a kind of job , too , " said Anice , " and I have n't been near it for days . I 'd rather counted on you . " She could see the Adam 's apple bobbing in his smooth throat as he turned away . " You wo n't lose your job . " He bent over the bag , shoving a fist into the contents , poking things out of sight . " You 're one of the top guys . Me , I 'm the bottom Guy . II I do n't show on Tuesday , there 's a dozen fellows in line for the post . " " Oh , I know , darling ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , occasionally , retreat was indicated . " It 's grand that you have this chance , and it 's really very good of you to take the tiresome trip when you have so little time . Forgive me if I sounded crabbed . I 've been under such a strain ? " " Gosh , yes ! " Guy looked up , his eyes still grave . " It must have been awful . What did they do to the poor ole calif , anyway ? " " I 'll tell you all about it . Now I must get dressed . " She spun on her heel , straight into Kathleen 's waiting bulk . How long had the girl stood there , sneaking up without a sound ? She had a hoity-toity look about her . " If you 'll give me your duds ? " Kathleen edged around Anice ? " I'Il put ' em to soak while I stuff the duck . " Anice shrugged and closed the door of her own bedroom very gently , resisting the tense muscle-impulse to slam it hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could have a few hours off tomorrow . Long  | enough to walk into the office , pick up the reins for a few minutes of firm direction . Winston should be back from his Baltimore and Washington trip . Burke should be back . As she planned , she dressed . For Sunday , for her son , for Clif who should be less comatose today , surely , she put on a black taffeta frock smartly cut to heighten bosom appeal and diminish waist expansion . Not a bad figure for a woman past forty . Middle-aged . Oh , God , not yet ! The middle of age must be later . A choker of chrysoprase , and earrings . If only those orchids had kept  --  where was the box , anyway ? She had forgotten it , Kathleen must have thrown it out . Outside her door sounded the blast of Kathleen 's laughter , and a shout from Guy followed the girl 's tread down the hall . Now her fur jacket , gray broadtail soft and pliant as velvet , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost a gala feeling today . The post-storm brilliance of yesterday had gone . The sky , the very air over rooftops , was drab , like a reflection of the dingy piles of snow along the side streets , banking high the marooned cars that lined the curbs . Guy handed her into the cab , the wheels swished through melting slush toward Broadway , and Anice told amusingly of her journey yesterday , with Kathleen 's lost galoshes as final touch . " She acted as if I 'd left them behind on purpose . " " Did n't you ? You know , the something pathology of everyday life , you really mean all your mistakes . " " Good heavens , you do n't believe that nonsense ? " " I would n't know , " said Guy . " Sometimes I have a notion more goes on than I actually keep an eye on . You know , like waking up with the theorem solved or the notion for a formula ? " " I know . The fad of the unconscious . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novels that come in now do n't sound so much like case histories , or perhaps all the novelists who could afford to go to an analyst have written up their confessions . " " You would n't like it , would you , Mom ? I mean the notion that you were n't really boss , that there was a fernicnt under the surface ? " " People use all that as an alibi when they want to do things they know they should n't , instead of standing up and saying I 'm doing this because I jolly well want to do it . " Anice wondered for a moment what Guy was thinking . He looked at her , his eyes bright with mischief , his mouth mobile , ideas moving almost into words , shadows thrown across the grass by an unseen bird in flight . Some youthful impertinence . " Never mind ! Do n't say it . " Anice laughed . " I 'm not going to tell you what I do that I know I should n't , but when I do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was three . " " Did he ? " Guy asked so ingenuously that Anice started to answer , and then both of them laughed . " Now that 's that , " said Guy . " Tell me about Clif . " The telling carried them to the entrance of the hospital , with Anice shrewdly underplaying the length of the operation , the suspense before the diagnosis was made , the impersonal austerity of the physician , the hours of waiting with only occasional glimpses of Clif . ( See what I have had to endure ! ) " They sure gave him the works , did n't they ? " said Guy . " This the place ? " Anice handed her purse to Guy . " You pay him , darling . " She watched Guy as he counted out the exact fare into the driver 's hand , and added a quarter . " Give him another quarter , " she said . " He rates it , taking his cab out in this slush . " Guy turned his head as he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jaw . Really , if he could n't take the smallest suggestion ? He stepped out , the driver said , " Mind your head , " and Anice unfolded herself without haste . " I begin to feel that I 've spent most of my life here , " she said , as they walked into the lobby . " I 'm going to start a movement for first aid to visiting firemen , oxygen tents or transfusions , something energizing . " Guy did n't smile , had he even listened ? He looked gravely about him , at the offices , at the visitors already seated . " At any rate I know the ropes now . The elevators are back here . " The fifth floor attendant would let them know when Mr. McReal could see them . They sat in the waiting room , the wicker chair squeaking its dry squeak as Guy shifted his legs or leaned forward to watch a nurse pass trundling her cart laden with medications and mysterious implements . " Tell me about your work , " said Anice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . " Not much to tell , said Guy . He 'd get his M.S. in June all right , he 'd finished the courses and passed the finals , just had to write up his research stuff . He 'd use the same material for his Ph.D. , probably take him about three semesters more to pull that down . " Wo n't this teaching job interfere with your work ? " " Not too much , it 's laboratory supervision , I can go right on with my own problem . " " I 'm not sure I approve , " said Anice . " Your record is so fine , should n't you be entirely free ? It 's not as if you had to earn your living . " " I ca n't be dependent forever , " said Guy . " Even it it does help your income tax . " He thrust forward his chin in speculative aggressiveness . " I might want to get married . " " Guy ! Do n't talk like that ! "  | " Lots of people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're older , and they have that Bill of Rights ? " " I got me a bill of rights , too . " " Guy , is this your way of telling me you 've got a girl ? " " My only trouble is which . " " You know , Guy darling , you 're so damned smart that part of the time I forget how young you are . All I hope is that your only trouble stays which until you grow up . " Guy 's eyes moved past Anice , and she turned , to find the nurse standing just inside the room . ( Snooping again ! ) " Good-morning , Miss  --  Miss ? " " Sexton , " said the girl , her black and white crispness altered as she looked not at Anice but at Guy . " Guy , this is Miss Sexton , Clif 's day nurse . My son , Miss Sexton , Mr. Harrison . " Guy angled up from the splintery chair and shot out his hand , pumping the hand Miss Sexton extended . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " How 's Clif this morning ? " Mr. McReal showed steady improvement . It would be better if he had only one visitor at a time . Trying to attend to two guests at once was too much of a strain . But my son 's come from Boston just to see his stepfather , " began Anice , her ire like static in her voice . " I 've got all day , Mom , " said Guy . " You go see Clif , and then by and by you sign off and give me a turn . " The nurse smiled at him as he went along the corridor with Anice , as far as the door . " I 'll hang around . " " It 's nonsense , " said Anice . " If we were strangers , yes , but you and me ! " " I guess she runs this show , " said Guy . " She 's a good looker . Be quite a comfort to have a gal like that smooth your fevered brow . "  | Anice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . The room had a different atmosphere this morning , more light , a soft , diffused light from the clouded sky , more air , clear air for breathing , not the heavy saturate air so laden with effluvia of opiates and antiseptics and unknown medications . The room had been a dark cave of suffering , now it seemed just a very clean , not at all un pleasant place . The head of the hospital bed had been cranked up a little , and Clif looked at Anice as she came round the screen from a more human , less effigy-ish angle . " Hello , " he said . " You 're late . I thought something had happened . " " Your nurse would n't let me in . " Anice kissed him , he circled one of her wrists with thumb and forefinger . " Oh , you are better ! Your voice is stronger . " " Where you going , all dolled up ? " " Nowhere else but right here . " " Who were you talking to ? Just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Guy ! He got in this morning . " " Oh . I thought it was the doctor . Why does n't Guy come in ? " " Your nurse again . One at a time , says she . " " Urn . I thought it was the doctor , telling you ? " Clif let go of her wrist . " No ! Do n't sit on the bed ! " He spoke testily at a slight movement of Anice , and laid his hand protectingly over the smooth fold of sheet . " It jars me . As if it was n't enough to cut out half my ribs , they 've dug manholes in my ankles for transfusions . I told the doctor ? " his voice thinned as he used it , and he stopped , waiting for the bellows to fill ? " they 'd kill me with their cures . Anni , what did he say ? The doctor ? Sit down , you look so  --  so temporary . "  | Anice sat down in the armchair , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor darling , " she said . " It roust be awful . But it wo n't last forever ? " CI if made an impatient gesture . " Do n't quibble . You can tell me just what they said , Dr. Priest or the other w , Conway . " " Rut it was n't the doctor , Clif dear , it was Guy . " " You have n't seen him ? " Clif 's face was rigid with susuion . " But he said he 'd told you ? " " Oh ! " Anice leaned forward , and in the muddy current , cI confused feelings  --  faint resentment at Clif 's implications , at his irritability  --  there was a sudden dizzying swirl about a rock , a movement of pity , of comprehension . " I did n't understand , " she said . " Of course I 've talked with him . You 're still worrying ! Foolish boy ! Did n't they tell you it was nothing , just a virus ? " " Sure , they told me . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report was negative , absolutely , positively negative . Dr. Priest had it in his hand , he let me look at it . Now do you believe ? " Clif shut his eyes . Under the smooth cover his knees drew up with the small crackling sound of crisp linen pulled loose from its taut and tucked-in neatness , his head lifted from the pillow as if his body wished to round over , head down on his knees . Then he let go again , the mound of his knees flattening , his head back and his eyes open . " Funny , " he said , " I was so damned sure they were lying . " " I doubt that Dr. Priest would lie . He has n't enough kindness or imagination . " " I 'll never forget that morning  --  I kept going in and out ? " Clif frowned , his eyes moving under the lids as if they searched ? " on and off , perhaps , like a light . Every  | time I came on , I ran right into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a  --  what 's the word ? ? hallucination . They were the eyes of God , wise , compassionate . So I could go off again . " " That must be his bedside manner , " said Anice , lightly . " He looked right through me at the opposite wall . " Well , that would be considered Godlike , too . She must n't argue with Clif . He was n't really listening to her , he seemed still fumbling among indistinct memories , the range of his attention had narrowed to himself . " But he would n't lie , I can see that now . " Clif 's hands relaxed . " I had such horror ? " " He should n't have told you that it might be cancer , " said Anice . " Not until he knew . " " I had a right to know . Then , being a fool for fear , I decided they all conspired to buck me up , fatten me nicely for future torture . " " Never think of it again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you have to do is to get strong and well . " " It 'll bear some thinking about . Like a stay of execution . But I wo n't talk about it , I promise . " " No , please do n't . It 's too awful . " Anice stood , drawing her soft fur close . " Are you warm enough ? It 's a little drafty ? " " I 'm warm now , " said Clif . " Do n't go , push down the window . " " I 'm going to let Guy come in , " said Anice . " You wo n't mind if we go back to the apartment for dinner ? It would break Kathleen 's heart if she could n't feed the boy . She just mourns over you all the time . " She edged toward the door , talking too fast , trying to control the exhausted shivering which ached so in all the hollows of her body that it would force itself out in helpless crying unless she  | could get out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours will let me . " She walked quickly along the corridor , movement easing the unwonted tension . Why , for an endless moment there she had felt Clif 's horror , as if her own flesh had become the host for the dreadful , devouring embryo of death . She could n't stand much more of this ! And what exactly would you have done , she asked herself , if the laboratory diagnosis had been positive ? Honestly , I 'm getting morbid , having to hang around this place . Guy stood at the window of the waiting room , hands in pockets . " You can see Clif now , " said Anice . " What are you looking at ? " " Good . " Guy wheeled . " How 's he feel ? I 've been watching a couple of fellows try to excavate their cars down there . Miss Sexton says a lot of the doctors got caught in the storm . How is Clif ? " " He is really better , " said Anice . " He was a little low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the doctors were lying to him , he had something malignant , of course when you 're weak it 's easy to let your imagination run riot . I 'm sure I convinced him . Do n't say anything to him about it , he 's promised not to talk that way again . " She sighed . " I 'm simply worn out ! But I did the best I could . " Guy 's glance was bright and contemplative , less admiring than it might have been . " That does n't sound like Clif , " he said . " Of course the whole thing was a great shock , no warning . " Anice laid her hand on Guy 's arm as he passed her . " Do n't argue with him no matter what he says , do n't excite him . " Guy shrugged off her hand , but his rangy stride lagged as he approached Clif 's door . Anice looked for a moment  | from the window into the parking lot below ; the activity there had no interest for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corners of her eyes and mouth . There was something withheld in Guy 's manner , not explicit criticism , but certainly a failure to offer any awareness of what she , Anice , had been through or how much she had done . As an audience he sat on his hands ! And why ? Certainly he and Clif never discussed her , she knew them both too well to suspect them of what to them would be rank disloyalty , betrayal . Guy had been devoted to her as a little boy , until his father 's death had built him into the boy 's idol . At least she had n't seen that photograph and medal and letters set out in the guest room . This air of his was something different . Perhaps he did have a girl and knew she 'd never allow him to marry until he could support a wife . She 'd like to hear what he and Clif were saying . Why should n't she just stroll in ? As Clif 's wife she certainly did n't have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more likely to go emotional and excite Clif if she was n't there to act as brake . She started down the hall with quick , purposeful step , which slowed as she rounded the angle into the long main corridor . At Clif 's door the nurse was lifting from a cart a tray , napkin-covered . She kicked the door wide and bore in the tray . If the nurse was in there , and Guy , Anice might as well join the party . Guy backed through the door as she approached . " Yeuh , I 'll tell Kathy , " he said . " Niz baby eat oop all your spinach . I 'll bring that bathrobe this p.m . " " Not before four , Mr. Harrison , please . After all this entertaining , we need a good rest . And please close the door for me . " " Take good care of him , he 's a grand fella . " Guy pulled  | the door shut , grinning at Anice and picking her fingers off the knob . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I just want to say goodbye . " " Nahl We are temporarily closed , pending repairs . " He hurried her along to the elevator , his fingers hard around her arm . Under the ceiling light in the car Anice saw that Guy 's hair along his temples was beaded with sweat , that his iiiouth had thinned in a hard line , ending his brittle chatter . She moved lightly ahead of him into the cab which rolled up at their appearance . She rejected several remarks as the wrong lead . What was the boy so upset about ? " Here , darling . " She fluttered a handkerchief toward him . " Mop off your brow , you 're dripping . " He mopped at his forehead with his fingers . " Gosh , " he said , " it sure upset me seeing ole Clif like that . " " He looks much better today . If you 'd seen him two days ago ? " " Sure . " He gulped audibly . " He 's on the mend . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of a thing and you stand around making wisecracks . I 'll pick him up some mysteries , in a day or two he can sit up farther and maybe read a little . It 's grim all right , seeing someone you 're fond of all cracked up . " " It 's grim , " agreed Anice . " And you 've had to take it all by yourself . " Guy dabbed at her knee , a brusque , clumsy gesture . " Where 's Marian ? I should think his own daughter would show . " Anice explained . She was sweet and forbearing , expanding in Guy 's belated sympathy . " Lorimer said he 'd unne in tomorrow . " " He 's not much of a treat for Clif . " " Maybe he ca n't get in , he 's afraid of bad roads . "  | " Trains are running . " Guy 's tone was natural again . " Ah , but trains have germs . " Anice imitated Lorimer 's Oxfordish intonation , and smiled at Guy 's laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to put off his call till Clif can have more visitors . One at a time . " Resentment pricked in Anice . Cooling her heels at the nurse 's orders . Suppose she did n't return to the hospital today ? Such a short time , not until after four . When Guy had come just for the day ? She 'd wait until after dinner , perhaps she could work it . Dinner was a success for Kathleen and Guy . Anice hated the Sunday midday custom . Even when Kathleen had been so green she could n't find her way to Broadway without getting lost , she had known by servant grapevine that she had a right to the dottle of Sunday left after she had finished the dinner dishes . " You know I 'm never hungry at noon , " said Anice , patiently . " I 'll have a duck sandwich tonight  --  if you leave a scrap . " She refused the deep-dish apple pie , drank black coffee , and excused herself . " I feel the first wedge of a headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? " Guy could . He 'd walk out to find a drugstore where they had paper mysteries . " Would Clif like a posy , do you think ? No ? Too funereal . You go get some beauty sleep . " She could n't lie down , she 'd jerk herself to shreds if she did . She wanted something that was the opposite of illness and suffering and the smell of anesthetics . Sunday .  | The office closed . Someone was throwing a cocktail party , who was it ! She could n't go . Bzzzz , her husband at death 's door , is n't she shocking ? Now why should she wonder how to reach Burke ? He was the opposite of anesthetics III right . But if she called Mary Keston to ask for Burke 's home address she 'd expose herself to Mary 's devoted curiosity . Nothing she could do , nothing . She might as well go with Guy to the damned hospital . Accumulate credit toward tomorrow . She 'd make Guy wait over for a night train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would tempt him . The telephone sounded in the hall . Anice lifted the extension instrument in her room , gently , and listened as Kathleen spoke . Mrs. McReal was resting , she 'd left word not to be called " Anice , you 're on the line , you wretch , I heard you ! " I.inton 's words crackled in her ear , and she laughed . " I 'll take it , Kathleen . " She heard Kathleen 's snort and then the click as the girl hung up . " Wait till I get a chair . " She settled herself comfortably . " You 've certainly been my mainstay , my ever-present help in time of trouble , what I would have done without ? " " Anice , I 'm sick , I 'm a very sick man , I 'm scarcely able to lift my head , the doctor thinks I 've got this new kind of pneumonia , walking pneumonia . Even if I could move , I could n't expose Clif . I 've called the hospital so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you , you 're always out . Why are you home now instead of at Clif 's side ? You ought to be with him , I thought if I held off you 'd simply have to ? " " Did you get pneumonia on purpose , Linton ? And that session with your masseur ? Do n't tell me what I might to do ! " " Anice , I 'm dying of loneliness . I 'm bored to extinc-  | tion . Hop a cab and come to my rescue . I 'll give you a drink , that 's disinfecting , you can stay in the living room , I must have someone to talk with . " " Not me . I 'm due at the hospital at four . Guy 's here , too . " Linton rattled on . Clif was really better , was n't he , how was Guy , had Marian come in or her husband , Anice must be careful of herself , the doctor was sure Linton had picked up his germ at the hospital , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he 'd topple over unconscious if he moved . He should have someone with him , impossible to get a nurse . Was Anice really going back to the hospital and had she been there this morning and yesterday ? Anice sparred with him , ankles crossed , toes curling lazily inside her pumps . At least he whiled away stagnant time . As she listened or spoke she held in her mind a question ; it fluttered , like a moth enclosed in her hand , but she waited for the moment to release it . The apartment door opened and shut , and Guy called out to Kathleen . Quickly ! " Linton , you promised to tell that girl of CIA 's , you know , the graduate student , that I wanted to see her . Did you ? " Silence , the metronome of his steady tick-tock run down . " Linton , hurry ! Guy 's just come in . " " My God , no ! What do you think I am , that was before I knew Clif was up against ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Will you give me her name ? You see , Linton darling , Clif 's going to be infinitely more bored than you are right now , he 's got days and days ahead of him , as soon as he 's stronger  --  naturally he 'll want to see his friends . I think it 's rather wonderful of me to think of her . "  | " I know damned well you 're up to some of your tricks . " Linton began to laugh , a sound like quick fire leaping in twigs . " It 's pretty good , Noel Coward stuff . I 've got her name and address somewhere . I 'll crawl around and find it , send you a postcard . " " Bye , now . " Anice slipped the telephone onto its low shelf and went quickly to the door . Anice met Monday in high gear , covering her delight as she manipulated the day by tuning down her voice in pitch and tempo . Plane reservation for Guy , instructions to Kathleen , a message for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as possible . Surprise appearance at the office , girl at the reception desk not as surprised as she might have been , but Mary Keston speechless . Anice shook off her coat , and said , " Now for a week 's work in an hour or two ! " Mary took the red rose from the slender vase and dried the stem with a Kleenex , pricking a finger on a thorn . As Anice cut the stem and fitted the blossom into her lapel vial , the girl sucked at her finger-tip and burbled . " Mary ! " Anice laughed at her . " You 're as excited as if I 'd caught you in some crime ! " " I did n't expect you . " Mary wound her finger in the tissue . " If I 'd known ? I 've already told several you would n't be in . Is Mr. McReal much better ? " " My son is with him this morning , he is allowed only one guest at a time . Who called ? " No one important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , reorders , return of commission sales ,  | a threatened suit for plagiarism . " The woman says she wo n't sue if we 'll publish a new edition of her book . Life with the Brontes . Ten years old . It sold eighteen hundred the year we published it . " " Oh , Lord ! Authors ! We could sue her for blackmail . Does she think she invented the Brontes ? What does the lawyer say ? " " He 's checking the books . " " She would n't sue the firm , anyway , the author 's responsible . " " But Blanche Cross is such a nice girl , it 's her first book . " Mary sputtered in her earnestness . " She is an honest little schoolteacher , she 'd never steal a syllable . " " You know our contract protects us , we do n't have to fight that particular battle . " " I just thought you might talk with this Mrs. Snyder . " " She 's made more trouble than money for every book she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Keston !

He went on to Atlanta , somebody heard a rumor a new writer there had something , sort of a cross between Thomas Wolfe and Gone with the Wind . " " Who wants a hybrid imitation ? " Anice slapped her foot against the floor . " Did Burke trail along ? " " I do n't know , Miss Lang . " " Why do n't you know ? I told you I had to instruct him about the Cressman campaign . " Emotion reefed in Mary 's upper lip . " I 'll try to find out , " she said through her teeth , and rushed from the office . Anice looked at her desk calendar , all the wasted no-  | tations for the days last week , nothing at all for Monday , or Tuesday ? She felt that she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , that the firm , a ponderous mammoth , had lumbered along of its own momentum .

" Good to see you . ! low about lunch tomorrow , there 's this English publisher wants to pick up a few titles , he should have got in this morning but the blizzard delayed his ship . She 'll dock tonight . " " I 'd like to , Ben . " ( Clif , watching the door . Damn Guy , why could n't he stay ? Two hours , more likely four , cocktails , talk ? ) " I 'll make it if I can . Who 's going ? You ? " " I knew him in London , he helped me get a couple of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent . " ( Anice knew , she did n't want Ben to start on that ! ) " Winston 's not back . I suppose Florian could do it . " " Urn . " Anice tried to pull down a shutter against any image of the hospital , it would n't stay down . " I 'll have to call you in the morning . " " Of course , of course . " Ben 's face creased in huge folds of sympathy . " Have to be a wife first , I know . When a man 's sick ? " " Clif is n't sick , he 's convalescent . " She wanted to meet the Englishman , here , on her own ground , where she cold glitter . Then , when she flew across to England later this spring ? Why , of course Clif would be well enough by April not to interfere ! " If you ca n't get off for the trip abroad , " said Purdy , a new emotion squeezing the folds of his cheeks and jowls  | into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My knowing the ropes in London and Paris is an advantage . " " Not a prayer , Ben ! That 's my job ! The first time the firm 's sent me over . " Ben 's face sagged , and he withdrew . The firm was a ponderous mammoth moving with irresistible momentum , but if you were on hand you could goad it slightly in the direction you wished , hook at its flapping ears , wave a banner in front of its eyes to deflect it . Mary sidled in , stenographer 's notebook in her hand , wariness in her averted eyes . Mr. Burke would not be in before the first of next week . The secretary in the sales office said  --  Mary sat down , opened the notebook , poised a sharp pencil ? " Mr. Burke arranged to call at a dozen bookshops in the southern circuit , and then fly down to Miami for the week end with his wife . I 'm ready , Miss Lang . I can type some of your letters so you can sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the piled letters . " Only three of these I need to sign . You can sign the rest . " ( Burke 's wife was a fool , putting the length of the seaboard between herself and that man . Perhaps she 'd given up . Or found she could n't hang on to him even when she stayed home . Now how did he get that kind of money ? ) " How did I start that sentence ? " Anice fixed Mary with a wide , wistful gaze . " You do n't know how hard it is to come from that atmosphere of suffering , suspense  --  it makes all this so trivial ! " That did it . Mary 's wary , injured expression , with its hint of feline , slinking triumph ( you did n't know he had a wife ! ) submerged in a wash of sympathy . " You began , Your inquiry about the chances of a reprint sale of your book ? ' " " Oh , yes . " Anice picked up the broken sentence and went briskly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon , she hated the crowds at the quick order joints , she 'd go to the apartment . Guy had n't come in . Kathleen served her quickly , reporting several calls . Professor Blair , Mr. McReal 's son-in-law , said the driving was too dangerous , icy roads , Ile could n't get in today . Mrs. Blair sent her love to her father . Mr. Linton Webber . " He talks so fast I could n't get it all , Mis ' McReal . Something about the doctor would n't let him up , is he sick , too ? He 's sending you a card or a cart . " Kathleen poured more coffee . " I wish you 'd eat more , " she said . " You got to keep your strength up . " " Yes , " said Anice curtly . " It 's lucky I 'm tough . " Again in a cab on the way to the hospital , Anice tried in vain to check the resentment that revolved , a paddle wheel creaking round and round but never moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to do , resentment against the demands upon her , demands made by no one , made by the expectanon of everyone , implicit in the-situation . Once at the hospital she walked with dignified grace to the elevator , her head erect , her eyes incurious . The fifth floor had the deserted quiet of the after-lunch rest period . The desk attendant thought Mrs. McReal 's on had gone home . He 'd been in and out all morning . Mr. McReal must be resting , the No VISITORS sign hung on his door . She 'd try to locate the nurse . So she 'd passed Guy somewhere on the way . A final pressure , speeding the rotation of that paddle wheel inside her . Another afternoon of waiting . She tried again to compose herself , leafing through one after another of the battered magazines in the waiting room , their crumpled pages which would not lie flat testimony to tense , dread-damp fingers of other waiting victims .  | Miss Sexton made an appearance , having , Anice thought , taken her own sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he had slept out the sedative . He 'd had a bad night , refused morphine . " You mean he 's worse than yesterday ? " " There 's always an up and down , " said Miss Sexton . " Good days and bad . We expect that . I 'll call you . " I might better have stayed at work , thought Anice . I do Clif no good , he does n't even know I 'm here . Guy might have waited for me . She should have brought some of her work . Instead she had deliberately left everything at the office , so that tomorrow she would have an indefeasible reason for a few hours of freedom . She rehearsed the explanation she would give Clif . She would not speak of the luncheon with the English publisher . Clif , like other laymen , had a sardonic line on editors plying their clients with food and mostly drink at the Ritz . ( Overtime parking , he called it . " What you going to use when they begin to tear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult contract she had to draw for the new Weymouth historical romance . Weymouth 's agent was the slickest operator in town . Sometimes Anice was sorry she 'd ever succeeded in prying Weymouth loose from his previous publisher . She might have known that a renegade author had no sense of loyalty no matter what you did for him . Still a Weymouth topped the lists , three times he 'd made a book club , this one might although Anice had a hunch that along with war books this pseudo-history was on the downgrade . Partly a kickback from the movies . Historicals cost too much to produce , the movies were frantic with the threat from television . Weymouth was a cormorant , vain and thin-skinned to boot . Anice 's face sharpened as she saw in a flash the form her strategy would take . She 'd  | pretend to hold out for a share in subsidiary rights , movie , television , drama , any future inventions , some jet-propelled new form . Weymouth would be positive about such sales , he and the agent would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( overpowered ) so suddenly they 'd fall on their faces , and before they picked themselves up she 'd explain the necessity , the advantage to everyone of a different scale of royalties . She must reinember not to call Weymouth 's book historical romance , thus insulting him . It was a Novel ! Even Clif might understand that she had to get this job done , she should have done it last week , when ? It sounded like a day 's task , but Mary was a wizard on contracts , if Anice outlined her manoeuvre the girl could type the stuff . And Anice could lunch with the imported publisher . Later in the week she 'd have to have time off again to meet Weymouth and his agent . It would be a good battle . She 'd tell Clif a little about it , might divert him . She had for a time escaped that battering resentment ; as she emerged into awareness of the sounds and movements of the fifth floor she brought a degree of protection for herself , a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in outwitting a pair of cormorants . The nurse came for her , and walked with her to Clif 's door , speaking in cool professional manner , so low that Anice had to watch her young , smooth mouth to catch her words . Mr. McReal had asked for her . She must stay only a few moments , the doctor had ordered another transfusion , the blood count was low again . Try not to excite hint . The room had reverted to the dim , medicated cave of two days earlier , and Clif stretched flat again , so that his eyes showed too much white under the pupils . His " Hello ,  | Anice , " had more depth , however , than his speech of yesterday . His hand groped over the sheet , and Anice , sinking into the chair , slipping her fingers under his , felt the sheath of competence shrivel and fall . " Dear Clif , " she said . " You must n't try to be too brave . " ( Would this excite him ? ) " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a drug addict if you let them ? " " I do n't want to be snuffed out , " he said . " I want to know what I 'm at . Where were you ? Guy said ? " " Guy wanted to see you this morning . " Amazed , Anice felt tears smart under her lids . " They wo n't let us cone in together . I went to the office , just for an hour or so . You do n't mind ? I 've been here for hours , waiting . " " Have you ? I did n't know . " " I ca n't stay now but a minute . " " Do n't got " " Nurse 's orders , darling . Listen , tomorrow will be better , there 's always an up and down . Tomorrow ? " ( Now was the chance , quickly before the nurse turned her out , to explain that tomorrow he must not expect her before midafternoon . As early as she could make it . Clif surely would understand . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They wake you up before daylight to find out how you are . Have to get the bedpan emptied and the patient tidied up before the doctors make their rounds . There you are , well waked up , scrubbed , no privacy , no dignity , nothing but all anonymous carcass . Anni ! " He flung her hand aside and made a contorted movement , trying to lift his shoulders . " Take me home ! I loathe it here . You could get a nurse , I 'd get well faster . " " Clif , lie still ! You 'll hurt yourself . " Anice bent over him , her hands against his arms , her face near his . She felt his muscles slacken . " You 're on the mend , acting  | crazy like that ! " She drew her fingers over his forehead , brushing back his hair , feeling in the tips of her fingers the laxness of his flesh . " Be your age ! " She tried to hold her voice steady . " We 'll have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek on his , and felt his breath wheeze into her ear in a derisive grunted yah . Anice stood away from the bed at the nurse 's knock . She withheld her eyes after one glimpse of the contraption which an orderly wheeled into place on the opposite aide of Clif 's bed . " I 'm sorry , " said Miss Sexton , her inflection meaning that she was nothing of the sort . " Anice ! " Clif 's hand lunged down the sheet , full arm 's length . " Do n't send Guy in your place . " " Guy must be almost to Boston now , " said Anice . " Did n't he tell you ? " She swallowed the impulse to add , for the nurse 's benefit , " That 's why I let him come this morning . " She did n't have to justify her conduct to that smug piece of starch . " I 'll come early . I 'm sorry they 're throwing me out now . " * What had happened to her skillful rehearsed explanation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention , she had committed herself , quite as if some part of her beyond her volition admitted Clif 's right , his claim upon her . Apprehension huddled with her as the taxi swooshed her the miles to the apartment house . The streets were black rivers , hosed down before the slush froze again , full of reflected light from neon signs and approaching headlights , a garishness in the Scene which tightened her apprehension . Clif had moved  | backward in time . He had sloughed off the recent years , with their dissension , tacit disapproval , and of late , cleavage so deep it marked the end . Why , she had told Linton as much the very day all this began to happen . Now Clif , inexplicably , had returned to the time before their lines had angled far apart . His illness , his weakness , his need for  --  what ? ? love ? Or just human identity ? Anice wondered whether , if she had been the victim of a sudden malady , she would have needed Clif . But her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed illness made its own emotional path and it was n't that of sex . Although she had heard that t.b . had a way ? Was n't that what the Magic Mountain was about ? Her quick , spontaneous vision of herself in Clif 's place gave her a rush of images , the projector set at a fantastic speed : the dramatic announcement , quiet understatement from her , just a chance I may pull through , after all it 's purely physical , masked doctors , their eyes amazed and admiring , what gallant courage ! This is a far , far better thing that I do  --  whispers of solicitude , how is she , have you heard ? The taxi reached the apartment house before Anice reached her funeral , her search for the fare broke the racing film . As she went into the lobby she felt uneasy , as if her phantasy might be showing . She did n't know how she 'd feel if she heard a verdict of serious illness , possibly fatal . In a lightning stroke , in the timeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its blind , painful and sporadic progress , she knew that Clif had gone down into an abyss of experience while she skittered along a shelving path in sunlight too shallow to penetrate his darkness . He wanted to drag her down into his abyss , to share its horror , to protect him against the loathsome reptilian fears that  | writhed there ! She was so shaken in her rejection of this new concept that she did not hear the elevator operator 's inquiry . He held the car at her floor before he levered open the door , and she realized he was repeating his question . He hoped Mr. McReal was not worse . " Oh , no . No . He 's gaining . " " My woman says she 'd rather be the sick one any day than have something ail me . That 's the woman of it . " He nodded in sympathy , and released Anice . Oh , God ! Anice could n't get the key into the lock . She rang . Just little Florence Nightingales , that 's women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand to quote some sonorous prayer-book phrase . The Bible had a lot to say , not the Old Testament , the New . I 'm just not that type ! Anice glared at the door , then at Kathleen , opening it . " Mr. McReal is all right , " she said hastily . " He would n't have any morphine or whatever they use , and so he had a bad night , but he 's doing well . Do n't ask me any questions , I 've got to lie down . Did my son get off ? " " Yes , Mis ' McReal . " Kathleen sniffed . " He left you a note . " Her face flushed with the effort to bottle up the flood of talk she would have poured out . " I put it on your dressing table . And I 'd like to step out this evening . Mr. Murphy 's got him a television set on approval , he 's fixed the antenny , an ' invited me in to see it . " " Murphy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It used to be etchings , now it 's television . " " At eight , he said . Will you have your dinner soon ? " " No . " Anice started toward her room . What did the girl think she was paid for ? Guy , so lately here , might have been standing at the end of the hall . " You need n't hang around , " Anice said , not turning . " Leave me something on a tray . I 'm not hungry , you stuffed me too well  | this noon . " She closed her door on Kathleen 's clattering rush for the kitchen . Guy 's note was brief . He was sorry he 'd missed her , he had to get his bag packed . He 'd try to make it again in a couple of weeks . I hope you wo n't mind a word of advice he ended . It 's easier to write it than say it . Let the office go for a while . Clif needs you more than the firm does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't mean he would n't get well without , but . Love . G. Guy voiced the pressure that she felt , palpable as the force of gravity . Anice tore the paper into crumbs , wadded them into a ball and tossed it at the wastebasket . She practically lived at the hospital , what more did they want ? After all , Clif had passed the danger of the ordeal , he was on the mend . It would do him no good if she crawled into his abyss . Much better for him if she kept her spirits up , kept some touch with the real world . She stripped off her clothes with harsh swift hands . She was n't fair to Clif . He did n't want her to suffer . He just wanted her , not want as desire , but want as some obscure and unappeasable need . Not a personal need , a wanting of her , Anice , precise , directed only at her , a fire not to be quenched except by her . Clif had once had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some woman , X marks the spot where this woman stands , I happen to be in that spot . I 'm a surrogate , a substitute , a nice little symbol , that 's me . If Elinor , his ex-wife , had not died , perhaps Clif would have turned to her . She would have enjoyed such a role . She could have forgiven Clif , been his ministering angel . Too bad . Well , Anice the little understudy would have to play the part . She 'd fool them , Guy , Linton , Clif 's daugh-  | ter , even Kathleen . They all expected her to muff the lines . A word of Advice ! Guy had n't dared say it to her lace . Anice headed for the bathroom and stopped , eyeing the telephone on the night table . Her thoughts sparked along tense nerves . What about that girl , Clif 's fancy ? Linton had n't done as he promised , no card with her name and address had come . Clif might refuse to see her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amusing try . Put the mistress in place of the wife right where X marks the spot . Not that Anice really thought the affair had gone that far . Potential mistress . Of course Clif might not even wish to see her , quite aside from feeling that a hospital room was too exposed a site for a rendezvous . A man weak , sick , lost his taste for caviare . He wanted thin soup , a soft poached egg . And never , thought Anice , never before has anyone taken me for mash . I 'll call Linton . Later , when Kathleen has cleared out . No eavesdropping on this conversation . Within the next ten days Clif accomplished several minor triumphs , such as walking into his bathroom under his own steam , sitting in a chair at the window to eat his luncheon from the serving table the diet kitchen sent in , looking through the Tribune . The bandages over the transfusion incisions on his ankles and shanks made him look like a multiple injury case . Anice escaped the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several other doctors and the nurse , was beautiful in its quick healing .  | Linton Webber recovered from his virus enough to pay an unannounced call on Clif . Anice , ousted from Clif 's room for the usual midmorning inspection tour of doctors , saw Linton dart out of the elevator . She interrupted with anger his burst of greeting and inquiry . He had told her only yesterday that he was still house-bound . He knew that his presence allowing her a few hours at the office would be a godsend to her , she could have arranged to spend the morning there . Linton kissed her , dancing on his toes , and laughed . " You ca n't make me your alibi , I wo n't allow it , it 's you Clif wants . I ca n't stay but a second , I 'm flying to Miami , the doctor says I must get out of this climate , I 'm really not well . I knew you 'd use me for an excuse , you 'd run oft for hours and hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at his door , say hail and farewell . I probably reek of germs , should n't stay if I could . " " You have n't been sick at all . You 're a fine friend , running away to Florida when you might help ! " " You should n't permit yourself to get into a rage , Anice darling , it 's not becoming , it does something ugly to your face , makes you years older , makes your line here ? " he drew a finger from her ear to her chin ? " much too heavy . You 're still beautiful , you know , except when in a rage . " " Leave me alone ! " Anice stalked away from him , into the waiting room . He followed her to the doorway , eying her with bright monkey-malice . Impossible to hurt Linton with anger . He was so unscrupulous and preposterous that anger bounced back into your own face , hand-ball style . " What , if anything , have you done about Clif 's girl , Miss Sidney Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen her ? Talked with her ? Look , who found the name and address for you ? " Miss Sexton , the nurse , put an end to his pestering . Anice presented Linton , a friend of Mr. McReal 's . " If you think it safe , " Anice added , hopefully . " Mr. Webber is recovering from virus pneumonia , he thinks he may reek of germs , he 's off to Miami for sun-cure . " Miss Sexton issued no interdict . Linton went down the hall capering beside the nurse , babbling that no one could expect Clif to hurry up his recovery when he had a nurse like that as long as he stayed at the hospital . His prattle , or her own anger , left a tinny taste in Anice 's throat . She packed up the attache case and hid in the women 's room . She would n't let Linton see her again , she would n't satisfy his curiosity about Miss Sidney Miller . Not that she had any satisfaction to offer him . She had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy to answer . Later Anice went , cat-footed , to Clif 's door . Not a sound from behind the screen . She strolled in . " Has Linton gone ? " Clif , back in bed after an hour in the big chair , looked at her morosely . " Where on earth were you ? " he asked . " Lin tried to find you . " " If I must explain , I was in the so-delicately called powder room . I knew you and Linton would enjoy a few moments alone . " " I do n't enjoy a few moments alone with anybody , and I 've said so . Lin 's like a buzz-saw or a gadfly . " " Your faithful oldest friend ? " " Oh , God , Anice ! You know I ca n't take it , hearing people chatter and gabble ! The least you can do is stick around and do the talking for me . Do n't let anybody else in . I  --  I 'm not up to it . "  | " Well , Linton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . You have to see people sometime . " " Not yet . Give me time . " " What about Lorimer ? He 's coming in Monday unless it snows or rains or Marian is worse . If you do n't see him without me as bodyguard Marian will be sure I am trying to conceal something about your state . " " Perhaps I 'll feel tougher by Monday . " On Monday Lorimer Blair appeared . He had an effect of suddenly arrested speed as he looked at Clif , at Anice , at the room , his pointed beard oscillating with his quick speech , his hands making uncertain motions with their load of book-stuffed briefcase , large manila envelope , hat , driving gloves , bumpy paper bag . " You look very well , Father McReal , " he said . " I ca n't stay long , I 've wasted at least a half hour finding a place to park , and now the probability is that I shall find a ticket on my car . It protrudes several inches beyond the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must remove my coat or I 'll run the risk of catching cold when I go out . " " Try the floor , " said Clif . " Here . " Anice opened the door of the small closet . Clif 's suit , his coat , limp , lank , unused , his shoes neatly disposed beside the traveling bag , had less pathos than the first days . " A home away from home . " She found a hanger for Lorimer . He hung away his coat , looked doubtfully at his overshoes and decided against removing them . He left the briefcase against the door and approached the armchair where Clif sat . " I hope you do n't fear the Greeks bearing gifts , " he said . " Marian sent this , with her love . She 's taken up knitting , she finds reading in a prone position results in eye-  | strain . " He extracted from the manila envelope a long , narrow strip of black with scallops of red at each end . " A muffler . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never have worn a muffler , and now , for your journey home , to protect your throat , she has made this . " Lorimer stroked the black strip . " This end is more skillfully knitted , on the whole a remarkable achievement for the first attempt . " Anice had started for the door , but Clif flapped the scarf in a parabola of entreaty . " Very thoughtful of Marian , " said Anice , pushing herself upwards to sit on the foot of the high bed . Lorimer was pretty bad this morning . The unfamiliar setting overworked whatever gland stimulated his vocabulary in an attempt to establish his personality . His British accent was slipping , too . " Next thing is to get Clif to wear it . " " After this experience , surely , you will be more careful . " Lorimer set the bumpy bag on top of the scarf . " A little citrus fruit , vitamin C , you know . A friend of mine , perhaps you 've heard of him , Montgomery Christian , a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I should buy a basket and arrange the fruit , but I explained that would be a nuisance to you when you prepared to leave the hospital . " " Yes , " agreed Clif . " Trouble enough just getting myself ready to move . " He shifted a knee , the bag tumbled to the floor , grapefruit and oranges rolling away . " Stupid of me . " Clif 's eyes met Anice 's , and she smiled at him over Lorimer 's scramble to collect the fruit . At least Lorimer had amused Clif . Lorimer placed the bag , filled again , firmly in the middle of the bed . The dome of his forehead looked larger , flushed from his stooping , his light blue eyes peered suspiciously through the spectacles .  | " I 'll ask the nurse to put them on ice , " said Anice . " Do sit down , Lorimer . " He carried the one straight chair around the foot of the bed , placed it halfway between the bed and Gill 's chair , and seated himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marian is deeply sorry that we can not ask you to come to us for your convalescence . Her doctor forbids her to attempt to have any guests , even her father . We thought ? " ( Anice could hear the marital dialogue , Marian in bed as per order , no doubt making quite a hummock under the blankets by this time , and Lorimer walking back and forth with appropriate gestures ) ? " that the apartment in town is a wretched place to recuperate , especially with Anice gone all day . Other things being equal , no , not equal , say more favorable , Princeton and our little house set in country quiet , our library at your service , a devoted daughter ? you get the picture ? But unfortunately the demands of what I might call the avant-garde , the new generation , make it impossible . " " A wonderful plan , if you could carry it out , " said Anice . Oh , Lord , it would be perfect , setting her free for work , for that trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a bad place , you know , and Kathleen longs only to serve her lord and master . " " There speaks the typical city dweller , the modern man , woman in this case . He has lost contact with the sources of life , he grows more artificial , mechanical , robotistic day after day . When he suffers injury , illness , he has no vitality , no power of recuperation . Sometimes an ancient racial wisdom informs him , and he returns to the earth for its healing . Like Hercules , unless he has that contact he loses his power . I speak of this in an article in a recent Review , I have a copy with me , I 'll leave it for  | you , Father . But to come back , Marian wishes to know if you have made any plans ? Certainly you ca n't , in spite of this Irish maid , just sit around in a New York apartment . " Anice stretched her arms behind her , bracing herself on her hands , thrusting forward her firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant and provocative . Lorimer looked hastily away from her . She swung her feet , clipping the wooden heels against the metal of the bed . She got it all right , the picture Lorimer drew , all the high color splashed on by Marian . " Poor Father , it 's simply terrible . " Anice could supply the very words ! " That woman is so completely selfish she will neglect him just when he needs tenderness and care . Everyone knows how important post-operative care is . " Clif was staring at her , his face expressionless . " Have you made any plans ? " insisted Lorimer . " Nothing beyond the trip back to that bed when I ca n't stand sitting in this chair another moment . " " Look here , Lorimer Blair ! " Anice dropped her voice into a diapason of controlled anger . " You forget what Clif has been through . What I 've been through . When a ton of brick falls on you you do n't plan any future beyond crawling out if you can ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's welfare . We 'll figure it out without your assistance . " Lorimer blinked at her , his beard thrust out at an angle . " Your implication that I 'm interfering suggests that you forget that Marian is Clif 's only child and that she is ? " " Simply devoted to her father . " Anice 's hint of mimicry was strong enough to put a flare in Lorimer 's nostrils . " But we 're tiring Clif , he 's not up to family rows . Come along , we 'll have the next round down the hall ! " She slid  | to her feet , pulled Lorimer 's coat from the hanger and flung it at him . " Do n't forget your bag of books . " " It 's only that Marian ca n't get in herself ? " Lorimer was still talking as Anice walked him briskly out of the room . " She feels that her father is too considerate ? " " And I 'm not . Exactly . Oh , never mind , Lorimer . You 've spoken your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to do when it 's time to do anything . " Lorimer set down his briefcase and wriggled into his overcoat . He wound a scarf about his throat , dug gloves from a pocket . Then he bent to unstrap the briefcase . " I almost forgot my article . Perhaps you could read it aloud to Clif . His mind seems quite clear . " He handed Anice the small white magazine , the one word , letters , out of plumb and off center . " I 'm in no hurry , but I 'd like it back for my files . I might add that I understand better , perhaps , than Marian , that your position in the publishing world is a demanding one . Marian is very feminine , she stresses the personal . " Anice smiled , ruffling the pages of the magazine . The conflict in the little man heaved very near the surface . Caution , wariness against the wiles of " that woman , " almost a sign of the cross to exorcise evil ; that was Marian 's indoctrination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hem of the publishing world . One of these days Anice was willing to wager he would extract from that very briefcase the manuscript of a book , a little collection of his critical papers . He might try a novel , all these critics did , something out of Proust by Joyce and Eliot , a conflict of ideologies . Almost worth encouraging him to watch the limb that would put Marian out on ! The pointer over the elevator door swung to 4 . " You were good to take the time to call on Clif , " said Anice . " We should have a chat someday , you and I.  | We 've never really had a chance . " ( Quick , try a dash of star-dust . ) " I 've been wondering whether you would , occasionally , look over a manuscript for us , belles-lettres rather than fiction . So few critics can evaluate ? " The elevator door slid open , Lorimer having rung for the car could n't ignore it . He went in sideways , saying hastily , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I  --  of course I 'm extremely busy ? " Anice strolled along toward Clif 's room , flexing her wrists gently in ironic benison . That would fix Lorimer . When Marian heard of it she would n't allow her husband to expose himself , unshielded by her , to such temptation . Before Marian was again in circulation Clif would be at home and Anice would be in England . Just when was that baby due ? Late March ? April ? Plenty of margin . Hard to imagine Lorimer as a lover . Had the Kinsey report included the modern dilettante intellectual among men studied ? The conception must have been polysyllabic and prophylactic . Would Clif be amused if she told him her outrageous thought ? Probably not . Enough that with it she had eased away the resentment at Marian 's impertinence . Clif was stretched out on top of his bed , a blanket over his feet , and the nurse stood at the head , cranking it flat . " How about a nice eggnog ? Or orange juice ? " Miss Sexton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I .. orimer had brought . Clif gave a long sigh as relaxation moved like a wave over his body , even untying the tension of his face . " Make mine Bourbon on rocks , " he said . " We 're fresh out of Bourbon . Now no more visitors for you today . Except your wife . " " That 's no visitor , " said Clif , lazily . " That 's my wife . "  | Miss Sexton giggled , gave the blanket a smoothing pat , gave Anice a tolerant nod , and left with the oranges . " I did n't know that girl could laugh , " said Anice , seating herself . " Part of a nurse 's job , " said Clif . " Encourages the patient . What 'd you do to Lorimer ? " " Not a thing . " Anice turned the pages of the quarterly . " We parted the best of friends . He gave me this  --  repository of literary culture I think he 'd call it . With a piece of his . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it to you . He thinks your mind seems quite clear . " " He 's mistaken . " Clif 's words drifted out as if even his vocal cords had relaxed . " When I sit up everything runs down into my feet . I know all about enervation . " " I could n't pronounce most of it anyway . " Clif 's eyelids drooped , his breathing was faintly audible . Anice leaned back in her chair , lifting a warning finger as the nurse appeared with the glass of juice . Later he woke as effortlessly as he had slept . Anice , preparing to go , asked him to choose his visitors for the next day , one in the morning half hour , one in the afternoon . No one he cared to see . She urged him . All his friends were wearing out the telephone , calling for news . Men in his department , his secretary , graduate students , surely one or two of them would fill a half hour pleasantly , would help pull him out of this prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking fine , it 's a nice day , how long before you get out ? I can hear any one of them , sitting right there , fumbling around for a password when there just is n't any ! Glancing at a watch to see if they 've given time enough . Brightly , sprightly visiting the sick . No . And no . There 's no sailing of boats on a mudflat , Anni . My tide 's out . "  | " If you 'd just make a little effort ? " " No . " " I do n't mean just anyone , but a few of your special friends . There 's one , Kathleen says she telephones every day to inquire about you , she wo n't give her name . I thought you might know who that is . " Clif lifted his head . The forward angle made the lower part of his face massive with folds of flesh under chin and jaws . " What is this ? " he asked . " Did Kathleen make it up ? Or  --  did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not at home most of the time , you know . " She watched Clif 's head fall back , saw how his face kept a craggy look , not a hint of discomfiture . " I suppose it 's just one of your adoring students . " " Let them not see me now , " said Clif . A pinwheel of protest exploded in Anice , shooting off sparks too incoherent for words , he was better , he might let someone else take her place , why did he want her constantly on hand , what ? Before she could articulate a single spark , the nurse came in . " Have a nice catnap ? It 's too late now for orange juice , time to wash up for supper . Want me to do it ? " " I do not . If you 'll crank me up ? " Anice rose as Miss Sexton began to turn the crank . " I 'll run along . " She blew a finger-tip kiss at Clif . " Have a good night . " The pinwheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving only a charred stick of determination . She had to get hold of that girl , Miss Sidney Miller . She could n't recapture the full malice  | and resentment with which she had first made this plan . Somehow they had seared and fallen away like the sheath which a new leaf of Kathleen 's philodendron wore and then , unfolding , burst . Had she played the role of devoted wife so well that she must go on with it ? Not once had Clif asked , " What are you doing about your job ? " Not once had he said , " It 's good of you to stay with me . " He simply took it . Already the pressure upon her began to implicate the future , today in Lorimer 's remarks . She must pull things back to the even keel of reality . Where had the word keel popped from ? That sentence of Clif 's about the mudflat , and all the boats lopped over . But his tide was running in . As Bill Shakespeare said , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , Anice , did n't make a move nobody else would . If no letter had come in today 's mail , she might try a telegram . Kathleen had been crying . Her eyelids were puffy and blanched in the high color of her face , her voice had a throaty undertone as she asked about Mr. McReal and gave Anice the messages from the day . Mary Keston , Anice 's secretary , could n't come up tonight on account of her mother was sick , but she 'd come early tomorrow . She 'd telephone tonight at nine , something had come up . The inquiries about Clif had grown few , law of diminishing returns in any disaster . Some woman named Mills , Kathleen thought , would drop in about eight . Just leave word with the doorman if it was n't convenient . Well , maybe the name was Miller . " I 'll have dinner right away , " said Anice . " I wo n't stop to change . " " Yes 'm . " Kathleen trudged to the kitchen , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , thought Anice , as she swung along the hall , speeded by a mild elation .  | Played right into her hand , this call from Sidney Miller . Better to receive her with some formality in the living room , no informal boudoir charm . Could n't tell what line to take until she saw the girl . She slipped off the jacket of her black suit , washed , powdered , brushed her hair into dark luster . With her jacket on again , after a moment 's inspection in the mirror , she added earrings and a brooch at her throat of antique gold and topazes , a gift from Guy Senior in Brazil to celebrate the beginning of Guy Junior . Just a touch of elegance . The baked potato had a hard core , the chop was disgustingly raw , sand on the endive gritted between her teeth . When Kathleen replaced those ruins with a watery custard , Anice tossed down her napkin . " If you can bring me coffee which is neither raw nor burnt , I 'll drink it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kathleen threw her apron over her face and rushed for the kitchen , her sobbing much like the get-away noise of a locomotive . Reluctantly Anice followed her . Kathleen had dropped onto the stool at the kitchen table , head down on her arms on the newspaper spread to catch the orts from dinner preparation , a litter of eggshells , tomato sections , green stuff , half emptied milk bottles . No persuading her to clean up as she worked , she said she could n't get things all cooked and hot at one moment if she stopped for neatness en route . Now her heaving shoulders , her wriggling rear threatened to pull the whole mess to the floor . Anice gripped a shoulder , shook at it . " Kathleen , what is the trouble ? Is someone dead ? Will you stop this caterwauling ? " Kathleen snuffled against her arm . " I tried to get a good dinner , " she wailed . " You never have it so early ? you always take hours fixing yourself . "  | " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby . You 're not crying about the dinner . What 's the matter ? If someone is n't dead they ought to be , all this fuss ! " Kathleen grew stone-still , solid image of woe . Then she rolled her head a little , peering up at Anice . " I 'm sorry , " Anice said coolly , " if you have some bad news . " Kathleen pushed her body up , bracing it with elbows on the table , heedless of the damp litter . Her eyes sought Anice , helpless , very young , after all Anice was older , she had authority , she was again a surrogate , perhaps this time for a mother . " His wife 's died , " Kathleen said . " She passed away this morning . " " Whose wife ? " " Mr. Murphy 's . The super down the block . They called him up from the Rockland State Hospital . " " Oh . And why do you cry over that ? " Anice seated herself on a chair at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lose the girl right now , no time to find a new maid , train her well enough to leave Clif ? " Is n't it what you 've both been praying for ? " " Mother of God , I never prayed for it ! I tried never to give it a thought ! " Kathleen straightened her body , her reddened hands gripped over the table edge . " Thomas was that patient , that good . I wanted her dead . She was no use to herself or to him . When he told me , I was glad . Deep in here ? " she pounded a fist against her breast ? " I wished her dead . I murdered her . " " What nonsense ! " " Ah , how can you be telling ? A wish is a powerful thing . " " You 're luckier than most if you can bring things your way by wishing ! She died , that 's all . It 's what you wanted ,  | you 've got it , I do n't see what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered her , " repeated Kathleen , forlornly . " As if I 'd stuck a knife in her . How could I marry Thomas with this sin on me ? " " Did you tell your Thomas how you feel ? " Anice sat very still , nothing moving but her agile mind . This was the Irish for you , splitting a hair to make a scourge . She would never have admitted that she saw a way to hold Kathleen , for the present at least . " What did he say ? " " He said I was a fool . " Kathleen 's full breasts swelled in a great sigh , tears rolled from her swollen eyes . " He wanted me to go with him to get her . I could n't . I could see her rising up from her coffin , pointing a finger at me . " " I 'm inclined to agree with your Thomas . " For all it was to her interest , she could n't quite abandon the girl to this ridiculous misery . " You 're too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like witches and evil eyes and all that ! You 've just had a shock . You 've been strung up all this time being noble and good , and you ca n't stand this sudden end . " Kathleen shook her head , her full soft mouth drawn into a thin line of renunciation . " Wait a few days and you 'll get used to the new state of things . Perhaps you never really wanted to get married to Mr. Murphy , and this is your way of getting out of it . " Kathleen 's swollen eyelids opened wide at that , her mouth opened , too , in a shocked round " Oh ! " " Well , if I wanted a man and his wife died , I certainly would never hesitate to grab him , even if I 'd tried to put a hex on her ! " Anice laughed , and rising , patted the girl 's tense knuckles . Kathleen dropped her hands into her lap , twisting the apron over them .  | " He 's that mad with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . His brother 's got a big apple farm upstate , Thomas stayed here on account of his wife , he had to visit her once a week . Now he can go , he 's bought in with his brother . He 's taking her ? " Kathleen 's words rushed out now , a current of despair ? " his brother 's got a lot , he can bury her there and save quite a bit . Mis ' McReal , how could I marry him and ride in a train with her in the baggage car ? Orchards and hills and a lake , it 's like Galway , he says , and I could help with the fruit . Ach , if only I had never had the wicked wish ! When he told me , my black heart leaped like a fish in a net ! " " Ca n't you do a little penance and get forgiven ? " Anice saw a veil of dignity drop curiously over the girl 's blotched face , but she went on with bold lightness . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in woe like this . Your Thomas will get over being angry , everyone does . Tell him you ca n't come with him , after all you ca n't walk off and leave us when Mr. McReal is just coming home ! Think how he 'd feel to find you gone ! You could n't walk out tomorrow or the next day . That certainly would be some kind of sin , if not mortal . Now pull yourself together . I 've got this stranger coming to call , I 've had a hard day , I ca n't stand any more laments and melodrama . If you like , I 'll talk to Thomas Murphy . Just like a man to expect you to ride in his funeral procession . I do n't wonder you feel upset . " Kathleen got to her feet , stiff , bewildered , knocking the stool out of balance , grabbing at it . " Now you 've got it out of your system you 'll feel better . " Anice patted her arm , drew her hand hastily away and dabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel . " For heaven 's sake , clean up that awful mess ! " Kathleen nodded , and moved into her task with heavy  | automatism . At least she 's stopped her hysterics , thought Anice , walking briskly into the living room . She folded shut the French doors to the dining room . Kathleen might be too engrossed to eavesdrop but no use giving her a chance . Perhaps the girl would go hunt up a priest . Anice was n't sure whether you had to make an appointment in advance or not . She 'd really handled the outbreak very well . She might so easily have taken advantage of the girl 's overstrung remorse , said , " Of course if you feel that way you should not see the man again . " Kathleen should be grateful enough for all Anice had done for her to stay on until summer . She could go pick apples when they were ripe . Anice straightened a pile of magazines . Several new issues still wore the mailing jackets . She might take them to Clif tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for almost a fortnight . She rearranged yellow satin cushions on the ivory damask divan , shifted crystal trays on the low square table of bleached wood , pulled two chairs from their prim back-to-wall placing . A pleasant room , redone a few years back , planned to hold the effect of sunlight in tones of wood and fabrics . Clif had liked the old furnishing better ; he said this looked like a shop window . An exclusive decorator had done it for her at a great bargain , after she had persuaded the firm to take his book , color plates and all . The firm had lost money on the book , but Anice said it gave variety to their list . She had planned to have the room redone in the fall . Not by the same artist . He 'd lost his gratitude . Like all authors he thought they should have spent thousands in advertising so that he might have made a few hundreds . Oh , well ! One trouble with going modern was that you had to go it again so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain she did n't know what she wanted to do even about a color scheme . The telephone rang . The doorman , announcing Miss Miller . Yes , send her up . Kathleen rattled the French doors open . " Oh , " she said . " You 're there . " " I 'm here and I 'm going to stay here , " said Anice . " I wish you 'd keep out of sight . Look at that apron ! " Kathleen looked , not at the sodden apron but at Anice , her cheeks swelling in a fresh outburst of tears . Anice moved swiftly to close the doors . The girl 's figure made a bulky , slowly retreating silhouette through the shirred silk over the glass . Job had nothing on me , thought Anice , waiting for the sound of the elevator . After the bell sounded she waited another interval . Then she turned the doorknob so gently the tumblers made no click , and pulled the door open smartly . The young woman had her finger on the button for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She just let her hand drop and said , " I 'm Sidney Miller . " " Come in . " Anice stepped back . " just drop your coat anywhere . " " I have to get right back to the library , I 'm on duty this evening . " She followed Anice into the living room , a tall , thin girl with angular , abrupt movement in nondescript collegiate clothes , polo coat over a bright green turtle-neck sweater , scuffed loafers , her light-brown hair worn smooth and too long so that she lifted her ungloved hand to brush it away from her face . " I began to think my note had n't reached you , " said Anice , easily , seating herself on the divan , indicating with a gesture a seat at her side . " I was in the infirmary , " said Miss Miller without apology , sitting down on a chair at an angle from the divan ,  | the table an expanse between her and Anice . The chair was too low for her , she hitched forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was abrupt , like her movements . She gave not a single glance about the room , no curious appraisal of the setting . Her expression was that of youthful obduracy , whether against this summons from Anice or against circumstances in general Anice could n't as yet tell . Her eyes , gray-blue , well spaced , long-lashed , hinted at wariness . The rest of her face , pale , with bright lipstick on the mouth , seemed planed into secretiveness . " I did n't know Professor McReal had gone to the hospital till I got out . He 's my advisor . I hope he 's all right . " " Not exactly . " Anice looked grave . " He 's convalescing from a very serious operation . " " That 's too bad , " said the girl . " I mean , but he is getting along all right ? " ( Now is Sidney Murray  --  Miller  --  a good actress or just a cold fish ? ) " He 's reached the stage where he 's frightfully bored . " Anice leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " You know how men are ! " " I was glad to catch up on my sleep when they put me in the infirmary , " said Miss Miller . " You 're one of Mr. McReal 's graduate students , are n't you ? " ( And something more , suggested Anice 's suave tone . ) " He 's my advisor , like I said . I 'm working in contemporary literature , the department 's frightful about anything later than Beowulf , I have my exams all off but I have to have my thesis approved . Before I can get my M.A. " She shot out her hand , twisting her arm to sight the wristwatch . Then she looked at Anice , much as she might have looked at the Dean if he had summoned her . Certainly if this was a grand passion , thought Anice , it  | was all on Clif 's side , But Linton had been definite in his gossip . These modern females were a hardy lot . " He 's been so interested in your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rousing a little . You know , stirring the ashes to find the old spark . " ( Miss Miller blinked , apparently unmoved . ) " If you  --  or some of you  --  could find the time from your very busy programs to drop in on him ? " " At the hospital ? " Miss Miller stared , her red mouth arched in surprise . " Where else ? " " Did he say he 'd like to see  --  some of us ? " " He has n't exactly said so . " Anice was sure , now , that the girl was sparring , that her abruptness , her gaucherie covered fear . The girl shot out her hand again , and then jumped up . " I 'll try to make it , " she said . " If you 're sure it 's all right . I 've got to go now , I 'm overdue . " She bolted toward the door , and rocked to a halt , turning her head over her shoulder like a colt . " You 're Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Professor Mac tell you about my novel ? " She swung around fully , intensity suddenly fluid through her thin body . " He thinks it 's not bad , but the department could n't see it for a thesis . Some places they will , but I had all my course work here , I could n't afford to start somewhere else . " Anice followed as far as the entrance to the living room and stood there , poised , gracious . The only trouble with her manner was that the girl 's eyes kept their indifference to whatever objects they encountered , being focused centrifugally on Sidney Miller . " Yes , I am Anice Lang , " said Anice . " So you 're a writer ! " " I have n't published anything yet . But I mean to . I  | have n't met many editors . " She laughed , a derisive little explosion . " I have n't met any if you want to know . Just seen them on platforms , you know . " She reached behind her body for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung there in the wedge of the door . " Well , it 's been nice to meet you . " She pivoted still clinging to the knob , the door her partner in a square dance of embarrassment , the rite of farewell too much for her . " Bye ! " she called , slamming the door . Professor Mac , how could you ? Anice stood unmoving , a queer sensation , an unfamiliar odor , creeping through some chink . That crude , provincial little chit ! Had Clif dared use her , Anice 's , position as bait ? " I 'll get my wife to look at your novel ! " Anice spread her hands slowly , a gesture of disposal . Then , before she had to admit the identity of the intensifying sensation , bells began to ring , doorbell , telephone , a confusing duet . Anice pulled open the door upon Miss Sidney Miller , her tall figure with bent head a question mark of embarrassment . " I 'm so sorry . I must have dropped my pocketbook , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Anice . " Shut the door . I 'll have to answer this . " She picked up the rocker arm , and heard Mary Keston 's nasal twang . " Miss Lang ? Oh , I 'm so glad to get hold of you ! Something 's come up , it really was n't my mistake . " " Of course not , " said Anice , motioning Miss Miller into the living room , leaning a shoulder against the wall . " Take it easy , Mary , or I ca n't hear you . " " It really was n't , I have the notation on the calendar , but you ca n't do a thing with Vera Verity 's secretary . She claims she said the fourteenth , you know , for Cressman 's broadcast , and she actually gave us the choice and  | I said the twenty-eighth because of Professor McReal , I thought you 'd be free by then , and now she has the twenty-eighth booked and she expects Cressman tomorrow and he wo n't go unless you go , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you possibly make it ? " " Why did you allow her to bluff you ? " Anice saw Miss Miller draw back the chair where she had sat , drop to her knees to peer under the table , make a pounce and come up , sliding her hand into a deep pocket . Had she really left a purse , or was this an excuse ? Mary was explaining , in detail , the argument she had put up and its futility . Anice turned , shutting out the intruder from her sight , if not from her awareness . " Do n't tell me any more , " she interrupted . " She got the best of you . It 's ten days before Cressman 's book comes out , too early to do any good . " " It might create a demand , " said Mary , miserably . " Bah ! How long is a radio listener 's memory ? What time do we have to show up at the studio ? " " Oh , Miss Lang ! Can you make it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Miss Miller , advancing on tiptoe toward the door . She waved a hand at her , gesturing her back . " What time ? " " Twelve o'clock . They go on the air at one . Studio K. " " Tell Cressman I 'll meet him there . Can he find his way or does he want me to come after him ? " Mary giggled nervously , and Anice held the instrument away from her ear . " That 's all for now , " she said . " I have a caller . I 'll expect you here about eight tomorrow , right ? " She set down the arm firmly ; the tremor in her hand had stopped . " You found your purse ? " She walked toward the girl . " That 's good . I do n't know how much you gathered from this talk ? "  | " I could n't help hearing part of it . " " Of course ! " Anice clasped her hands loosely , she was charming , confiding , taking this would-be author behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does her best , but I 've had to be away from the office so many days ! This broadcast was supposed to be the twenty-eighth . Now it 's tomorrow ! One of our new young authors , Henry Cressman . You have n't heard of him , but you will ! A book club choice , oh , he 's going to go far ! His first book , too . ( Think what may come your way ! ) And I simply must go with him . " " What time is it , Mrs. Mc  --  or should I call you Miss Lang ? I mean  --  I 'd sure like to listen to it . It would be wonderful , now I 've met you . " " But I was going to ask a great favor of you . " A little coin of color appeared under each cheekbone on Miss Miller 's face . " You see , I do n't like to leave my husband alone . I ca n't be in two places at once , can I ? You said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomorrow ? In the morning ? " The girl set her small pointed teeth into the full lower lip . Anice waited , a delicate compliance in her manner . Whatever the girl decided " Why , I guess I could . I could find somebody to take my place , I have from twelve to two at the library . " " Wonderful ! " Anice moved in quickly with directions about reaching the hospital , the address , the number of Professor Mac 's room written on a card . " Any time after eleven . You can even get your lunch at a cafeteria in the building . I did n't know about it at first , I had to walk miles in the snow to a dreadful drugstore . Then in the afternoon he has to rest anyway , and I 'll get there as soon as a cab can carry me once the ordeal is over . " " Then I ca n't hear you on the radio , can I ? "  | " You know how unimportant that is ! Was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could borrow a portable radio , I know a boy who has one . Would n't they let me plug it in ? " " Goodness , my husband would n't live through it ! " Just a touch of depreciatory mocking . Of course he 's the type that would simply loathe all the commercials ! But if you 're on ? " " Me ? " Anice 's monosyllable , the expression of her face conveyed nuances of tolerant self-belittling . " A husband tuning in on his wife ? Unless he had to ? Oh , no , Miss Miller , he 'd much rather tune in on you . Anyway , I may not say a word into the mike . I 'm not a V.I.P. I 'm just a publisher , there as a prop . A baby sitter ! " Anice established herself with radiant modesty . " In a way , that 's just what you 're doing for me , is n't it ? " Anice opened the door into the hall . " Only do n't tell my husband that ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be more flattered ? " Anice waved the girl through the doorway before the shocked earnestness of the young face found words . " I 've kept you away from your date ! Good-night , and thank you . " Anice snapped the night latch and went along the hall toward her room , swaying a little to a secret tune . She had fixed everything very neatly . Clif could n't complain that she had deserted him , he might be relieved if she did n't show up . Too bad that the girl had n't turned out to be a more formidable rival . The darling of the department , Linton had said . " All the old boys disguise their titillations as an interest in her brilliant future . " Anice had n't felt any titillation-making charm in the girl . Unless that intense and earnest innocence was in itself a challenge to the bored , slightly aging male . Anice wished she could talk with Linton . He would ask , " What exactly are you  | up to ? " She 'd tell him she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity for her job . But you planned this before you ever knew there was a broadcast , Linton would say . All right , Anice would tell him . " Clif 's suffered an attack of amnesia along with his illness . I 'm reminding him how things really are . " Anice shut herself into her bedroom . Why not call Linton , he 'd given her the number of his Miami hotel . " Do n't hesitate to call if you need me , if Clif needs me . " He would enjoy an account of her interview , with what he would call its intimations of immorality . She 'd like to play over the record , no one else would listen as well as Linton . She could hear herself giving the number , hear operator calling the string of exchanges , moving on Miami faster than any airplane , hear Linton 's excited crackle . Do n't be absurd , she told herself , walking briskly , the wicked tune of complacency silent now , into the bathroom to start water running into the tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns of the wheel . Quite an evening . Late the next afternoon , later by several hours than she had intended , Anice came to the opened door of Clif 's room and stared , with shock setting a harsh heel on all the gay explanations she had hatched . The room was deserted , empty , the screen folded back , the fresh linen on the bed unwrinkled , not even a glass of water on the high table beside the bed . The window was raised , admitting the bleak dank chill of February air , air which even here  | above the city streets had the odor of sterility , the ferment of the decaying season being frozen , the ferment of spring not yet at work . Anice had an instant of purely superstitious horror , as if with her too clever scheming she had dislodged Clil , had driven him away . Then through the opened bathroom door she saw on the shelf under the cabinet the brown leather toilet case , gaping open , and beside it the tortoise shell reading glasses . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk said oh , no , they had n't kidnaped Mr. McReal . They 'd taken him down for X-rays . Anice 's quick , irritated inquiry brought an orderly from the inner office . No , nothing wrong , Mrs. McReal . Routine procedure , final checkup before we let him go . He disappeared into the inner room , the attendant was murmuring assurance about a new patient into the telephone , there was no one to hear how startled , how really frightened Anice had been . One more thing in a trying day . Anice could n't sit down in the waiting room , she felt exactly like a marionette with frayed strings , likely to come apart at every joint . She walked slowly the length of the corridor . The rooms were quiet , visiting hours over , only a murmur now and then where one of the faithful who practically lived at the hospital still lingered . Near the end of the hall a door usually shut stood partly open , and Anice had a glimpse of the occupants . She had seen within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light catching the ashen tonsure with its rim of weak grayish hair ; beside the bed , as motionless as the man , an elderly woman , crouching forward , her brooding , lined face , her bent shoulders imbued with an infinitely tender patience . Anice took a long step beyond the room . They ought to keep the door shut on spectacles like that . The quality of the woman 's vigil  | ached in her breast , a physical pain . To escape it , she turned deliberately to a review of the day . Waste motion , most of it . Henry Cressman needed her only for his vanity , escort of honor . Vera Verity put on a good show , playing up to her studio audience , a throng of suburban housewives entering like a flash flood , tickets in hands , when the doors opened , excited and adoring . Cressman had sulked under his dark brows when he found he was n't the solo star , but he 'd made the most of his youth as against the extreme age of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose memoirs , ghosted , of course , had been published today . Cressman had lost his temper when V.V. asked him why young then always wrote such gloomy books , but her assistant ( he 'd put on weight since Anice first met him ) had interrupted with an inquiry about a product V.V. was forgetting , and they very cleverly did n't give Cressman another chance at the air . Then coffee in the crowded lunchroom where all the studio people ate , and a placating trip to the office with Cressman . She 'd left him autographing a pile of books , soothed into semi-good-humor by the long list of advance requests for signed copies . One thing she knew . She was n't going to play wet-nurse to , Henry Cressman or any other author on any future radio hour . Sitting in frozen silence ( if you sneezed you shattered an air wave ! ) for two hours , no , the first hour you could sneeze , practically incognito , suffering the coyly factitious enthusiasm of the commercials . Just to insert the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunny ears , a million ? As from now , Ben Purdy could take over , it was publicity work . If ever they asked the editor to introduce the author , that would be different . But to the eye watching the inexorable studio clock stroking off the priceless seconds an editor had no money value . Any-  | way , the whole notion of this kind of book pushing was a sorry misalliance , noodle soup and cleaning fluid wed to literature . The offspring of that match was n't book sales ! Anice paced the length of the corridor and back more briskly , animated by scorn , planning a memorandum for Ben Purdy which she would dictate to Mary Keston in the evening . As she turned at the far end of the hall she saw the elevator door slide back and Clif , erect in a wheelchair , roll out , Miss Sexton 's capped head sighting over his shoulder . Anice , starting swiftly toward him , heard his firm , " Now wait a minute ! " He disentangled his feet from the blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slowly stood upright . Miss Sexton whisked the chair aside , wadded the blanket into the seat , and followed his deliberate progress . " Cliff " Anice had reached him . " How wonderful ! " She thrust a hand under his elbow , but he brushed it away . " I do n't need any help , " he said , scarcely a flicker of recognition in his intent face . He speeded up as he neared his door , like a child learning to walk , running before the pull of the earth could defeat this new accomplishment . " I made it ! " He grasped the back of the big chair at the window , breathing heavily , and then got himself around and down safely into its support . " And that 's enough for today . " The nurse brushed past Anice to tuck the rug over Clif 's knees . She pushed down the window , took a look at the thermostat , brought a glass of water , and as he drank , lifted his other wrist , fingers against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad at all , " she said . " It wo n't be long now . " She took the glass , inventoried the room , found nothing called for , and left . " What wo n't be long ? " Anice leaned against the window sill , one hand on his knee , the wool blanket pricking  | her palm . The hollows of his temples and the upper lip glistened . Clif drew a long , puffing breath and mopped at his face with a folded handkerchief . " Seems warm here , " he said . " Every time I walk a few steps I begin to sweat . " " Because you 're still weak . You 've been in bed for clays ! " " You 're telling nie ? " " Clif , what wo n't be long ? What did the nurse mean ? " " Till I can go home ! " He flung a hand over Anice 's , gripping her fingers . " Out of this cell and home ! Provided ? " his grip loosened ? " the damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . The doctor said it was just routine checkup . " " Did you see him , Dr. Priest ? " " No . One of the interns . " " I thought it was queer . He 's never here afternoons . Ile wants to see you before I leave . Postnatal care . " Clif leaned well back in the chair , looking up at Anice with enigmatic gravity under fatigue-thickened lids . " I said he could give me the orders , but he did n't think that was good enough . " " Of course I want to talk with him . I 'll get here very early . Tomorrow ? Will they let you out tomorrow ? " " Perhaps . They want to get rid of me , they need the room . " " Clif , I hope you did n't imply ? " Anice twisted a bit of blanket between thumb and finger ? " that I would n't want to talk with Dr. Priest . He does n't approve of me anyway , he likes his women meek and worshipful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clif did n't smile . He even turned his head slightly , letting his eyelids droop . " I did n't imply anything , " he said .  | " I said I 'd tell you . I hoped you 'd come . If you did n't have another engagement . I did n't say that . " " You 're cross because I was late today ! Clif darling , I had to see to that awful broadcast . It was our new author and a book club selection . I came the instant I could . " " I 've been quite a nuisance , have n't I ? Just a day or so more . Somebody has to bail me out , I do n't think they 'd let me go by myself . " " Do n't talk such nonsense ! " ( All the long hours she had spent here forgotten , ignored ! ) " You know I want to be here . Of course I 'll come at crack of dawn . It 's wonderful , darling . Seeing you walk ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her then , something dark , unreadable , oh , surely not derisive , in his eyes . " Oh , I 'm tall , " he said . " Not so wide right now . Anice , what was the hellish idea , sending that girl in your place ? " Anice leaned hard against the window jamb . She tried to say what girl and could n't . " I did n't send her , " she said . " She asked about you , she apparently wished to see you . I thought it might be  --  diverting . " " Whatever you thought , it was n't that . The poor kid all but died of embarrassment , catching a prof with his pants not down but off ! " " You are getting better , are n't you ? " Anice jumped to her feet with a sharp stamp of heels , a guilty rage humming in her ears . " There 's a pat and ribald answer to that remark , if you want it ! " " I do n't . " Clif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling as if a worm of angry distrust crawled out of his mind . Then he sagged in the chair , his head drooping back , eyes shut . " Clif ! " Anice felt guilt muffle the protecting hum of rage . This might be pretense , this weariness , this weak .  | ness . No , Clif would n't malinger . He might cling to weakness as convenient armor , anyway he had her on the hip . Had she thought to strike out at a man already stricken ? " Clif darling , I 'm sorry . You looked so natural walking around  --  I tried to be funny . " She lifted his hand , warming the cold fingers between her palms . " Open your eyes , Clif , you look so sunk ! " He did , but his hand kept its unresponsive limpness . " Just do n't move out on me quite yet , " he said slowly . And do n't rake up any more young substitutes . I 'm not up to playing games . " " I knew this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts made a whirlpool , the vortex her need to justify herself . Everyone knew about Clif and Sidney Miller , everyone was talking about it , he 'd made a conspicuous fool of himself , why could n't he admit it , why pretend he had n't longed to see her ? And there he slumped , cocooned in his lethargy of weakness , swaddled in indifference . " I 'm sorry if she tired you . You have to begin to pick up threads someday . " Not today I do n't . " Clif drew his hand out of her clasp and pulled the blanket up a hitch or two . " Punch the button for the nurse , will you ? I 'm cold , I want to get into bed . " " I 'll find her . " Anice moved slowly to the door , unwilling to go without some final phrase , not of justification now , but of natural farewell , a phrase to restore her to the role she had played for him at his implicit behest , a role from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , Clif dear , it 's because you 've done so much ! X-rays and walking ! I 'll be here early in the morning so I wo n't miss Dr. Priest , I 'll find out when you can come home . "  | Clif thrust his head forward , staring at her . " I thought you 'd forgotten , " he said . " Foolish ! " Anice dropped her voice to a tone of gay chiding . " I 'm going home to tell Kathleen . She 'll set all the bells ringing . Oh , I have a good story about her and her follower . I 'll save it for morning . They ought not to let you overdo like this ! " For once Anice heard with relief the faint announcing rustle of the nurse . " Good ! " She was gentle and solicitous . " I was just going to look you up ! Among us we 've quite worn down my husband . Have a good night , Clif dear . " The door beyond Clif 's was closed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mute and enduring ordeal , protecting the passer-by from grief which surely was not his to share . Why , if you allowed yourself to tune in on all the misery you could find , you would destroy yourself . You have to be sensible . Anice shrugged . So the ether was full of trouble . Dial your own station , cut out the rest , it was n't your business anyway . Riding homeward Anice fidgeted with fragments of thoughts , bits of broken glass , dangerous to handle , likely to draw blood , making no pattern . All right , Clif had n't wanted to see the girl . Anice had n't set him back on his heels with a reminder of the real state of affairs . Perhaps serious illness was a purgative , leaving no minor guilts . He might at least have offered her , Anice , a benign cliche , something like " At last I realize what you mean to mc . " Good curtain line for a bad play . But had he ? Nol He had ,  | instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste if nothing worse . He had somehow managed to turn things inside out , upside down , projecting upon her the feeling she had intended for him . Not maliciously , just ? just what ? What was happening to her ? That final struggle to reinstate herself with Clif , fear a sharp spur in her heart . How ridiculous to have that feeling about Clif The cab swung around a corner , jolting her . She regained her balance , sweeping away the splintered thoughts . Thank God , the siege was alrnost ended . No , not a siege , an amnesty . She 'd go out of her mind if she had to keep up this pace much longer . And no one any-11 where understood in the least what she 'd been through or appreciated what she 'd done . She could feel pretty sorry for herself if she let herself go . Instead she had to 1 wind herself up for an evening of stiff work . Even Mary Keston would probably expect to get away early because somebody at home needed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused a moment before she turned it . Out of the past , shaking off any sign of age or weariness or illness , moving clown the hall toward her with quick eagerness , walked the image of Clif . He put a thumb under her chin to lift her face , he looked at her with hard , searching energy ( You ! What 's happened to you all these hours away ? ) before he kissed her . She twisted the key with a wrench of her wrist . Good Lord , what years since he had waited for her to come , had even wondered how she fared ! Then as she stepped into the hall , drawing the door smartly shut behind her , someone rose , a man , blurred against the window in the dark living room , and Anice made a queer sound in her throat . " Hello , Mom . Sorry , did I scare you ? " Guy turned on a floor lamp and came toward her . " What are you doing ,  | sitting in the dark ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got yourself here . Or maybe I did fall asleep . How 's tricks ? " He rubbed his cheek against hers . " Oh , this is nice ! " Anice clasped her hands behind his head and hung herself there for a moment , laughing in delight . " I was n't sure I could make it till the last second . Holiday tomorrow , and I cadged two more days . One of the fellows was driving down . " " Just when I dreaded coming in to this empty place ! " " There is a Celtic twilight about it , at least in the kitchen end . Kathy would n't let me in the kitchen . " " Is she still that way ? " Anice went quickly through the dining room . " I 'm home , " she announced , pushing open the door . Kathleen , busy at the stove , did not turn . " Is n't it fine that Guy came ? " In an undertone , " Please do n't spoil the boy 's holiday by glooming around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathleen . Mr. McReal is coming home any day now ! " Kathleen dropped a pot lid , dove for it as it clattered to the floor , and Anice shut the door quickly . " Good enough , " said Guy . " I can help convoy ole Clif back down here . " He jerked out his hand absently for the coat Anice slid off her shoulders . " He had me worried . I tried to call him or you when I got in . Thought he 'd have a phone by now unless he was n't doing so good . " " He just would n't . I thought it would be good for him to talk to people . Amuse him . Who was it , the White Queen or Queen Victoria , We are not amused ' ? That 's Clif . He 's  --  difficult . " " Short of breath , just half a lung . " " Marian wanted to talk with him , she 's threatened to come in no matter what the doctor ordered . Men at the University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . I have n't been able to reach him without trekking way out there . It would have been easier ? " Anice dug in her heels before she slid farther down the inclined plaint . " I just think any invalid has to make an effort to come back , do n't you ? " Guy disappeared into the hall closet to hang away Anice 's coat . " The telephone as therapy , " he said , backing out . " Just because you wear ' em sprouting out of your ears all day ? " As he turned , his grin drew out the sting from his words . " I might run out this evening . Would Calif like to see me , d' you think ? " ( Oh , not tonight , with Clif in that queer , critical mood , with Guy so  --  well , call it emotional . ) Anice hesitated , careful not to sound off with authority . She spoke of the X-rays , of Clif 's trying his feet for the first time , of his fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " The nurse was putting him to bed for the night when I left . " " Okey . How about a show , then , you and me ? " " Darling , if only I could ! I did n't know you were coming . " Anice explained , she heard herself too voluble , why need she sound apologetic ? Work piling up all these days , secretary not turning up when due , she could n't reach the girl even if she could postpone the letters , surely Guy must realize she 'd like nothing better than a gay evening with him . " Ca n't you find someone to go with you ? With the therapeutic telephone ? " At least she drew a laugh with that . " All my good numbers are in Boston . Have to wait till night rates go on . " " Are there good numbers in Boston ? " Anice started slowly toward her room . " Ground-grippers and spectacles ? " " You 'd be surprised . "  | " Sometime you must tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy lazily . " Any time you have a mo-ment to spare . " Anice wheeled at that . " I told you I was sorry ! If you think ? " Guy flung up his hands in a ridiculous pantomime of defense , with a quick , " Hi , Mom ! Take it easy ! I do n't think a thing except I 'm starved . " No use to argue as to his implications . Anice jerked herself into swift recovery . " I 'm hungry , too ! " she an nounced . " I wo n't be long . " Dinner moved smoothly enough . Kathleen could keel , her disordered mind on cooking for Guy when site could n't for Anice alone . She moved about the table with correct impersonality , her face grim , cheekbones and nose shiny , tear-burnished . Anice knew that Guy inspected the girl , but for once he made no facetious remarks . In stead he listened with apparent appreciation to Anice 's account of the visit Lorimer Blair had paid to the hospital , muffler , oranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might call them up for me this evening , if you have time , " said Anice . " Tell them Clif will be home soon , ask how Marian is . One less chore for me to see to . " " Sure . Anybody else ? " " Call up a ticket agency . What show do you want to see ? I 'll stake you to it . You must n't spend a dull evening just because I 'm a slave . " " Do n't bother about me . " " But you could easily get one ticket ? " " Stop pushing me , Mom . " Again the quick upcurve of Guy 's wide mouth made his words bland . " I 'm full of plans . " " As you like . " If he hung around the apartment Kathleen would probably unburden her elegy for him . What  | of it ? Anice had done all she could for the girl , had n't she ? " I have some notes I 'd like to get together , " Guy was saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would n't bother you , would it , if I shut the door ? " " No . If you want to waste a good evening that way . " Mary Keston came as Kathleen served the dessert , huge slices of chocolate roll with whipped cream . Guy opened the door for Mary , and stepped back as she began a flustered apology . She was too early , she 'd wait in the lobby , she did n't know Miss Lang had a guest . " For heaven 's sake , Mary , come in ! Do n't you remember my son , Guy Harrison ? " Anice rose , throwing down her napkin . " I could n't eat that cake anyway , add an inch to my waistline . I 'll have coffee in my room , Kathleen . " Mary , sniffling audibly from excitement and sudden warmth in her chilled nostrils , followed Anice , saying with a superfluous and nervous laugh , " He must have grown , it 's been several years , or maybe it was my glasses , the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a social secretary , thought Anice , for all your competence . ) " Take off your things , Mary , and stop imitating a porpoise ! " ( If she made her tone warm enough Mary took any insult as a delightful sign of intimacy . ) " One more day without you and I 'd have lost my mind ! " Mary was sorry . The neighbor who kept an eye on her mother while Mary was in the office could n't stay in the evening , but her mother was a little better . Anice half listened , her hand on the doorknob , reluctant to shut off hints of Guy 's activity . She needed him for an ally in the vague difficulties she foresaw . Perhaps she only imagined a hovering criticism in his attitude . If she left the door ajar he might suspect her of keeping an ear to the wind .  | She closed it . Mary had draped her coat over a chair and stood waiting , the contents of the large folder in her hands . Anice let down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary was at ease now , displaying her neat arrangements . These letters , duplicates , routine matters , she had mailed . These Miss Lang might check through and sign . These ? " If you give these the once over and dictate a line or so ? " Anice settled to work , Mary beside her , pencil alert over the notebook . Like the little figures in a Swiss gadget to tell the weather the way the editor popped out , wifeand-mother darted out of sight . An hour or more later Anice leaned back in her chair , tortoise- and gold-rimmed spectacles hung over a forefinger . " Good girl , " she said . " You did a nice job on that stuff . Now tell Ben Purdy to get that blurb on the Weymouth book ready for me by Tuesday , and make the appointment with Weymouth and his agent for that morning . Tell Winston he 's crazy thinking of offering an advance to his Atlanta find on ten pages and a title ! No , do n't tell him , I will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does ? " Anice watched Mary 's hands arrange the papers , blunt fingered , nails wide and square , knuckles reddish , wrist bones chapped , the movements awkward but still quickly functional . " You ought to put something on your hands , " she said , and Mary scrambled together the last of the papers , standing away from the desk light to cram them into the holder . " You never think about yourself , do you ? " " I know they 're a sight , Miss Lang . In the winter they always ? " " Never mind . I do n't know what I 'd do without them ! "  | Anice reached for her purse . " Did I give you enough taxi fare the last time ? How far is Brooklyn , anyway ? " " I did n't use it , Miss Lang . I  --  it would be an awful lot . I thought the subway would be quicker . " " That 's no way to handle your expense account ! " Anice tucked a bill under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on the firm , they all do it . This should be our last evening performance . Oh , Mary , tell me I 'm a fool to be so excited at the idea of getting back to work ! " " That 's because you 're a born editor , " said Mary , devoutly . She thrust her arms into her dark coat and pulled a gray knitted cap over her hair . ( Just like a tea cozy , thought Anice . ) " It 's wonderful the way you put your mind on our work when you must be worn out with anxiety . " " It lets me breathe again ! " Anice opened the door . " Do n't say a word about my coming back , " she said in a gay , quick undertone . " Let 's see what they 're up to ! Tomorrow 's a holiday , then Saturday , Sunday . By Monday afternoon ! " The door of Clif 's study stood shut , with no tapping of typewriter behind it . Where was Guy ? Anice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the letters until Monday . You 've earned a holiday . " " I wo n't say a word . " Mary hugged the manila folder , warmed by the hint of conspiracy . " I 've tried to keep an eye on things . " Her voice grew strident and loud , as always when she was pleased . " Mr. Purdy was trying to find out if we 'd made plane reservations for your trip to England . As a family man , he says , he 's got to know before the last minute if he 's to go in your place . " Anice jerked open the outer door , but before she could shove Mary into the vestibule the girl 's zeal carried her along , even more loudly . " I just told him this trip was  | yours , the idea , the plans , everything , and he could stop counting chickens that would n't hatch . " Anice laid a finger on her lips , a warning and at the same time a barrier against the rebuke that would so shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , her head safely outside the shielding door . " But by April ! Do n't say a word to Purdy . Let him dream . " Oh , damn the girl , blurting everything out like that ! Anice drew the door carefully shut . With luck , Guy had n't heard . What 's happening to me that I should care if he had heard ? Of course Mary could n't imagine that I might have to scheme and jockey for anything , much less this trip . She knew how Mary saw her , fearless , direct , undeterable . She was n't afraid . The misgiving that twittered secretly was just nerve exhaustion after all she 'd been through . And sometimes a devious path took you around a road-block . She meant to say nothing about going to England until the last minute , just as she boarded the plane , too late for anyone to pile up reasons against her going . And no suggestion that Ben Purdy could serve as well . If Guy had overheard she 'd refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business . She 'd find out at once . Her knock at Clif 's study door had no answer . Signs of Guy within the room , a notebook propped open , an unfinished sheet in the typewriter . Unlike Guy to leave any disorder . Even as a little boy he had picked up his toys and put away the books he was reading and hung up his clothes to a degree of secretiveness , as if he feared the objects he had used might offer clues to the private life he protected so fiercely from everyone and , admit it , especially from her , his mother . Not that I ever interfered , thought Anice , biting down on an old resentment . Or demanded anything in return  | Anice looked across at the notebook . No , the pages would reveal nothing of Guy to her . The symbols and formulas and strange scientific vocabulary made her feel uncomfortably ignorant . Even the orbit where the boy 's mind moved excluded her . The only information the room could give her was that Guy had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summons . She glanced then at the day bed along one wall , and went quickly to lift the green cover . Yes , Kathleen had made it up with fresh linen . Would Clif be comfortable enough , or should she offer him the wide marriage bed in her own room ? All his belongings were here , in the closet , in the little adjoining bathroom . She 'd make the suggestion , and then Guy could n't look at her with that shade of criticism held just under the surface . Anice went on to her own empty room , treading softly not to disturb the appalling uncertainty which threatened to rise up with a shout . Clif would come home , he was getting well , in a little while he 'd be back at work , everything would be as it had been  --  would n't it ? Anice stood at her desk , leafing through a manuscript Mary had left , a second revision . Dolores Worthingharn , who dashed off plots and puppets , steady circulating library sale and reprints with sexy jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Greenwich . Anice had spent hours with the author , hours that dragged even in hasty recollection . ' The author , with a mind as untidy as the pages of the script , listened with amiable effervescence , agreeing to each suggestion , and went off to tie up threads she had overlooked and to cut out episodes she could use in the next book . Phrases leaped up from the pages , familiar and meaningless as a tune in the back of Anice 's head . She could n't read the stuff tonight , not even to give Guy an impression of the  | way she had to drive herself . She 'd shut her door and go to bed . Let him take it as a rebuke if he liked . But he would n't . Like most men , he was thin-skinned only around his ego . The little clock on the table beside the bed read eight when Anice woke . She had to pick it up before she was sure . Night still lingered , netted in the thick fog that filled all space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anice dressed hurriedly . She had to show up at the hospital in time to see the august Dr. Priest . Plain blouse , plain suit , no jewelry , no make-up except lipstick . Somewhat worn and anxious wife . Kathleen 's laughter rolled as she went quickly toward the dining room , Guy said something , the canary shrilled . Had n't taken the girl long to snap out of her tragedy , trust the Irish ! " Hi , Mom ! " Guy rose to pull back her chair and Kathleen made for the kitchen with a stride that stretched her blue skirt tight . " Have a good sleep ? I 've been up for twenty waffles . " " It 's so dark I did n't know morning had come . " Anice drank the orange juice . " Tell Kathleen I wo n't wait for waffles , " she said . " Just coffee and toast . " " You 'd break her heart for a calory , " said Guy . " Not I. " Anice broke off her sentence as Kathleen came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl served Anice with a sidewise roll of her blue eyes , a glance of apologetic triumph . As she withdrew , Anice said , " Thanks for hauling her out of the dumps , however you did it . "  | Guy reached for the silver coffeepot and filled his cup . " Tell you about that later . " " I was sorry not to wait for you last night , " went on Anice . " But I was too tired to talk . " " Oh , sure . I was glad you went to bed . " " Where did you go anyway ? " " I had a letter to mail . " " With the chute right outside the door ? Do n't they have those in Boston and you 've forgotten ? " " Had to be sure it went out last night . " " I just hoped you 'd thought up someone to have an evening with . " ( That was better than saying that he could n't have spent the evening walking the short block to the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , she 'd keep it to herself ! ) " Did you get hold of Lorimer before you went out ? " " I did . He was full of messages and obstetrics . I do n't know which one is pregnant , Marian or Lorimer , except that Marian could n't answer the phone . " " He 's showing you how bold and modern he is . " " No , he is n't showing off . He 's spellbound . He 's keeping a diary , blow by blow account . He 's planning a prose epic . Something entirely new for a Christmas booklet . You know , glory to the newborn king , queen , whatever , he hopes for twins . Would n't your firm be interested ? " " Guy ! You did n't suggest that ? " " No . But I bet he 's thought of it . " " No doubt . " Anice stood up , smiling at Guy . He 'd set out deliberately to divert her . He was nice , lounging there over his coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , with those humorous dark eyes and quiet , unsmiling face . " At least he has months more before his diary winds up . July or August . " " You know , there 's something rather touching about  | it . " Guy strolled along the hall after Anice . " Trying to make amends for being a mere male . " " Trying to horn in for literary copy , " said Anice , lightly . " What do you mean , mere male ? " " You know , that old notion , the man went to bed when the woman did ? What 'd they call it ? Couvade ! That 's it , Lorimer 's practicing a long intellectual couvade . " " Guy , darling , give me a raincheck , please ! We 've got to get to the hospital early . " " Just as I 'm warming up ? " The ringing of the telephone broke his drawl . " Answer it , please . Whoever it is , I 'm on my way . Hurry , get your coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms into the coat Guy held for her , gathered purse and gloves under an elbow . " Kathleen says what about lunch . " Guy had a hand on the doorknob , Kathleen waited at the entrance of the dining room . " Perhaps we 'll all be here , " said Anice . " I do n't know . I 'll have Guy call you the minute we find out about Mr. McReal . " Even at street level the fog hung yellow-gray between the buildings , blurring the ends of the block , enlarging shapes and sounds and odors , turning into a clattering monolith the sanitation truck which blocked the way , deepening the horns which blatted impotently behind it , floating globules of the heavy smell of fuel oil from an iridescent trickle along the curb . Anice and Guy walked to the corner for a cab . As Anice settled herself she thought , This may be the last trip I 'll have to make , thank God ! Guy , banging the door , giving the address , flopping beside her , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smog . All flights canceled , trains late , motorists advised  | to proceed with caution . Maybe they wo n't leave him go today . " Anice , exploring her purse , said carelessly , " They do n't know there is any weather , not at that place . There it is . " She spread open the checkbook , frowning at the figures . " I hope I 've got balance enough . You ca n't get anyone out of a hospital dead or alive till you foot the bills . Oh , well , if I 'm short I 'll call the office . Mary can deposit more . " " I hope it 's not worrying Clif , all this expense . " " I do n't think it 's entered his head . " Anice dropped the checkbook into the purse . " He 's had enough else . " " So has everyone , but that does n't pay bills . " Then hastily , before Guy 's mildly inquiring glance elevated Clif still farther from all practical matters , she asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was another thing , Guy explained , that had set him wondering . It was Miss Ballantine , the secretary of Clif 's department . She 'd tried yesterday to get Anice . Wanted to know if they had any idea when or whether Professor McReal would be taking his classes again . The young instructor who 'd taken his seminars had come down with a virus , the other men could double up for a time , Guy forgot their names , one of them had been giving the big lecture course . If Clif was n't coming back soon , they ought to arrange for the whole semester . " I told her he was n't even out of the hospital yet , but we 'd let her know . She sent love and kisses . " Guy looked at her sternly . " You know Clif , you tell him and he 'll promise to show up tomorrow . " " You do n't know Clif as of now , " said Anice curtly . " You have n't spent these past weeks with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anice turned over nimbly  | the story of Sidney Miller . Clif would scarcely speak of it to Guy , and yet , if the two of them had one of their closed door sessions ? " Why , his graduate students were terribly concerned about him , they must have sent a delegate out to the hospital , it was the one morning I did n't arrive at sunrise , I had an emergency call from my office . Anyway , she got in to his room . Yes , it was a girl . One of his worshipers . Clif was simply furious at me . " " Infra dig , " said Guy . " Did n't want the gal catching him in bed . Maybe he had n't shaved . " " He wo n't see anyone ! Nor make the slightest ef-fort ? " Guy shifted in his seat , turning toward the window , chin thrust out , making a hard smooth line of the jawbone . " So you see you need n't be afraid he 'll rush back to work too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy , pushing down the door handle and sliding out almost before the cab stopped . " You 'll have to settle , I 'm broke as always . " He waited , his clear white skin , his dark hair heightened by the diffused light through the fog . Anice , paying the driver hastily , thought , I should have given him money , no , he 's telling me off for changing the tip last time , I ca n't get anywhere with him , damn it , not one word of sympathy , not that I want sympathy , but understanding ! Instead of understanding , he stands off . More each time he comes . As a businesswoman Anice admired the precision and speed with which the hospital discharged a patient . Clif  | was already dressed and waiting , looking in his gray suit more of an invalid than yesterday . The nurse had packed his bag , and was , as Anice and Guy came to the room , trying to fasten cord around a bulky package . " No matter what we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of cord between her teeth , " he always goes away with twice as much as he brought ! " " Hooray , " said Guy . " You 're coming home with us , what ? " " Yes ! " Clif 's tension blew out in a whistling sigh . " Yes , I am . " " You 'd never get a job at Macy 's . " Guy picked up the bundle . " Now put the string around it . " Miss Sexton , cap brushing Guy 's chin , got the string around and tied . Everything was ready , now . Dr. Priest was making his rounds , he 'd be in presently . If Mrs. McReal wished to step down to the office to take care of the account Mrs. McReal stepped down to the office , she glanced at the long itemized sheet , like a hotel bill with transfusions instead of cocktails , oxygen instead of valet service , oh Lord , she could n't live through all that again ! Everything down to the last vitamin . Hospitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Clif took that out . The surgeon 's bill will go directly to Mr. McReal , said the clerk , taking Anice 's check , scrutinizing it , stamping the sheets Paid . Folding the sheets , tucking them into her purse , Anice rode up to the fifth floor . For the last time , she thought , stepping out of the elevator . A nurse 's aide scurried along the corridor with brushes and pail . Anice , standing aside to let her pass , saw the open door of the room beyond Clif 's , saw the girl duck into that room . The room where only yesterday the old woman had crouched beside the  | bed ? Anice moved swiftly past Clif 's room , impulsepropelled , to the end of the hall and back ; quick and permanent as an exposure on film the impression of the empty , stripped room , the vacant high bed , the chair turned against the wall , the spurt of water as the nurse 's aide filled her scrubbing pail . Efficient , speedy , whatever way a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novice what had happened last night . She would n't tell if she knew ! Why should I care ? An old woman whom I do n't know and shall never see again . But such austere purity of feeling in her silent , unmoving figure that Anice could n't be rid of her . She was n't a woman , she became compassion and acceptance . Anice 's quick step ( she did n't want the desk clerk or one of the orderlies to suspect her of prying ! ) brought her to Clif 's door . Stocky , square shoulders in stiff white jacket , solid dome of head with cropped fair hair , neck shaved up high behind the ears . Immaculate and impenetrable even from the rear , Dr. Priest himself . " There she is , " said Guy , and Dr. Priest revolved slowly , stepping aside . " Good morning , " said Anice . ( Late again , was she ? ) " I 've just been paying the ransom . " ( Wrong note , this was a serious moment ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anice offered herself , poised delicately , ready to go into secret conclave , of course I ca n't say these things directly to him , he 's still , I wo n't say neurotic , but convalescent . Instead Dr. Priest looked at her with his opaque , nonrevealing light eyes , and said , courteously enough , " I think I 've handed out advice enough to your husband , if he 'll remember it . He ca n't go back to work , that 's out of the question . By fall you 'll be good as new . " Dr. Priest nodded briskly at Clif , who had one arm in a sleeve of  | his overcoat and fumbled backwards with the other arm . Miss Sexton and Guy both moved to help him , the nurse won . " Get your wife to take you out of the city . If you do n't like Florida , that place your son spoke of in the country . Spring 's coming even here , you could get out of doors . See me next week at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A week from today . " With a brisk , inclusive good-morning , he left . Well , there goes God . Anice would have said it aloud except that incredulous anger dried her throat . Of all the rude brush-offs ! Not one of them had noticed . Clif was shaking hands with the nurse , he 'd miss her bossy ways , he was trying to push a button of the coat into the buttonhole with agitated fingers . " Come on , let 's get out of here quick before someone changes his mind . Did you notice , Guy , the way he stood there and stared at me , when he first carne in ? I was sure he 'd found something on those X-rays . Here , I can take the package . " " What d' you think I came along for ? " Guy pried the package from Clif 's hand and picked up the bag . " All set . " " Your muffler ! " Miss Sexton caught Clif at the door , tucked the limp black scarf about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell your daughter you wore it home . Keep warm , now . It 's a mean morning . " " It 's a wonderful morning . " His voice shrilled with excitement . " Tell ' em all goodbye for me . " Anice caught his arm , tried to check his quick march to the elevator . " You 'll wear yourself out , Clif , before we even start ! " Clif flung up his head , his breath quick and uneven , his eyes bright in the hollowed sockets . " I tell you what it 's like , " he said . " You tunnel under the prison walls ,  | crawl along on your belly in the black , dirt in your mouth , in your eyes , inch by inch , you know you 'll never make it , and then , wham ! you burst through into daylight , you get up to your feet again . " " Free , " said Guy , succinctly . " I getcha . And then you get into the elevator . " He shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door slid open . Once in the taxicab Clif 's elation settled into a brooding contentment . Having escaped , he could stop running and trust that he would reach shelter . The telephone girl in the apartment lobby greeted him with enthusiasm . The elevator man was strange . No , Tom had n't left . ( Like a child , disappointed ! ) His day off , this was the new relief man . Clif hoped Kathleen had n't left . A man had to find some landmarks . " She would n't desert you , " said Guy . " Not that gal , no matter what . " Anice felt a small antenna of suspicion quiver . Guy had talked with the girl , then . Here she was at the apartment door , almost before Guy had pressed the button , flailing her hands in eagerness to help , generally getting in the way like a log pitching in a flood of excitement . An ' look at him , the flesh pared down to the bone with their cruel knives ! " Here , Kathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take care of that and hush your blather . Want to sit down , Clif ? " Clif shook his head . He stood just inside the door , his body slumping a little , nothing moving except his eyes which made the circuit from Kathleen lumbering up the hall , around the living room with the sky low and sand-hued beyond the windows , into the corner of the dining room .  | " Funny thing , " he said , slowly . " I could remember the carpet we had on the dining-room floor when I was a boy , but I could n't see this rug no matter how I tried . " " Goodness , why try ? " Anice laid her hand on his coat , prying at the buttons . " Let 's get your things off . " " Just a game . You invent games to wheedle time along . " His arms felt inert as Anice pushed back the coat . Guy moved to help her . An awkward restiveness fretted at her , as if they 'd all forgotten their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said uneasily . " The doctor did n't tell me a single thing ? " " No ! I can do as I please , he said . " " You do n't want to stand up the rest of your life , " said Guy briskly , tucking a hand under Clif 's elbow . " Plenty of time to rest before lunch . " He convoyed Clif toward his study . " Put him in my room , if he 'd be more comfortable , " called Anice . But they went past that room to the next . Anice hung away Clif 's coat , tucked the hat on the shelf , waited for Kathleen . Perhaps a luncheon tray would be best for Mr. McReal today . After the long drive . Then she looked in at Clif . Guy had spread a blanket over him , and stood at a window , holding it open . " Brrr ! " That damp air blowing right on Clif ! " Anice shivered . " Leave it alone . I like it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lock on the casement bar . " Then cover up properly . " Anice tucked a corner of the blanket between Clif 's shoulder and the pillow . " There , have a good rest . " She patted his shoulder . He did look wretched , his skin grayish and taut , puffy white half-circles under his closed eyes . His ordinary clothes , his usual setting , exaggerated his marks of illness , superim-  | posing his image upon the expected image . " You feel all right , do n't you , except tired ? " His eyelids lifted , and Anice , still bending over him , saw his eyes for an instant black and cold with misery , as if they looked from some depth where neither light nor life could penetrate . Then the pupils contracted , and ironic wrinkles at the corners of the lids altered the expression . " Oh , sure , I feel wonderful , " he said . " You were so excited , now you feel let down . " Anice stood away from the couch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathleen . " Behind her Guy moved quietly toward the door . She would n't turn to look at him , she had again that feeling of inadequacy , of being cued for lines she did not know . " Let down , " said Clif . " Busted out at the seams , that 's me . I 've been running like mad to reach the goal post , and when I get there I fall flat on my face . Boom . " " Gosh , you 're home , are n't you ? " Guy gave a kind of bellow . " You mean you want bands playing and drums rolling and ticker tape ? " " That 's it . " Clif laughed , and somehow the strain smoothed from his brow , the search ended . Anice laid her hand curled in a soft fist in the hollow of his cheek , shoved at him gently . " We 'll celebrate later , " she said . Guy was not in sight , Kathleen had shut herself into the kitchen . Anice turned irresolutely into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twice over . The emergency of Clif 's illness had ended , and with it the artificial routine of all the exigent demands upon her . And then the day was a holiday , not held into any shape by normal routine . You 'd think she might be glad to have a chance to draw a long breath . But if she did , she 'd fill herself with this fog of uncertainty , gray and  | chilly as the half-light beyond the windows , in which everyone waited for her to make the next move . Had she told herself that once Clif was here at home again , things would snap into the old , interrupted pattern ? Perhaps Clif had thought so , too . That black misery in his eyes , that pathetic little phrase , fallen flat on his face . Bands playing , drums rolling , Guy had said . That old woman , shouting with joy if her man had been delivered to her . The Italian family , ages ago , singing out Grazie as they welcomed the old grandfather with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and getting well ! I ca n't help it if I 'm not the naive , exuberant type . But her defense was a toothpick , not a staff . Anice sat on the chaise longue , hands clamped between her heels digging into the rug . All right , something had to be done about Clif . He could n't go back to work . He had to get out of the city . What else ? Guy would have to tell her what Dr. Priest had n't deigned to say directly to her . Florida ? He 'd certainly mentioned Florida . Why could n't Clif join Linton Webber ? If he did n't like the idea of a hotel , they could take an apartment together . All that wonderful sunshine ! Get your wife to take you ? Where did he think the money would come from ? Anice tipped herself back among the cushions , crossing her ankles . She 'd put it out of her mind until she could talk with Guy . After lunch . Clif would surely want a nap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a monster . But her mind kept clicking busily . What about a convalescent home , a sanitarium ? Clif would n't tolerate such a place . All the other old crocks dragging around  --  and expensive , too . If Linton would only urge him to join him ? too many hims spoil the broth  --  oh , Lord ! She shot up to her feet and darted to the telephone before she thought  | up objections . If the suggestion came from Linton , not from her , it might have some power . She dialed Western Union and dictated swiftly . Day letter . Clif was home , well but wobbly . Doctor said he must have sun . Lacks energy to make effort , Florida sounds too far away . Ca n't you persuade him to fly down , find quiet place for him near you ? Love , Anice . She repeated her name , yes , the telephone was listed in that name . Now , unless Linton happened to be off on some absurd expedition  --  oh , not Linton ! He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in creased linen , probably attaching himself to a jowled dowager with pearls in her creases , waiting for the luncheon hour . He should have an answer back before many hours . Surely they 'd stay through March . March was always a tough month in New York . And that place in North Carolina where Linton sometimes went in the spring ? If Clif spoke of expense , she 'd point out that if he left her free to handle her work ? Of course she 'd have to find some tactful way to say it . Money had been no part of their  --  what would you call it ! ? disaffection ? In spite of her making more than he did . He had enough to hold up his end . If , now , he ran short ? He might have to pay for a substitute , she did n't know how the university managed such things . The day moved along with no chance for any private talk with Guy . Clif refused a tray for luncheon . He 'd had trays enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary living he might come alive more  | quickly . Nor would he go back to his study for a rest . He 'd looked at ceilings too long . If he stayed upright for a few hours he might sleep at night . Guy set up the chessboard on the low table in the living room , with Clif wedged comfortably in the divan . Clif 's hand , the wrist thin and knobby , hovered irresolutely over one pawn , another , and then his fingers flicked at the carved pieces , clattering them over the table . " Too much for my empty head , " he said , leaning into the pillows . " Ca n't do it without a pipe . " Guy picked up the polished chessmen , fitting them slowly into the box . " No smoking , eh ? " he asked . " Do you miss it much ? " " How do I know yet ? " Anice brought in a pile of mail which had collected . " You want to go through this ? " she asked , laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't forward your office mail . I suppose the secretary took care of it . " Clif shuffled over a few envelopes . " Nothing there that will spoil , " he said . " How about the morning paper ? Or was n't there one today ? " " I 'll get it . " Guy folded the chessboard and stowed it with the box of men on a bookcase shelf as he went toward the dining room . " I do n't want anything , " said Clif , impatiently . " I just want to sit . " " Call me if you want anything , " said Anice . " I have some office work to catch up on . " Like having as a guest a man you did n't know well enough to select the appropriate entertainment . All she was doing was to project into the present moment the whole problem of the next weeks or even months . Clif was just glad to be out of the hospital , back in the apart-  | ment , he did n't need entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bags , and forget this petty , cobwebby feeling of one minute after another spun into a dragging awkwardness . Clif had partly emptied the bag . Anice shook out the dressing gown , the hospital odor floating from its folds . She thrust it into the hamper . Kathleen must give it to the cleaner . Then she cut the cord of the package and spread back the wrapping paper . The old bathrobe Guy had carried out , books , Lorimer 's Review , a large box of candied fruit unopened , a thin package of letters held together by an elastic band . Prof. C. A. McReal , care of the Private Pavilion , in a large , careless script . Anice turned the package , and the letter on the other side faced her with the same inscription in the same careless hand . She had a finger under the elastic band , she meant only to flip over the envelope to see if the flap had the name of the writer , she was drawn taut into a sharp pointed awl of curiosity , Clif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been there long enough , everyone knew where he was , but he had saved these ! During all the days while he had practically devoured her with his helpless need . The emotion that drove her must have sharpened every sense , for she knew instantly that someone had come behind her to the doorway . She had heard nothing , or had she ? Or seen at the outer margin of her vision a movement , or felt just a shift in faint air current ? She gathered the books and magazines in her hands and turned to place them on the desk , no start of guilty surprise , nothing but casual acceptance of Guy , who stood just where she had felt him . He extracted a battered cigarette pack from a pocket , and smoothed down a cigarette .  | " Clif 's sort of dozed off , " he said . " I thought I might finish typing that page of notes . " Anice wriggled her finger free from the rubber band and jerked the letters from hiding under the books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate about Guy 's expression . She hung the bathrobe behind the bathroom door and gathered up the wrapping paper , saying 11 only , " If you want to smoke , you 'd better move the typewriter into your room . Would n't the smell tantalize Clif ? " " So it might . " Guy stuck the cigarette into his shirt pocket . " If you close the door ? " Anice left him . Had she looked  --  well , snooping ? ? when Guy came to the door ? Pussyfooting up to catch her , was he ? Hastily she improvised the scene in front of her mirror , picking up envelopes , snapping a band around them , trying her finger negligently under the elastic . She 'd had her back toward him . With a hand mirror , peering over her shoulder , she decided that Guy could n't even have seen the letters . And if he had , she thought angrily , I have a right to read them ! To know what 's going on . If Clif 's been putting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , enveloping her in it like a voluminous white robe ? Only last night the suggestion of its withdrawal had set her clutching for its folds . But that handwriting might very well be Sidney Miller 's . The same heedlessness , haste , lack of subtlety . Clif had kept the letters . I 'll find out , Anice assured herself , and tasted the brassy flavor of the streak of unscrupulousness with which she moved by any means toward an end she desired . If one of my authors was breaking a contract , I 'd do the same thing . She turned away from the mirror . She had n't thought of it before , but now she did . It was a contract that lay behind the pressure upon her , pressure from  | every direction . You 're the man 's wife , are n't you ? For better or worse . Nurses , doctors , son , maid , friends , everyone . She 'd filled the bill , had n't she ? Had Clif , too ? In spite of her fretful confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clif imposed an obligation on anyone , never upon her . The telephone rang down the hall . Anice heard Guy 's quick dash and checked her involuntary movement toward her extension . She opened the door instead , and heard his , " Hello , Lorimer . Yes , Dad 's here . Wait , I 'll ask him . " Anice hurried down the hall . " The cord 's long enough , you can carry the phone right in to Clif , he need n't move . " " It 's Lorimer , he can put Marian on , she wants to speak to you . " Clif made a wry face as Guy elbowed a chair out of the way and handed him the ear-piece . " No , the other way around , you 're out of practice . " Anice swung back toward her room , hearing Clif 's curt , " Hello , yes , this is Clif . " Then , in a tone warmer , deeper , more like his own voice than anything she had yet heard , " Marian ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed ? " Clif would exert himself to sound normal and even cheerful for his daughter when he would n't for her . Perhaps he wanted to stave off a visitation from Lorimer as Marian 's proxy , sent in because Marian was n't Satisfied and must Get at the Truth . No , Clif had a deep affection for his daughter , and with her pregnancy a vivifying of his old responsibility for her which he had apparently buried at her marriage . Anice had suffered enough from that quality in his affection in the old days . Marian had been more of a rival than Elinor , Clif 's first wife . She  | was like her mother , with an illusory dependence which hid gyves of steel under its femineity . She was n't pretty , but Anice granted that she had charm , with her smallboned , soft-fleshed body , her mobile and very young face . Probably maternity , dislodging some of her persistent youth , would make her look more like her mother . At any rate , finished Anice , she ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky she 'd married as she had , before Elinor died . This might be the chance to talk with Guy . Marian would go on for an hour , indifferent to toll rates . But Guy had already shut himself into his room ; Anice could hear him tapping away . She left her door ajar . When Clif finished his family talk , she 'd ask him what he wished done about that inquiry from Ballantine , the department secretary . If he could n't pick up his work the rest of the semester  --  and the doctor had been specific aboutI that , at least  --  he 'd have to notify them . Somewhere among the papers Mary had left last night was a tentative calendar for next week . Anice found the typed sheet and began to check the items , lifting herself out of the thralldom of this dull afternoon . The ringing of the telephone startled her . Clif had ended his talk , she had n't noticed . Before she could cross the room she heard Clif answer . She hurried to the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clif , " he jerked his head impatiently , not looking at her . All he said was , " Yes . What was that ? Yes . " She knew before he set down the receiver , before he looked up with a wry , mirthless smile , just what had happened . Linton had wired . He had let her down someway . But she said , seating herself in the low chair near the divan , " You are coming on , Clif dear ! Even answering the phone now . " " You should n't leave it within reach . "  | " Marian must be relieved , now she 's actually talked with you . I expected to see her arrive at the hospital on a stretcher , she was so frantic about you . Lorimer would n't let her . I must tell you Guy 's phrase for Lorimer . He 's enjoying an intellectal couvade , he 's keeping the most intimate journal . " " He suits Marian , " said Clif . " She sounds contented . " He spoke indifferently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend Lorimer or to share ridicule , and after a pause , in the same neutral tone he added , " Give me a few days before you try to be rid of me , will you ? " He leaned forward , and Anice stiffened in her chair , a tingling of shock running up her spine . But he leaned forward only to slide a hand under one knee , to lift that leg over the other . Then , with a long sigh , he slumped back , pushing away the sheets of newspaper that crackled under his arm . " That was a wire from Linton ? What on earth gave you that impression ? I did think you might enjoy a few weeks there with him . Your wonderful Dr. Priest suggested it . " " Not to Linton , he did n't . " ( And she had bespoken Linton 's help ! Rule one , never defend yourself . Dodge out of the corner where your adversary thinks he has you , fly at him from another quarter . Reverse the charges , pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't going to be a paranoiac invalid , now you 're home ? If that 's the right word , persecution ideas , suspicions . Linton begged me to keep him posted . Poor Linton . He did want to stand by but he was frightened out of all his best poses by your operation . He just had to take his virus to a safe distance ! " ( She would n't ask what Linton had wired . She 'd have that out with Linton when she saw him . No accidental betrayal of her , not from that shrewd little schemer . Part of his  | refusal to pinch-hit for her . ) " He was n't the only one who was scared ! I ca n't believe you 're really home again . Is n't it wonderful ! " " It is , to me . " Clif let his head slide back against cushions , his frown untied . He eyed Anice with humor and skepticism , knowing what she was up to but taking it because he liked it . " You look sleepy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to lie down ? " " I 'm sure . I want to loaf right here forever . Unless ? " his eyelids lifted heavily ? " Are you expecting anyone ? If I 'm in the way ? " " No one knows you 're here . " ( Or me , she thought . I 've been out of circulation , too . Do n't say it , not now . Do n't stir him up . ) " I 'll move this so it wo n't disturb you again . " She picked up the telephone and stood just behind the divan , her free hand touching his hair , quite gray there at the temple , sticking up in funny ends against the cushion . " You need a haircut , " she said , softly , and perhaps the brief halt in the rhythm of his breathing was an indication that he heard . She waited to be sure he had slipped well into sleep before she moved . It 's not hard to put him at ease , she thought , wondering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger-tips so that she drew back her hand . Perhaps when Mary first touched Lazarus , bound hand and foot with graveclothes , he seemed strange . Illness did n't change a man permanently , did it ? Only now Clif 's span of attention was as short-winded as he was , his thoughts flagged as quickly as his strength . Why should the figure of that old woman at the hospital show with such sharpness on the screen of her inward vision , with compassion like a lovely arc starting its curve from her bent head , her crouching shoulders , springing forward to encompass her  | dying husband ? Clif was n't dying , he was almost well , he just needed a little time . And if he needed more than time , he needed more than she had to give . She certainly could n't submerge herself in him as the old woman had seemed to do . That was the very meaning of the word , was n't it ? Compassion . Feeling with . You crawled into the other human being and looked out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the telephone in place on its stand . Did any one ever change center that way ? Probably the old wife was feeling sorry for herself . If you were alert  --  sensitive was the overworked word  --  you could gather hints about other people , clues to their hidden intentions , desires , attitudes toward you . Anice had always prided herself on a quickness of perception which let her outguess the other fellow . But she , Anice , stood at the center looking out . Using a sounding board . What else was possible ? People fooled themselves . I know how you feel , they said . She glanced back , but Clif had sunk out of sight there in the corner of the divan . How would it feel to be Clif ? She let her arms fall limp , muscles loose , she let her body sag on the saddle of her hips . For a queer instant she felt a wrenching upwinding through her , like a grinding into reverse gear of the smooth and secret peristaltic work of her organs . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual erect posture and went swiftly to her room . How foolish could she be , anyway ? It showed the strain she 'd been under . She picked up the typed calendar she had been checking when the telephone interrupted , and read it , her irritation at herself enhancing each item . On Monday she would turn up at nine-thirty at the office . If she made that the necessary and inevitable action , whatever problems there were would adjust themselves around her act . No more daw-  | dling around . She 'd even , just to underline her act , take in that publishers ' dinner on Wednesday . Mary had a note about it . " Winston , Purdy , Burke , Cressman , one or two others are going . The firm has a table for eight or ten . Can you come ? " So Burke was back . Mary 's omission of him from her report on office doings might mean that she wanted to see whether Anice would ask about him , or simply that her sharp-nosed jealousy had found the scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked for future reference . He might furnish an amusing sideshow at a dull dinner . Anice would go from professional necessity ; there was a nuisance value in exhibiting herself in a group where the other women were by-products of the industry , literary agents or publicity directors or authors . Sometimes she had amusing encounters over cocktails , enough to give her mind a plaything or two while the waiters bore down on the tables with successive courses of the inevitable hotel dinner and the speakers came on with the ice cream , the old stand-bys who needed no introduction to such a gathering and whose speeches Anice could have prompted word by word except that old stand-bys never faltered , and the novices who said with nervous emphasis the very phrases the stand-bys had spoken in their apprenticeship . What on earth was a man like Burke doing , letting go of twelve dollars and at least four hours for such an ordeal ? Anice did n't know him very well , she could n't quite visualize him now , she got instead the sharp challenge she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no orchids without expecting a return . She had it ! He was finagling for a New York job . Now , when every publishing house was swallowing its own tail in its need to contract . What price orchids now ? I wonder , thought Anice , whether  | he planned just to use me , or whether he has an eye on my job ? He would n't be the first man to think he 'd do better . This ought to be fun , now I 'm on to him . She folded the memorandum and laid it with the letters . It 's high time I got back . For a second the surface of her assurance had a faint crinkle ; except for the delay he might have fooled her , she might have allowed herself to be fooled . Oh , no , never ( A breath smoothed off the crinkled doubt . Saturday morning Clif did not come out for breakfast . Kathleen tiptoed to his door , much like a cautious elephant , and tiptoed back . " Let him alone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up at noon and go to bed past midnight the rest of his life , just to be sure he was out of the hospital . No , do n't fuss with a tray . Put your mind on a good lunch for him . " She had a brisk , impersonal discussion with Kathleen of menus for that day and the next . Guy would take a late train Sunday . She finished her coffee standing , obviously too hurried for any talk of Kathleen 's private life , which just as obviously , Kathleen intended . " I 'll try not to be late , but do n't wait luncheon for me . You 'll stick around this morning , Guy ? " Guy 's " Sure , " without even an upward glance from his bacon and eggs , sent Anice on into quick explanation . " I 've got to be overhauled , I 'm a wreck , not a second for weeks to have even a shampoo . Have to get my armor polished , I 'm back to the wars next week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up . Anice gathered up purse , gloves , coat , where she had laid  | them in readiness in the hall , and let herself quietly out of the apartment . If Guy had evaded her yesterday , she had at least told him what she meant to do . She was back before one , after all , having achieved a sense of burnished well-being from several hours of highpriced personal service , hair , nails , face , ego , all smooth and lustrous . You paid for the flattery along with the special rinse and the chromium and the deft fingers , but what of it , she liked it ! Kathleen , setting the table for lunch , jerked her head toward the direction of Clif 's room . " Some woman from the college , " she said . " Lucky I rushed in and did up his room while he shaved . " The voice , dry and emphatic , was not that of the graduate student . Anice heard Guy 's " No pack of blue cards in this drawer , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We can have duplicates made , but it 's always irritating to the registrar 's office . " Ballantine , the department secretary , greeting Anice with a little flurry of appropriate remarks , they 'd all been so worried about Professor McReal , they were so glad he was out of the hospital and going away for a nice rest , Mrs. McReal must have been so worried , she was sorry to be such a bother but they did need the course cards . Guy shoved at the drawer of the desk , pushing down obstructing papers , and Clif sat up from his corner of the couch , dropping a long leg to the floor . " Please do n't get up , Professor McReal . " Miss Ballantine hung between two solicitudes , one for the invalid , one for a sacrosanct detail within the small range of her authority . Her blue-white hair glistened around her small hat , her skin crinkled under her discreet make-up . " Do n't let him , Mrs. McReal ! " " I just want to get my briefcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petulance . " I ca n't remember a thing about that last day . " " Here you are . " Guy swung it over to the couch , and while Clif explored it , Miss Ballantine explained how fortunate it was that Professor McReal was taken ill just when he was . If he had to be , that is . " If students get started with one professor , no matter who he is , they never really settle down with a substitute . Oh , some of them may , but most of them , I do n't know why it is , they just do n't like the change . " " Might be they liked the old man , " said Guy , and Miss Ballantine blinked at him . " Ah ! " Clif found the narrow blue slips in a pocket , Miss Ballantine seized them before they vanished again . " Now you are n't to worry about a single thing , " she assured him . " Professor Pinckney means to drop in , some of the Ph.D . candidates you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . And your colleagues are perfectly willing to carry your courses as well as their own , as they say who knows , any day you may have to do the same thing for them ! " " Nobility with a pragmatic streak , " said Anice , manoeuvring Miss Ballantine out and along the hall so adroitly that Miss Ballantine was still explaining arrangements when they came to the exit door . " We have to be careful not to tire my husband , " said Anice , confidentially . " So nice of you to drop in . Let me know if you find any more red tape . " " He gave me his bibliographies and reading lists . " Miss Ballantine frowned . " I ca n't think of anything ? He 's awfully thin , is n't he ? It makes him look older , he 's always looked so , well , young . Well , have a lovely time while he gets built up . " Anice closed the door upon her . Have a lovely time .  | What , exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely time ? Oh , they were all the same , these middle-aged women secretaries . Deciduous variety , shedding leaf by leaf their youth ( firm skin , clear eye , bright hair ) , their warmth , their little hopes , until they had only bare . branches , sharp pointed twigs of petty authority and jealousy and gossip . So Clif had let go of his work without a ripple of protest , just as he had assured Guy he would do . He had always dragged himself out to keep appointments , no matter what . You and the postrnan , Anice had jeered at him . " You tap your second wind , " Clif would say . It blows out before you get home again . " Now he just accepted the doctor 's orders , in a way quite out of character . Perhaps you did n't have a second wind with a piece of lung clipped out . Or had the doctor frightened him , or was it what they called a traumatic hangover from the suddenness and from the brief threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hypochondriac . Anything worse than a man who went around with his finger on his own pulse ! " Lunch is ready , Mis ' McReal . " Kathleen startled her . " Could you get them to come ? It 's souffle and in five minutes it must come out and I 'd like the good luck to serve it before it falls on me . " " I 'll warn them , " said Anice . Clif , humped forward at the edge of the couch , hands limp between his knees , did n't want any lunch . Nor did he want to see anyone else from the university . If Anice had been home , she might have dealt with Ballantine . " She stalked me right down the hall , " said Guy ruefully . " I told her I 'd ask Clif and there she was , tailing me . " She did n't need the damned cards . Flies buzzing  | around the corpse : You look dreadful , Professor . Do you think you 'll be back at your desk by fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes fine drama . A heart attack , a stroke is the best . " He looked up at Anice , squinting as if he could n't see clearly . " You remember Collins , dropping dead at a faculty meeting ? Bzzz , bzzz ! " " We 'll have death in the kitchen if you do n't come on , " said Anice ; her quiet words , her long step to Clif 's side , her hand under his arm , her gesture toward Guy were all of a piece , a single curving impulse to lasso him out of quicksand . " Haul him up ! The man does n't know when he 's starving . March , now . Kathleen 's waiting with a souffle and if I do n't serve you two up in time for her , I 'll have to jump out of the window . " She could feel Clif 's arm relax under her hand . " Give me credit for getting rid of her promptly , " she said . " You 'd make a grand bouncer , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to study your technique . " Then for some moments Kathleen held the center , breathing heavily with cautious pride as she bore in the earthen casserole with its perfect gold-brown dome . Anice served dexterously , landing a triangle on the first plate before the golden crust sagged , and Kathleen placed it before Clif with a satisfied " Eat it hearty , now . It 's nourishing . " Expectancy like Kathleen 's was a mandate ; even Clif ate , obediently at first , and with no protest when Kathleen whisked his plate away for a second serving . With the second less momentous course Kathleen withdrew . Anice had flipped over the surface contents of her mind , thinking that the world as of 1950 did n't offer much in the way of light conversation befitting an invalid at lunch . But Guy started a yarn about a trailer camp he had visited with one of the G.I. physics majors and Clif was listening , his expression quiet , half amused , his corn-  | rnents natural . That 's that , thought Anice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Kathleen 's over her prized dish . She had pulled Calif out of a queer little tailspin . Late in the afternoon Dr. Pinckney , chairman of Clif 's , department , telephoned . " Dick Pinckney . Mrs. McReal ? " Yes . Clif was still resting , she did n't like to disturb him . It was n't necessary , not in the least . Miss Ballantine had reported on her call . Delighted to hear Clif was getting out of town . He was sending over a few books Clif might like to nibble at . Tell him to forget the school existed at all . Just one detail . Would Clif feel up to talking with young Bishop , who was taking over the supervision of theses ? " It 's the final hurdle for some of those students , and they 're pretty worried . Mr. Thorns , Miss Miller , one or two others . They feel they 've lost a good pilot . " Suddenly enamored of his figure , Dr. Pinckney went on for several sentences about unknown channels and rocks ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at dinner parties ; she knew just how his color deepened and the neat tufts of gray eyebrows and moustache jumped in creative excitement . " Mr. Thorns , Miss Miller , " he repeated , and Anice turned to glance at Clif 's door . No , he had n't opened it . He could n't have heard , anyway . Had Pinckney underlined that name , Miller ? " I 'll tell Clif , Dr. Pinckney . I 'll have him do something about Bishop . " Difficult thing , swapping horses in midstream . But he must n't mix his metaphors . Give Clif his best wishes for a pleasant sojourn in the country . He was very wise . No virtue in city pavements . It would be nice , thought Anice , returning to her seat at the low table in the living room , papered with office work , if someone let me know what these plans are ! When  | Guy came in , she 'd corner him . He had n't said where he was going . Just announced that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd see her in the morning . Had n't asked if she minded , or needed him , or perhaps wished to go somewhere herself . Kathleen had gone off , too , without a word . Probably to buy birdseed or something equally crucial . She must have come in by the service door . Anice could hear her rumbling away in the kitchen , to herself or to the canary . She had evidently settled her soulwrenching problem or she would n't be so voluble . Anice picked up the sheets of contract she was annotating clause by clause for her conference with Weymouth and his agent on Tuesday . She 'd straightened Kathleen out in that talk she 'd had with her , when was it , centuries ago ! She 'd never known that time could move so glacierslow . Anice left her door open when she finally went to bed , hoping to catch Guy when , if ever , he came in . She woke , thinking morning had come ; only the glow from the reading lamp , a weight across her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dark silence of the apartment . Had Guy come in , tiptoeing past her door ? She heard the faint , familiar pattern of sound that a city weaves at night , gray sounds of traffic , trailer-trucks rumbling along the avenue , nighthawk taxis , a fabric shot through at times by a scarlet streak , a shriek , a siren . Nothing tonight to pull her to the window on an always futile search for mugger , murderer or fire . Sunday breakfast was late and lazy , with Guy and Clif drinking coffee behind sections of the morning paper ,  | accepting fresh muffins . Kathleen must have gone out to early Mass ; she had tied an apron over her black street dress instead of changing into a uniform . Anice reserved comment until later . It must have been a very High Mass , thought Anice , the way the girl slatted in and out of the kitchen and flung her hand up across a giggle every time Guy lifted his eyes from the paper . At any rate , Kathleen was as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't hear you come in , " Anice said , as Guy folded down the gaudy comic sheets and tossed them over to Clif . " That 's good . " He gave her a quick , bland look . Anice waited an instant to be sure her irritation did not carry into her movements , and then rose , shaking clown the soft folds of her housecoat . " You look too comfortable to stir , " she said . " But at the rate Kathleen 's geared she 'll be serving dinner before we 've dressed . " " It 's a big morning for the gur-rul , " said Guy , jumping up to pull back his mother 's chair . " Did n't she tell you ? " Kathleen 's head bobbed through the gaping kitchen door . Guy waved at her , grinning , and her head bobbed back , the door muffling the explosive laugh . " The priest read the banns this morning , " said Guy . Of course she 's excited . Come along to Dad 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clif 's slippers scuffed along the hall , Guy pivoted from one heel to the other , keeping slow step with Clif . Anice hung in the living room , wavering . Go hack to confront Kathleen , deserting without a word , forgetting her hysterical scruples , her obligation to the household ! This was some of Guy 's doing , she 'd hear his account . " But I thought there was some obstacle , " Clif was saying as Anice came up behind them .  | " Obstacle number one died , " said Guy . " Obstacle number two I dislodged . Here , sit over here . " Anice brushed past them and attacked the unmade bed , slapping sheets smooth , jerking at blankets . " Banns or no banns , " she said , " she knew you 'd want your room . Please lower that window , Guy . " That first evening of Guy 's visit , while Anice had been slaving with her secretary ! Guy had found Kathleen in the kitchen , foundered in a bog of woe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd whisked her off first to Murphy 's basement . Murphy , back from Rockland , was packing . He would n't say a word ! Somehow Guy had propelled the two of them over to the parish house and when he left them they were planning on Mike 's banns in the little church near his brother 's farm  --  he had to go the next day , convoying the coffin and all  --  and Kathleen 's here . " The poor girl was in hell , " said Guy , " thinking she 'd lost both her man and her soul . We set her straight . " " Did it occur to you that I had a right to know what was going on ? " " Kathy said she 'd talked with you . " " She carried on like a banshee and I spent hours , exhausted as I was , trying to calm her down . " Anice flapped out of its folds the tailored cover for the couch . Her control threatened to snap , a withered elastic band . " Yeuh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good licks . You 're a cute little juggernaut , Mom . Not that I blame you for wanting to hang on to Kathleen . Why , her poor Murphy was half crazy , thinking she cared more about Clif here than about him . There he was , throwing everything into this old suitcase , not opening his head no matter what we said . When he dumped his greasy coveralls on top of his clean shirts Kathleen grabs the suitcase  | and dumps everything out on the floor and chucks the case at him , catching him on the knee . He yells , she grabs him , Darlint , have I kilt you ? From there on in everything went fine . " Clif leaned back in the deep reading chair with a guffaw . Guy , perched on a corner of the desk , swung one foot and pulled down his mouth in mock contrition . Anice looked at her son , a hard clarity on her face . He had turned the scene into farce to sidetrack her , to sidestep her justified indignation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for everyone except me . But if that girl says I tried to hang on to her , she 's an Irish liar . " Anice pulled herself up sharply from the almost irresistible desire to drop into childish vulgarity , to add that she had n't realized an immediate marriage was so imperative . " She did n't say so . But she was scared to talk to you . So was I. " Guy swung his foot more quickly , grinning at his mother . " just do n't take it out on her , Mom . " " She 'll make the man a fine wife , " said Clif , quite as if he had dialed out of the talk several remarks back . " You say it 's a big apple farm ? " Anice , at the door , broke across Guy 's answer . " I still do n't understand why she could n't wait until summer , or at least until I 'd found someone to take her place . " " If you 'd seen ' em , " said Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Murphy had got off she 'd never caught up with him . The first farm girl he met up north of Geneva could have grabbed him , too . If Kathleen failed him , he was through . No patching up later . " " Very romantic , " said Anice . " Romantic and young . " " You mean me . " Guy 's foot stopped in midair . " Maybe . But Murphy was as practical as ? I tell you , it was like a laboratory experiment . Here you are with your test tube ,  | you introduce one reagent you get one result , you ca n't change it , you could have got another result if you 'd used another reagent . But it 's done , set , finished , that 's my point . I 've done it often enough in the lab . I 'd never seen it before with folks . It sure set me thinking . " He looked at Anice with a puzzled humility and then shifted around on the desk corner so that he faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " The irrevocable moment , the point of no return . I t makes sense . " Clif 's voice had a lazy affection . " Lucky for us we do n't often recognize these test tube moments . We 'd never be able to move . We just find out sometime later we 've jelled or whatever . " " Point of no return to my kitchen ! " Anice drew herself up tall , anger rippling over her down to the tips of the fingers as she flung their words back at them . " What kind of a reagent will a strange cook make for Clif ? " " Clif might hire out as apple picker , " said Guy . Anice glowered at him , a simple , maternal , **34;988;TOOLONG glower , and left them . She had n't lost her temper enough to disturb Clif . Guy had taken advantage of her , making Clif part of the audience for his sentimental story . He had stymied her , interfering with her household in the most presumptuous way . If he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have managed Kathleen . Too late , now . Too late not because of banns or promises , but because Clif , now , would see her as inconsiderate if she tried to postpone this Irish idyll . As she dressed she let her mind beat on with its angry churning , throwing up blobs of words without sequence , without direction , all from the same source . She 'd counted on Kathleen if Clif refused to go off somewhere , sanitarium if he needed one , pleasant hotel , anywhere . She would say that the girl ran the house perfectly , she could  | take adequate care of everything , Clif could invite a friend , Linton , say , scarcely Sidney Miller , that might shock Kathleen . Only a few weeks before that trip to England . Had Guy possibly discovered that ? Why not out with it , show these sentimental males what harm his meddling had done ? These next weeks when she needed every scrap of time , of energy for her job ( who knew what blunders , oversights , sly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to waste herself on dreary maid-hunts . Why not say out ( Guy called her a cute juggernaut , did n't lie ? ) you made this mess , get yourselves out of it , I 've got other things to do . Anice had finished dressing . She examined her face in a hand mirror , finding no mark of all she 'd been through except perhaps a little grimness around the lips . What was that word the girl who gave the facial had told her to practice to relax the mouth  --  not broom , thrush ? Brush ? She tried it a time or two and then laid down the mirror . The futile churning in her head had stopped , having produced no solid lump of decision , leaving only a little froth of anger . She knew one thing she would do . She wrote and blotted a check for Guy Hamilton , Jr . His March check . Usually she deposited it for him gracefully in his bank . She 'd hand it to him ( save me the trouble of mailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting at her desk , setting the pen in the onyx holder , she knew with a tired and bewildering finality that she could not say to Clif , " Find yourself a good place to hang out , will you ? I am going abroad . " I have n't given it up , she told herself . I 'm just waiting for the right moment . Kathleen 's fist gave a thud at the door , and Anice moved swiftly across her room , coming up through dark water into determined amiability . She 'd show them how  | wrong they were , how magnanimous she was ! Kathleen , somewhat incoherent , wished , please , to serve dinner a little early as she had to get to this place in Brooklyn where some of his relatives , Mr. Murphy she meant , were coming , it 's his aunt 's boardinghouse at this address , and they 'd asked her to come . It would be all right , Anice told her . She added , in her clearest tones , not peering around to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had things straightened out and hoped she would be very happy . Not one word about defaulting . Amusing the way the girl 's face puckered suspiciously , as if she tried for a look behind what Anice had said , and then cleared in gusty relief . " I hated to be leaving right when Mr. McReal would be needing special tasty dishes cooked to coax him back into health . Thomas said he has his own wife , no less ( not knowing the great things you have on your mind ) , leave her fend for him and you look after the health of your own man . ' Ah , he was nervy , having no proper life for a man all this hard time , and me adding to his worry . Who would n't wish that poor woman at peace ? " Kathleen laid the palm of one hand along her cheek , bending her head into it . " He 'll be coming for me in a pick-up truck , I can take the canary bird in his cage with a cloth over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may have been halfway to the apple farm when her hand dropped , her nostrils flared , and with a shriek , " The pie ! Holy saints , the pie ! " she thundered toward the kitchen . Anice caught an acrid whiff of charring sugar . She must remind Kathleen to clean the oven . Always her pies flowed over , and always the girl shut the door on the mess , filling the house with smoky smell the next time she lighted the oven . She did the same thing with her life ! She boiled over , filled the air with woe or worry or bliss ,  | and banged shut the door . According to the analysts if you did that you were bound to have a stink later . Kathleen did n't seem to . Was it a racial trait , or just childishness ? A volatility of emotion which left no char . Nice if you worked that way . Guy stepped up behind her . " Did I hear something about dinner early ? " he asked . " You did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , but would he give her one word of credit for her smooth generosity ? " You 'd better get dressed . And , Guy ? " She opened the book she held and flipped out the check , extending it to him . " Here 's for March . Save me the trouble of mailing it . " Guy held it between thumb and middle finger ( like a dead mouse ! ) . " I may not need it , " he said , slowly . " I wanted to talk over a couple of things . After dinner ? Before I go . Okey ? " " What else have you been up to ? " " I got ta ask Kathy where she put my clean shirt . " He loped down the hall , a disheveled , gangly tall boy . Anice hunted through the sections of Sunday papers Kathleen had stacked on the low table before the divan . She ought to check over the book section , Mary had n't brought up the advance copy . She sat there , her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid past behind her . She 'd like to make him eat that juggernaut . She 'd certainly never rolled over him . She 'd left him absolutely free in his choice of schools and camps and colleges , when the money Guy Sr. had left him ran out , she had footed the bills even when she did n't know where her next rent was coming from . She did n't want gratitude , no parent had a right to ask that . Just a simple affection . She might have expected some kind of trouble , if he 'd turned into one of the wild , reckless , hopeless , end-  | of-the-world young men she ran into ( in their manuscripts , in person ) ? Guy , a little younger , seemed part of a generation indurated against shock because they cut their eyeteeth on the bone of destruction and sent their roots down in atomic fissures . They sat in irreverent and disinterested judgment on their elders . Anice looked at the front page of the book section . About time The Continental made first page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would read . She flipped a page . She hoped the Cressman book would be well placed , perhaps next week . Although the book club choices were n't as sure fire as they had been . Guy pried through the attention she tried to fix . He was special , perhaps . Brilliant . Not a fond mother 's appraisal . Damn it , why should she worry about him ! She never had until now . Part of this enforced isolation , this separation from her normal interests . Like hibernation , when the creature fed on his own tissues . She needed to crawl out of the cave . What if Guy did n't approve of her ? He never had , whole-heartedly , and she 'd survived . She 'd learned long ago to take approval , admiration , exciting adoration where she found it . She was n't , at her age , turning into , not turning but being compressed into , a female who lived only when breathed upon by the male , a Sweet Alice-Ben Bolt ? Anice pushed her attention back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down the hall Guy 's voice boomed in a shout , and Clif 's , in a lower key , answered . Anice bent over the pages of the book section , forming the syllables of the words behind her set teeth , determined to hold her mind right here , reading , to ignore the recognition which threw its shadow between her eyes and the meaning of the words , recognition that she  | made of Guy only a peg on which to hang her real concern , whose essence was Clif . Dinner was pleasant and at moments amusing , with Kathleen torn between a desire to have them eat appreciatively , especially Clif , and a desire to have them finish that she might start for Brooklyn . Guy told over again a tale he had told yesterday , and Anice thought , He 's worked up about something , not that it matters . Clif listened as if he had n't heard it , lifting his fork as if it were too heavy . Slow motion picture . He ought to ask Dr. Priest for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the wonderful new drugs  --  Time , the great healer . Now why not a concentrate of time ? Recommended dose , in case of serious grief , take a year and a half . After illness , perhaps three months . Anice offered her idea lightly . Guy answered with quick young condescension . Her kind of time was an old illusion . You could n't make a capsule of velocities . Clif interrupted . " Save that for your next lecture , Mr. Einstein . I think Anice has something . We kill time , we lose time , we have too little or too much time , the opiates they dose you with are a sort of concentrate of no time . " An amused alertness lightened his face . " And monkey-glands ! They were an antitoxin against the poison of time . " " Where would you be if you took a double dose ? There or now ? " Anice laughed at the wry face Guy made . " But it must n't be an opiate , a blotting out . That leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger the blot the higher the hang , too. , , Clif 's alertness dimmed . " Look at me , not half here . " " There 's something about plants , " Anice hurried on , reluctant to let the interlude end . " I 've read somewhere . Wonderful new chemicals that you pour on , you can see the spindly little thing shoot up . Why not do something useful in your old laboratory , Guy ? " " I 'm no chemist , I 'm a physicist . Strictly no dealings in hot air . " Kathleen served the dessert ( thinnish triangles of blueberry pie ) and as Anice started a caustic sentence about blueberries on the oven floor instead of in the pie , the girl reappeared , coffee tray in her hands . Would it be all right to set this in the living room so she could get done with the dishes ? As she stalked back into the kitchen the door cut off a piece of her low monologue . " Gassing and lollygagging when they know what a piece it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Anice . " The fuss that girl 's made over Clif , you 'd think she 'd lie down and die for him . Now she 'd like him to choke on the pie ! They 're all alike ! No real feeling for anything except themselves . " " You want too much for your money , Mom . Love in the kitchen and all that . " " I dislike pretense , lip service . " As the door swung open for a listening crack , Anice rose , tossing aside her napkin . " You 're too harsh . " Clif steadied himself with a hand on the table as he got slowly to his feet . " It 's another kind of time capsule , " he said . " We belong to the girl 's past . She 's got a head wind toward her future . " Anice settled herself at the coffee table , the pale afternoon sun glinting on silver pot and tray . She must see to it that Kathleen cleaned all the silver again . Clif and Guy  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her in the present . Anice poured coffee into the fragile cups and looked up , impatiently , for the two to join her . Clif was crossing on a slow diagonal toward the hall , jerking his elbow away from Guy 's hand . " No coffee , " he said . " Sit down out here with us , " urged Guy . " You can stick your feet up on the divan . " Clif turned his head ; his face had a chastened grayness in the bright room , it wore the blank and yet intent expression Anice had seen in the hospital room , as if , unaware of them , he listened to the hidden , uncertain rhythm of his body , for all the world like a skilled mechanic testing out a motor . " No , " he said . " I 'm sorry . I just want to lie down . " Guy followed as Clif moved along . Anice drank her coffee and then , a finger steadying the full cup against its saucer , went to Clif 's door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , and Guy stood fastening the casement window ajar . " I said I did n't want coffee . " He shut his eyes . " Just let me alone . " Anice went back to the living room , stopping to drink the coffee . Clif could easily have sat down for a moment ? he 'd seemed quite himself at dinner . Kathleen , in coat and scarf , was humped over the low table , hands spread to pick up the tray . At Anice 's sharp " Leave that alone ! " she side-stepped , jarring the floor lamp , catching at its shade . " For heaven 's sake , clear out ! " said Anice . " You make me nervous . " " I thought you 'd finished ? " She backed around Anice with celerity and her bolt for the kitchen set up a clinking of the potted plants on the window ledge .  | Guy strolled in . He 'd like some coffee , please . He 'd throw his things in his bag , he 'd take the seven o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear before work begins . " He held out the cup for a refill , drank it quickly , and went off . He 's winding himself up to something , thought Anice . I know that look . It 's just like the drop curtain at amateur theatricals , with excited little ideas running around behind it , bulging it out , moving it , bumping against it , sticking their heads around the edges . Well , come out from behind your curtain , put on your act ! Anice carried the coffee tray into the kitchen , sniffing distastefully at its odor of dishwater , damp towels and careless haste . She opened the window , rinsed the cups , glanced at the closed door of the girl 's bedroom and decided she could n't stand inspection . Kathleen might as well leave tomorrow for all the good she 'd be . Prom her own room she brought a leather writing portfolio and the envelope filled with cards from florists ' boxes , notes tucked under the covers of books , dreadful colored get-well cards , ten cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking what to say , even the list of telephone inquiries in Kathleen 's phonetic attempts at translation . She could n't afford the time to answer all these gestures , she should look over the Weymouth hybrid , think up a unique jacket , a new slant on advance publicity . Later , after Guy had gone . Let him find her writing these notes which Clif would n't tackle . She had n't known he had collected so many . Unfamiliar names , most of them . No addresses . She 'd dash off the notes , she 'd try to check addresses , telephone book , university directory . Dear So-and-so , my husband wishes me to thank you and so on and so on . How about my investing in a stock of thank-you cards ? She amused herself planning a design , rosemary  | for remembrance , what 's for thank-you ? Lots of money in cards , now did they have one for accepting or rejecting a proposal ? A this-is-so-sudden one ? And all the time she was waiting for Guy , the glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for his amusement , the unfinished note lying under her hand . How many friends Clif had ! If he 'd begin to see some of them , they 'd take up the slack in his long days . If she dropped a hint , Mr. McReal is at home now , time is heavy on his hands , how about lifting a hunk of it ? Time , again . Suddenly , like a corkscrew shredding fibres as it turned , pain ached in her throat . It had been their old game , played for a brief moment there at dinner , that tossing back and forth of words , with Clif 's volleys increasing the pleasant illusion of cleverness . Why should it hurt ? just a moment , and Clif had gone drooping back to his invalid bed . All right , so we did have fun ! When did I ever cry about the past ? Anice spread the writing case open and began the notes , her fine , abrupt , legible script making a decorative holograph on the sheet . Gratefully , faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind , but a faulty washer let through an occasional drip : where was Guy , he could n't take all this time with one bag , if she went to his room their talk might disturb Clif . Give me a few days before you try to get rid of me , Clif had said . Then he 'd forgotten about Linton . Or set it aside . A child 's way , shifting easily , quickly diverted , steadfast only to the little hard ego-core , the center where growth took its course . Clif was n't childish . But recovery , recuperation , was a kind of growth . Growth of tissues , of new blood cells , recharging of innumerable small dynamos . Perhaps the ego was just a physical quality , the body instinct for its own well-being , comfort , safety , sating of its hungers.  | Betraying friends , abandoning loyalties to escape torture , to protect the soft-fleshed ego . Then people made saints of martyrs to attest their separation from ordinary human beings . Now how had she jumped from ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd like to bat it around with Clif . Someday , not now . Right now he might think she implied criticism . How , exactly , if egoism was an expression of the body and not of the so-called soul ( show me a self-immolating rattlesnake or even angleworm ! ) had it collected such obloquy ? A hangover of Puritanism , which held all instincts suspect . Anice tucked the note under the flap of an envelope and looked at the next card . Francis with an i , was that male or female ? She heard Guy , his quick tread distinct in the silent apartment , and flung her arm toward him . " Francis with an i , darling , " she said . " Which is it , man , woman or beast ? " " Huh ? " Guy looked at the card between her fingers . " Oh , man . " His dark brows bent , almost meeting , and he did not heed the scene Anice had set for him . " Where I was yesterday , " he stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propulsion of a leap for which , with dread , he had gathered all his energy , " was at Princeton , at Marian 's and Lorimer 's . They asked me to come . I guess Marian would have come right in and to hell with the doctor , if I had n't gone out . " Anice set down pen and card and dusted off her fingers with a gay lightness . " Well , well , " she said . " Is it plots ? Do sit down and tell me all . How is Marian ? " " Oh , all right . Kinda fat . " Guy stood still , no hand waving , no fist clenching , a stiff-kneed , stiff-necked bracing of his muscles . " And Lorimer ? " ( Go ahead , do n't expect me to help you out ! ) " If you 'd divulged your call I could have  | sent Marian one or two things I 've collected for her and have n't had time to mail . " " No time for an argument , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of Lorimer 's pieces , too precious to trust to the post office . Or perhaps Clif knew ? " " No . I just went . " Guy thrust back his head , swallowing . Along his upper lip moved the faintest quivering , an almost imperceptible betrayal of inner tension . Anice had n't seen that since he had been a little boy , facing her in some small controversy . " You know damned well what they wanted . " " I can guess . They wanted to issue directives about Clif . So they make you take that tiresome trip in order to use you as a cat's-paw . I 'm surprised you would lend yourself ? " " No use , Morn . " Guy 's voice sounded tired , uninflected , perhaps from too many rehearsals to himself . " You can put me in the wrong , easy , with words . You always can . I got me such an earful of words yesterday I do n't want to hear any more . " " I can imagine how Marian would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such a good chance . And you let her ? " " That 's what I went for , " said Guy , with sudden harshness . " I did n't know how bitter she felt . We never got on too well . I knew she blamed you  --  about her mother , I mean . I did n't know she ever gave my father a thought . The gist of it is , she says you ruined two lives to get Clif and now you 're welshing on him , too . " " My dear boy , you sound like a soap opera . What will this woman perpetrate next ? Listen to tomorrow 's installment . How about a singing commercial ? Sit down and relax . You 've let a hysterical , pregnant girl cram you with  | distorted ancient history . You were a fool to let yourself in for it . " Anice flicked at him , meaning to set him in a dither , not knowing where the next sting would land . " I 've always put up with her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " " She did n't tell me anything I did n't know , " said Guy , quite as if her words had been harmless gnats , not even buzzing around his head . " Maybe it is ancient history . They 're both dead , her mother , my father . " Anice felt her blood slow in her veins , thickened with the chill of anger . This was her son , her child , separate , uncompliant . He had eluded her , evaded her , feared her , sometimes loved her , but always in direct encounter she had won , hands down . And now she could see him thrashing about in the seine of childhood where she had thought to trap him , breaking through , beautiful and young and free of her and very male . " And I killed them , is that the idea ? " " How do I know ? " demanded Guy . " Marian says her mother died of a broken heart , she never got over ? " " Ulcers , the doctor said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I took a pot shot at him ? " " He would n't have gone to war , he did n't need to , he was past the draft age . " " But for me he would have settled in a suburb ? Why , he spent his life running off , mountains , jungles , wars ! " " In one of his letters ? " " I do n't even wish to hear what he wrote you . But there is something I 'd like to add to the record at this point , and I hope you 'll not forget it . All this talk of ruining lives  --  God , that 's a soft way out . If you 're a helpless infant , all right . But once you 're grown , no one ruins you except yourself . People can hurt you , as you 're doing now , to me . But what you do about it is your own con-  | tern . This eternal buck-passing , this finding someone to blame , something , the age you 're born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , your wife , anything but yourself ! It makes me sick . " " You 're kinda off the beam , " said Guy , warily . " You mean what you do does n't affect anybody ? That 's an easy out . " " I mean your father , Major Guy Harrison , would have rushed off to build bridges for an advancing army if we 'd been living in the slums with ten children . I do n't believe he wrote you that he went from a broken heart . Oh , I do n't think you 're lying . He no doubt threw in a few appropriate phrases . Writing to you would remind him of me . And I do n't believe Clif went mewling to his daughter . " " You 've jerked it all around so it looks okey from where you sit . " " But not from where you perch in judgment . " Anice smiled at him , a delightful , coaxing smile . " What are you driving at , Guy ? I know you did n't trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal past . Does Marian blame me for Clif 's illness , too ? " how stubbornly somber and unmoved the boy stood there , not rising to any bait of anger or irony or charm ! " No , she did n't say that . " His very literalness , so unlike his usual quick uptake , proved the degree of his immunity to her . A swift pulse set up its beating behind her ear , like a minute alarm bell . " She 's worried about his next move , these next few months . She sent Lorimer in to ask the doctor about it because she could n't get in herself . " " Dr. Priest ? " " I guess so . " " Of all the outrageous interference ! "  | Guy made an impatient gesture . " They figured you 'd had your chance to consult him . And were n't confiding in them . " " A fine idea they 'd give Dr. Priest of me ! " " Lorimer had about one second . Really , he was rather rude . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **29;1024;TOOLONG manner . Any fool  --  I do n't know that he said fool or implied it  --  knows what McReal needs now . About then Lorimer had to shush Marian 's hysterics . What ailed her was that Clif turned down flat the place they 'd found for him , a super rest-cure home in New jersey , not far from them . Said he could n't stand it , could n't afford it , would n't hear of it . He was going to his own old house , you know , up there on the Hudson . Going to sit out spring on his own doorstep . Had his doctor 's word for it , good a place as any , better if he liked it . " ( Anice had known it , had refused the knowledge , since that phrase Dr. Priest had dropped . The old house Clif 's father had built , the one thing he had salvaged from his settlement on Elinor : in swift montage it wheeled through Anice 's inner vision , dark river , darker palisades beyond , tangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilly scent of wood and plaster when they opened the doors . Those week ends the first year ? ) Had she spoken , or was Guy just plodding along ? " That 's what they called up about the day Clif came home . Marian was frantic . Clif would n't tell her a word about his plans : He said she was mistaken , he was not an abandoned derelict , he did n't need an old man 's home , he was too tired to talk and so he hung up on her . About then she got real spiteful . Clif would n't hear one word against you , she 'd never opened her mouth , but now with so much at stake , his safety , perhaps his life ? " Guy 's  | hands were stiff against his thighs , he drew a long breath and swallowed it in a gulp . " She made me so damned mad , all of a sudden I blew my top . " " About time . " ( There 's a virtue in the way an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you together again , all the bits of self you left hanging on brambles , lying under the wharf , or in the quarry lake . ) " I told her ? " ( Anice saw , dimly behind the severe , tense young man the little boy , face contorted , hands balled into angry fists ! The fullness of the brows , just over the eyelids , flushed as it had in childhood . ) " I told her she forgot herself , talking that way about my mother . All this bosh about poor Clif helpless and alone ! Who 'd stood by him day and night ? Not his daughter . Oh , she had a good alibi . Lorimer was buzzing around like a bluebottle . And I  --  I got out on a limb all right . " Guy 's tenseness dissolved , his body slumped , he slapped a hand against the back of his head , his mouth hung open an instant . " I told ' em Clif had a wife , did n't he ? And of course you were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Out on a limb , out on a limb , the silly phrase jigged through Anice 's head . When she looked at Guy she saw him sprawling , dangling , scrabbling before it let hint down , crashing in a litter of crumbled loyalty and pride . Shadowy behind him , Clif , watching with that bleak , remote darkness in his eyes . She could see uncertainty prying loose Guy 's grasp . Astonishingly , without volition , she laughed . " Oh , I wish I 'd heard you ! " she said . " Cripes ! " Guy 's head jerked sidewise to make sure he heard . " You 're not sore ? " " Oh , it 's wonderful . All these years I 've handled Marian with gloves , and now you take them off ! "
