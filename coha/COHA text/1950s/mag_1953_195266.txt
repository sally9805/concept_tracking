In a sort of shotgun wedding , Hollywood and television got together last week for the 25th annual presentation of Oscars . It was easy to predict who would wear the pants in the family . Master of Ceremonies Bob Hope , bowing to the cathode ray by wearing a blue dress shirt with his dinner jacket , cracked : " With Oscar 25 years old , it 's high time he got married . While it 's true he has a child bride , the kid is loaded . In fact , the bride 's father is picking up the tab . " ( The show cost the Radio Corp . of America $250,000 . ) <P> To the movie fans outside Hollywood 's RKO Pantages Theater , the show looked familiar : klieg lights crisscrossing the wet night sky and Cadillacs disgorging jeweled and ermined cargoes . But inside the palace , surrounded by TV cameras , zoomar lenses , floodlights and monitoring screens , the 2,800 top-drawer movie folk were acutely conscious that times had changed . <P> For the first time , some 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual event . The TV technicians , bossing the whole show , did a slick job of switching back &; forth between Hollywood and Manhattan 's International Theater , where a junior edition of the ceremonies was under way . All the cinema queens , some appearing for the first time on TV , looked as gorgeous as they ever did , but a few seemed to miss the careful direction they get in films . The cameras might have been less rigid ( the losers in the audience were ignored , even though Bob Hope had advised watching them : " You 'll see great understanding , great sportsmanship-great acting " ) . But the show was still fascinating in an unrehearsed , star-studded way . <P> Oscar for 1952 's " best actor " was presented in absentia to durable Gary Cooper for his performance as the cow-town marshal in High Noon . In Manhattan , Broadway 's Shirley Booth , whose slatternly housewife in Come Back , Little Sheba was her first screen role , stumbled excitedly up the steps to the stage . But the Hollywood audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk off with a well-deserved award for " best actress . " <P> Perhaps in a sentimental mood , the academy gave the Oscar for " best picture " to Cinema Pioneer Cecil B. DeMille , 71 , for his moneymaking circus extravaganza , The Greatest Show on Earth ( already No. 2 on Hollywood 's list of all-time big grossers ) . <P> Among other Oscar winners : <P> Best supporting actress : Gloria Grahame , for her southern belle in The Bad and the Beautiful . <P> Best supporting actor : Anthony Quinn for his desperado role in Viva Zapata ! <P> Best direction : John Ford for The Quiet Man ( his fourth Oscar ) . <P> Best foreign-language film : France 's Forbidden Games . <P> Best two-reel short subject : Walt Disney 's Water Birds ( Disney 's 18th Oscar ) .
