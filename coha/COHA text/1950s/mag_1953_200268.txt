In his round , paneled office atop the Manhattan headquarters of Webb &; Knapp , Real Estate Tycoon William Zeckendorf has three telephones , a bronze Matisse nude , but no windows . The reason , says the room 's designer , is that for a showman like Bill Zeckendorf " it would be ridiculous to create any environment for him other than one consisting exclusively of himself . " <P> In this environment , Zeckendorf is rarely diverted from dreaming up big and complicated real-estate deals . Last week he invited reporters into his office to disclose his biggest deal yet . He had just bought control from the Chrysler family of the famed , spire-topped Chrysler Building , its annex , the Chrysler Building East , and the nearby Graybar Building+ owned by Eastern Offices , Inc . Price : $52 million . It was the biggest office-building transaction in modern real-estate history , approached only by the sale of the Empire State Building for $51.5 million in 1951 . <P> In negotiating the labyrinthine stock transfer , more than 100 attorneys from a dozen leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the deal , Webb &; Knapp and Graysler Corp. , owned by Lazard Freres , investment bankers ( with a 25% interest in the transaction ) , got all the stock in the Chrysler Building and its annex plus the stock controlling the Graybar Building . The money came from $40 million worth of mortgage bonds taken by Equitable Life Assurance Society , $4,000,000 from J. P. Morgan &; Co. , $8,000,000 from Webb &; Knapp . <P> For Webb &; Knapp , the buildings , all fully rented , will bring in an estimated $2,000,000 a year before taxes . Moreover , says Zeckendorf , the skyscrapers will be more profitable under one control ; costs can be cut , possibly by a private power and heating plant for all three , and tenants can shift around more easily in the different buildings , according to their needs . He also plans to improve the buildings , starting out by air-conditioning the Chrysler and Graybar . <P> The Chrysler deal was not the only big deal for Zeckendorf last week . He also paid about $7,000,000 for Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , owned by Associated Dry Goods Corp. , which controls the Lord &; Taylor stores . He got the building , fixtures and equipment ( but not the inventory ) , began looking around for " a real big operator " to lease it to . At week 's end , he thought he had just the operator : Manhattan 's Ohrbach 's ( TIME , Dec. 13 , 1948 ) , a fast-growing Union Square store that has been thinking of moving uptown . The deal , said he , was " very close . " <P> <P> +The Chrysler Building , completed in 1929 for $16 million , is the worlds second highest ( 77 stories v. 102 in the Empire State Building ) . The 32-story Chrysler Building East , finished last year , cost $16 million . The 30-story Graybar Building was built in 1927 for $13.5 million .
