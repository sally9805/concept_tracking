A svelte blonde in a black sheath dress , with mink stole draped casually over her right arm , stopped during an inspection of a new apartment house on Los Angeles ' Wilshire Boulevard last week and gushed : " It 's the most gorgeous thing I 've ever seen . But , I mean , it 's even nicer than our house . " Near her , a trim , wavy-haired man gravely replied : " Thank you , madam . " For Norman Tishman , 56 , president of Manhattan 's Tishman Realty &; Construction Co. , the compliment was no surprise ; his company had planned the building to be the most luxurious cooperative apartment house in Los Angeles , with some units costing $125,000 . <P> From his new apartment building , Norman Tishman could look down Wilshire Boulevard toward five 13-story Tishman office buildings and the site of a projected 22-story Tishman office building in downtown Los Angeles . Such hustling has in the last few years made Tishman the biggest single landlord in Southern California , added to the firm 's reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities as well . <P> Uncut Diamonds . " We 're investment builders , creators , not land speculators , " says Tishman . " We buy for a specific purpose : to develop . " Tishman covers the whole spectrum of real estate , from buying and building to renting and managing . The company specializes in opening up new areas of cities , is often followed by other firms once it builds . " If you get there first , " says Tishman , " you find remarkably little competition . I first trust my instincts to pick the sites , then take a thorough economic survey . If the survey bears out my instincts , we go ahead . If not , I stick with the survey and forget my instincts . This is no business for guesswork . " <P> Though Tishman is based in New York , the firm has moved into such growing areas as Los Angeles because Tishman feels that development opportunities are about exhausted in Manhattan . " To me , " says Norman Tishman , " a piece of underdeveloped property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it as it is-I see it as it will look when it has been properly developed . " Today Tishman operates 31 large office or apartment buildings and three shopping centers in five U.S. cities ( including West Hempstead , L.I. ; New Orleans ; Philadelphia ) , has other buildings under construction in Cleveland and Buffalo . Tishman 's buildings win few architectural prizes , are often deplored by architects as unimaginative , even ugly . But they please tenants - and cut costs-because they lay heavy stress on economy of space , no-nonsense layouts . <P> Above 86th Street . The Tishman firm was started in 1898 by Norman Tishman 's father Julius , an immigrant peddler who turned to real estate to get money to educate his children . Julius Tishman built small tenements in downtown Manhattan until 1910 . Then he decided , against all advice , to erect a nine-story luxury apartment on Manhattan 's West 93rd Street , despite a tradition that no well-to-do New Yorker would live above 86th Street . The building was profitable , and Julius Tishman made his fortune by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .
