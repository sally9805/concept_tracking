The uprooting of Protestant missions in Colombia , many of them U.S.-sponsored , goes steadily on . Missionary Juan de Jess Varela reported last week that he had been haled before the military mayor of the village of Peque , and told that his services were a " mockery " to the Roman Catholic religion ; he got 24 hours to get out of town . In little Tamalameque twelve Protestants were convicted of " holding services " and given a choice of $4.20 fines or ten days in jail ( they chose jail sentences but were not held strictly to them ) . In the jailless hamlet of Colorado , two missionaries were held in stocks overnight on the parish priest 's charge that they had beaten and insulted him . The Division of Foreign Missions of the National Council of Churches reported last week in New York that in April alone , 30 churches were closed by government authorities . <P> <P> Though Colombia 's constitution guarantees religious freedom to " all cults that are not contrary to Christian morality , " anti-Protestantism appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the military government . President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla darkly links the Protestants with subversion . " International Communism , " he said early this year , " understands that in order to fight successfully in Colombia , it must first destroy as much as possible our religious unity . " The archbishop of Popayn , in a pastoral letter , frowned upon the " tenacious , deceitful and well-organized propaganda put out by apostles of the Protestant heresy among us . " <P> Less fanatical Colombians , too , doubtless resent instances of aggressive missionary proselytizing in Colombia , which overwhelmingly professes Catholicism . But they also deplore closing the missions , because the missionaries run useful hospitals and schools . Last month in tiny Noanam , two Protestant nurses were prevented by civil authorities from treating a sick Protestant child . And the current Foreign Missions ' report says that more than 200 Protestant schools have been closed in Colombia since 1948-to add to " 46 church buildings destroyed by fire or dynamite " and " 75 believers killed because of their religious faith .
