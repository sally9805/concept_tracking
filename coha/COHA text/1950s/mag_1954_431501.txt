 | We have passed through that period when the question re clothes was . " Must I put on something else ? Company wo n't care . Nobody looks at a child ? except to make improvements , of course . " " 1 look at you . And I think you 're perfect practically . " I would say gently . " hut today let 's have a kind of dress rehearsal for when you become ? well , civilized . " " Okay . " she used to say dolefully , " but can I wear the blue jeans ? " We did eventually become civilized , as far as clothes are concerned . It was a fearsome state . The clothes question . which used to be an unwelcome foundling on our doorstep , became the honored guest in our house . It had first place . Boo came clown late to breakfast , looking haggard from trying to decide which pearls , the large or the small . should go with the sweater . Or did I think the silver chain with the elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would plead . " I have only one kind . " I 'd say . " One-piece . " " No comedy , please . Now look : This ? or this ? " She 'd hold up each ornament in breathless suspense . If I could n't make up my mind instantly . with good substantiating reasons , we had to go through it several times . The same mountainous importance , naturally , was given to shoes , to scarf . to **29;842;TOOLONG . Life was a complex business . And shopping , up to the time of my invention , was delicious agony . Every item in her size was tried on thoughtfully and courteously . She could have closed her eyes and picked at random . After all . how can anything be unbecoming when one has blue eyes and golden hair and a figure that has every ounce accounted for ? ( And if an alien ounce sneaks in on the morning scales . it is routed by night like a pickpocket in Utopia . ) But to her . and to all her friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect swim suit or formal and all the others on earth . The aim seemed to be to try on as many of the others as possible before the one is found . Sometimes . when deciding which of two utterly @#  | perfects to buy ? well , you can imagine what usually happened then . " It would save you a shopping trip later , " she would say , always considerate , " and if you say so , I 'll just hang the extra one in the closet and not wear it until you say I definitely need a new one . Okay ? " We have been known to be guilty of three when we went to buy one . These were the Saturdays when she said , " Was n't our luck absolutely fab today ! I just love to shop with you , darling . " If we took a kibitzer on the trip , we naturally had to buy a little souvenir for her . Not a major item , of course . But a sweater she adored , or a handbag like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish not to think of someone else , " Boo always said afterward . " You would n't want me to be selfish , I 'm sure . " In spite of all this Boo never had a thing to wear . None of them had . When an occasion arose , everyone phoned everyone else and discussed the problem at length . I could hear Boo saying , " But I have n't a thing , Jane , absolutely nothing . My closet looks like Old Mother Hubbard 's . Speaking of O. M. H. , I suppose Connie will wear that bag her mother brought her from Paris . " Poor Connie . Her mother selects her clothes . BUT a while ago everything changed in our house . Because I had an inspiration so stunning and so wonder-working that I felt as if it should be marked " pat . pending . " Next time the fascinating and despotic clothes subject came up , which it did within the hour , I was ready with my invention . " Speaking of clothes ? we 're going to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathesome and sound , I expect . " " No . I think you 're going to like it . " " So ? Tell . " " I 've figured out how much we spend for your clothes a year . Hereafter we 're going to give it to you in monthly installments . " " You mean real live money ? " She uttered the electric word in a whisper . " I do n't mean hay , " I said , aiming at her language and missing it by a year or two . " Gosh . " She looked starry-eyed with awe and found nothing to say for quite a while . " You mean I 'll handle actual money ! In amounts you can see with a naked eye ? " " The thing is , you 've got to plan your spending , " I said . " If you know you 're going to need a large item ? say , a winter coat ? you 'll have to go lightly on buying , to be ready for it . I should draw up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said politely . " If I 'm going to manage it , I 'd better do it . " " It will give you fine experience , so when your have your own family ? " Right there was where I made my big mistake . For when we talk about her family of the future , the present always fades into dwarfed insignificance . " My husband will be proud of the way I handle his money , " she said , with that lovely guilelessness her " husband " always brings out in her . " Exactly . Anybody can spend money . But the really smart woman ? " @#  | " Say no more , " she said , for she was already making a list and crossing things off and scribbling in improvements . Before she went to bed , she had drawn up an elaborate spending plan and set up books to handle the checks coming and going each month . There was nothing simple about this ; it was double-entry bookkeeping ? triple entry , in fact , for there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's check sent her whole gang out shopping . I shuddered to think . She was quite capable of shooting the works on a new sweater for everybody ? " just to get things started right. ? But I completely misjudged her . She would have been capable of it , on my money . But this money was a different breed . It was hers . This was real live money , which screamed with pain if you touched it carelessly . This was money that bruised easily if you came too near . They all came home looking grim . " Your child is a monster , " Jane said . " Presents for nobody . Not even light refreshments . " " Naturally not , " Miss Boo said . " Refreshments are not wearing apparel . " Sally said sheepishly , " On me they are . A heavy layer between my bones and my underwear . " " What did you buy ? " I asked , realizing that from now on things would be different in this house . " One very sensible slip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces , " Boo said defensively . " The way it does on the slips I buy . " " Exactly , " she said . " I do n't think lace is appropriate for a schoolgirl . I expect to have a few lace-trimmed slips in my trousseau , which naturally I assume you 'll provide when the time comes . Or do I have to start saving for that ? " " Not the way things look at the moment , " I said mercilessly . They each gave a rancid smile at that , as well they might , for nothing seems so heavy-handed as a grownup trying to be funny in the presence of the young . The tailored slip covered the first month 's buying . " I do n't seem to need very much , " Boo said innocently . " I seem pretty well outfitted at the moment . " THE next month Boo looked at swim suits , and they were a terrible temptation . But the old white one was still pretty good , and the best one could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The month passed without a purchase . Not without shopping . But without buying . I took the matter in hand now . I went with her on the next shopping trip . She tried on lovely things as always and made the most of her brief reflection in the mirror . But nothing was completely irresistible . The salesperson , I thought , looked a bit fed-up . I stole out of the dressing room and apologized to her . " Think nothing of it . They all try on everything ! " she said wearily . " But at least you 're in there pitching for a sale . " Pitching or no pitching , we left without a purchase . " I 'm frightfully sorry , " Miss Boo said pleasantly to the limp saleswoman . " They 're all charming . But nothing seems to look just right on me . " When we were outside , before I had a chance to scold her , she said meekly , " But you would n't want me to buy something that was n't perfect , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Not quite , " she said , trying to keep the honest regret out of her voice . " Besides it makes such a difference when what you 're spending is money . " " I ca n't seem to remember what it was we used to spend , " I said mildly . " That was just that green stuff grownups sling around for people they love , " she said with a twinkle . " But kids ' money is practically sacred . " NEXT month I mentioned pajamas . " Who 'd waste money on clothes nobody sees , " she said with finality . " Anyway I 've matched up the green tops with the yellow-striped bottoms . They 're not legally married , but they 're very happy . " Ignoring this , I said , " And of course you 'll need something rather special for the faculty tea . Last year I got you the taffeta skirt with the gold nylon blouse . " " Ideal for this year , " she said . " No people would see it . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything this month ? " I thought we might as well get the cards on the table . " My husband would n't approve , " she said . " Not while I have all that silly stuff you bought me . " Her money began piling up . " I get dizzy when I think of it , " she said . " I expect I 'll be able to help start my husband in business or something . " Each month she enters the sum in her book , and there it stays intact . " My frozen assets , " she calls them , " and do they keep me warm ! " Every Saturday she goes shopping , and when she comes home , she has a list of things she could have bought but has n't . " To torture yourself ? " " No . Just to be sure I 've still got some taste . " After five or six months I began getting positively ashamed of her . " What do people think ? That we 're just too mean to dress you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . The ones that matter , " she said . " Anybody can spend money . It takes strong character to resist it . That 's what you always told me . I belong to Spendthrifts Anonymous . The way to be sober is not to spend the first dollar . " " You 'll have to spend some next month , " I said sternly . " You need a new raincoat , a dress for Sunday school , new shoes , and a skirt . " " Who looks at anybody in the ' rain ? " she asked feebly , skipping the rest . " Never mind that . I 'm warning you . " " Okay , " she said agreeably . " I 'll shop next Saturday . " " I 'll come with you . " Her face congealed in horror . " You would n't like the places I patronize , " she said . " Very low altitude . Basement , in fact . " She came home from.the trip beaming . As she burst through the door , she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope so . Raincoat ? Shoes ? " " Well , not exactly , " she hedged . " I got something for you . A scarf . Marked down . " " And for you ? " " Well , I 'll tell you . " She always begins this way when she wishes to evade the issue . " I looked and looked . But to tell you the truth , nothing looks so good on me as ? money . " I could see by the convulsed merriment in her face that she was thinking about her " husband " and hoping that when he arrives , he will read the rich fine print of her hard-earned shabbiness.
