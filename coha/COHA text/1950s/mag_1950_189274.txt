Quartz crystals are harder to grow than the tenderest orchids . How nature does it is not exactly known , and nature does not produce enough big , perfect crystals to provide electrical manufacturers with the quartz slices they need to control radio frequencies , etc . <P> Early man-made quartz crystals were too small to be useful . During World War II the Germans did better , but not well enough . Last week Dr. Albert C. Walker of the Bell Telephone Laboratories told a gathering of scientists in Ithaca how Bell engineers had improved the German process until it grows quarter-pound crystals in only two weeks . <P> The Bell crystals are grown in thick-walled steel " bombs " filled with a water solution of alkaline material ( see diagram ) . At the bottom is a layer of finely ground quartz ( silica ) . A small quartz crystal ( it may be only a sliver ) is suspended near the top . When the bottom of the bomb is heated to 750F. , and the pressure raised to 15,000 Ibs. per sq . in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution . When they reach the cooler top of the chamber , they deposit one by one on the " seed , " building it into a perfect , transparent crystal which is more uniform , and therefore more useful , than any made by nature .
