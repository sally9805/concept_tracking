I was walking down the main street of our town about five years ago when . l came face to face with the wife of the village barber , whom I had n't seen for quite a while . She surveyed my burgeoning midriff with alarm , and instead of saying hello or complaining about the weather ? our usual sure-fire conversation piece ? she said with disgust and some asperity , " Virginia ! What 'd you go and do that for ? You had a nice family . " There was so much accusation in her voice that I almost found myself apologizing for my forthcoming fourth child and overlooking the brashness of her remark . Yet this woman 's attitude is not unusual . In fact , it reflects the average person 's reaction to the reproduction of more than two or three offspring and also the rather common practice of intruding on the most personal part of one 's private life ? the begetting of children . It is taken for granted that the dewy-eyed couple who have just exchanged marital vows have life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the insurance companies , the savings banks , and the " planned " parents , much as they would get a route from the AAA to drive to Florida . In our case ? and in many other cases ? nothing could be farther from the truth , because we have always strictly ad-libbed and never followed a script This deviation has caused us to  | become curiosities at parties , P.T.A meetings , and radio studios , where our birth rate causes more quacking that the H-bomb or the FBI roundup c American traitors . This inordinate interest in our progeny began in January , 1936 , the day after our engagement was announced in if St. Louis papers . The nuptial couch westill unreserved in our honeymoon hotel . and the only tiny garments I had on my . mind at that particular time were wisp : bits of black chiffon trimmed with lace That evening Woody , my future husband came for dinner , enraged after lunching with an elderly male relative ( his who toasted us and then put down hi glass firmly and said emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won. - have any children ? certainly not for years . " Woody stomped out , leaving his bewildered host with the untouched blueplate special and a very large piece of his mind . THIS was only the beginning . Severe weeks before the wedding an aura ( mine ) who lived at a great distanc and whom we had n't seen for year popped in , ostensibly for a peek at th trousseau and a gander at the groon but actually on a secret mission . Born is the nineties , she was titillated , not by if orange blossoms , white satin , and veil but by the twentieth century 's contributions to matrimony ? birth control planned parenthood , and the twin bec which she considered the greatest invention since the wheel . This I discovere one evening when she quietly cam into my room as I was dressing for a party . She shut the door very gently . and with the furtive look of an agent. - about to unload a cache of heroin she tiptoed over to me and whispere stealthily , " Virginia ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sit down - Virginia . " Fascinated with the possibility of discovering some family skeleton that hadn'tbeen paraded out of the closet , obediently sat on the bed and watched her . She cleared her throat and , with flushed face and shining eyes , leane toward me and blurted out . " Do yo-. know ? about ? limiting your family ? You know you do n't have to have children . Virigina . " Breathing hard , she stoppe and waited to see what effect her wore would have on me . I explained to her as kindly as I could that Woody and I had a firm conviction that children were a part of marriage . but I did n't have the heart to tell her that we also thought it was nobody else 's business . Her face fell like a windless balloon . The next morning she left or . an early train , her mission a failure which grew more colossal with each succeeding child . So we were mairried , and a year an a day later our first son arrived . ( During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised eyebrows in the various - cities in which we lived by saying happily to new friends of ours , " I was born the day after Daddy and Mommy were married . " ) We received the customary felicitations on the appearance of a firstborn , and everybody seemed pleases : because we were following the traditions .  | pattern of Mollie and me , and baby makes three . When the second son arrived eighteen months after the first , we discovered we were out of order on two counts . First , it seems , there is supposed to be a minimum of two years between children . Or so I was informed by several starchy matrons , who assured me that " everybody knew that . " In addition to our second child 's not waiting the prescribed two years , he was a boy instead of a girl , thus violating the unwritten law of what constitutes the typical American family . The ideal unit , I believe , as pictured in vacation , cereal , and automobile advertisements , is a father , a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily together at the deep blue yonder . And here we 'd got a repeater ! Quite a few people dropped into my hospital room and , instead of sharing my enthusiasm over my new little son , leaned over the bed , much as though it were a bier , and said , " Is n't it too bad , Virginia ? Another boy . I hope you 're not too disappointed . " The first few times I thought they were kidding , but it happened so often I finally realized that many were quite serious and felt very sorry for us . Some of these sympathizers said , with an air of finality , " Well , anyway , you have a nice family now , and the two boys will be company for each other as they grow up . " A few added thoughtfully , " But you 'll find how lonely you 'll be when they get married , because boys always go with their wives and girls stick to their mothers . " I do n't know which made me madder ? the tacit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family or the picture of a child sticking to me the rest of its life . WE bagged the legal limit when our third son arrived , in Toronto , in 1940 . Fortunately for my blood pressure we were across the border and did n't know enough people to have too many dropping in to commiserate with me . Canadians , anyway , are a more reticent lot , and the ones we knew held themselves admirably in check during my pregnancy . In fact , our next-door neighbor had bowed stiffly to us but never had uttered a word from Christmas Eve , when we moved into our house , until two weeks before the baby 's arrival , in August . Then she leaned over the garden fence as I was bending , with great difficulty , to pick some sweet William and zinnias , and she said quite simply ; " Will it be soon ? " I said , " Two weeks . " With a satisfied smile , she nodded and went quickly back into her house . We did n't have another word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During this period we began to have a taste of what the future held . Woody , who is a radio producer and not easily thrown off balance , and I were entertained a great deal in Toronto , and we thoroughly enjoyed it ; but we sometimes quailed at the line the introductions took . Whenever we were presented to strangers by someone who knew us , our friend would unfailingly say , " I do want you to meet Virginia and Woody Klose . They have three boys ! Three ! Think of it ! And all boys ! " Then everybody would ignore us in the ensuing amazement and interchange over this phenomenon .  | It took our fourth son to put us really the big-league-quiz class . Everybody go into the act . The questions flew aster than a Senate investigating committee 's and ranged from our income , our nervous systems , our monthly meat bills , the sixty-four-dollar one , " What are ) u trying to do , a Bing Crosby ? " By 1947 , when I joined the staff of riters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Motherhood " was my trade-mark . In this program , planned for the homemaker and covering the whole domestic front ? from how to scallop a cucumber : a what to do with Junior on a rainy ay ? I became something of a minor miracle . The reason was so simple . I acrally ran a household and had children , o marks that make you a woman of distinction on any homemaker 's show , a great many of the ladies involved n this field live alone in small apartments . This fact came home to me quite forcibly at the first staff meeting we had , hen the brass invited us into the conrence room . As I looked around at . e Lilly Daches and the Hattie Carnegies : id smelled the heady perfume , I wonered how we were going to make connect with Mrs. America out there beyond le blue horizon , with her cookies , her : ds , and her plastic apron . At this point , one of the high command tied us with a professional eye , took it her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rls , remember there are just three things women are vitally interested in. iod ? dogs ? " Her voice trailed off as e vainly searched for number three . Everyone sat mouse quiet , and when e silence got as thick as cheese , I ventured , " Children ? " Why , Jinny , that 's exactly right ! " the ly said , beaming . I was made . Five days a week we had a guest ! ebrity on our show , and five days a week I was exhibited as the staff writer : th four sons . This bit of information never seemed to impress Lucille Ball , Mel Torme , Faye Emerson , or , in fact , anybody who ever heard it , but it was Thought to lend a cozy touch to a show : ned at the homemaker . As a result , I got all the hearts-and-flowers scripts Mother 's Day , Father 's Day , the Fourth of July . They were my meat . I was a mother ? with " feeling . " Once I did manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a run of one of his plays , and when I looked at that great big handsome guy with the sea-blue eyes , I remember a distinct feeling . And it definitely was n't maternal . The delivery room ended my writing career on the Betty Crocker program , but by that time Woody and I were broadcasting a five-day-a-week husband-and-wife show over the Mutual network from our farm , and our fifth child came into the world with a bigger audience than any of the four previous ones had had . On Friday we left our listeners with a " will it be a boy or girl ? " cliff , which probably was the only real one that ever closed a Friday show in the history of radio . On Monday the stork 's wings could be heard brushing our chimney from Hollywood to New York . On Tuesday morning , when we broadcast from my hospital room , we could hardly find our voices to tell our listeners we had a bouncing baby ? girl ! This sealed our fate . Now we knew we i were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be sporting and answer all corners . Then , too , after all the years of , preparation , we found it easier to face the quiz masters . This event also signaled our progression from the Bing Crosby to the Eddie Cantor class ? if that 's progression . And , astonishingly enough ? such is radio 's power ? the event had some influence on other people 's birth rate . Letters came in from many women saying they had decided to have a baby , too . One after a lapse of twelve years since the last child . We heard nothing from her husband or next of kin . We had our sixth child several months ago , and the cry from friends and neighbors was " Six kids ! What are you trying to do ? a Don Ameche ? " But someone dared me with the real show-stopper : " Six children ! Now are you going to stop ? " I looked him straight in the eye and said , " What ? Only two ?
