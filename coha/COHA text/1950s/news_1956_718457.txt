txt Government officials forecast a downturn in the cost of living for December and possibly January and February after the third straight month of increase . The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the November index rose 0.1% to a new record high of 117.8% of the 1947-49 average . But B.L.S. Commissioner Ewan Cleve said discounts now appearing on 1957 cars and declining meat and clothing prices were expected to outweigh increases in other items and force down the total index level for December . Mr. Clague said the expected downturn will be slight because a number of factors will be tending to counteract these declines . Fuel prices , which were up 1.1% in November , will head higher , he said . The recent freight rate ' increase given to the nation 's railroads also will have a " broad effect , " he said . The impact will be not so much in the rates themselves , he said , but in their influence on " many other items . " Steel Waive Boost The November index rise brought a three cent an hour wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to build up new pressure for a steel price boost . Some industry sources have said a price hike might be pegged to the steel workers costof-living increase . In addition to 650,000 steel workers , some 250,000 other factory employes got pay increases Industries affected were aluminum , can and steel fabricating , which have contracts similar to steel , and some meat packing and aircraft workers . The steel wage increase is based on the increase in the index since June . The figure then was 116.2 . B.L . S. indicated the chief reason the November index was not higher was discounting of 1957 cars by auto dealers . Mr. Clague said the discounting appeared to be more widespread and showed up slightly earlier than last year . The discounts offset November new car price increases , which went up only 1.8% as newer models came on the market . The discounts had not been reflected in the October index . New car prices in October went up 11% . Mr. Clague said he thought " people have become used to discounts now . The consumer expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal price ( than the list price ) . " B.L.S. aides said they could n't see that the discounts were the result of buyer resistance . They credited industry competition . These officials also said the discounting , while spread over most of the country , seemed to be concentrated near the big centers where competition is stiffer . However , B.L.S. said they could not say how much the discounts were . The only cars which are taken into account in the consumer price index are Chevrolet , Ford and Plymouth . Mr. Clague said lie thought the index had absorbed almost all of the auto list price increases and now ought to show the effect in any discounting by a downturn in this part of the cost of living gauge . He said he thought the discounting would be one factor working for a lower December index level . Any increase in steel prices . Mr. Clague said , would not show up in autos right away since car makers will be using lower priced steel already on hand " for another one or two quarters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November was food . It fell 0.2% , B.L.S. said , but this was not enough to counter-balance rises in all the other major groups of goods and services . Prices on other items also went up during the month . In the housing index , which went up 0.25 , rents and house-furnishings rose . Prices on some appliances were slightly lower . Movie admission prices and the cost of television sets also rose , and prices Of newspapers in a few cities also advanced , B.L.S. said . So did the cost of professional services in the medical care index . Prices on prescriptions and drugs were also up . Workers ' Buying Power However , B.L.S. said factory workers ' buying power has more than kept pace with the rise in the cost of living . Net spendable earnings of factory workers and the buying power of these earnings both rose to new highs in November , the agency said . For a worker with three dependents , B.L.S. said , net spendable earnings rose 17 cents in November to ; $75.20 a week . The previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory worker , net spendable earnings were $67.79 in November against the previous record of $55.54 last December . In terms of ' purchasing power . B.L.S. said , the factory worker 's take-home pay in November could buy about 1% more goods and services than a year ago even though retail prices went up 2.4%.
