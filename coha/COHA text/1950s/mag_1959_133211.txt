I like wild ducks only when they 're tender and juicy and well done , " explained pretty Mrs. Willard Van Beuren King of St. Louis , as she began the preparation of a most unusual game dish . " So I brown them first very thoroughly , and then I cook them for a long time in a Dutch oven with lots of good things . This enrages the sportsmen who like ' bloody duck , ' of course . But when the bird is cooked this way , even the legs come out tender and edible . " At serving time the dish proved to be a creation of cheflike finesse . // Mrs. King , whose given name is Frances , has always been called Fauvette , a French word that means warbler . And like a songbird , this Fauvette loves to greet the dawn in the open air . On many days of the local duck season , sunrise finds her attired in padded shooting clothes , hip boots and a raccoon cap , slogging through the " gumbo " mud of Dardene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duckblind with her husband Van . // Dardene Prairie is the long , low spit of primitive floodland  --  most of it . privately owned  --  that lies between the Missouri and the Mississippi rivers . Here each year thousands of waterfowl  --  mallard , sprig , teal , blackjack , redhead , wood duck and Canada goose  --  interrupt their southern migration to feast on hundreds of acres of millet and smartweed . When Dardene Prairie 's feeding grounds are depleted and its chain of diked ponds frozen hard , the birds and many of the St. Louis marksmen move south together to that next stop along the Mississippi flyway , the shooting grounds of Arkansas . // All this is the spice of life to Fauvette , who acquired a taste for shooting from her sports-minded parents , the Virgil Lewises ( her mother was at one time skeet champion of Missouri ) . But equally rewarding are her culinary triumphs . She was born with flair , has cooked for 18 years and has become a real maestra in the kitchen . Homemade bread  --  a favorite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? are commonplaces in this household . And though the Kings have plenty of help in their large , comfortable house on Washington Terrace , Fauvette herself cooks for all the dinner parties she gives . // Often served to guests at this time of year is her wonderful duck preparation . On the day I was there she made it with mallard . I have since tried out the recipe for an unexpected party of 10 , with a mixed bag of birds , to wit , one golden pheasant , one mallard duck , a partridge and  --  three store-bought squabs . The dish was an unqualified success . It seems likely that this recipe could even transform Arctic ptarmigan or capercaillie into genuine delicacies . I only regret that I did n't have it in my possession when a friend one time persuaded me to cook , as well as eat , crow . // WILD DUCK A LA FAUVETTE ( serves four ) // 2 wild ducks 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons sherry 2 tablespoons tomato paste 3 tablespoons flour 1 ? cups strong bouillon ? cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black pepper ? pound mushrooms , sliced 1 bay leaf 2 cups cooked wild rice , molded in custard cups // Clean , pluck and singe the ducks . Remove and discard wings . Halve neatly with poultry shears , and cut out the backbone completely . ( Scissors will be useful , too , to cut through the skin without tearing. ) // Melt butter in Dutch oven . Brown the four halves of duck in this , turning often , till they are very dark brown . Now pour sherry over them . In a moment or two remove the duck pieces temporarily and stir the pot briskly to amalgamate the sherry with the " browning . " Lower heat and stir in the tomato paste . Sift in the flour gradually , stirring with a whisk to insure smoothness . Gradually whisk in the bouillon ( warmed previously ) , the seasoning and the red wine . Bring smooth mixture to the boiling point and return duck pieces to the pot . Add sliced mushrooms and bay leaf . Cover pot and cook over very low heat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platter , placing them so they are well separated . Keep them warm . Strain , then degrease the sauce ( a quick way to do this is to pour it into a thin saucepan set in a bowl of ice cubes and ice water ; the fat that rises to the surface can then be spooned off ) . Reheat the sauce over brisk fire . Unmold hot , cooked wild rice between duck halves on platter . Spoon some hot sauce over each duck section . Garnish with a border of red , spiced crabapples.
