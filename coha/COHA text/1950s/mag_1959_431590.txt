 | Part IV : TOMMY ARMOUR MY BRAINS-AND YOUR MUSCLES ! ' This is the last of four lessons on how to play a golf course , adapted from the full-length book " A Round of Golf with Tommy Armour , " which has just been published by Sion and Schuster ( $3.50 ) . Bill , a mediocre golfer who had come so discouraged by his game that he was about to uit forever , was persuaded by Armour to try one final round as his partner in a friendly foursome . Tommy told Bill that the real reason he was so bad was because he did n't use his brains on a golf course . Bill agreed to try a round in which he used his muscles , but Tommy did the thinking for him . After some early heartbreaks and some triumphs , Bill was playing better than ever before . On the eighth , a long par 4 , Bill faded his second shot into the rough short of the green . He pulled a nine-iron out of his bag . Tommy was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to clear the bunker guarding the green . DESPITE my fears , Bill played this one as it should be played . He took an open stance , with the ball off he right foot and his weight accented , n his left foot . When you do this and keep the left arm straight as you 're swinging , the wrists hinge pretty much automatically . Something else that Bill did right was hitting down at the ball so the loft of the club face could smack the ball up . He also made the club go through the shot and toward the flag . The ordinary hacker digs into the ground behind the ball and stops hitting . There is hope but no purpose to that sort of a shot . Bill 's shot was quite an achievement . If he 'd missed it the error would have been caused by one of those mysterious frailties of man for which there is no accounting . But the procedure in this case was as perfect as one could expect . The ball went about 25 feet past the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intelligently played . It has been given a chance . Let me repeat something I 've said and written many times for the continued ? 1959 BY THOMAS D. ARMOUR SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IOS ; l 19.19 51  | benefit of 98 c of golfers : Do n't worry about applying " stop " to approach shots but think about hitting them up to or past the hole . Usually golfers forget that the high trajectory of shots made with the short clubs will cut down distance . On shots made with eight- or nineirons or wedges you 'd better shoot much brain capacity as the greatest golfers ? maybe more ? but you still have n't much of an idea how to employ your brains in playing golf . " For years I have been seeing 75-shooting professionals and amateurs who know how to hit the ball but who do n't know much more about how to play golf than I know about atomic fission . Any unusual problem of tactics or competitive pressure defeats for the flag rather than for the hole . He lined up his putt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head or body moving . The ball stopped only a couple of inches away and on the proper side of the hole . He tapped that short one in and glowed with satisfaction as he stood up with the ball in his hand . " I 'll make no complaints about picking up that 5 ; the champions do n't do it much better , " he boasted . " Comparatively , you played the hole better than many experts , " I told him . " That hole , with the wind against you , is a par 5 for your kind of golf . Now do you know how you got it or was it just a case of heaven helping you five times in succession ? " Bill vehemently declared , " Certainly I know how I got that par . I played five perfectly hit shots . " I put my hand on his shoulder . " Take it easy , champ . And let me tell you you 've confirmed what I suspected . You 've still got a lot to learn , so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main objectives . " " Which are ? " asked Bill . " First , to hit fewer bad shots and , second , to learn to use correctly the shots that you do know how to play . Both purposes are more matters of mentality than they are of muscle . I would say that you probably have as these fellows , who are solely mechanics at the game . Times without number I have seen young men on practice tees ? tournament circuit contestants ? who can hit shots as well as any golfer I 've ever seen but who ca n't pass the rigorous tests of playing . I also have seen older and more notable golfers who have failed in critical situations , not really because of luck being against them , but because of lack of mental keenness required in the fell clutch of circumstance . SHOTS THROWN AWAY Most of the 75s that I have looked at ( including my own ) have included at least three shots , and generally five , that were absolutely thrown away by thinking wrong or by not thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth tee we were showing the strain . I 'd been carrying the thinking responsibilities on the odd holes and Bill had enjoyed a mental recess then . On the even holes , where Bill was supposed to think for himself , I continued to examine and apply remedies to the mental part of the play , so I did n't get any letup . Furthermore , I had to provide Bill and the other boys with a good example and did n't dare allow myself any lapses in concentration . I did n't want Bill to take golf brutally hard but I did want him to learn to play golf with an active and educated mind instead of mere ! , : walking around and pounding a stick at a ball senselessly . Without being consciouE of it I 'd possibly been a bit too sharp with Bill . That had n't made things easier for either one of us but we both were lucky in understanding each other . Bill realized that he represented a challenge to my pride in showing myself and him that I was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bill , like so many other very successful businessmen , had been pampered at his golf . He had n't been taught sternly so he would be encouraged to learn something by himself . Instead he had fallen into the custom of depending on a professional who had been attempting the impossible job of nursing him into command of a first-class game . From being a fellow who 'd wanted to quit the game and who had to be almost shanghaied to the first tee , Bill now had become cocky and avid . His cheering performances on the sixth and eighth holes had given golf a new look to him . Here at the ninth tee he stood like stout Cortez with eagle eyes as he stared at a 520-yard hole . The wind was pushing into him . With distance , wind , a narrow fairway bordered by bunkers on the right , and a green tightly trapped all united against him , Bill began to realize that he was up for a harsh examination . He shook his head . " What do you think about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think . You 've played two fine holes out of eight so far , now see if you can play two consecutively . " " Yeah , but this is the toughest par 5 on the course . " " I know it . I can read the distances on the card . " " The fifth is a bit longer . But look at those bunkers . They do n't show on the card but my clubs can see them . " " The only help I 'll give you right now is to mention to you that at long holes it has been the habit of boobs for centuries to hit the ball hard , and for the same centuries and at the same long holes the experts have hit the ball easy . I can tell you from my own experience that I have made a considerable amount of money and won a collection of important championships by hitting the ball easy .  | Now , off with you into the wild blue yonder . " Bill studied the layout to get an idea of the target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best percentage prospect of success . Obviously he was having trouble making up his mind what to do . I could n't stand the suspense . " Stay away from trouble and remember that , as long as it looks , you can reach it with three easy four-wood shots . If I direct you any more and you get a par 5 here you wo n't feel as though you had achieved it independently . So get to work all by yourself . If you do n't want to do that , why do n't you pick up the ball and walk in ? " Then Bill stepped up to the ball , waggling his club . His grip looked good and appeared to be loose enough so he could get a lot of spring from his hands into the shot . He teed the ball wisely , a bit lower than for a drive in which oncoming wind was n't a factor : At that point he very plainly began to freeze . He shuddered in a manner that I imagine he hoped would be a forward press and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " Bill jerked his swing to a halt , then turned to me in relief . " What did you stop me for ? " " Because I did n't want you to tear yourself apart , hitting the ball 340 yards . The ball would n't have gone that far . You 'd have hit it about 140 yards to the right or hammered it right on top . But you would have wrenched every muscle in your body @# He went back to the ball and took his stance , thinking about his swing rather than the narrowness of the fairway and the length of the hole . He 'd just hurdled a mental block . He turned in an excellent , smooth swing . He almost seemed to be relaxed and that 's an extraordinary thing for an average golfer who is hitting a shot into the wind . Usually they are grim and inflexible . His hand action at the bottom of @# and have done practically nothing to the ball . Now , go to it again and swing moderately . And when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting , in the name of St. Andrew , hit ! Throw both your hands into the hit and do it as fiercely as you know how . But up to that point , take it easy . The easier you hit this ball the farther it 's going to go . " Bill listened studiously . the swing was fast . When you do n't hurry to whip your hands into the shot but have the intention of smashing the ball with a right-hand uppercut your hands will work exactly as they should . The back of your left hand and the palm of your right hand will bring the club face , going at top speed , correctly against the ball and keep it there , compressed , for this allimportant fraction of a second that tells the story of direction and distance of the shot . The result of the stinging whip of the ball was a 210-yard drive , much better than Bill expected , and mighty good for a better golfer than Bill , hitting into the wind . " Partner , I 'm proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell people you know me , " I applauded Bill . I felt almost as good about the shot as he did . Bill grinned and bowed . When we got to Bill 's drive it was far enough down the fairway to give him the unique problem of keeping his second shot short of the crossbunkering . The bunkers were so far ahead there was only a remote chance of carrying them with another shot hit nearly as well as the drive Bill had just made . But still there was a temptation to try , so a fellow could say in the locker room later , " My second flew over the cross-bunkers on the ninth . " Bill shoved Satan behind him and hit a graceful , unforced shot with a four-wood . The brainwashing I 'd given him about dismissing the impulse to hit hard had worked . The ball went like an arrow straight down the fairway and stopped in front of the trap . With 140 yards to go , Bill took out a seven-iron . I knew he would pick the wrong club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accustomed to getting and he did n't judge this shot correctly . I could hardly blame him ; he was in a location that was new to him after two shots . Under normal conditions , a good lie and no wind , a seven-iron in the hands of an average golfer is good for 120 to 130 yards . With a breeze fluttering the flag toward us , Bill 's seveniron definitely was n't the club to use . It would cost him one of the several strokes with which the average golfer penalizes himself every round by thoughtless choice of clubs . Bill played the shot beautifully for him . It was n't a shot to excite Hogan or Snead or to arouse the envy of Palmer , Finsterwald or Venturi but , outside of there not being enough of it , it was a class-A shot . He had a bit of luck , too . His ball must have hit a hard spot . It took a big bounce , then kept hopping toward the green . The fairway to the apron of the 53  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairway length . A bit closer to the green and a putter would have been the approach club for Bill . I was afraid he was going to use his putter ? and he actually hauled it out of his bag . Then he took another look at the short stretch of fairway between his ball and the green and decided that the turf was a little too long for rolling the ball . He gave his putter to his caddie and took out a six-iron . I sighed in relief . At this stage I was more apprehensive than Bill . Maybe Bill was n't As we walked toward the clubhouse Bill was exultant and bouncing . Reaction to the exertion of thinking at golf had n't hit him yet . I was tired but jubilant , too , at having performed a minor miracle ? with the help of a golf ball and club I had brightened a man 's future . Golf has done wondrously well by me . My responsibility is to do as well as I can by golf . Helping Bill gave me an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the clubhouse Bill sagged in his chair . He sighed , " Tommy , only nine holes and I never was so tired in my life . " I moistened my larynx . " That 's the @# bothered at all . I hoped so . I was wondering if I 'd told him , somewhere along the line , a peculiar thing about these delicate short shots : The grip must be firmer than on the other shots . There 's no lash to these shots but a short , firm , precise smack , delivered smoothly . Bill took an open stance with the ball off his right toe . His hands were close to his body . His right elbow was close to his ribs . His head was almost over the ball . He held the club at the lower part of the grip . Bill made a short backswing . There was only a fraction of a break in his wrists . He hit the ball crisply , and when he finally turned his head to look at the shot with his left eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only thing the ball could do . It had been hit neatly and crisply , like a long putt , with a club with some loft to it , and it had to shoot through the air in a low arc until it hit the green , then , with its overspin , roll along the line to the hole . He had a six-inch putt for his par 5 . I holed a tricky six-footer for mine . All that was needed after Bill 's feat of playing the hardest hole on the course the easy way , by using his head , was for him to ask me if there was any help he could give me with my game . penalty you have to pay for unique labor with your head on that nine . After you have trained yourself to think at golf you will enjoy the game more and it will be less work for you . " " At that , I 've never enjoyed nine holes more in my life , " Bill said . " That goes for me too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea there was so much more to golf than hitting the ball . " Jim stared at his empty glass as though he were looking at a crystal ball . He came out of his trance and remarked , " I 've played a lot of golf and I 've played a lot of other games . I 've hunted and fished all over the whole damn world . But until I listened this afternoon I never had an idea how much fun and what selfexamination a game could be . " " Maybe I did n't do you any good . You may feel ashamed of yourself when you play a stupid shot from here in , " I replied . " That 's true , but think of how elated I will be when I outbrain a golf ball , " Jim retorted . Jim and Ed had been in on a pass in the arrangement I 'd made to take Bill as a partner . I was glad to hear they 'd benefited from being in the bleachers but I was concerned only with determining whether I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his score I decided that I had succeeded better than I had anticipated . In nine holes Bill had gained knowledge that is power and had got basic training in how to apply that learning . He had learned , I trusted , a grew deal about how to simplify golf , an , : that 's a very tough subject to handle . His card was nothing wonderful ? 583564355=44 ? but even with that 8 on the second it was strokes better than he 'd been scoring for the nine . The way he was playing now . using his head as well as his muscles . I felt he had a good chance to crack 40 on the back nine . As I reflected on my experience with Bill I reached the conclusion that the best thing I 'd done for Bill was to show him how to help himself . The test of my efforts for and with him would come when he was playing without me and he 'd have to work out his own combination of mechanics and mentality . Would he begin to survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ? Or would he backslide to the original sin of the duffer ? totter stiffly at the shot , take a swing that would be too long or too jerky and short , have every muscle as stiff as a wire and throw his body at the ball ? He showed signs of learning the very hard job of hitting the ball easily . He did n't realize that he had passed a revealing test on that point when he played the ninth . He was a bit tired , and in that condition fatigue pushes a fellow into trying to hit harder , when he should keep his body steady and hit easier but faster with his hands . After the third quick application of painkiller I began to think there might have been so much progress made in nine holes that Bill would expect perfection from now on . He and the other fellows were starting to talk profoundly about the game . Every golfer is an expert in the club 's grillroom . Presently Bill gave marching orders . " Come on , boys , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up from their chairs . I stayed sitting . " Go to it , fellows , and good luck . I 've just played 900 holes ? nine outside and 891 inside my skull . I am tired . Include me out . Thanks for a pleasant game . And for your money , too , when you get around to paying Bill and me. "
