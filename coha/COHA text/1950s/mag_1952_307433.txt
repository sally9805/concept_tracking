Britain 's dean of portrait painters is a fierce-looking , bearded 75-year-old named Augustus John . In his long life he has been almost everywhere , has known and painted practically everyone he considered worth knowing , and he loves to talk about it . Having finally arrived at what he lightly calls the " Halfway House " of life , John thought it was time to get his memories in print . Next week his book will be on sale in U.S. shops . Chiaroscuro : Fragments of Autobiography ( Pellegrini &; Cudahy : $5 ) is indeed one of the most fragmentary autobiographies ever written . But the fragments he has gathered up sometimes turn out to be semiprecious nuggets . <P> A Paltry Sum . He brushes over dates , rarely discusses his nine children or his second wife , Dorelia MacNeill , to whom he refers simply as " D. " The best nuggets are his painter's-eye-view comments on his famed sitters . " Bernard Shaw 's head , " says John , " had two aspects , as he pointed out himself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed him of my fee , Shaw exclaimed , ' What ! Do you mean to say you work for so paltry a sum ? ' But before I had time to revise my charges , the cheque was written and handed over . " <P> Another famous Irishman , James Joyce , sat for a series of pencil sketches . " He had a precise and buttoned-up appearance . . . He explained that the poverty of his beard was due to an early accident to his chin , but I did not feel empowered to restore the missing growth . In spite of his cold and formal exterior , I was much drawn to Joyce and , on finally parting with him . . . to his consternation , embraced him in the continental manner . " <P> A Colossal Effigy . In 1920 , John went on one of his most famous rampages . Shortly after he had finished a portrait of Lord Leverhulme , founder of the Lever Bros , soap empire , the canvas was returned with the head cut out of the picture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable proceeding . . . I received in return a letter stating that , on finding the picture too large to place in his safe , the owner had cut out what he considered to be the most important part , that is the head . . . As for the remainder , it had been sent back by an error on the part of his housekeeper . I was urgently requested to keep the matter dark . . . My answer to this was to inform the Press . " Soon the artistic world was in an uproar . Telegrams and cables began to pour in . Public demonstrations took place . " In Italy . . . a 24-hour strike was called , involving everyone connected with the painting industry . . . a colossal effigy . . . was constructed of soap and tallow , paraded through the streets of Florence , and ceremoniously burnt , after which a wreath was solemnly laid on the altar of St. John . " <P> When he was not working on a commission , he usually packed up his family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's roster of famous subjects grew , e.g. , Japan 's Prince ( later Emperor ) Hirohito- " an inconspicuous young man attired in a navy blue suit " - Thomas Hardy , T. E. Lawrence , W. B. Yeats . His fees also grew , to 1,000 and up . The " series of scenes and adventures " practically fill Chiaroscuro , but here &; there , John pauses to point and comment .
