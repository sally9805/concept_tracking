I HAVE 2500 SONS By LT . GEN . GARRISON H. DAVIDSON , U.S.A. , as told to Rout Tunley West Point cadets are one part military and one part mischief , their superintendent declares . Riding herd on this corps gives him plenty of tips on raising his own three boys . .5 . " Niimmers : IgoI had an experie " re few lathers have . My family was suddenly in  --  creased by mime 2496 members . I became Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at %Vest Point . As father of three boys of my own , I was not exactly itinncent of the problems of raising a teen-ager . The job can be formidable , as quite a few parents kill testify . I therefore approached my new family with some trepidation . To my surprise , the task was simpler than I had an  --  ticipated . I had expected that the lessons learned in bringing up three teen-age boys would help MC in dealing with the cadets , but I did not realize that the cadets would be even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to see the latter in something of a new light . %Vest Point 's strategic location on the heights above the I Itulsini , I found , is also an excellent vantage punt from which to study the foibles and follies of the young . You may feel that calling myself " father " to a corps of disciplined and highly trained ca  --  dets is stretching the parent role a bit . Actu  --  ally , it is n't . I ant directly responsible for the amount of food they eat ( calories a day ) , the hour they arc in bed ( I 0:I 5 P.st. ) , the exer  --  cise they receive ( plenty ) , the kind of clothes they wear , the place where they may smoke a cigarette , even the number of date6 they may have in a school year . In a very real sense , I have more control over them than I have over my own sons , now aged fifteen , twenty-one and twenty-two respectively . On the surface , my cadet family is a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frighteningly so . The spit-and-polish um-forma , the braced posture , the precise drills against the gray , granite back  --  ground of West Point gist the stranger the impression that all is order , coldness and obedience . " A hunch of automa  --  tons ! " commented went visitor . " Not a surpnsc in the package . " No surprises indeed ! I imagine few fathers have ever had to face the kind of situation one of my predecessors laced a few years ago when a teen-age cadet got into an argument with his physics in  --  structor . The youngster , who , if he is an automaton , would have to be classified as a particularly uninhibited one , took the position that the academy 's plumbing vsas inadequate . Particularly in the stone barracks ss hich he shared web 500 other cadets . What would happen , he asked . if everybody turned on the water at once ? Nothing . answered the instructor . This unusual man was not the sort to be disputed , even by an officer . He planned his rebuttal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready and everybody 's wrist watch in the barracks had been synchronized to the split second , he took up his post in the center of the barracks quadrangle . At the precise moment agreed upon , he lowered his arm briskly . Observers planted at each window shouted , " Now ! " Simultaneously the plebes , who had been stationed in each bathroom , opened every faucet and shoecrhead and flushed every toilet . There was a mighty roar of eater cou  --  pled with a muffled explosion as the big pipes under the barracks were ruptured . The cadet , to put it mildly , had made his point with the physics instructor . He had also made himself the most re  --  stricted man on the campus . A cadet with an I.Q. of almost genius level , he never could quite learn to apply himself to his studies . Because of a series of similar , if less drastic , escapades. he gradually slid from the top to the bottom of his class , the position in which he ultimately graduated . An interesting thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of be  --  coming adults is that you can never take matunty for granted . They constantly fool you . Just when you think you 're dealing with a man , the boy crops out . And vice versa . One evening during study period , a normally quiet upperclassman , who cer  --  tainly appeared grown up to most of us , took it upon himself to boast to his room  --  mates that he had an unusually large mouth . So large was it , in fact , that he could put his whole fist in it . He there  --  upon proceeded to do just that . The fist went in all right , but it would n't come out . He yanked and yanked , but the fist would n't budge . At first , his roommates roared , but it soon appeared that the young man was in considerable pain . Fi  --  nally , they became concerned , got him down on the floor where they could study him , and decided to give his arm a con  --  certed yank , which managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ' the experience except that he was not able to cat properly for three days . No . I do n't think there is any danger of turning our cadets into automatons . Beneath those smart gray tunics are the unfettered souls of college boys with all the high spirits native to the breed . In drawing any comparisons between the corps and my own family , I would be less than honest if I did not admit that handling several thousand cadets is a lot easier than handling my own children . For one thing , I know where a cadet is most of the time . Unless he is on a week ? end leave  --  and these are strictly limited  --  on his summer vacation ( one month ) , or at a dance on the post , he is in bed at the same hour every night . Ile is not allowed to drink within twenty-five miles of the academy , and he is seldom that far away . He can not have an automobile until sev  --  eral weeks before graduation . He is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to dress immaculately , with shoes sparkling . He makes his own bed and cleans his room . He gets regular food and regular exercise . Although my wife , Vcronc , and I do not have problem children in any sense of the word , we would certainly be de  --  lighted to settle for even a tiny fraction of this order in our own household . In fact , when I arrived at West Point a year and a half ago . the contrast in behavior between my two " families " was so great that I reanalyzed my whole role as father and decided that a little more discipline at home was just what was needed . In some ways , I 've failed . Take the matter of " going steady , " for example . Neither my wife nor I think it 's a good idea for a boy in his teens to tie himself to one girl . We feel that young men and women need to meet others as a basis for comparison , and yet my sons have scorned this idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to lead to early marriages , which I am opposed to . I feel that the stability they bring to youngsters is apt to be tem  --  porary . I made a point of expressing my ideas about going steady to the upper-class cadets this year . but I also told them frankly I had given the same advice to my own sons and they refused to take it . I expect little success in this matter with the cadets . Contrary to the situation a dec  --  ade or so ago , most of them have the same girl up weekend after weekend , and dance every dance with her . At the end of four years , they are apt to marry her with  --  out any real idea of whether she is suited for the kind of life led by an Army officer . Since no cadet is allowed to marry and stay in the corps  --  according to tradition he may have " no horse , no wife and no mustache " ? the wedding usually takes place right after graduation , generally at the Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes after graduation , with seventy-five taking place the first week . In some ways , having sons of my own has given me a fresh viewpoint on some of the long-established traditions of the academy . Drinking is one of them . Last summer when my two older sons , Gary and Tom , were home from college , they spent their vacations working as la  --  borers at the post in order to supplement the seventy-tine dollars a month I give each of them toward his total college ex  --  penses . Occasionally after a day 's work , they would come home , sit in the garden and have a glass of beer with me . I was r 0 S T conscious that on the other side of the fence were men of exactly the same age who were not allowed to have that glass of beer . I do not know whether any change will result in the academy 's drink  --  ing rules as a result of this observation , but at least the question has been raised and is under consideration by the authori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that when an upperclassman is visiting another post , he may observe the drinking rules of that post . In my own family , I have discussed with my older sons the problems of drink  --  ing , but I have also told them that if they have the urge to take a drink , I would pre  --  fer they do so at home . The results so far have been good . They will take an occa  --  sional drink , but it is in no way a habit with them . luring the last few years there has been considerable liberalization in the life of the cadet corps in general . Prior to the end of World War II , for example , no drinking at all was permitted a cadet even when he was outside the twenty-five-mile limit . It was found that this policy was un  --  realistic . Boys would often drink at home and on leave , and it was felt there was no real harm in this if they behaved them  --  selves . The twenty-five-mile limit was im  --  posed simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except on vacation or on official weekend leave . In addition , the leave policy has been loosened up a bit  --  I have allowed first clansmen who stand sufficiently high in their studies , for example , to start their weekends on Fridays rather than Satur  --  days , if they wish  --  and there has been an casing of rules regarding the use of cars , receiving money from home and many minor matters . Hazing , of course , has long since been a thing of the past . Most important change of all , however , is the much greater accent on " positive leadership . " By this I mean that when a cadet is punished for some infraction , he is made to understand the reasons behind the rule he violated . Formerly , punish  --  ment was meted out strictly on a " Yes , sir ; no , sir ; no excuse , sir " basis , and no whys and wherefores were gone into . Furthermore , each cadet now has a tacti  --  cal officer as a counselor , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and informal basis . These changes have been brought about because , to put it bluntly , they produce better soldiers . In World War II , it was found that a man trained under more lib  --  eral conditions  --  that is , strict , but sym  --  pathetic  --  was apt to do more thinking as well as to be better disciplined . For , con  --  trary to popular opinion , a liberal pol  --  icy  --  with penalties for misbehavior  --  improves discipline . it teaches a man to discipline himself and gives him a greater sense of responsibility . It was also found that when life at the Point was too monastic , too unrealistic , the cadets would find the plunge into more normal life after graduation too sudden . Not all of them could adjust . All things are relative , of course , and despite a certain casing up , the life of a cadet is still highly regulated and disci  --  plined . He rises at 5:50 A.M. , falls in for reveille at 6:00 , has breakfast at 6:30 . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a short midmorning break to return to his room , classes go on until noon . At 12:10 he marches to lunch , and from I : 00 until 3:15 in the afternoon there are more classes . At 3:30 he engages in some form of athletics , and is perhaps able to get in a few moments of rest or study until the call to supper ( 6:20 ) at which time he marches to the dining hall again . At 7:15 there is a call to quarters , and for the next two and a half hours there is a study pe  --  riod . Following this , a cadet has about , I , Iwo thirty minutes before lights out . On Sat  --  urdays there are classes until noon and on Sundays , except for compulsory chapel and marching to meals , a cadet has the day to himself . During the first year a man does not leave the post at all for eleven months , except for two possible weekend football games away from the academy . In his third year . he IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have nine . This may seem pretty strict to the lay  --  man , and it is only by comparing the rules and privileges with what existed years ago that it is possible to note any over-all changes in the direction of liberalization . A number of things at West Point do not change , however . Of these , the most im  --  portant is the honor code . This is the heart of the system . Basically , it simply means that a man will not lie , cheat or steal . Any violation of this code is dealt with strictly by the students who admin  --  ister it . A few years ago the nation was shocked to learn that ninety cadets were dismissed for cribbing . It is significant that the stu  --  dent who reported the cribbing to the honor committee was not blamed in any way by his classmates . All of them arc honor bound to do the same thing . After the shock had subsided , there was no doubt but that the corps of cadets felt that dismissal was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor system is stronger than ever . Rules and regulations are another mat  --  ter , however . Violation of these causes demerits and punishment  --  restriction of liberty , extra marching , and so on  --  and has nothing to do with honor . There 's a strong instinct in most every boy to kick over the traces , and in this regard the cadets are no different from other young men . In the 155 years of the academy 's history , there is only one man who hasever gone through the full four years with  --  out a demerit , and that was Gen. Robert E. Lcc . As both a father and a superin  --  tcndent , I am aware of the fact that most sons arc not Robert E. Lees and that youngsters often violate rules just for the sheer pleasure of getting away with some  --  thing . This was brought home to me the other day when an upperclassman was caught with an electric coffee-maker in his room . ( No cadet may have cooking appliarKes in his quarters . ) When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cof  --  fee and the hot water that came out of the tap , he replied significantly , " Sir , that would hardly be getting away with a thing ! " As a parent as well as a public servant , I 'm aware , of course , that some of the academy 's regulations are contrary to the normal inclinations of a growing boy , but for obvious reasons there 's very little I can do about it . Take pets , for example . There 's nothing wrong in wanting to be  --  friend a dumb animal , and yet no cadet is allowed to keep one . It would be impos  --  sible , with several thousand men living close together under barracks conditions , for it to be otherwise . Naturally , the ban has not stopped stu  --  dents from acquiring pets . For a century and a half they have been pitting their wits against those of the inspecting offi  --  cers in an attempt to flout the rule . Touchingly , they have taken to their hearts hamsters , parakeets , dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unbelievably ingenious in finding hiding places in their sparsely furnished rooms , and bringing back the necessary food from the dining hall . A monkey once lived a year in a barracks trunk room , and a goldfish swam happily for months in an overhead light globe until an officer spotted his shadow on the floorduring a'sunny inspection day . One of the most interesting logistics solutions on military record  --  that of supplying fresh milk for a pet kitten  --  was achieved when the owner rounded up a group of plebes and had each bring back a mouthful of milk at the end of every meal . The method was hardly sanitary , but the animal throve . In the flouting of rules , cadets keep strictly up-to-date . At the moment , the most popular extracurricular activity in the barracks is the smuggling of television sets . They have been put together piece by piece , and concealed in ventilators , fire  --  place flues , laundry bags and false draw  --  ers . Transistor radios arc also much in vogue , especially with those cadets forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know whether it was a desire to break the rules or merely good , old-fashioned free enterprise that caused a cadet to go into the midnight-snack busi  --  ness recently , but he had a flourishing trade under way with an illegal sandwich grill in the barracks . He delivered toasted-cheese sandwiches by rope to the rooms of his various classmates after lights . This activity was brought to an end one night when an officer surprised the youth  --  ful chef just as he was completing a sand  --  wich . The officer , in keeping with the academy 's more " liberal " viewpoint of discipline , decided to take the grill and leave the sandwich . Just as he was about to leave , however , he heard a voice out the hack window shout , " Hey , Mike ! Where 's my sandwich ? " Mike did n't say a word , but the voice got louder and more insistent . While those in the room stood in silence . the officer suddenly noticed a head appear upside down at the window . After one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head quickly disappeared . The officer then rushed upstairs and read a 49 lecture to the occupants there on the dan  --  gers of being held by one 's feet , head down , four stories above the ground . Naturally , many of these high jinks have had counterparts in my own family even before we came to West Point , and although we live in a big house in the cen  --  ter of the academy , I can not blame the cadets for an occasional upsurge in mis  --  behavior among my own children . My youngest son , Skip , for example , needs no such inspiration . Recently , while my wife and I were away , he got bored and decided to do some shooting with a BB gun . He said he was aiming at a tree , but most of the shot landed in the room of a cadet who was studying . The cadet quickly tired of this and came to com  --  plain . Skip was unimpressed . Finally , the officer in charge appeared , and that put an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the sort of punishment a cadet would be given . He was restricted to school , home and gymnasium for six weeks . Unlike the academy , we have never had any runaways in our family , although this seems to happen to most boys at one time or another . At West Point , despite the fact that a cadet is free to resign at any time except during the first two months and the gates are always wide open . we still have occasional runaways . Last March , for example , a plebe who thought he 'd flunked a physical-aptitude test and " wanted to get away from it all , - ran away from the post and took refuge in a railway boxcar . He was inadvertently locked in , and lived for eight days on raw ' potatoes . When the car was opened in Hoboken , New Jersey , and he was found . he was fifteen pounds lighter and much dehydrated , but little the worse for wear . The next morning his tactical officer , who is directly responsible for the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn ) potato Iron ) his superior officer . It had a tag on it labeled : " Sub  --  ic. : t : FT . " ? Perhaps the most important lesson I 've had demonstrated to me during ms super  --  intendency is the folly of trying to get your son to follow in your loiusteos un  --  less he 's so inclined . It has been said that a father sees in his son a last chance to rectify his own mistakes , and there is a good deal of truth in this . At West Point we constantly find that the men who do most poorly are those who base come to the academy to please a parent rather than because they themselves wanted to do it . For this reason , I hase tried very hard not to influence my own sons in becoming cadets , although I would base been %Cry pleased if they had decided to do so . To date , there are no cadets in my family . My oldest son . Gary , decided that he would not like the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ernment expense  --  cadets not only get their education free but receive a monthly stipend of S111.15 as well  --  and then re  --  sign after putting in the three required years as an Army officer . My second son , Tom . wanted to become a cadet , but was , unfortunately , unable to pass the eye ex  --  amination . My third son , Skip , is still too young to have to make a choice . What  --  ever that choice is , however , I want it to come from him . As far as my own life is concerned . there was neser any doubt about what I wanted to be . My father , who worked as Registrar of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New fork City , was an ardent National Guardsman and his civilian sol  --  diership rubbed off on me . At fise. 1 buckled on my father 's sword and , using a pot cower for a shield , swashbuckled around the kitchen in command of an imaginary army . As soon as I got through high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where my first love was football . Staying on after graduation as coach , I met Verone , who was visiting her brother , now Gen. Alfred M. Gruenthcr , then also stationed at the Point . We were married in 1934 and immediately started raising a Because of two wars  --  World War II and the Korean War  --  in which I spent long periods overseas , however , I was away from my three sons a good deal while they were growing up . This is one of the reasons why Verone and I started " another " family when I returned from the Korean War  --  a family entirely of girls . In 1952 , Linda was born , and three years later , a pair of twins , Gail and Bonnie . I call this my second family , and this time I hope to have the chance of watching them grow up without the in  --  terruption of a war . That the problems will be somewhat different from a family of sons . I am already aware . My daughter Linda , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at becoming more of a cadet than the cadets themselves . In fact , she seems to be under the impression that the entire corps was created for her special henclit . She never ores of the military life , and it is hard to get her off the parade ground . The other day , after a drill , she stopped to talk to a cadet who was with his girl friend . After a while he wanted to be alone with his guest and he left Linda with the casual words , " See you later ! " She took this literally . with the result that it was very difficult to get her to leave the spot even for lunch . After lunch , she went hack to the parade ground to wait . Both my wife and I hope to he able to get her through kindergar  --  ten before she is engaged to a cadet . We arc not unaware , of course , that if Skip by any chance decides not to enter the academy , Linda may be our last chance for acquiring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enthusiasm for the corps . However . I would he less than honest if I pretended that the West Point system is perfect . My admiration for the academy , w ith which I have been associated , off and on , for thirty-four years , does not blind me to the fact that there is room for improvement . Here are two areas in which I believe the system could he improved : I ) Appointments . Although West Point takes 750 boys each year  --  boys of every color , creed and family background  --  and molds most of them into men with some stamp of leadership , it does so at the cost of a high rate of attrition . Almost 25 per cent of the boys who enter fail to make the grade and are returned to civilian life , mostly in the first year . Although it may be no fault of his own , the boy suffers a major failure in life , one which he ca n't always overcome . This is a blow both to his parents and to us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking , many of these heartaches might be avoided by a closer screening of all candidates in a manner similar to that which we now use in de  --  termining the competitive appointments . Under this system candidates are judged on a whole man basis  --  mental abilities , physical aptitude and leadership poten  --  tial . Studies we have conducted indicate that a system of selection which is vested in our academic board should improve the standards of the candidate . How  --  ever , under the present **25;941;TOOLONG method , which accounts for 85 per cent of our cadets , there is no comparable system for determining the relative potential of the candidates . Our degree of selectivity , therefore , is limited . Since our academic hoard has had extensive experience with the qualities which make for a successful cadet , I think it only wise that they should have some part in the selection of candidates . We are prepared to assist any congressman in reviewing candidates with the aim of selecting those individuals who appear to be best qualified for a cadetship and a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressmen could select a list of six or eight individuals and have the academic hoard evaluate their po  --  tential and establish an order of probabil  --  ity of success . The congressman would still make the final selection as he sees fit . The academy thereby would continue to receive candidates of high caliber from each of the forty-eight states . In other words , the academy would offer advice , based on past records . I believe this sys  --  tem would lower the attrition rate and everybody would be happier . 2 ) The Curriculum . This important as  --  pect of the West Point system is still being studied , and I 'm not yet prepared to make specific recommendations , except to say that certain changes will be made , espe  --  cially in the field of English . It is the gen  --  eral feeling  --  bolstered by an intensive survey recently made among former grad  --  uates  --  that the teaching of English needs to be expanded . Certainly , nothing is more important than that an officer be able to express himself clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , At present , the West Point curriculum is divided roughly as follows : 60 per cent scientific and engineering ; 40 per cent lib  --  eral arts and humanities . It is possible that this is not the ideal ratio for the needs of an officer in a modern army . This is something that will be determined only after exhaustive study . There are probably many other ways in which the West Point system could be improved , but to my mind these arc the most important at the moment . Times change and requirements change , and it is the duty of the authorities at the academy to anticipate the kind of officer who will be needed in the generation to come . If hard work will produce that kind or officer , certainly the present system will do it . It is interesting to note that in an age when the working week is getting shorter and shorter , and the world is get  --  ting increasingly leisure-conscious , the cadet today is the busiest in history . The curriculum is so jammed that he spends 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room than the average college student . He also has less vacation : nine months are spent in classroom work , and two more in military training at camp . In spite of all this , he does not seem to be any the worse for the extra work . Nor do the grinding physical drill , the busy athletic schedule or the early hours seem to stifle his drive or imagination . In this regard , it seems to me that the academy makes a point worth noting out  --  side the military circle as well . I do n't think it 's possible , or even desirable , for the average parent to try to turn his son into the equivalent of a cadet . I do be  --  lieve , however , that in an age when we seem to be constantly trying to make things easier for our kids in every way  --  from buying them television sets to chauf  --  feuring them six blocks to school  --  it 's possible to learn a lesson or two from the West Point system . I have found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned , we have learned over the past few years to temper old-fashioned discipline with a little more leniency . On the other hand , as a parent , I 've learned to temper leniency with a little more old-fashioned discipline . In an age of gang warfare and juvenile delinquency , this may strike a lot of other parents as a pretty good idea too .
