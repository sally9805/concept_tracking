In Bangkok last week , Thailand 's Chamroen Songkitrat squared off with Algeria 's Robert Cohen for the bantamweight championship of the world . Early in the fight , a right cross broke Chamroen 's nose and splattered blood all over the ring ; for 15 rounds both men whaled away at each other furiously . Chamroen was beaten on points . By western standards it was a lively scrap , but to Thais it looked like a mild family argument . <P> Shortly before the Cohen bout , Bangkok fight fans took in some home-style boxing in Rajadamnern Stadium , and found it more to their taste . Before a typical bout a pair of lithe welterweights , Sriswasdi Thiamprasidth and Kaeh Chomsrimesk , bowed gracefully to the crowd , knelt on the canvas for prayers to Buddha , and warmed up with a graceful , slow-motion dance . Then the gong sounded for the first round , an energetic four-piece band swung into a tune that sounded like an old-fashioned American carnival hootchy-kootchy , and the fighters started dancing in earnest . <P> Sriswasdi charged out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked him in the thigh , and clipped him on the back of the neck with a wicked elbow . By the middle of the second round , both fighters were smeared with blood . The music rose to a frenzied tattoo . With every blow , the 8,000 Thais in the stadium chanted for more blood . Sriswasdi jerked Kaeh 's head down and kneed him viciously under the chin , blocked a feeble counterpunch , spun his man around and jabbed at his ribs with both elbows . Dazed , his opponent backed away . Sriswasdi took aim and kicked him in the groin , finished him off with a knee in the belly . The crowd screamed approval . <P> Glass in the Gum . Such biweekly settos are a " reformed " remnant of medieval tournaments in which Thai warriors jousted with sword and lance from the backs of elephants . Once a man was unseated , the fight was finished on foot , without weapons . After a while Thais stopped bothering with elephants and did all their scrapping hand to hand . Fighters took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resulting gauntlets into gum and sprinkling them liberally with broken glass . Before a fight , the gum was allowed to harden until a man 's arm became a club . There were no weight limits , no rounds-only a punctured coconut shell floating in a container of water . The fight continued until the shell sank , or until one of the boxers fell unconscious or dead . <P> For centuries Thailand supported this formalized mayhem , but in 1934 the government decided to civilize boxing . Fighters were forced to wear four-ounce gloves , bouts were limited to five three-minute rounds , and some basic rules were established ( no biting , gouging , or kicking a man who was down ) . Today the sport is controlled by the national police department , and Thailand supports some 500 professional fighters . Buddhist bonzes ( priests ) box for exercise , and the prefight prayer is an important ritual .
