" The other errors disclosed in the recheck were scattered ones or errors in addition in other districts . Prosecutor Enters . the Case The bitter feeling caused by the closeness of the Macy-Greenwood contest became evident last night when Lindsay Henry , District Attorney of Suffolk County , called at the office of the Board of Electhins of Nassau County in the old County Court House in Mineola . Mr. Henry was accompanied by two men , one of . whom served an order on Alicia O'Connor , a Democratic member of the board , requiring it to impound and preserve the voting rhaehines , ballot boxes and the ' keys to the same , the registry books , tally sheets and records in which Mr. Macy 's name appears . . This order was issued on Mr. Macy 's behilf by Supreme Court Justice L. Barron Hill , and was accompanied by an affidavit by S : Martin Adelman who alleged that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the Nassau Board of Canvazgers had been rechecking during the day . Mr. Meisser and Police Commissioner John M. Beckmann of Nassau County alto were scheduled to receive service of the order , but the notice of service had been sent to Mr. Meisser 's home instead of to his office . Mr. Henry in a sharp manner then told ' Mr. Meisser ' that he wanted to speak to him in private , to which the latter replied : " Anything you have to ' say to me , you can say to me in my office . " " This is an official matter , " Mr. Henry rejoined , " and . I do not choose to discuss it before newspaper men . " Suggests " ' We Step Aside " After further discussion , . Mr. Meisser suggested that " we can step aside and talk- over , the matter . " " I want you to be in Frank Gulotta 's - ( the District Attorney of Nassau County ) office tomorrow morning , " Mr. Henry then said . " I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but ? not on your say-so , " Mr. Meisser replied . " Maybe you would like to come to Riverhead ( county seat of Suffolk County ) tomorrow , " - Mr. Henry retorted . " No , I would n't , " Mr. Meisser re. ; plied , " and I wo n't , unless you ' have the proper papers . " As Mr. Henry started to leave , a photographer of Newsday snapped a picture . Mr. Henry grabbed the camera , declaring that , " I have my right of privacy and you ca n't take my picture in here . " There then was a. struggle for possession of the camera , with ' Mr. Henry demanding that the photographer take out-the slide and destroy it . Mr. Meisser reminded Mr. Henry that he was overstepping his authority and the Suffolk County District Attorney left , with one of his aides saying , as the group made its exit : " We 'll take care of you . " Mr. Greenwood has protested wilt he called scattering the machines used in Suffolk County . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which lies just off the Connecticut shore , is stored there . The machines used in the two Shelter Island districts are stored on Shelter Island . The machine used on Fire Island is stored there . All other machines are in a central warehouse at Yaphank . ? Gives Verdict to Newspaper Mr. Greenwood said he was naturally elated at the results , of the recheck but would withhold any specific claim of victory , pending the official canvass . He credited the newspaper Newsday , published in Nassau County , for his large vote . Mr. Macy was not available for comment . Identical editorials appearing in the eight , weekly newspapers published in Suffolk County by Consolidated Press , controlled by the Macy family , attributed the close race to the letter written by Lieut . Gov . Toe R. Hanley to Mr. Macy and to the support of Mr. Greenwood by Newsday . The first of these editorials eppeared on Wednesday in the Huntington Times and was written before the recheck was made . The editorial declared that " we may assume that the Hanley letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attacked Newsday for " distortion " of facts .
