After a year of cantankerous argument about how to pay for it-bonds or taxes-the House of Representatives last week approved the biggest face lifting job in U.S. history . By a 388 to 19 vote it passed a road-building program calling for 13 years of federal and state spending amounting to nearly $52 billion . The project involves a 40,000-mile system of interstate highways that would connect 42 state capitals and link 90% of all cities with populations of 50,000 or more . <P> Under the Administration-backed bill , as sent to the Senate ( where it faces smooth riding ) , the Federal Government would spend $37.6 billion and the states would chip in $14.2 billion . On the interstate system ( $27.5 billion ) the U.S. would pay 90% , the states 10% . For roads within states ( $22.7 billion ) , costs would be split dollar for dollar between the states and the U.S. The Federal Government would meet the entire $1 billion construction cost for park , forest and other public-domain roads . <P> This time , the Administration had abandoned its position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . The House bill would pay a large part of the Federal share with regular appropriations . But it would also levy additional taxes of $14.8 billion on highway users during the life of the program . The present 2-per-gallon federal tax on gasoline would go up to 3 . Tires would be taxed at 8 per lb. , instead of 5 . Excises on trucks , buses and trailers would be raised from 8% to 10% . The added tax cost to the average motorist : $6 to $9 per year .
