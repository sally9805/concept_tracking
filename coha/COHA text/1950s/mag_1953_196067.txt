A hastily abandoned car , a vaguely phrased intention to visit a friend , a reassuring but phony telegram from out of the void-these were the nebulous clues left behind by British Diplomat Donald MacLean and his Foreign Office colleague , Guy Burgess , when they disappeared off the face of the free world more than two years ago . Last week , leaving behind an almost identical set of clues , still more MacLeans disappeared : Donald 's attractive , Chicago-born wife Melinda and the three MacLean children . <P> They vanished from Geneva , Switzerland , as suddenly and as mysteriously as Donald MacLean and Guy Burgess had vanished from their posts in the inner sanctum of the British Foreign Office . Where had they gone ? Why ? <P> Two weeks ago Melinda MacLean and her children , Fergus , 9 , Donald , 7 , and Melinda , 2 , returned from a vacation in the Balearic Islands to their apartment in Geneva , where they had been living for a year with her mother , wealthy Mrs. Melinda Dunbar of Boston and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded the children into the family 's black Chevrolet , and set off to weekend at the home of a friend near Montreux , some 50 miles away . She told her mother she would be back on Sunday . The friend ? Mrs. Dunbar was not sure . A " Mr. Robin , " she thought her daughter had said . Sunday passed , then Monday , with no sign of the MacLeans . Mrs. Dunbar notified the British Foreign Office . Two Scotland Yard detectives sped to the scene , but they found no trace of the MacLeans . <P> Love from All . On Wednesday Mrs. Dunbar received a telegram from a suburb of Montreux . " Unforeseen circumstances have arisen , " it read . " Am staying here longer . Please advise school boys returning about a week 's time . All extremely well . Pink Rose in marvelous form .

Detectives found that the wire , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been filed by a large , heavily rouged woman . A few days later the MacLean Chevrolet was found in Lausanne , at a garage close to the railroad station . A lady calling herself " Mrs. Dunbar " had left it in a great hurry , said the garage attendant . Abandoned on the seat was a child 's book-Little Lost Lamb . <P> Anything Is Possible . Urged to the chase by a suddenly jittery British Foreign Office , the police of five nations were as hard put to find an answer as they were to determine the whereabouts of MacLean himself . No certain information has ever come out concerning the two diplomats , both known to be Communist sympathizers . They have been variously reported as shot by British counter-espionage agents , in a Communist prison , or living in luxury behind the Iron Curtain . Had Mrs. MacLean been kidnaped by the Russians in order to pry secrets out of her husband ? * Had her way to his side been smoothed by Russian officialdom in return for services rendered ?
