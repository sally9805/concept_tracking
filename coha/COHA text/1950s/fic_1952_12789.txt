( Sound of wind and sea as the play opens , suggestive of wide desolate spaces , rising and subsiding for a minute or so when steps are heard approaching the microphone heavily over dry sand . Dernier speaks , slowly at first , as if afraid of his own voice , and then more confidently as his speech continues . ) HARRY DERNIER Who am I ? Who dare n't explore The fringes of my hand ? The horizon has become A boundary of bones . The wind 's wicked today , huh . . Talking to yourself again , Harry . Who 's Harry though ? The world 's whole sap is shrunk , Dernier shrunk with it . God , what a blinding blaze when the towers Waltzed down like Ilium . The ruddy end of the world . You 'd better sit down . . . ( He can be heard Brushing sand away . In the back of this monologue the sea can be heard all of the time ) . Ahhhh . That 's comfort . What 's this ? A newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . a skull . . . And earrings . What ruddy symbols !

Wash your face now , girlie . Smile now , smile , lady . . . ( He speaks with the over-ingratiating tone of a photographer coaxing a petulant child ) Some withered Cleopatra 's brain , A withered honeycomb . The buzzing tenants Have vacated it . Only the dry apartments where the past Is a dusty trickle . . . Smile , smile , girlie . There are two hollow jokes your sockets Are telling . Ahhhh . . . that 's a sickening sight , even for a priest , You hag . . .

How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At fools in dinner jackets at cocktail lounges ? ( The cry of birds high up in the air ) The vultures again . High company . They 're swooping lower ; beat them off last night when I Had to take a nap . No more carrion . What a rarity You must be , Harry , caviar to the vulture , The last human . Not pickled yet . It 's getting darker . Sun sinks low . Only way tell time . . . Sun sinks quick too . Look , there , Harry Dernier , some careless angel Is dropping it . Food for thought . Some luckless handmaiden , Polishing the shelves of stars , lets a star fall And drives astrology frantic . The fools sit on dark sands With sidereal portent . Hah . . . It 's blowing up from the sea . . . Cold tonight . Suppose you die tonight . . . Now I lay me down to sleep . Well I still have my matches . A FIRE IS IN ORDER . . . ( He says the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man speaks in an empty hall to feel comfortable with his own voice ) There you are , Dernier . Dry sticks , Matches . . . Have lasted well . . . You took enough from that store With the burnt people twisted like mannequins . . . ( He can be heard fanning the fire after it has crackled to life , its whirrs against the sound of his voice ) Ha ! Theo-biologic , burn my leaves , boy . To Carthage then I came , burning , burning . The devil burns Bibles to warm his wit by , God chafes his pity In the blaze of a burning world . ( The fire steadies down to a friendly purr . Some seconds of silence . Interval of the sea and wind . When Dernier begins to talk again it is with a low mumble . . . He is beginning to be frightened with the dark suddenly on him ) I hate this worst .

Good morning Quant , fetch coffee , tell Vienna , I 'll not be visiting today . Is that New York Signalling through human wires underground , the communications of The utterly dead ? Quant must be like me . Unshaven , pot bellied , bald , In Quant. . . by the way sit down , sir . In Quant , as I was saying , pupils , You see the word Do not . The thin commandments .

I can exhale you Through the organs of my nostrils , shut you off , defy you In that same breath that wheezes cathedral organs . . . . A hoax of two crossed sticks . A monstrous joke , Dropping the sun like a squib in the sea , Circling the earth with the horizon of a doodle : A man hung by his own nails . . . .

Hallucinations . . . LILLY THE LADY Your name is Harry Dernier ? HARRY DERNIER Yes . It used to be . . . everything used to be . . . The past imperfect . . . The future simple . The present , tense .

LILLY THE LADY I 'm flesh and blood , like you . Touch me , touch and see . HARRY DERNIER You were a skull once .

Around the destructive argument of the bone , the bone ? p. 7 LILLY THE LADY I was singing . Did you hear me ? I can sing pretty well . I used to sing for money . . . Once . . . as you say . . . Everything used to be . . . Why did the world end ? Sin , I suppose ; they new too much , Aeonstain , and Openhimmel . . . It 's a nightmare , like one of those Desert island gags . But I 'm alive .

Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady , resist your wiles ; I am the last thing in virility . No wisp of lawn , satin , or Trumpeting Jericho can waft me back To the swanee music of the spheres .

Morass and filth here , boy ; Get me a clean-laundered country with the sea respectable In a bluegreen snood . Spread me a meadow where I can eat Without a faint of dung . What are you but a scentless heap of moving earth , A miser 's last hoard of eyes and pennies Of blood ? Here 's the sea 's rim , woman , Go clean yourself , Salome . LILY THE LADY Get a load of him . . . Oh , you fool . . . Die then , you have n't got the guts to kill yourself . . . HARRY DERNIER Well , I can die now . I know what other faces mean , The mirrors of eyes where Narcissus was drowned .

There 's no end like a damp end , Moby Dick 's room . LILY THE LADY You 're educated . HARRY DERNIER Yes . But not wise . Anyway . . . How did you survive that total sorrow ? As for me , I came down from a mountain 's pinecold air To find no world . Populations absent . The cities vacant as A child 's sandcastle . Fled through deserts , death following , Like a sick wind , woeful scenes , The meek crab 's scuttle Was thunder and quake . How thick the silence Of sea and dead men ! Leave well alone , Lily , let us die After our fashion , patiently and chastely. p. 9 LILY THE LADY I do n't want to die ; I like life , I like boredom , the gift of choice . Earth 's a hard lover to lie on a lady . HARRY DERNIER ( Loudly ) I can not accommodate you . Repent , repent . . . I felt feet following everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sand broke underfoot , like cities scrambling Under a Titan ; populous crabs Huddling inside their shy apartments , accused me With children 's eyes like broken-necked dolls . . . .

I was nervous , upset . . . What good is religion now ? HARRY DERNIER ( Embarrassed by his own crudeness ) I love you , Lily , But you 're another house Of the primordial sin . Now with you alive , the three loves come again , The desert blossoming like the rose . Isaiah . God , Sensual , and self love . We must be cautious , although God and man Are not on speaking terms . We must trust in Him . . . Or die . . . When trust goes crediting nothing can repay it , Not even that bankrupt honour we sailed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , self murder is in order . . . You hear God 's vultures creaking in the sky , and they obey God 's own laws too . Our sin is flesh , The masque of chastity , the ashen touch , The skeleton in the cupboard of our skin . Our hinged and fingered clay is nibbled by Flies , sins and distances . Oh , I can not help you , I can not help Harry , The ruddle is still the rib , And the hidden . . . We can not join the wise and horizontal friends unless We wear the worm as a conspicuous ticket . LILY , LILY , WHERE ARE YOU ? LILY ? ( Echoes take this up SILLY . . LILY . . ARE YOU . .
