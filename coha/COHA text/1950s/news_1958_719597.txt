txt Chase Manhattan Bank , largest in New York City and second nationally , said it is prepared to set up a $100 million revolving credit to " warehouse " Government-backed mortgages if and when the Senate-adopted housing bill is signed . Mortgage wafbhousing is a practice whereby banks make temporary loans on mortgages as collateral , thus giving the borrowers funds to create additional mortgages . The housing bill would make $1,850,000,000 available in added Government backing for home mortgages as well as extend the veterans housing program two years . Sen. Sparkman ( D. , Ala. ) , author of the bill , predicts the legislation would add some 200,000 new housing starts this year . A Chase Manhattan spokesman said the bank 's warehousing plan hinges on a provision in the houising bill which he said would eliminate present restrictions on the discounts that lenders can demand in buying Federal Housing Administration-Insured and Veterans **25;846;TOOLONG liens . The discount is the amount deducted from the face ? value of a mortgage when it is sold ; but since the borrower must repay the principal amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield than the interest rate would pay . Present law sets up discount controls limiting . the discounts on Government-backed mortgages . John J : Scully , Chase Manhattan vice president for real estate and mortgages . - said its warehouse plan would only work on the basis of discounts being permitted to find their own level in a free market . The bank 's plan , he said , would help spur residential building since it would permit mortgage companies and builders to go ahead with construction plans by assuring them at least a temporary market for mortgages they originate . If after a period of 18 months , the mortgage originators could not find other purchasers for their liens . Chase Manhattan would take over all or some of them , Mr Scully explained .
