Drug Store : Sunday Noon A Story by Robert Hutchinson Drawings by Oscar Liebman M RS . LANG scrubbed the last smudges of of her sun-tan-oil advertisement from the drug-store window until she could look out on every inch of Main Street , from the Presbyterian Church to the pool hall . " Nice view , " she muttered . " Wo n't last , thank God . " She took one last look at Lite gullies in the road and the weeds stretching tall to the edge of the Baptist stained-glass windows , and reached for the uppermost corner of the sign whose orange letters she had spent two hours on the night before . " Yeah , " she shouted through the glass at the Sunday School boys running to watch , " says School Supplies . Do n't need gawking to see that , nor an old lady , either . Run on home ' fore you get your clothes dirty . " " Run tell your ma some folks work on Sundays , " she added to herself as she groaned down out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gawking . " Nor sitting , neither , she thought , glancing toward the back of the store where the girl seemed not to have moved a muscle since her last look , ten minutes before . Some day Mrs Lang meant just to sit for ten minutes . That was the day she 'd be carried to the White House on an elephant . She 'd be nine hundred years old . She picked up the bucket of soapsuds and belched . None of her business , she decided , noticing as she went past how the stitching had come loose on the girl 's shoe . The whole world could rot on their chairs and she 'd think twice before crying . She opened the side door and emptied the bucket around the chrysanthemum roots . " Have some soap , " she told them . They were dead anyway . She straightened one of the dry stalks sadly . " If you want more coffee , " she called over her shoulder , " it 's right there . Be sure to leave a dime , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all right . I still have a little . " She touched the cup lightly to her lips , and Mrs. Lang , letting the door slam , turned her head to keep from seeing . It had been at least half an hour . From the looks of the flour-sack dress , Mrs. Lang doubted if the girl had a dime . She had n't bought that permanent anywhere , with the curling-iron rolls hung awkwardly in the wrong places around her white face . She 'd be lucky to have a nickel if she was a Taylor , and she looked anemic and scared like one . Everybody in town knew Otis Taylor owned nothing more than an evil tongue and a pig's-worth of brains . Mrs. Lang glanced at the home-made bead purse and wondered what it would be like , living in a basement house the Chambers had started as a place to store vegetables and always seeing the Chambers ' big gray house next door against the sky . " You 'd get an evil tongue , too , " she told herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last a long time . T T THE fountain she started piling dirty glasses in the bucket . The butter-slicer needed washing , too , but her hand , reaching for it , stopped over the roses instead , hesitated , touched them , and she leaned over the sandwich-board to smell them for the fifth time that morning . This time she counted Twenty-five : half a one for each year . At that rate she 'd be too expensive to let live . She supposed lie had made a date with the flower-()ix ! to get the extra one . She had hid them there that morning after the sheriff 's wife , needing aspirins , had seen the freckled head pushing over the edge of the counter and thrust her hand deep into her apron pocket . " What 's your trouble ? " she said . One of the Lowries , from his ears . " Nothing . " " Then you 'll have to take it someplace else . Ca n't just come in and sit . " The boy glanced toward the table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all right , boy . She 's got her reasons , I guess . " " I got mine , too . " He grinned and she reached for the tea towel . She could guess which teeth were missing without wasting a look . " Might just as well leave town then and not be disappointed . We do n't give handouts after August . " " Piece of ice , maybe ? " She rinsed one off silently and gave it to him . The sheriff 's wife had seen the roses . them . " Roses ! " she had shouted , as if any fool could n't see . " You 're a lucky mother , Mrs. Lang . " " Easy to send roses , " she had said , flushing and turning her back . " Roses do n't pay no bills . " " Why , Mrs. Lang , how can you ? " " Ai n't you gon na be late for Sunday School ? " She had known how she could feel it , all right . Roses did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work till nine and get up at midnight to prowl around the shelves finding heart medicine for some poor old man somebody wished would die . She held the card toward the window now and read it . " For one most dear . " Had n't even signed his name . Not even " Your loving son . " Probably not his own handwriting : it had been that long since his - last letter , she did n't know . He had never written much more than about the weather and bow his cold was , but it had been good just to see the name she had picked out for him . There was that much of her in him he could n't leave behind . She raised her eyes from the card to " Cost you a nickel for that much in Kansas City . Now you go on . Do n't want to see you for five days . " " That Wednesday ? " " Friday . Do n't want to see your brother , neither . " The store phone was ringing as he climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cowboy suit , and she turned toward the booth reluctantly . " I could do without you , too , " she said . Lifting the receiver , she saw the girl catch at her purse and , pull the table toward her . " Yeah ? " Mrs. Lang said . It did n't strike her dumb with surprise . She 'd seen them come and sit like that before . She listened to the man 's voice and then held a hand over the mouthpiece . " You Emmy Taylor ? " The girl nodded and stood up . " Looked like a Taylor . " She stumped back to the counter . " Tell your pa he owes  --  oh , forget it . Go on , answer the damn thing . " In the mirror she watched the way the girl 's hand trembled as she lifted the receiver , the way she stood up close to the mouthpiece . Mrs. Lang blew on each glass as she dried it and held it up to the light . She 'd seen them like that before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had always been given to understand they were pretty good girls . to make up for their father maybe . Not that she even expected that much any longer . " Nobody makes up for anybody , " she was always telling her Christian Science friend , Mrs. Harriman , " and I ought to know . I 've seen more of this town than you have , or Father Hardy , either one . You think I do n't know what they want the pills for , or why they ca n't sleep at nights ? I got an eye for trouble , girl , but I tell you it 's no skin off my hones if the whole town goes to pot , long as I get mine . " " You do n't really ? " " Hell I do n't . Nobody else is gon na take care of you in this world . Least of all your children . " And she glanced now at the roses on the hot plate , as she thought about how snocked Mrs. Harriman always looked . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good at all , they get out of town . " Nothing to hold them here , she thought , pulling a thorn off one of the stems . Nobody to go around with , no work that was n't being already too well done , nobody to marry . " Would you marry any of them people ? " she had asked Mrs. Harriman once , who had become confused . " The painter , maybe . " s " Did n't know we had one . " " Oh he 's real nice , stays with the Chambers and paints wheat fields all day , only ? " Mrs. Harriman 's voice had dropped ? " I guess he 's married . He 's got a little boy . " " What you think I 'm talking about , they 've all got little boys . The young ones are off in Chicago or  --  Houston . " At least Houston was the last address she 'd had from him . She could hear the girl hanging up now and she put the card back op the stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a background . They looked better that way . " Jimmy had his reasons , " Mrs. Harriman always said . And maybe he did . The girl was closing the door to the phone booth , the tight skin flushed under her eyes . It was not a healthy color , and Mrs. Lang wondered , looking at the thin arms , if the girl got enough to eat . For a while they said Otis Taylor was a vegetarian . The girl advanced timidly . " Thank you . " " Do n't like to have people call here , " she said . " Got enough to do . " The girl reddened even more . " I 'm sorry . " " That 's okay . just thought I 'd warn yOu for next Sunday . " " Oh . " The girl turned away . " 1 wo n't be here next Sunday , " she said in a small voice that made Mrs. Lang hold the dish towel empty in mid-air and watch her all the way back to the table . H E CAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in the doorway right on the Coca-Cola sticker so that she had to turn all i he way around to get a good look at him . She hid the rag behind her and straightened her back . She was not quite sure what she had been expecting  --  a serviceman , maybe , or some kid looking uncomfortable out of his weekday overalls , trying- his first winter in town away from his brothers  --  but it had been of a different world from this man with his neatly pressed business suit and the slow , somehow sad smile with which he looked to see if he were in the right place . Automatically her hand sought out the chili stains on her apron and covered them . There was something in his quiet face and stooping shoulders that made her suddenly ashamed of the cracked marble in the fountain , the torn linoleum . the wire-back chairs , and she wished she had sold the candy case when she had a chance . He looked , indescribably , the way doctors always did in the movies , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , she almost expected to see a stethoscope hanging from it , instead of the small address card . " Help you ? " she said . But he was not looking at her when he smiled , The girl must have seen him in the same moment. , for she was moving toward them slowly , a smile beginning on her face until she stopped and put her hand out to the fountain while the color drained away , and Mrs. Lang knew she must have seen the suitcase . He squeezed the girl 's arm gently . " Hi , " he said . His eyes moved over the lowered face , and his hand reached for her chin and drew it upward . " Can you stand to have another cup of coffee ? " he asked quietly . She nodded and turned away . It was the way , Mrs. Lang thought , people acted when she told them . " We 're all out of that " ? like they did n't know where to try next . " One black , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East  --  most folks here used cream . But before she could think to ask , he had carried the cups to the table . " You forgot your change , Mister , " she said . " Hate to do that . " He laughed and held out his left hand for it , and as she counted out the dimes , she could fee/ a tiny pain crowded into her stomach . She wished , ringing up the sale , she had not seen his hand . Of course , she told herself , it might be just a class ring on the other side . Or maybe it was an earlier marriage . It could be lots of other things , but it was n't something to see . She pressed her hand against the ache in her side . " Mrs. Chambers brought me down , " he was saying to the girl , and Mrs. Lang felt very tired suddenly , very old , and something seeming to hit her so fast in the chest that she could hardly get beyond the flowered curtains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Your father brought me the telegram , " his voice went on , and Mrs. Lang decided to lie down a bit before heating the chili . H Ell rest room , as she called it , with its horsehair sofa and the chintz-covered dressing table she had tried to make attractive with postcards of national parks and pictures of movie stars around the sides of the glass , was never very bright , even when the afternoon sun poured through the small window at the end or through the opened door that led to the toilet . The green window shade and the darker green of the walls kept it in a year-round gloom broken only by her talks with Mrs. Harriman or the rare moments she could retreat here with a letter , holding it and squinting at the stamp until the suspense became unbearable . But here , at least , she could lay ? her apron aside and for a moment stop being " old Mrs. Lang at the drug store . " Sometimes she would lie in the darkness whispering " Vinnie Mae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called her any more . Today , though , the trick could not overcome , fifty years and the room seemed unusually dark , the sink only a line of gray in the corner . She put her hand over her eyes to keep from seeing the spot in the ceiling , darker even than the rest , and tried not to listen to what they were saying in the other room . The top of the partition ended in lattice work , and their low voices , marked by silences , drifted through it as though they were talking directly to her . But they were not , she knew , and she wanted none of it . It was none of her business : she had enough of her own without getting herself involved in whatever foolishness Otis Taylor 's girl had got herself into . She coughed and turned ? z , noisily onto her side , drawing the pillow up over her ears . But phrases came through . " I 'll write you , " the man was saying . " You do n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be busy . You 'll have to save time to  --  paint . " " I will , though , every day . " Mrs. Lang could almost sec her own boy then , the Jimmy she had named , grinning and tossing one end of his tie over the other and slipping the knot in his large hands . She opened her eyes and the image went away , but the words , said years before , still echoed with promises not kept . " Sure I 'll write , " he had said ; " what you think I am , huh ? " " ? awfully busy , but ? " " just have a minute ? " and the letter from Texas still stabbing her blind with " looks like I wo n't get home Christmas . we do n't get much time . " Once lie had sent her a picture of himself with some girl , standing on the rocks at Carmel , and she had put it up on the fountain next to the orange juice , but the camera must have slipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side , and lie was always neat about things like that . She had written that the girl was real pretty , but he had never said anything else about her . " How will you get home ? " the Taylor girl was saying now . " She 'll be there , I guess . With the station wagon . " There was a pause , then , " It must be wonderful driving a car . " He laughed . " I 'll have to teach you . " And then there was a longer pause and Mrs. Lang coughed once more , recalling days she had never wanted to think of again , and how she had sold the car after Mr. Lang died . It had been the thing she hated most , watching the swift hands check the throttle and raise the hood as if it were a thing that might have been anybody 's , and none of the dealers knowing how Mr. Lang had liked to go for a drive on Sunday afternoons . She shifted her weight on the horsehair sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the car had gone past with a stranger at the wheel , and she and Jimmy on the sidewalk , left behind in a town there 'd be no more leaving . Jimmy had taken her hand , she remembered , but she hardly knew now how long ago it had been . Jimmy had been just a boy . It was later , when he started dating , t hat he 'd got a car of his own . " I 'm afraid you 'll get hungry , " the girl was saying in the next room ; " do they have a place to eat ? " " There 'll be a diner . " " Oh . If I 'd known , I  --  T could have made some  --  sou " Emmy . Emmy , here , use this . That 's better . I did n't know myself ? " Mrs. Lang got up slowly and began splashing water on her face . She could not help wondering how they had ever met from their neighboring houses . Perhaps he had been painting a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe she had sold the Chambers some eggs , or maybe on a hot night when each of them was walking and no one else around  --  she turned off the water angrily and dried her face . It was none of her business . She had her own , and the screen door slamming and here was work to do , and her hair looking as if she 'd come through a regular storm . T I IREE high-school boys were standing by the magazine rack , and she tried not to see the table at the hack as she walked forward . The boys were in dungarees . " Jesus , " the tallest one was saying , " get a load of this one . How 'd you like those shoes under your ? " He saw her , closed the magazine quietly and walked to one of the tables . The other boys started to follow . One of them waved half-heartedly as he sat down . " Hi , Emmy . " " Hello , " she said , turning her head away . Silently they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the fountain rag . " Ca n't sit there , boys . That section 's closed . " They looked at the girl . " But if ? " " Should of got here earlier . Closed that section just five minutes ago . " " How come ? " She wiped off the counter in front of them . " Business , " she said mysteriously . " The usual ? " She reached for the ice-cream dipper and moved the roses farther back where theycould n't see . Scooping the ice cream , she could hear their harsh whispers . " You could take Emmy . " " Who wants her ? " " She ai n't bad at games . " " That all you think of  --  gamest What I want to know is , does she ? " She pushed the shakes on the machine and stood looking at them . They matched pennies silently until she poured the shakes . " Thanks , Mrs. Lang . " " I get paid for it . Where 's your money ? " It was eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Not that it mattered much : no one she knew would be on it . T NOON , with church out , the rush began , and Mrs. Lang , busy making sand-wiches and stuffing containers of ice cream , was almost glad to slip into the quiet , thoughtless activity of Sunday afternoon . The sheriff 's wife was in for salted nuts , looking He was not looking at her when he smiled . around for something she did not see . - Mrs. Lang waited on her silently without mention of roses or birthdays . Father Hardy smiled in on his way to dinner . Mrs. Harriman called for ant-killer . Young people , bursting in noisily after the abnormal quiet of morning , crowded the fountain , wanting malts and cones . Mrs. Lang let the accumulated skill of years carry her along . She did not ask the two at the bac- k if they wanted more coffee . They could look after themselves . Only once , when the man asked for change for a phone call , did her mind go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , handing him the two nickels . " Expect people to carry their own on Sunday . " She saw the girl looking around vaguely . " Right through those drapes , " she said . " Light on the left . " She would have to go back later and see that everything was in place . She looked back toward the fountain and saw that everyone else had left , gone home to Sunday dinner with the family and an afternoon of reading the papers and listening to the radio . It was a good time for families , she thought , looking at the man in the phone booth and spreading the counter rag to dry . She was considering whether to ask Mrs. Harriman for dinner when she saw the boy in the doorway . She looked wearily at his cowboy ? suit . " I said Friday . " " That was ice . " " Then what 's this ? " " Candy . I got a nickel , " He held it up while his little brother sidled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel , too ? " The smaller boy nodded and pulled on his brother 's coat . " Nickel ai n't much nowadays . What if I told you candy was six cents ? " The boy 's face darkened . " All of it ? " " Pres. ' near . You look it over ; we 'll see . " The man had come out of the phone booth . and the boys stood looking at him glumly , motionless before his height . " Hi , boys , " he said , and the younger one turned away in confusion . " I got a boy about your size , " he told the older one , who looked skeptical . The smaller boy held up four fingers . " Is he this many ? " " More than that . " " Is he six ? " the older one said . " Seven . " " Oh . " After a moment he looked up . " Can he ride a bike ? " The man frowned . " Not  --  just now . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy ran off in delirious delight to the candy case . " Why not ? " the younger one said , lingering . " Why ca n't lie ? " " Well , he ? " He straightened and turned to Mrs. Lang . " How far is it to the station , please ? " " About a minute , " she said . " Walk left , last building you come to . " The boy was tugging at his trouser leg . " What 's the matter with him ? " He put his hand on the boy 's head . " Now do n't you trouble yourself , fellow . " " Is he sick ? I was sick yesterday . " The girl was coming from the back and he moved to meet her . " It 's on time , " he said . DRUG STORE : " Oh . " The girl paused . " How long ? ? " He looked at his watch . " Pretty soon . " She tried to smile . " Well , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on her elbow and they stood looking at each other . " I had croup , " the boy said . " What 's he got ? " The girl put her hand over his , and Mrs. Lang , watching the dust gathering in the- air outside , turned suddenly to stir the chili . It had stuck to the bottom of the pan and she had to lift it from the hot-table to scrape it loose . It took all her mind , doing it . She was still working on it when she heard the train whistle and she looked up in alarm . It sounded again , nearer . " Mister , " she said , hurrying forward , " there 's a short-cut through there ? " " Thank you . " He picked up his suitcase . " Thank you , " the girl said softly and started to follow him onto the porch . The man had turned so that he was facing her . He was not wearing a hat and the wind blew a lock of hair over his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment before catching on his shoulder , and it was the way , Mrs. Lang recalled , Jimmy 's had been in the picture . The girl stepped forward . " No , " he said , and her face stiffened , Mrs. Lang noticed , like he had struck her , like he 'd struck her hard . " But I thought  --  we did n't have much time ? " He shook his head . " You stay here . " He set his suitcase down and for a moment held her thin elbows between his hands . She stepped back . " You stay right here . " And suddenly he was gone through the short-cut and only a whirlwind of dust moving in the road . M RS . LANG let the dust hit - her and go past before she moved . She could hear the grinding of the train now , and behind her the smaller sound , the girl 's footsteps hurrying through the store . She walked slowly to the hack room and drew the curtains aside . In the darkness the girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed . Mrs. Lang had seen people pray that way . Shc looked at the girl 's hands , holding hard , and felt the girl 's shoulder quiver at her touch . The phone was ringing , but it could ring . " Miss Taylor , " she said . " I 'm all ? " The girl shook visibly . " Go away . " Mrs. Lang walked to the telephone and lifted the receiver . " This is Otis Taylor . Is my girl ? " She dropped the receiver back in place and went behind the fountain . For a long time she did not move . She had meant to get back to work  --  the glass panels of the cosmetics case needed cleaning , and it was a good ? time to sweep , during the noon hour . But she stood , seeing other things . The store rose like a box ' before her , and she saw it new and painted as it had once been . The sun glinted on the bicycles outside . The September wind held a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghostlike from sight . Mrs. Lang stood motionless among ghosts , confronting them with her hard eyes . She was surprised that she could hear her own breathing . Her hands were shaking and slowly she lowered her eyes . She could see herself in the polished top of the steam table . " Miss Taylor ? " she said a moment later , from the doorway . The girl did not move . " Do n't you want to see what he left you ? " She held the box in her arms . Quietly she read aloud , without seeing the words , " For one most dear . " The girl turned , lifted them , drew them close . " That 's better , " Mrs. Lang said , as the girl lowered her head among the roses . " You go ahead , " she said , rubbing the girl 's back the way she had rubbed Mr. Lang 's when he came in tired . " You go right ahead . Better that way . " After a moment she let the curtains fall behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil and paper . " Dear Jimmy , " she wrote , " the roses are here since early and my they at e lovely so fine of you to send them and so many , I have never seen so many before . Now I am wondering about you  --  silly old mom , you know . Are you all right ? " She put the pencil in her mouth and thought . " I am fine , " she added . " IIey . " She looked up and heard the coin tapping on the candy case . " We 're ready now . " She got up slowly and slid the chair beneath the table . She looked down at the paper , turned it over , and laid the pencil carefully on top . " Okay , kids , " she said . " What 's yours ? "
