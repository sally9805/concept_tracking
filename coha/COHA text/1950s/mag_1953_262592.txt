THE SILENT WORLD ( 266 pp. ) - Captain J. Y. Cousteau - Harper ( $4 ) . <P> When the French Poet Grard de Nerval was asked why he walked a lobster on a leash down a Paris boulevard one day in the 1840s , he replied : " He knows the secrets of the sea . " Until very modern times , most of the sea 's secrets have been known only to the sea 's inhabitants , and they never tell . In the last two decades , however , a new species has joined the finny tribe : the men-fish , who , with flippers on their feet and an air tank on their backs , go down into the waters and come back to tell what they have seen . <P> In The Silent World , a French navy captain named Jacques-Yves Cousteau , inventor of the " aqualung , " describes his underwater adventures with a scientist 's care and a poet 's feeling . <P> Rapture of the Depths . Cousteau perfected his seagoing lung in 1945 . The key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air supply to the diver 's demand and the water pressure . The outfit weighs about 45 lbs . above water ; submerged , the man and the machine when properly ballasted weigh hardly a pound . <P> A diver , merely by filling or emptying his lungs , can change his waterborne weight by as much as 12 lbs . Let a diver deflate his lungs and he sinks like a stone ; inflate them , he pops up like a cork ; intermediate effects are easily learned . But descent below 300 ft. becomes increasingly dangerous . One reason for this is something Author Cousteau calls , from experience , the " rapture of the great depths . " <P> The rapture , which comes on at about 200 ft. , is apparently caused by the oversaturation of the nervous system with nitrogen or carbon dioxide under the increased pressure . " The first stage , " writes Cousteau , " is a mild anesthesia , after Which the diver becomes a god . If a passing fish seems to require air , the crazed diver may tear out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish as a sublime gift . " <P> Cousteau describes one attack in detail : " My mind was jammed with conceited thoughts and antic joy . I struggled to fix my brain on reality , to attempt to name the color of the sea about me ... navy blue , aquamarine and Prussian blue . The debate would not resolve . The sole fact I could grasp was that there was no roof and no floor in the blue room . . . <P> " Childhood nightmares overruled my mind . I was ill in bed , terrorized with the realization that everything in the world was thick . My fingers were sausages . My tongue was a tennis ball . My lips swelled grotesquely on the mouth grip . The air was syrup . The water jelled around me as though I were smothered in aspic . I hung witless on the rope . Standing aside was a smiling , jaunty man , my second self , perfectly self-contained , grinning sardonically at the wretched diver . He ordered that I unloose the rope and go on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth-marker , 297 feet down ... In my bisected brain the satisfaction was balanced by satirical self-contempt . . . Back at 264 feet , the rapture vanished suddenly , inexplicably and entirely . "
