txt The Agriculture Committee of the House of Representatives called on the Secretary of Agriculture today tp extend price supports to cattle immediately lest " economic 1J aster " overcome producers . The request was made in a formal resolution adopted late this afternoon on the basis of conditions of distress found by an investigating subcommittee . The Secretary , Ezra Taft Benson , said earlier in the day that he was exploring the means of expanding the Government 's livestock purchase program to ease the crisis . He made no mention , however , of bringing cattle under the department 's price-support program . The Agriculture Committee contended that it was necessary to put an immediate floor under the price of cattle to ease the economic plight of drouglAt-ridden livestockI producers and " to prevent the fast liquidation of herds that now threatens the future meat supplies . of the consumer public . " The resolution was drafted this morning and presented to the committee by its subcommittee on livestock , of which Representative William S. Hill of Colorado is chairman . Farmer Getting 22% Less Choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 22 per cent below last year 's levels . Lower grades range , on the average , from slightly more than $20 to about $9 . The latter prices are from 24 to 31 per cent below the levels that the farmers and ranchers got a year ago . The Secretary of Agriculture has discretionary authority to support the price of any farm commodity by loans to producers , by purchases of the commodity and by other means . Heretofore , there has been no price floor on beef cattle , although supports are maintained on the prices of wheat , corn , cotton , tobacco , peanuts , rice , dairy products and other commodities . However , the Government is now engaged in the purchase of 238 , - 000,000 pounds of beef as an emergency measure . It was this program that Secretary Benson said might be expanded . He talked to reporters on leaving an earlier meeting of the Agriculture Committee at which the beef price problem had not been discussed . He had attended the session to answer questions about plans for reorganizing his department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of funds available from customs collections to subsidize exports of beef to private purchasers in other countries . The difference between the domestic price and the final sales price would be made up by // the Government from the customs funds , known as Section 32 Funds . ( These were made available by the Tariff Act of 1930 for the removal I of surplus farm commodities from ; the market . I Part of the present purchase program is being financed by Section 32 funds . The rest of the cost is being born by the Foreign Operations Administration , which is buying beef for shipment abroad , Under the Mutual Security ProI gram . Mr. Benson said his aides were conferring with officials of : this agency , too , in an effort to expand its purchases of beef . " We are pushing everything to Abe limit , " he commented . The Agriculture Committee , headed by Representative Clifford R. Hope , Republican of Kansas , said that beef prices should be supported " at approximately present levels , adjusted for seasonal variations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to slaughter cattle graded as " U. S. choice . " Direct Assurances Wanted The committee , however , also ' urged Secretary Benson to an- , flounce immediately that " the present beef purchase program will be , extended and implemented in a ' manner which will assure cattle , producers in all parts of the coun-1 try a price for non-fat cattle adequately reflecting Government prices paid for canned and frozen , beef bought under the program . " This should include , if necessary , direct Government purchase of cattle for processing at markets where facilities are available , the committee stated . " In the opinion of the committee , " according to a statement re'leased by the group , " there will be little or no occasion for the Department of Agriculture actually Ito purchase choice beef or otherIwivotarry on an active price support operation under this program . lAt the present level of consumer income and beef consumption , there is no reason for the price of beef to go below present levels . " The committee believes , thereforeNhat this portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Government and would give cattle feeders and , stockers the assurance they need to stabilize their operations . " Otherwise , the statement said , " panic " liquidations of stock are likely to occur , meaning high prices for consumers when scarcities occur in the future . Secretary Benson meanwhile issued a report indicating that the spread between the price of beef on the hoof and choice meat on the dinner table had not widened to any appreciable degree in the last year and a half of sharp declines in cattle prices . The department is conducting an inquiry into the margin between prices received by farmers for their cattle and retail prices . The preliminary findings , though , indicate that the spread is somewhat wider now than before the outbreak of the Korean conflict in June , 1951 , Mr. Benson said , These findings relate to choice grade beef and cattle only . Of most concern  --  and still to be determined ? is the trend in the margins for lower grades of meat and cattle . The prices of the lower grades , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest declines . It was the spread ? in these classes that prompted members of Congress to urge the Secretary to undertake the study . The investigation , being conducted by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics , has made clear , Mr. Benson reported , that the " most difficult and troublesome " problem has to do with the lower grades of beef  --  good , commercial , utility and canner-cutter . Field Studies Arranged " Within the next few weeks , " he said , " the work now under way should throw considerably more light on the question which cattle ' producers and others are asking , as to why retail prices remain high despite a serious drop in cattle prices . " No statistics relating to the lower grades are available since the department has never kept records of them , so arrangements have been made for actual field studies , the Secretary declared . The gathering and , analysis of statistical material immediately available on choice beef is almost complete , he said , and records substantiate the 6 per cent rise in beef ' at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statistics . The increase in beef has been a major factor in raising the B.L.S. cost-of-living index to a new high point . The bureau 's retail prices of meat in urban centers are chiefly f , choice grade cuts of beef . " Our records indicate , " Mr. Benson said , " that the rise since July 1 in retail prices traces back to the substantial rise in prices of carcass beef to retailers and to the increase in prices of around $5 per hundredweight for choice and prime grade steers in central markets which took place in the first half of July . " Restaurant Study Also Due " The rise in the prices of prime and choice beef steers which took place in early July has been maintained fairly well , " the Secretary said . " Furthermore , current calculations indicate that farmers selling choice grade animals are getting about 66 cents out of the retail dollar for choice grade cuts as of mid-August , compared with about 60 cents in mid-June and early July and 70 cents a year earlier . " Efforts also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , will permit an analysis of I changes in prices charged by selected groups of restaurants for meat dishes . Since the inquiry started , several cattle groups have renewed demands either for a Federal floor under lower grade cattle , which flooded markets as a result of the drought and price declines in cattle states , or for Government buying of cattle .
