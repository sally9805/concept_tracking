EVER since the mournful 1928 presidential-election showing of New York 's Al Smith ( 87 electoral votes v. 444 for Herbert Hoover ) , the Democratic Party has generally accepted as political gospel this proposition : a Roman Catholic is a fatal liability on a national ticket and is therefore not to be considered . <P> But in the late preconvention season of 1956 , two Catholics-Massachusetts Senator John Kennedy and New York Mayor Robert Wagner-rank high among Democratic vice-presidential possibilities . One reason : a confidential survey now in the hands of selected Democratic leaders , e. - g. , Harriman Adviser Carmine De Sapio and Stevenson Campaign Manager James Finnegan ( both Catholics ) . The survey 's fundamental thesis : Democratic presidential chances in November may well depend upon getting a Catholic on the national ticket . <P> " Tke Al Smith Myth . " The paper was prepared under the supervision of Connecticut 's Democratic State Chairman John Bailey , himself a Catholic , who strongly favors a national ticket of Protestant* Adlai Stevenson and Kennedy . It concedes only that " Democratic margins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nominated for Vice President . It quickly adds : " It is apparent that a Democratic Catholic vice-presidential nominee , although admittedly prejudices would be stirred , would lose no electoral votes for the ticket simply because a handful of Southerners or Republicans would not support him . " <P> Before Bailey 's researchers could get on with their case , they had first to deal with the matter of Al Smith . " The ' Al Smith myth , ' " says the paper , " is one of the falsest myths in politics . The year 1928 was a Republican year , regardless of who was on either ticket . It was a year for ' drys ' like Hoover , not ' wets ' like Smith . " <P> All to Ike . The ' Catholic vote , says the paper , is " far more important than its numbers-about one out of every four voters who turn out-because of its concentration in the key states and cities of the North . " The paper lists 14 states with 261 electoral votes : New York ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Illinois ( 30% ) , New Jersey ( 39% ) , Massachusetts ( 50% ) , Connecticut ( 49% ) , Rhode Island ( 60% ) , California ( 22% ) , Michigan ( 24% ) , Minnesota ( 24% ) , Ohio ( 20% ) , Wisconsin ( 32% ) , Maryland ( 21% ) , and Montana ( 22% ) . <P> " In 1940 , 13 of these states with 240 electoral votes went Democratic , without which the Democrats would have lost the election . In 1944 , twelve of these states with 221 electoral votes went Democratic , without which the Democrats would have lost the election . In 1948 , eight of these states with 125 electoral votes went Democratic , without which the Democrats would have lost the election . <P> " In 1952 , none of these states went Democratic , all 261 of their electoral votes went to Eisenhower , thus making possible the first Republican victory in 24 years .
