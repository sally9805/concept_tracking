" Banks , " wrote FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover in a recent warning sent to bankers , " are an almost irresistible attraction for that element of our society which seeks unearned money . " Hoover urged that , to resist , banks install armed guards , electronic alarms , tear gas and other protective devices . All these cost money , which banks are reluctant to spend , a fact that makes them even more irresistible . <P> One morning last week three men accosted a young New York bank clerk as he was leaving his home in New York City 's borough of Queens . They ushered him into his Ford at gunpoint and drove with him the 14 blocks to his office , a branch of the Bank of the Manhattan Co. ( which had just merged with Chase National to become the nation 's second largest bank ) . They waited on the sidewalk outside . When the manager arrived he was stopped , too . " This is n't funny , " he snapped . One of the bandits , flashing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not kidding . " <P> At 8:52 , with all the bank employes accounted for , the bandits entered , herded eleven people into a 6 by 5 ft. vault , whose inner gate they locked with a chain and padlock foresightedly brought for the purpose . " Thank God they did n't close the vault doors , " said one prisoner . The head teller collapsed in a faint and the others kept quiet . " I hugged the wall , " said one later . " I was n't going to get fresh . " The hold-up men had eight minutes before opening time , and that was enough . By 9 a.m. the three bandits were quietly driving away with $305,243 in bills , the most money ever taken in a U.S. bank robbery . <P> The bandits had planned carefully . During the hold-up one said : " We 've been casing this joint for six months . " They knew the bank employees ' names and faces . They also knew that the vaults contained an extra $200,000 that day to meet local payrolls . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manhattan Co. ' s 35 branch banks in Queens , three of which were recently robbed . Until this month , none of the 35 had any armed guards or protective alarms .
