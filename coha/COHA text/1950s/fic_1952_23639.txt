A Present for a Good Girl A Story by Nadine Gordimer Drawings by W. T. Mars 0 N AN afternoon in September a woman came into the jeweler 's shop . The two assistants , whose bodies had contrived , as human bodies doggedly will , to adapt the straight , hard stretch of the glass showcases to a support , sagged , hips thrust forward , elbows leaning in upon their black crepe-deChine-covered stomachs , and looked at her without a flicker , waiting for her to go . For they could see that she did not belong there . No woman in a frayed and shapeless old leg-horn hat , carrying a bulging crash shopping bag decorated in church bazaar fashion with wool embroidery , and wearing stained old sandshoes and cheap thick pink stockings that concertinacd round her ankles could belongin the jeweler 's shop . They knew the kind ; simple , a bit dazed , shortsighted , she had wandered in mistaking it for the chemist 's , two doors up . She would peer round stupidly , looking as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handsome canteens of cutlery , with their beautifully arranged knives spread like a flashing keyboard in their velvet beds , and the pretty little faces of the watches in their satin cases , and the cool , watery preening of the cut glass beneath its special light , she would mumble and shamble herself out again . So they stood , un . moved , waiting for her to go . But , uncomfortably , she did n't go . She advanced right in , half-defiantly , half-ingra-tiatingly  --  she gave a little sniff to herself as if to say : Comc on , now ! Well , why should n't I  --  and put the shopping bag down on the counter . Then she gave the hat a pull , and stood waiting , not looking at the young ladies . But still they did not move . Their half-closed eyes rested with faint interest upon the crash shopping bag , as upon some fossil discovery . The third assistant , who was sitting at a table threading wedding rings in order on a velvet rod , pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossness as lethargy could muster : Weil , someone must see what the old creature wants . " Yes ? " she said . It was all ready in the woman 's mouth ; as a child comes threshing up out of water with bulging cheeks , and lets out all its mouthful of breathlessness and enthusiasm in one great gasp , she said : " Good afternoon , miss , there 's a green bag in the window , miss  --  in the corner , right down near the front . I want to get one for my daughter , she 's always talking about a green one  --  and I wondered , you see , it 's really only for Christmas , but I thought . . . " ? and her pupils , that seemed to swim like weak small fish in the colorless wetness of her eyes with their underlids drooping down in a reddish peak , darted wildly . Like a beggar exhibiting valuable sores , she smiled pn a mouth of gaps and teeth worn like splinters of driftwood . " You want the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up , then down . " Well , how much is it ? " said the woman , in the coy tone of a confessed secret , screwing up one eye . But the young assistant would not be drawn into such intimacy . " I 'll have a look ... , " she said , resigned to wasting her time , and came out from behind the counter . Slow and measured , she unfastened the window catches , leaned in , and drew out the bag . The old woman pressed forward over the counter , her tongue feeling anxiously along the dark canyons of her teeth . She leaned on her elbows ; and her left hand , with the bones and great knobs that punctuated each joint sliding beneath tough slack skin like that of a tortoise , had taken up a curious pose , hanging indolent from the wrist , like the hand of a Louis XVI dandy pinching up MAGAZINE snuff . " Maim , " she said , fumbling the air round the bag , wanting to touch it . She breathed hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright locked fangs of the zipper and felt for the price tag inside , the girl held her breath against the fusty sourness of the old woman 's breath . " Four-fifteen , " said the assistant at last . " Four-fifteen , four-fifteen , " nodded the woman sucking in her lower , lip . " Ninety-five shillings , " said the assistant , hand on hip . " Ah , " said the woman , lifting her eyebrows under the flop of the zany hat , as if that explained away any difficulty . " It 's got a mirror ? " she asked . " Yes , " said the assistant ironically . You ca n't afford it , said the hand on her hip . " Oh , I 'm sure she 'll like it , " chatted the woman , fidgeting with the pockets and gadgets of the leather interior . " She loves green , you know . Everythink must be green . All her dresses and everythink . When I tell her it 's supposed to be unlucky , she just says , Mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green bag ? " " Then you should certainly take it for her , madam , " said the assistant . Another minute or two and the old thing would be gone , muttering she 'd see . . . she 'd speak to her husband . . . " You see , I thought I 'd get it for her for Christmas , " said the woman . She played with the knobbly string of yellow beads that stood up like boulders on the bony plateau of her chest . " Yes , better take it when you see it . " Habit prompted the assistant : " It might be gone , if you wait . You can put it away till Christmas . " " Oh , well , I could n't take it now ? " she said . " You see I have n't got the money on me now . " " Well , we could put it aside for you until tomorrow , " said the assistant . The woman stood blinking at her subserviently , with the smirk of cunning innocence worn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You see , clear , " she said in a hushed small voice , " I thought perhaps you 'd let me pay off for it , like . " Her face was drawn into a question . " Ca n't do that , Miss Pierce , " chimed in the other two assistants at once , like the representatives of some great power waking up halfway through a conference in time to boom a veto on some mewling little voice they have n't even heard . " Mr. Cano is n't in . " " You see , the manager is n't in at the moment , " offered the assistant . " Oh , I do n't expect you to let me take it ? " protested the woman , smiling at the young ladies as if they had just done her the most charming favor . " I just wanted to pay some-think down on it , then you could keep it here for me , and I 'd come in every week and pay somethink more off it . " She grinned at them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the girl Miss Pierce , not prepared for this . " You ca n't do it without Mr. Cano 's permission , " stated the other two . " You ca n't do it without him . " " All right , all right , I know , " said Miss Pierce . " How much did you want to pay now ? " she asked the woman . Subdued with tension , the old creature grappled down in the shopping bag and dragged up a thin purse . " I could let you have ten bob , " she said . " And how long to pay the balance ? " " Well , until Chr ? until just about the fifteenth of December . " " It 's out of the question , Miss Pierce , " said one of the others in a high voice . The girl heard it behind her ; in front of her the old woman grinned on her bad teeth , like a dog continuing to wag its tail even at the person who approaches to take away the bone that enchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . Silently the woman took a ten-shilling note from the flat stomach of her purse , and waited in silence while the receipt was made out . The moment she had the receipt in her possession , and was folding it away in the purse and the purse away in the crash bag , a mood of lighthearted talkativeness seized her . She opened up into confidential mateyness like a Japanese paper flower joyously pretending to be a flower instead of a bit of paper as it . swells with water . She spoke only of her daughter . What her daughter always said , and what she always told her daughter . " You must know my daughter ? " site said , pooh-poohing the remote notion that the girl might n't . " You know , dear , she 's the cashierat the Grand Lyceum  --  fair girl , got a very good figure . . . ? " ? She had a peculiar way of speaking ; each " d " was a little step before which her voice hesitated , then hastily tripped over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a frequent patron of the cinema in question , but who was never reduced to buying her own seat , and so had never seen the cashier . " Yes , I think I have seen ? " " Wears a lot of green ? Got a quiet way of talking ? " went on the woman . " Of course you know her . It 's a good job , you know . She 's a clever girl  --  sharp as a needle . She 's been a good daughter to me , I must say . Not like some . That 's why I 'm glad I got that bag for her . She 's been wanting a green one for a long time ; I seen her , when we 've been walking along , stopping to look in the shop window . And when I 've asked her , she 's said , no , nothin ' , just looking generally . But I knew what it was all right ; sure enough , somewhere in the window there was always bound to be a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her flattened heels leaning over the sides of the old sandshoes , the two assistants stood looking at Miss Pierce . - Well , do n't say we said it was all right . You know Mr. Cano ? " " Peculiar-looking woman , " reproached the other one . " Did you see the way she was dressed ! She looks to me as if she drinks , too . " " Well , why do n't you ever do anything , anyway ? Why do you always wait for me to come forward ? " flashed out Miss Pierce , in a sudden temper . T wo weeks went by and then the woman came in , with an air of wanting to get her ten-shilling note safely paid in before it " went " on other things . She asked to see the bag again , and repeated to her fellow conspirator , Miss Pierce , the details of her daughter 's taste , color preferences , and mental powers . To get rid of the woman , the girl pretended to have taken particular note of the fair-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyceum . " The mother became almost speechless with an excess of quiet pride : she seemed to go off into a sort of dream , leaning on the counter , saying , very low , " Yes , I 'd like to see her face on Christmas morning . . . I 'd like to see her face ... That I would ... " Putting away her second receipt with the greatest of care , she went slowly out of the shop , as if she were walking straight off the edge of a cloud . " Funny old stick , " said Miss Pierce , writing , " Balance , ? 3.15 , " on the parcel . The next time the woman came in she was embarrassingly garrulous , and insisted on offering Miss Pierce a cigarette from an enameled tin case picturing two yellow cockatoos and fastened with a catch which was evidently rather tricky , because she fumbled such a long time over getting it open . Under the same frayed leghorn hat , she looked queerer than ever ; her face was stiff , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mauvish lipstick on her mouth . She paid only five shillings , with profuse apologies : " As God 's my witness , I 'll pay the lot off at the beginning of the month , " she said loudly , raising her right band . " As God 's my witness . . . " Her hand dropped and suddenly she smiled , sweetly , sweetly . " For my little girl . my little girl , " she whispered , evidently to herself . Poor Miss Pierce smiled back fiercely in embarrassment . And suddenly the woman was gone . The third time she came it was in the morning , and it seemed to the young Miss Pierce that the woman was really much older than she had noticed : she walked so falteringly , the crash shopping bag was much too heavy for hcr , and her eyes looked red in her bluish-pale face . Had she been crying , perhaps ? Miss Pierce thought perhaps the poor old thing had to work very hard at housework ; there was a faint smell of methylated spirits about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why it must be a fortune to her ! Miss Pierce won-dered if a peroxide blond cashier from the Grand Lyceum was worthy of it . Anyway , the green handbag was another fifteen shillings nearer being paid for . And that , it seemed , was as far as it would ever get . W EEKS went by , and the woman did not appear ; Miss Pierce hid the bag away from the businesslike eyes of Mr. Cano . " What 's this , " he would say , " How long ? ? Put it back into stock . Return the woman 's deposit to her . . . " So the green bag lay waiting behind a pile of hand-tooled leather writing cases . An intoxication of buying grew upon the town as every day Christmas moved up a notch nearer , and soon the three assistants were elbowing one another out of the way as they smiled , persuaded , suggested , to the timorous , the vacillating , the imperious who came to buy . Miss Pierce really did not even have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shop-girl 's attention was already wrangled into half-a-dozen divisions by half-a-dozen equally demanding customers as it was ; there was no small shred left that was not immediately snatched up by someone who had been waiting fully three-quarters of an hour to see a tortoise-shell powder bowl . But in the fine high frenzy of half-past four on the last Saturday afternoon before Christmas , Miss Pierce was interrupted . " Your customer 's here " ? one of the other two young ladies prodded her elbow . " What ? " said the girl , dodging the blinding demand of eyes . " The green handbag , " said the other , smiling with great brilliance , and diving back . The harassed girl dodged in and out to the A PRESENT FOR other side of the shop . In the dazed preoccupation that results as a kind of spiritual sunstroke from overexposure to the question and demand of a daylong crowd , she could not recall any green handbag . But then she saw the woman in the battered garden-party leg-horn standing just within the doorway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behind the writing cases . She went forward with a quick smile . " S'ere . . . , " said the woman , handing out a pound note as if to a blank wall , " ' F you 've sorl thabag t'anyone . . . I pay'dfirit and you 've got norite fcrooka poorwoman . " ? Her voice whined through the persuasive buzz of the shop . Harsh fumes surrounded her as rising incense round some image . Miss Pierce looked at her in astonishment . Dropping the crash bag , the woman turned to look at it , lying on the floor , as if it were some animal that had just crawled to her feet . She tried to pick it up , but could not . Half bent to the floor , she looked up at Miss Pierce with a sudden chuckle , like a naughty child . Miss Pierce stood quite still . " Why'd'you keepm'waiting , whydonchu giviterme , " said the woman with great dignity . There was a red poppy , the kind that charitable organizations give away on collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large safety pin . Miss Pierce trembled like a trapped rabbit . " Youdonwana be'fraiduvme , " said the woman with a sudden cunning flash of understanding . " Sorry . . . " She wagged her head , sorry . . . Miss Pierce burned with guilt . " I 'll just get  --  I mean , see ... , " she tried . " Musn be'fraid uvaporeolwoman . Iwan the ? the-bag " ? stopped and thought hard " the-the green bag I got f'my daughter . Y'know my daughter ? " she urged , clutching Miss Pierce 's arm . " Course y'know my daughter ? " She stopped and smiled , closing her eyes . " S'ere , " she said , putting down the pound note . " But that 's not enough , " said Miss Pierce very loudly , as if talking to a deaf person . " Not enough . You owe two-pounds-fifteen on the bag " ? holding up two fingers ? " twopounds-fifteen . " . " Wbas ' sat ? " said the woman , stupidly . Her face grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she muttered . " But you have n't paid for it , you see , " said Miss Pierce miserably . Mr. Cana was frowning at her through the crowd ; she could sense his one twitching eyebrow , questioning . " Howmuchwasit ? " whispered the woman , winking at her and leaning over into her face . " Four-pounds-fifteen . You remember . " " Wasit ? " she giggled . " Wasit . " " You have to pay another pound and fifteen shillings . " The woman knelt on the floor and felt down amongst the lumps and bulges of the crash shopping bag , collapsed on its side on the floor . At last she got up again . Some anchor in the heart that even the vast swelling uncharted seas of drunkenness could not free her of , pulled at her . Underneath her stiff face , her glassed-out eyes , it was horrible to see that she was alive and struggling . The silliness of being drunk would not come up to save her . " I waned to getit for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . " The broken brim of the hat hid her face as she felt her way out . The whole shop was watching , each man from the pinnacle of his own self-triumph. 1 T HAD hardly turned back to its own business again when a pale girl , violently white-faced , with the thin pale hair of a slum child , swept trembling into the shop . She stood there leaning forward on her toes , shuddering with anger . Just behind her , held leashed by the terrible look of her eye , was the old woman , open-mouthed . The girl 's eyes searched desperately round the shop . They seemed to draw Miss Pierce out from behind the counter : she came slowly forward . A flash of angry disgust passed from the girl to the old woman , who blinked beneath it as from a whip . " Now what is it ? " blurted the girl . " What does she owe here ? " " She 's paid some , you see , " ventured Miss Pierce . They were like doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me how much , and I 'll pay it , " the girl cut in violently . Under the pale spare skin of her neck , her heart flew up madly , as a bird dashing again and again at its cage . " Oh , it 's 241 right , " faltered Miss Pierce , avoiding looking at the old woman . " She 's not so very much behind in her payments . It 's not absolutely necessary that she take the bag now . " Hot bright tears at the recollection of some recent angry scene fevered the girl 's eyes . " Tell me how much it is , " she whispered fiercely , crazily . She swallowed her tears . " She ca n't pay , " she said , with a look of hopeless disgust at the old woman . The bag was four-pounds-fifteen . She owes two-fifteen on it . " " A bag for four-pounds-fifteen , " said the girl bitterly , so overwhelmed by a fresh welling of furious despair and irritation that her pale eyes filled with bright tears again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand sank leaden at her side , as if defeated in the desire to strike . " What next . Always something . Some rubbish . Now a hag . What for ? You people give her things . She 's not responsible . I 've had just about enough of it. ? She ought to be in a home , she should . I ca n't stand it any longer . " The old woman looked out at her from under her eyelids . Trembling , the girl jerked out two pounds and fifteen shillings in silver and gave it up with a gesture of hopeless impotence to Miss Pierce . Miss Pierce handed to her the parcel containing the green handbag . The girl looked at it for a moment , with an expression of quizzical , sullen disgust . She looked as if she would have liked to hurl it away , as far as her arm could . Then she picked it up , and went out of the doorway . " Come on , " she ordered in a low , dead voice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
