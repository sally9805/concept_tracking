On a warm Indian summer afternoon last week , a vigorous , white-haired man , caddying his own golf bag with an aluminum tow cart , strode briskly down the fairways of the Royal Ottawa Golf Club . Sporting a jaunty white cap , grey flannels and a checked shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbows , Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent neither looked nor acted his 74 years . <P> Only two months ago the Prime Minister 's health seemed likely to become a critical issue in Canadian politics . Toward the close of the grueling , seven-month parliamentary session , St. Laurent seemed close to exhaustion . His political foes openly predicted that the Liberal chief would soon be forced to retire , and a few panicky members of his own party talked nervously of holding a snap election this autumn to cash in on St. Lau rent 's potent vote-getting leadership before it was too late . But top Liberal strategists were more confident ; all St. Laurent needed , they said , was a good vacation to be as vigorous as ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his summer home in St. Patrick , Que. , St. Laurent golfed almost daily , splashed around so regularly in the family swimming pool that he finally learned to swim ( previously he could only float on his back ) . He went back to Ottawa not only completely restored from last summer 's fatigue , but imbued with more political drive than he has shown for several years . <P> One of his first moves back in the capital was to spike all talk of an autumn election ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) . St. Laurent assured the Liberals that he was ready to lead an aggressive campaign next year . " If I feel then as I feel now , " he said , " I 'll want to go to all parts of Canada . " St. Laurent began a new practice of taking a different Cabinet Minister or official home to lunch with him every day , to talk politics and government business over the meal . He also drew up an ambitious schedule of personal appearances for every weekend during the fall and winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has already paid visits to Sherbrooke and Toronto . Last weekend he went to Montreal and Quebec City . <P> On his Toronto visit the Prime Minister received a handsome set of matched monogrammed golf clubs as a gift from the city . Less than 24 hours later , Louis St. Laurent was out on the Ottawa course testing his new equipment . He seemed to enjoy the exercise , playing with his daughter Madeleine ( Mrs. Hugh O'Donnell ) . But no one outside the family could say whether the set of championship sticks had any magical effect on Duffer St. Laurent 's chronically 100-plus game . As usual , he kept his score a deep secret .
