txt  | brought in about the same amount . There was thus available $72,000 per mile to pay the costs of railroad construction , where the cost was running from $100,000 to $150,000 per mile . It was this situation that caused the financial problem that the four builders had to solve . Bank loans and the sale of city and county bonds were the source of revenue that supplemented funds from government and company bonds , which in the end enabled the builders to complete the road across the mountains . Stanford testified before the 1887 Commission that when they finished the road over the mountains the company was $5,000,000 in debt , a statement that does not seem exaggerated in light of the fact that construction costs were so much greater than the money obtained from the sale of bonds . Once the mountains were passed , the government subsidy of $32,000 per mile , discounted to $24,000 per mile in gold , together with the company bonds , enabled the work to proceed without further financial complications . From the difference in the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley lands and the $48,000 per mile for the 150 miles of mountain construction , a situation arose that at that time and later caused a large amount of undeserved criticism of the builders . The acts of Congress that granted the subsidy bonds left it to the President of the United States to determine the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains , toward which the Union Pacific was building , as well as the western base of the Sierra Nevada , where the Central Pacific started to climb . In the latter case that point could have been anywhere from twenty to twenty-five miles from Sacramento . One of the granite outcrops of the Sierra Nevada was found at Rocklin , and this point was considered the base of the mountains as far as construction was concerned . That point was twenty-two miles east of Sacramento . However , it was to the interest of the Central Pacific builders to have the base of the mountains placed as near Sacramento as possible , as there the subsidy per mile changed from $16,000 to $48,000.  | They therefore fixed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sacramento , and a number of geologists of good repute were found who testified that the alluvial valley changed to a mountain formation at that point . J. W. Whitney , the state geologist , F. F. Beale , United States surveyor general for California , and J. F. Houghton , state surveyor general , wrote letters , the first and last locating the base of the mountains at Arcade Creek and the second , approximately midway between Sacramento and Folsom . With that evidence in front of him , the harassed Abraham Lincoln signed a paper fixing Arcade Creek as the beginning of the mountains . Geographically , this may have been true . From a construction standpoint it was incorrect , since there was no difference in the rolling plain for at least fifteen miles farther . The result was that the builders were able to obtain $450,000 face value additional subsidy bonds , but as the mileage of subsidy bonds at that rate was limited by the law to 150 miles , it merely moved the 150-mile section fifteen miles closer to Sacramento . Actually , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and increased the sum obtained from the government $240,000 , which in the end netted the builders less than $200,000 . The money obtained by this method came at a time when the builders were in desparate need of cash and helped in pushing the road up the mountains . Out of this subterfuge has grown the legend of the deceitfulness of the builders , a legend that is still going the rounds . In 1863 , California was a long distance from the eastern states . The Gold Rush of 1849 and the years that followed had spent itself , but California was still a mining state , with labor scarce and mostly undependable . The first decade of the great mining development on the Comstock at Virginia City and Gold Hill in Nevada was at its height , so that prospectors were searching the mountains of Nevada for more gold and silver mines . Some  | of the early California miners had gone back to farming , and for these reasons there was no labor group as it is now understood . This writer experienced the same difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Men would come to the construction camp dead broke and looking for work . Three weeks ' work would provide them with a grub stake and away they would go , searching for that Eldorado that ever lures the prospector . Again it may be noted that the few short railroads that had been built in California before 1863 had not brought into being organized contracting firms , which later become a fixture of railroads in the West . The first Central Pacific contract was given on December 26 , 1862 to Charles Crocker , who had resigned from the directorate of the company two days before . The contract was for eighteen miles of road and included the bridge over the American River . The contract was said to have been based on unit prices for various items . The work took from February , 1863 , to October , 1864 , to complete , and the payment was $50,000 in stock , $100,000 in bonds of the company , and the balance $250,000 in cash , total of $400,000 . Following the first Crocker contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins and Brother were given the contract for sections 19 and 20 , a section being substantially a mile in length . Following this , sections 21 to 24 were given to Truxton , Knox , and Ryan ; sections 25 to 27 to C. D. Bates ; sections 28 and 29 to S. B. Smith ; and sections 30 and 31 to Charles Crocker . It was probably on the insistence of Judah at an earlier date that this method was tried . It resulted in the failure of Collins and Brother to complete their work , which Charles Crocker was forced to finish . Those contracts cost $183,155 . Crocker received $11,600 in stock and $65,537.42 in cash . The delay caused by the segregation of contracts showed that this method could not be followed , since beyond section 31 , near Newcastle , the work grew heavier . It was followed by a  | third contract to Charles Crocker and Company for sections 32 to 43 that was extended , with or without a contract , to section 138 , the California state line . The total payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a total of $22,885,677.21 . The rolling stock , railroad iron , and other equipment for the Crocker contracts was supplied directly by the company . The final contract was awarded to the Contract and Finance Company in October , 1867 , and under it the road was completed to Promontory , Utah . The Contract and Finance Company was made up of the four Associates . Under the contract was included not only the construction but the full equipment of the road . The company was to complete the road , build all depots , station houses , turntables , and roundhouses , and furnish all the equipment , such as cars , locomotives , machine shops , freight shops , machinery in the shops ? in fact , everything necessary to the running of the road . The purchase and installation of rail , ties , and fittings were included . For this work the contracting company was paid $23,746,000 in cash and an equal amount in stock , for a total of $47,472,000 . It was claimed by Secretary Miller that the reason for forming the Contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their money into the work in order to make certain the completion of the road . In addition to awarding the contracts mentioned , Stanford went to Salt Lake City when the race with the Union Pacific was well on and contracted with Brigham Young for work by the Mormons on an extension from Promontory eastward , with the expectation of keeping the rival road out of the Salt Lake Valley . There he expended $751,964 on rights of way and construction , much of which was wasted . The Union Pacific had spent an even larger sum on grading work west of Promontory as far as Humboldt hells . All of this was squandered , since it resulted in two parallel graded roads across 200 miles of desert , only one road of which was used .  | After the junction of the roads , an arrangement was made by which the Central Pacific bought from the Union Pacific fortyseven and one half miles of its completed road eastward from Promontory to within five miles of Ogden , paying $1,502,000 in Central Pacific first-mortgage bonds and $1,338,000 in United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bonds . On a discount basis of 75 per cent , the cash value of the bonds was $2,130,000 , make the rate $45,000 per mile of railroad . While this history is concerned with the building of the original Central Pacific Railroad from Sacramento to Ogden , the affairs of the Central Pacific Company were involved with other railroads that formed the first rail connection with San Francisco , a logical deep-water terminus of a transcontinental railroad . That connection was made by means of the Western Pacific Railroad , which should not be confused with the existing road of that name , and also by the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad . To understand why this circuitous route was adopted , one must visualize the topography of the region between Sacramento and San Francisco . The modern road follows a very direct course , but in the decade of the sixties the physical obstacles were great . The river had to be crossed at Sacramento , where it was wide and deep , and subject to heavy floods that inundate the region as much as ten miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been necessary to find a way to cross Carquinez Strait . This strait , a mile in width , carries the corn bined water of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers from the Valley of California , as well as the ebb and flow of the tidal estuary . In later years the railroad trains were transported across the strait by huge ferry boats , and it was not until 1030 that a bridge was built to take their place . When the Central Pacific was building , another crossing would have had to be made from Oakland , on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay .  | to reach San Francisco . Therefore all of these difficulties were avoided by building south from Sacramento to Stockton and thence southwesterly over a low range of the coast mountains to San Jose , from which town the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad led north to San Francisco . The San Francisco and San Jose Railroad , following the line of the early Spanish development of the country , was projected in the fifties , but it was not completed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1864 . At a still later date is was continued southward . By 1868 the Central Pacific group became interested in the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad , which had been built by San Francisco capitalists , and in 1870 it became a part of the Central Pacific System . The location was mainly through a valley and no difficulties other than financial were encountered . The Western Pacific Railroad , from Sacramento to San Jose , was a more ambitious project , initiated by the same San Francisco interests that controlled the San Francisco and San Jose . The original grant to the Central Pacific contemplated that the road would be built to a point on San Francisco Bay , but the Central Pacific transferred whatever right it had in the grant to the projectors of the Western Pacific . These rights included land grants and government subsidy . The Western Pacific was organized in 1862 , and after an estimate of cost of $5,400,000 was made , the work was placed under contract . The road was located along fertile level valley lands except where it crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara Valleys , in which San Jose is located . The contractors proceeded with their work until 1867 , when they found themselves unable to complete the road . After negotiations , the road became the property of the Contract and Finance Company , which completed the construction . The road was 123 miles in length , and together with the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad represented a distance of about 173 miles between Sacramento and San Francisco . From a point five miles west of Ogden ,  | Utah , to San Jose , California , the distance was 861 miles . It was obvious even at that time that such a route was too circuitous to gain much traffic , so in September , 1868 , the San Francisco Bay Railroad was organized by the Associates and built by the Contract and Finance Company , It was twenty-six and one half miles in length , running from Oakland to Niles , on the Western Pacific . Entrance into San Francisco was obtained by ferries operated by two short railroad lines connecting with the ferries from the towns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Central Pacific in 1870 . These lines are mentioned because the statistics of the Central Pacific were given in the testimony before the 1887 Commission , together with those of the Western Pacific . When the line from Oakland to Niles was completed , the distance from Sacramento to San Francisco was reduced from 173 miles by way of San Jose , to 139 miles , which included the ferry distance across the Bay of San Francisco . Entrance into Sacramento was made over the tracks of the Sacramento Valley Railroad , making the length of the two railroads at that time 1491/2 miles . The roads are still operated as one system , a part of the Southern Pacific Company . No official company information is still available that would show the costs of the Central Pacific to the contractors , who at one and the same time were officers of the railroad . The books of Charles Crocker and Company and those of the Contract and Finance Company were undoubtedly destroyed to remove all record of the contractors ' costs . The investigation by the Congressional Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs as thus defined could be determined . The cost to the railroad company , however , is found in the testimony of Senator Stanford and in that of other officers of the company , especially in that of the secretary , Edward II . Miller , Jr . The statements carry practically to the end of 1869. although some of the funds included in this record was for work done in the succeeding year .  | The above figures are given for what they are worth as indicating about what the construction costs were to the railroad company . It will be noted from the above table that many payments were made from bonds rated at seventy-five cents on the dollar , which apparently was pretty close to the discount at which the bonds were sold . The Commission of 1887 employed an engineer to estimate what the Central Pacific alone had cost , taking into account all the facts then available , including , " All that appears in the evidence relating to the peculiar and difficult character of the work , to the excessive cost of building the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by snow and stormy weather , to the unusual item of costs arising out of the construction of snow sheds , and to the increased cost resulting from the rapidity with which the work was carried on and the necessity of expensive and unusual transportation of all material required for the construction of the road . " The conclusion reached was that the road from Sacramento to Promontory , Utah , and the purchase from the Union Pacific Railroad Company of forty-seven and one half miles , a total distance of 7371/2 miles , did not exceed $36,000,000 . This may be roughly compared with the cost from the table prepared by Mr. Miller . The total there given is $50,344,740 . Deducting the two items of the Western Pacific road of $3,355,420 , leaves a cost of the Central Pacific alone of $46,989,320 , or an average cost of $64,000 per mile . The difference between the two statements of cost merely represents differences that can occur when entirely different . bases are used in determining the result . Miller 's statement was made from the books of the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . The details from the original records of costs would merely repeat the story with the same result . The commission 's estimate was made after more than twenty years had passed from the time when the road was built and the money spent . While the engineer who prepared the  | estimate may have labored in good faith , it must be recognized that no man can , by any stretch of the imagination , rebuild the actual circumstances under which the builders labored . Again , the commission sat with the fixed purpose of showing that the four men of the railroad company , by employing the device of the construction company , had robbed the railroad of large sums of money . The commission 's adherence to this purpose detracts from the validity of its conclusions . The subject was complicated further by the difference in money value at that time . Government bonds were currency bonds with interest and principal payable in paper money , which was subject to wide variation . At one point during the Civil War , paper dollars were worth only forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Coast , a gold mining country , being made mainly in gold . After the close of the Civil War there were boom times , with the result that prices rose . Therefore labor costs and efficiency were considerably different in the decade of the sixties from what they were twenty years later . The meaning of the word " costs " depended entirely on the position of the estimator . It remains to consider the means by which the necessary funds were obtained to carry out the work of construction . Senator Stanford gave the only statement of the major arrangements , which was supplemented by a statement by Mr. Miller . Combined , the statement is as follows , the record being dated January 1 , 1870 , and including the Central Pacific and Western Pacific :  | It will be noted from the above table that the floating debt and amounts due the Credit and Finance Company of $12,500 , - 000 were not extinguished by the sales of the $10,039,120 of land bonds , which brought to the company $7,529,340 . In round numbers , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to the Contract and Finance Company . It also seemed that the contracting company owed the Associates $5,700,000 for money advanced , probably to form the capital of the company . The debt of the railroad company to the contracting company was apparently liquidated in 1871 by money obtained from the sale of the land grant bonds that were authorized in 1870 . The railroad company had given the contracting company its notes , dated October , 1869 , and May , 1870 . To liquidate these notes , 8,953 land bonds were sold at a rate of $865 per bond , which represented a return of $7,744,345 of cash and a discount of $1,208,665 . It may be assumed that substantially all of the return from the sales of these bonds was to pay for work on the railroad prior to January 1 , 1870 . The return is probably included in the item of $12,500,000 in the preceding table , together with other floating debts . The face value of these land bonds , $8,650,000 , must be added to the total of other bonds of $70,333,360 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonded debt of the railroad as of . January 1 , 1870 . The $7,744,45 received from the land bonds thus sold must be added to the total receipts of $52,034,060 from the other bonds and stock , making the total $59,778,405 . The sums realized from the sale of bonds were somewhat less , since there is included in the above amount direct land sales of $107,000 , and profit and loss of $1,610,000 . It should be noted that the issue of land bonds was for $10,000,000 , the total sum realized was $8,643,661.82 , and the discount was $1,356,338.18 . These latter sales were made mostly from 1874 to 1878 and had nothing to do with the original railroad . They indicate the relatively high rates paid for money at that time , as the bonds bore 6 per , cent interest .  | These statements of bond issues and of the sums realized have been given to show the magnitude of the transactions that were necessary to build the Central Pacific and Western Pacific . However , the statements are not necessarily exact . The work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driven at Promontory . Much work remained to be done all along the line , and in the next five years it was necessary to replace the iron rails with steel . A railroad is never finished , and as standards change , bridges must be rebuilt , ties removed , wooden trestles filled , new rolling stock added , and old , worn-out stock discarded . Only a general statement can be made , and from the cost and other figures given by the railroad officials it may be stated that the cost of the 860.66 miles of railroad from San Jose to Ogden was $58,000,000 . Of this sum , the Central Pacific cost $52,000,000 ; and the Western Pacific , $6,000,000 . The bonded debt attributed to this stage of the development was about $79,000,000 , of which sum , a portion not known may have been devoted to other purposes , such as building the line from Niles to Oakland . The work of building feeder lines and absorbing other lines already constructed went on even while the main line was under construction , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad company from the general figures available is impossible . The operation of completed portions of the line was an important element in furnishing money for the construction forces and in meeting the growing interest on the company bonds and borrowings . As soon as the road reached the junction with the line leading north at Roseville , passenger and freight trains operated . At Newcastle there was a long delay in construction , and so trains from Sacramento met stages that ran to the mining towns . The same was true at Colfax . At Dutch Flat , passengers and freight were transferred to stages running over the Inoue tains to Reno and the Comstock towns . At Cisco , where there was another long building delay , a similar arrangement was made .  | The earnings and operating costs summarized by Miller for the Commission of 1873 are as follows , the figures being for gold coin : The operation of the road thus furnished money that not only paid bond interest but also contributed a substantial amount of cash for paying construction costs . The profit and loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was without doubt made up of cash received from operations . In 1862 , when the road was organized , the capital stock was set at $8,500,000 , the shares having at all times a par value of $100 a share . The California law required that the capital stock should equal in value any bonded debt incurred . As the work proceeded and the scope of the enterprise enlarged , it became evident that an increase in the capital was necessary , so in 1864 the capitalization was raised to $20,000,000 . Later , in 1868 , it was found that this amount was not sufficient and it was raised to $100,000,000 . The disposal of the stock during the period to January 1 , 1870 , together with issues to care for debts incurred , was as follows , the amounts being expressed at par value :  | In his testimony before the Commission of 1887 , Senator Stanford testified that the stock issue was about $54,000,000 . That figure was reached by including stock issued on the construction of other roads as extensions to the Central Pacific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table In considering only the Central and Western Pacific Railroads , the figure of $48,355,000 should be used , although it is uncertain for what construction the two payments were made to the Contract and Finance Company . The assumption is that it was for the branch roads mentioned . It was freely admitted that the stock had little or no value when issued . In the first contracts Crocker rated the stock at fifty cents on the dollar , but this was soon reduced to thirty cents . Attempts were made , without success , to sell the stock , and the general opinion now is that it was worth only ten cents  | per share . When Crocker sold his holdings in the fall of 1871 , the stock was rated at thirteen cents a share . Attempts of the Associates to sell out to San Francisco capitalists failed , so that when Crocker returned from Europe in 1873 , he was forced take his stock back and resume his place in the directorate . At that time the $48,000,000 of stock was probably worth less than $5,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days merely represented the chance for future profit , provided the railroad became a paying proposition . When on September 13 , 1873 , the first dividend on the stock was paid , the rate was 3 per cent . The one on April 1 , 1875 , was 6 per cent , after which the annual rate declined to 3 per cent . Including the dividend of January 15 , 1884 , the sum of $34,308,055 was paid , most of which went to the Associates . Naturally the stock rose in value , and much of that belonging to the Associates was sold . This constituted the major reward of the four men who built and financed the Central Pacific . Even at the time the railroad was built , it was well known that the device of the construction companies made up of the railroad directors was a subterfuge . Its obvious purpose was to secure the stock as a bonus for the risk that the Associates took in the enterprise . The idea was for Crocker to make over the stock he received on his contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that company was dissolved , each of the Associates received his share of the stock , about $13,000,000 at face value . Whatever real return the stock made to the individuals is not known . The same procedure was followed in the construction of the extensions of the Central Pacific , the absorption of other roads , and finally in the building of the Southern Pacific . To say that by this practice Stanford , Huntington , Hopkins , and Crocker became wealthy is something of an understatement . Nevertheless , it is equally true that the Associates built one of the great railroad systems of the West , which still operates to the great benefit of the region through which it runs .  | The original Act of 1862 gave the company five 640-acre sections on alternate sides of the railroad line . The Act of 1864 doubled the grant , making it twenty sections or 12,800 acres per mile , extending ten miles on alternate sides of the line . Owing to the line 's irregularities , the actual amount of land granted was less than the theoretical amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant as well as all lands already preempted . Since the extent of mineral lands could not be determined in advance , there was some uncertainty about the total acreage . The amount of land remained indefinite until the actual route was determined by definite surveys . For these reasons , statements of the acreage allotted to the railroads varied from time to time . In 1883 , the Commissioner of Railroads , in reporting to the Secretary of the Interior , stated that the land grants were as follows : The Western Pacific had disposed of its lands before its absorption by the Central Pacific . At the date of the report in 1883 , the company had disposed of 780,879 acres . In fact , it was the policy of the company to dispose of its lands as rapidly as possible . The prices to settlers varied from $2.50 per acre up to $20 per acre , the latter figures being for land covered with timber . The benefit to the railroad came from traffic developed by the settlers on the land rather than from the sale of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . The best land was in California , where about 1,000,000 acres were available after deductions . The Nevada and Utah lands were mostly desert . At the present time unsold land amounts to approximately 5,000,000 acres . Everything considered , the land grant was of little direct assistance to the Central Pacific during construction , since the total sum available therefrom was only $107,000 . Notwithstanding , the land grant was a big help in selling the company 's firstmortgage bonds . Later , in 1871 , a land-grant mortgage of $10,000,000 was executed , from which funds became available to pay off the floating debt . Disposal of the lands would have moved more rapidly had the General Land Office been provided with sufficient personnel to make the surveys and to attend to the detailed work . However , unless the lands were under contract for sale , the company was in no hurry to patent the lands , because they then became taxable by the states . It took a lawsuit , together with a decision of the Supreme Court , to determine this liability .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Railroad , both because of the length of nearly 1,800 miles and the remote and difficult country it traversed , certain principles which governed its location may be mentioned . In the case of railroad terminals as widely separated as Sacramento and Omaha , the shortest distance between the two is measured on the trace of a great circle . This trace can not be drawn as a straight line upon an ordinary map , which is meant to represent the surface of a sphere on a flat surface . For short distances , the variation would be of no great importance , but over a spread of 1,800 miles there would be a wide difference between the shortest distance as measured on an ordinary map and as measured on a great circle . The topography of the country will rarely , if ever , permit a railroad to follow a great circle trace exactly , but it is remarkable how closely the located lines of the Pacific Railroad adhered to the trace of a great circle drawn  | between Sacramento and Omaha . The greatest divergence , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Salt Lake and at the big bend of the Humboldt River , On the line as built , seven topographical divisions of the country were traversed that were of major importance in fixing the route of the railroad . From west to east , these divisions were as follows : ( 1 ) The Sierra Nevada , with passes at elevations of 7,000 feet or more ; ( 2 ) The valleys and basin ranges of Nevada and Utah having a north and south trend ; ( 3 ) Great Salt Lake , a body of water about eighty miles in length , north and south , lying directly across the route ; ( 4 ) The Wasatch Mountains , located directly across the route and bordering Great Salt Lake on the east ; ( 5 ) The high rolling plains of the Wyoming Basin , situated between the Wasatch Mountains on the west and the Black Hills ( Laramie Mountains ) on the east ; ( 6 ) The Black Hills of Wyoming , now called the Laramie Mountains , an extension of the Front Range of the Rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Lowland , extending from the eastern base of the Black Hills over 500 miles to the Missouri River . The great mass of the southern Rocky Mountains also had an important bearing upon the location of the railroad . These mountains were regarded by the locating engineers of that time as practically impassable , from both financial and physical points of view . These factors determined that the location of the railroad should be across the Wyoming Basin , thus passing around the northern end of the southern Rocky Mountains . Sacramento , from which city the Central Pacific Railroad was built , lies on the alluvial plain of the Valley of California . The city is located on high ground above the river , at an elevation of  | twenty feet or more above sea level . The river , which is affected by the tides , furnishes a route for transportation by boat to San Francisco , about 130 miles to the west . The plains extend eastward from Sacramento to merge without break with the Sierra Nevada . The rising ground of the mountains becomes apparent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along the line of the railroad there is a fairly uniform rise in 103 miles to the 7,018-foot summit of the Sierra . In the vicinity of Donner Pass , the mountains on the south rise to elevations of 10,000 feet , while to the north the elevations are somewhat less . The Sierra Nevada is a tilted fault block , the central mass of which is granite . There is a long uniform slope on the western side , where rivers have incised deep canyons . On the eastern front there is a steep escarpment , with a drop of 2,500 to 3,000 feet from the high passes to the floor of the valleys that border the foot of the mountains . The fact that there were two ranges of about equal height in the mountain chain to be crossed was important in fixing the railroad location . North of the headwaters of the South Fork of the American River , the mountains divide into two ranges , between which lies Lake Tahoe and the surrounding level lands . At the lake , the east and west distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River drains Lake Tahoe and much of the surrounding watershed . This river runs northward from the lake , and then pursuing a generally eastward and northward direction for some fifty miles , reaches Big Bend , where it makes a sharp turn to the left and flows northwestward into Pyramid and Winnemucca lakes . This favorable situation was recognized by Judah when investigating the route for the Central Pacific Railroad . He also expressed himself in favor of a route up the valley of the I-IunIboldt River to reach Salt Lake City , a route that had been used for years by emigrants and was generally well known . It terminated at Humboldt Wells , from which point there was a choice  | of routes across the intervening mountains to Great Salt Lake , and then around the lake , either to the north or to the south . By the time Theodore Judah was ready to present the plan for a Pacific Railroad to investors , the main outlet had been determined . The road was to be built from Sacramento , California , to a point on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Plains , the Wyoming Basin , pass Great Salt Lake , cross Nevada , and go over the Sierra Nevada . Judah visualized the road as far east as Great Salt Lake and the road was built along the route he outlined . Judah 's final decision to cross the Sierra Nevada by the route that the railroad followed was not reached until after he had considered a number of other routes , each of which had its advocates . The investigations were made at various times from 1860 on , and were summarized in Judah 's report of June 1 , 1863 . Five routes were examined . The first was from Folsom , at the terminus of the Sacramento Valley Railroad , up the ridge via Georgetown to the summit of the mountains at the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the American River . This route was rejected because of the heavy grades required ? 150 feet to the mile . The second route was the one upon which the railroad was built . The third route led by way of Nevada City and the ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was known as the Henness Pass road . This route involved crossing deep mountain canyons on the western slope of the mountains and a bad location to reach the Truckee River on the eastern side . For these reasons it was rejected . The fourth route crossed the canyons of the South and Middle forks of the Yuba River and continued up the North Fork of that river via Downieville and the Yuba Pass , and through Sierra Valley to the Truckee River . The fifth route led via Oroville , and up the Middle Fork of the Feather River , crossing the highest moun- tains at Beckwourth Pass . This route had the advantage of lighter grades and crossed the mountains by a lower pass , but it involved such heavy and costly construction that it was rejected . Years afterward , in 1903 , the modern Western Pacific Railroad was built over practically the same route , excepting that it followed the North Fork of the Feather River . It was a costly line because between Sacramento and Winnemucca , common points on the two lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Central Pacific . It was also true that to have built on this fifth route would have meant abandoning the lucrative traffic of the Comstock mines . The fifth route was therefore rejected by Judah , and his decision was sound . After making his investigations , Judah decided that the railroad should be built directly across the Sierra Nevada by way of a ridge that lay between the Bear and South Yuba rivers on the north , and the North Fork of the American River on the south . He had made reconnaissance of the route in company with Dr. Strong of Dutch Flat in 1860 , just as he had made a preliminary survey across the mountains to a junction with the Truckee River in 1861 . The results of his work were embodied in a report to the president and directors of the Central Pacific Railroad , dated at Sacramento , October 1 , 1861 . Some excerpts from the report will explain his conclusions . Speaking of the survey he said : " These observations demonstrated the existence of a route from Sacramento across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grades of 105 feet per mile ; accordingly , field parties were organized early in the spring , and a thorough Railroad Survey made , the results of which are embodied in the following Report , developing a line with lighter grades , less distance , and encountering fewer obstacles than are found upon any other route or line hitherto examined across the Sierra Nevada Mountains ; and proving , by actual survey , that the difficulties and formidable features of this range can be successfully overcome for Railroad purposes . "  | Referring to the problem of reaching an elevation of 7,000 feet in the distance from base to summit , Judah said : " When it is considered that the average length of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains , from summit of base , is only about 70 miles , and the general flight of its lowest passes about 7,000 feet , the difficulty of locating a Railroad line with 100-foot grades is correspondingly increased , as it becomes absolutely necessary to find ground upon which to preserve a general uniformity of grade . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet above Sacramento , is reached by maximum grade of 105 feet per mile ; showing a remarkable regularity of surface , without which the ascent could not have been accomplished with this grade . " Judah set forth the general characteristics of the Sierra Nevada and described the ridge up which the railroad was located : " These rivers run through gorges or canons , in many places from 1,000 to 2,000 feet in depth , with side slopes varying from perpendicular to an angle of forty-five degrees . " The ridges formed by these rivers are sharp , well defined , and in many places so narrow on top , as to leave barely room for a wagon road to be made without excavating surface of ridge . " The branches , also , of many of these rivers have worn out gorges as deep as those of the rivers , and present physical barriers to a line of communication either crossing them , or extending in a northerly and southerly direction . " The line on top of crest of ridge being far from uniform , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , and it was found necessary to carry the line from gap to gap , passing around the intervening hills , upon their side slopes . " The most important controlling gaps were Clipper Gap , forty-two miles from Sacramento ; New England Gap , six miles farther on ; Long Ravine , about four miles from Illinoistown ( Colfax ) ; and Emigrant Gap , eighty-two miles from Sacramento . Beyond the last gap the line was on the side of a mountain and the gaps no longer controlled the surveys . The most  | characteristic portion of the ridge as described by Judah lies between Colfax and Emigrant Gap , an air-line distance of about twenty-one miles . In this section the distance between the Bear River and the North Fork of the American River is about four miles , the rivers running parallel and more or less southwest . The ridge between the two streams may average from one to two miles in width and is the remnant of an ancient peneplain . The ridge is cut by numerous small canyons , tributaries of the main streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass around these gullies so that the distance of the railroad between the points mentioned would be about twenty-nine miles . This twisting of the location increased the length of the line by approximately eight miles . The North Fork of the American River runs in a canyon much deeper than that of the Bear . At Cape Horn the depth from the railroad to the river is about 1,500 feet . Above Towle station , the railroad runs on the edge of the canyon , where the drop to the river is some 2,000 feet , while on the opposite side the Bear River runs 1,000 feet below . At Emigrant Gap , where the ridge narrows to a knife edge , Bear Valley is nearly 600 feet below the track , while several miles away the North Fork of the American is more than 2,500 feet below the railroad . These data give some idea of the favorable location selected by Montague for the railroad after Judah 's death . In the surveys directed by Judah , it was his opinion that the line could reach the South Yuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it generally to Summit Valley and across that valley to the summit . However , it was determined later to keep to the side of the mountain above the Yuba bottoms and the line reaches the river only at Summit Valley , elevation 6,800 feet . Above the eastern end of Summit Valley , where the summit was reached , a tunnel 1,659 feet long was excavated through the culminating ridge , 124 feet below the summit . The highest point reached was an elevation of 7,042 feet in the tunnel .  | After crossing the summit of the Sierra Nevada , Judah 's problem was to drop down to the Truckee River . He describes the situation in the following words : " From the summit looking easterly , you appear standing upon a nearly perpendicular rocky wall , of 1,000 feet in hight . " Immediately below is seen a valley , from one to two miles wide , extending up from the Truckee River , to nearly beneath your feet . Donner Lake , ( about three and a half miles long , by one mile in width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its outlet is seen pursuing its course down to a junction with the Truckee . Two long ranges or spurs are seen , on either side , parallel with and inclosing the lake , reaching from the summit to Truckee River . Immediately beyond the river is seen the second summit of the Sierra Nevada , while still further in the distance the Washoe Mountains are plainly visible . " The line was continued down from the summit along the mountainside above Donner Lake with maximum grades of 105 feet per mile . In order to reach the Truckee River as quickly as possible , advantage was taken of two ravines , the largest being the ravine of Coldstream Creek . Truckee River was reached after eleven and one half miles of maximum grades , the direct east and west distance being about eight miles . The first surveys demonstrated that a line could be found up the ridge to the summit and thence to the Truckee River with maximum grades of 105 feet per mile . In discussing the merits of this location , Judah mentioned some important and favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about eight miles , thence northerly about ten , and then north-easterly about twelve miles , the Truckee passes down between these two summits with a nearly uniform fall of about thirty-five feet per mile ; thence sweeping round to the eastward , it passes through the second range or summit , at a depression where it seems to be entirely worn away down to the level of the river , thence pursuing its way through an extensive plain known  | as the Truckee Meadows ; thence through the Washoe Mountains to the Big Bend ; thence northerly about twenty miles , finds its way into Pyramid Lake . " By avoiding the Second Summit of the Sierras and Washoe Mountains you are not only enabled to save the grades required to overcome these ranges , but also encounter a much narrower snow belt ? the eastern limit of deep snow upon this line being the Truckee River , at a distance of twelve miles from the summit . " Judah also investigated the possibility of a line leading southward through the Truckee Meadows and Washoe and Eagle valleys to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open plains near Humboldt Lake . He rightly concluded that such a line was feasible but much longer than the one down the Truckee . The reports by Judah give details of the location of the line up the Sierra Nevada , based upon his preliminary survey . Later location surveys varied from the original location at a number of places , but the line as built followed his first selection of the ridge between the Yuba and Bear rivers on the north and the North Fork of the American River . The route down the Truckee to the Big Bend at Wadsworth was also followed and it remains today the line of the Southern Pacific eastward from California . On one point only was Judah incorrect . He believed that the snow could be handled in winter by snow plows , but experience during construction showed that this was impossible and that snow sheds were an absolute necessity in order to keep traffic moving . Judah did not live to complete the location surveys eastward from the Truckee River , but he had urged the necessity of continuing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added to his own those of Lieutenant Beckwith as far as Salt Lake City and also those of the other government estimates to Council Bluffs . The total was $99,870,000 . He pointed out important considerations that gave the route up the Humboldt manifest  | advantages over any other route for a railroad line . It was left to Montague and his corps of assistants to finish the line to a junction with the Union Pacific at Promontory . The final location on which the road was built was made by Judah as far east as Dutch Flat , sixty-six miles east of Sacramento . His preliminary location beyond led into Bear Valley on Bear River , and thence up the canyon of the Yuba River . When Montague took charge , he made a more detailed study of the mountains and became convinced that a better line would be found by continuing along the mountainside well above the Yuba River instead of in the canyon near the stream . Had Judah lived , it is certain that he would have ordered additional surveys of this particular location and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did Montague . During 1864 and into 1865 , further detailed studies of the location were undertaken , with the result that Montague submitted his findings to the management and advocated his location as having better grades and easier construction . Naturally , there was some question of adopting the new line rather than that made by Judah . To settle the matter , Stanford employed George E. Gray , who came out from the New York Central Railroad and examined the situation . Gray reported on Montague 's location in the following terms : " Mr. Montague leaves Mr. Judah 's line a short distance above Dutch Flat , thence diverging to the right and crossing the dividing ridge to the North Fork of the American River .. . " I did not pass over all of Mr. Judah 's line through Bear Valley , but from a comparison of his maps and profiles and a personal examination of the line surveyed by Mr. Montague , I have no hesitation in pronouncing the latter decidedly preferable in all respects ; it being more economical of construction , including only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and averaging less than 400 feet each . Besides , no loss of elevation is suffered , the grades are no heavier and the line is shorter by about 5,000 feet  | between Dutch Flat and Crystal Lake , a distance of twentytwo and one third miles . " From Crystal Lake to Summit Valley , and thence to the summit at Donner Pass , the grades of the new line will be much less than the maximum , far less than on Mr. Judah 's and without any loss of distance or requiring a tunnel of more than 1,350 feet at the summit . " Gray also commented on the general excellence of the location up the mountains and assured the management of the railroad that the line as laid out could be built . Gray 's decision settled the matter , and Montague 's location was adopted . It was decidedly the best possible route . The work of locating the line up the Sierra Nevada engaged the engineers up to the end of 1865 . In his first report , dated October 8 , 1864 , Montague stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1863 to the Big Bend of the Truckee from the terminus of the Judah surveys . The result was " highly satisfactory , developing a line with easy grades and curves , and for the greater portion of the distance with very light work . " Montague states that " from the Big Bend , the choice of routes must be hereafter determined by proper exploration and surveys . " In 1866 , active work was undertaken to determine the route through Nevada and Utah to a possible junction with the Union Pacific . In his report of February 8 , 1867 , Montague says that the line had been finally located beyond the eastern boundary of California to a point thirty-four miles into Nevada toward the Big Bend of the Truckee River . Lines of exploration across central Nevada and through Utah were made by several parties under Mr. Ives , Mr. Eppler , and Mr. Buck . Two lines south of Great Salt Lake , together with the same number north of the lake , were investigated as far as the mouth of Weber River at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 3,623 miles of line were examined , either as a reconnaissance or by preliminary surveys . No portion of the central part of Nevada was omitted from the examination ,  | and the same was true of the region of Utah westward from the Wasatch Mountains . The instrumental surveys extended from the Big Bend of the Truckee , " via Say 's Station , Truckee Desert , Desert Gate , Sink Humboldt , north side of Humboldt Lake , and thence following the valley of Humboldt River to Humboldt Wells . " The result was that the original idea of a location up the Humboldt was confirmed . A glance at the map would seem to indicate that a direct line across Nevada south of Great Salt Lake to Salt Lake City might be the best . It was , in fact , the route of the overland stages . However , the physical obstacles were too great . The isolated mountain ranges scattered in that region would have made necessary a zig-zag line to round the ends of the ranges that lead through narrow passes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the mountains , with desert valley between , gave an up-and-down profile that made such a location impossible . A line might have been run from Humboldt Wells south of Great Salt Lake , but lack of water along the route , the necessity of crossing twenty miles of Great Salt Lake Desert , which might again be flooded by the waters of the lake , and the twenty-five miles additional distance to the mouth of Weber Canyon determined the selection of the northern route . Montague 's report summarizes the conclusions from the 1866 surveys and investigations : " The route adopted for the location of the Central Pacific Railroad is via the line referred to above and also in the report for the year 1865 . . . following the valley of the Truckee River from the point where the line first reaches it ( near Donner Lake ) to the Big Bend . Thence via Truckee Desert , Humboldt Sink , and lake and valley of Humboldt River to the Wells ( near the source of the stream ) , thence in an easterly direction on line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains , north pass of Toana Mountains , passage between Goose Creek and Ombe Mountains , skirting north margin of the Great Desert , to north end of Great Salt Lake ; thence through  | the South Pass of the Promontory Mountains , skirting Mud Plains north of Bear River Bay to Brigham City ; thence along the west base of the Wasatch Mountains to Weber River , and up said stream to the mouth of Weber Canyon . Distance from easterly boundary of California to Weber Canyon , 588 miles . " During 1867 the explorations were continued for a line to the north of Great Salt Lake at the same time that location surveys were being extended into Nevada and additional preliminary lines were being run . One of these preliminary lines extended from Wells across the eastern border of Nevada to the Salt Lake Valley . Another was carried from the mouth of Weber Canyon across the ranges to a tributary of the Green River at Granger . Trial lines were also run up the valley of Utah 's Bear River , by way of the river and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Little Bear River . The country through the eastern mountains by way of Weber and Echo canyons , Chalk and Sulphur creeks , and along the northern base of the Uinta Mountains was explored by trial lines that extended to the tributaries of Green River . Together with running reconnaissance lines , the company explored the country from the western base of the Wasatch Mountains to Green River over a north and south distance of 150 miles . The transit party starting at Humboldt Wells and ending at Salt Lake City covered 950 miles , while the exploring party traveled 1,430 miles . In addition , large-scale triangulation nets were made from the Big Bend of the Truckee River to the Reese River in Nevada . It was quite evident from the wide extent of the surveys of 1866 , 1867 , and 1868 that the Central Pacific intended to build across the mountains into Wyoming as far east as the Green River . In fact , President Stanford stated later that they had hoped to meet the Union Pacific at a point as far east as Cheyenne . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location across  | Nevada had been finished and in the first six months of 1868 it had been completed for 248 miles eastward of the Big Bend of the Truckee . In addition , final location east of Humboldt Wells had been completed to Independence , while locating parties were working on both sides of Promontory Point . When the roads were joined , after Central Pacific grading had been carried eastward to Bear River and Ogden , final location had been completed as far east as Ogden . Surveying expenses on reconnaissance , preliminary , and location surveys had risen progressively from the start . The amounts were : June 1 , 1863 , $33,889 ; March 1 , 1864 , $59,457 ; February 8 , 1867 , $181,121 ; June 30 , 1868 , $271,182 . It was the practice of the national government to have the railroad examined by special commissioners from time to time . One such commission composed of G. K. Warren , Brevet Major General U. S. A. , J. Blickensderfer , Jr. , civil engineer , and James Barnes , civil engineer , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior , on November 23 , 1868 , in which the following statement occurs : " Ample surveys and examinations made by the Government , and by both the Central and Union Pacific Railroad Companies , show that the valley of the Humboldt River is a controlling feature of the direct central route to San Francisco . A line from the sources of the Humboldt River eastward by the north end of Great Salt Lake is more direct , and passes through a country , superior in many respects to that through which a line must be located leading to the south end of this lake , and consequently the line by the north end is the best , if the best location for the line through the Wasatch Mountains permits it . " The problem of location had been solved , but there were other details that required attention . The law granting a subsidy to the railroad had provided that grades and curves as used on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad should not be exceeded . These limits were grades of 116 feet per mile and curves as  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy in operation dictated that grades of the least possible rise be obtained and that curves of larger radius be used whenever possible . The location had been made with these limitations in mind . The line from Sacramento to the summit of the Sierra Nevada was the most difficult , because it had to reach an elevation of over 7,000 feet in 105 miles , of which about fifteen miles was across the nearly level valley floor . Therefore , the line was located diagonally across the mountains in order to gain distance . From Sacramento to the summit , there were 11.2 miles of level track , 20.9 miles of 105 feet per mile grade , and 9.55 miles of maximum grade of 116 feet per mile . Lighter grades intervened , the average grade in 195 miles to the summit being 66.97 feet per mile . From the summit , for 11.5 miles the line descended to the Truckee River , with maximum grades of ninety-five feet per mile . From that point for over seventy-two miles to the Big Bend of the Truckee , 189 miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , the average grade being 35.12 feet per mile . Beyond the Big Bend of the Truckee River the average grades were all lighter , the heaviest , however , being 52.8 feet per mile . The Big Bend of the Truckee , where the town of Wadsworth was established , was at the western end  | of the Truckee and Humboldt Desert . For forty miles the route led across the open desert to the west shore of Humboldt Lake . Skirting the low grassy shores of the lake , the line then followed up the valley of the Humboldt River for 291 miles to Humboldt Wells , 520 miles from Sacramento . The line was located away from the river in most places to avoid the bottom lands that were apt to be flooded . As far as Golconda , the river runs in the sediments of the former Lake Lahontan , a good region for a railroad to avoid . In this stretch of the line to Humboldt Wells there were several canyons and narrow gaps , as at the Palisades , but these offered few difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river came practically to an end , so it was necessary to cross the intervening mountains toward Great Salt Lake . The location was not difficult , as the several basin ranges had wide gaps between them and there were also open valleys . The route was somewhat zigzag for this reason . About nine miles east of Wells , the highest point , with an elevation of 6,166 feet , was reached in a pass through the Independence Range . From that point on , there was a gradual down grade for sixty-two miles to Umbria junction , near the present station of Lucin , where the Great Salt Lake Desert was reached . In that stretch of the line , such open valleys as Thousand Springs Valley were followed on through open passes in the Pequop , Toana , and Pilot ranges . The lowest point in the line into the desert was reached some twelve mile east of Umbria , where the elevation was about 4,340 feet . From there the line climbed the Ombe Mountains , a range of low hills about 375 feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to the flats at the upper end of Great Salt Lake . For about twenty-five miles along the shore of Spring Bay , the line was practically level . Monument Point , at 4,220 feet , was rounded in this stretch of line , 142 miles from Wells and 662 miles from Sacramento . About seven miles east of Monument Point the line commenced to climb the Promontory Mountains . The pass  | was through another open valley where the mountain breaks down from the north and then rises into the high range that extends southward into Great Salt Lake . The climb of 685 feet to Promontory Summit was made in sixteen miles , and from there the line descended the eastern slope of the mountains to the flats across Bear River Valley . The Bear River was crossed about ten miles north of Bear River Bay , the upper section of Great Salt Lake . Turning southward and eastward , the line followed the plains at the base of the Wasatch Mountains until it finally reached the mouth of Weber Canyon , 752 miles from Sacramento . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union Pacific , but the Central Pacific line was graded into Ogden . The location of the two lines over the Promontory Mountains was practically the same , and , as both were graded , the observer can still see the unused grade , sometimes within 100 feet of where the rails were later laid . Some statistics are available . In a distance of 450 miles from Sacramento , the location was based on 264 miles of tangent or straight lines and 186 miles of curved lines , of which the curves of minimum radius ( 573 feet ) made up less than 1 per cent of the total length . East of Wells , for 219 miles the grades were less than 25 feet per mile for 133 miles ; from 25 to 50 feet for 35 miles ; and 50 to 75 feet for 50 miles . These results were obtained only after careful surveys had been made . The railroad was built along the line as located , and with one major exception is still there today . The exception is the Lucin Cutoff crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of a century after the completion of the road over the Promontory Mountains . The plan of building directly across the lake was indeed considered by the early engineers , but rejected on account of cost , lack of information regarding the lake bottom , and uncertainty as to the lake levels . Some records then available indicated a rising lake in the years from 1850 to 1868 . To this day traces of ancient Lake Bonneville are  | in evidence that show that prehistoric water levels were at least 1,000 feet above the modern lake . To have crossed the lake where the modern line was built would have saved forty-five miles of distance and a climb of 680 feet over the Promontory Mountains , but it was just not possible in 1869 . There is no question that the early engineers found and used the best route there was from Sacramento to Ogden , and their work remains today as evidence of great ability and far-seeing vision .  | THE CONSTRUCTION of the Central Pacific Railroad through uninhabited regions involved tremendous problems absent in building roads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major items , the procedure was much the same . Financing construction , while a part of general management of a railroad , played an important role in determining the speed at which the work went forward . Once the location surveys had been made , rights of way had to be obtained , and after that final construction surveys were needed . These surveys continued throughout the construction period and required surveying parties at frequent intervals along the line . The roadbed in cuts and on fills passed over uneven ground and through all kinds of earth materials where ditches had to be dug and provisions made for the discharge of storm water . Tunnels in solid rock could be left as excavated , but many other tunnels had to be lined with timber , brick , stone , or concrete . Bridges had to be designed and erected ahead of track laying . Culverts of stone or concrete were built under fills . Snow sheds , in the case of the  | Central Pacific , and snow fences on the Union Pacific , were essential in keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switches , and other items were transported to the construction depots from distant locations and carried from there to the end of the track . Sidings and station tracks were built along with the main line . Ballast was brought from distant quarries , placed in position , and the track brought to line on an even grade . Station houses with water tanks for the locomotives , eating houses on long lines , and similar structures were also vitally necessary . Machine repair shops and engine houses were located at carefully selected points . Provision had to be made for fuel to be stored in quantity at division points . Rolling stock of locomotives , freight and passenger cars , and construction trains were also an important and costly item in Central Pacific construction . A telegraph line had to be built ras an adjunct to the construction forces . In many places a wagon road reaching ahead of the track was required . Then , too , there had to be an organized force of trainmen , graders , bridge builders , teams , earth-moving equipment , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished . Over all , there was the company organization , the engineering staff with the chief engineer and his principal assistants , the construction superintendent and assistants , contractors for various kinds of work , and many other groups of skilled men for performing special tasks . CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS When the Law of 1862 was passed it contained a clause stat- - ing that " the track upon the entire line of railroad and branches shall be of uniform width to be determined by the President of the United States , so that when completed , cars can be run from the Missouri River to the Pacific Coast . " President Lincoln , harried by the worries of the Civil War , set the gauge at five feet , but an Act of Congress of March 3 , 1863 , established the gauge as four feet , eight and one half inches , which is the standard gauge today .  | The previously mentioned clause of the law , which stated that standards of the Baltimore and Ohio had to be used , was indefinite , and for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a board made up of government commission-. ers , government directors of the Union Pacific Railroad , and a number of representatives of the companies constructing the Pacific railroads . A circular was sent out to prominent railroad engineers , among whom were Major General M. C. Meigs , John B. Jervis , George Lowe Reid , Ashbel Welch , Benjamin H. Latrobe , G. A. Nicholls , W. W. Evans , Philip S. Justice , J. L. Williams , and Silas Seymour , the last two being government director and consulting engineer of the Union Pacific respectively . The comments of these men constitute an excellent summary of railroad building as it was understood in 1865 . The men from the eastern states favored solid , permanent construction , such as stone bridges , but on most of the other items of construction there was a general agreement . It is interesting to note that Silas Seymour , whose name appears elsewhere in this work , advocated a road built on rails resting upon longitudinal timbers instead of upon crossties , a plan that had been abandoned everywhere long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , and said that he had never been in favor of iron bridges for railroads . This was the type of man with whom General Dodge of the Union Pacific had to contend . The weight of locomotives suggested by the advisers ranged from twenty to forty tons , the weight being limited by the carrying capacity of the fifty- to sixty-five-pound rails then available . Today steel rails are double these weights , and locomotives weigh ten to fifteen times more than was then deemed safe . It is true that steel rails made by the Bessemer process were then coming into use , and the possibility of using them was discussed , but they were not adopted on the first Pacific Railroad . The Board brought in recommendations on location , grades and curves , embankments and excavations , mechanical structures , ballasting , crossties , rails , sidings , rolling stock , and build- ings . It properly stated that grades and curves should be adapted to the country , and that while grades of 116 feet to the mile , ( 2.2 per cent ) had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum radius of 400 feet , the situation in the Platte and Kansas valleys was such that grades should nat . exceed thirty feet per mile . The roadbed should not be less than fourteen feet wide at the grade line , excavation in long cuts should be twenty-six feet wide , and in shorter cuts , twenty-four feet wide to allow room for side ditches . Earth slopes should be one and one half base to one of rise . Rock slopes could be steeper . Tunnels in rock should he made for double track , but this provision was never enforced . Culverts were to be of stone or brick , but could be made of wood and replaced later with permanent materials . Bridges were to be built of stone , iron , or wood , at the discretion of the railroad company . Ballast should be of broken stone or gravel , twelve to fourteen inches thick . lCrossties should be of oak or other suitable timber ; if of soft wood , such as cottonwood , they should be treated ' by the Burnetizing process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least six inches on the face and eight feet long , and laid 2,400 to the mile . 1 Rails were to be of American iron and should weigh at least fifty-six pounds to the yard on ordinary track , and sixty pounds per yard in the mountains Rails should be fastened by fishplates and bolts at the joints and should be spiked to the ties on each side of the rail at each tie . However , wrought-iron chairs could be employed at the joints if the use of fishplates would delay the work . Sidings should be at least 6 per cent as long as the line . Buildings should be of brick or stone . The specifications were liberal and allowed for plenty of lee-way in construction , depending upon the country . Much was left to the judgment of the railroad officials , and of the directors and commissioners who had charge of the work for the government . In accordance with the standards , a first-class road was constructed . At Sacramento , the starting point of the line , the railroad was  | located on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Sacramento from the flood water of the American River , one of the broadest streams flowing from the Sierra Nevada . About three and a half miles from the initial point , the river , flowing nearly due westward , was crossed by the largest bridge on the entire Central Pacific line . At the crossing point the American River is about 700 feet wide , and on both sides there are wide bottom lands , flooded in times of high water . Geologically , the mountains begin at Arcade Creek . In the vicinity of Rocklin , granite is encountered , but the road for seventy miles up the mountains to a point near Cisco runs mostly in gravels , sedimentary rocks , slates , cemented gravels , and volcanic rocks of various types . From Cisco to the summit and down the eastern slope of the mountains , the rock is a hard granodiorite . In the vicinity of Truckee there are glacial deposits , but between Truckee and Verdi a canyon is encountered where the river runs through a lava flow for about ten miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when passing over the Virginia Range the road had to follow an open canyon to Wadsworth , at the Big Bend of the Truckee . From Wadsworth to Ogden the railroad was built over the desert , which at places borders the Humboldt River , and across the mountains that were not difficult to surmount . In this distance of 550 miles , there were a few stretches of difficult construction , the most troublesome being at Palisade Canyon , where for some tweleve miles the line was built beside the river between basalt cliffs . In the sections across Nevada and Utah , the country was similar to the terrain where the Union Pacific crossed the Wyoming Basin . It was here that great progress was made during the last year of building . As the Central Pacific began at Sacramento and built cast ward , all supplies other than those obtained from California or from along the road had to be brought from the eastern states .  | The usual route from Atlantic ports was around Cape Horn , a distance of 18,000 miles , which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight , mainly locomotives and rail , was sent across the Isthmus of Panama , but this route , while shorter in distance and time , was extremely costly , owing to high freight rates . Mr. Clement stated that shipping rail by way of the Isthmus in 1868 cost $51.97 per ton , making the cost of rail delivered at Sacramento $143.67 , which did not include transfer charges to lighters at San Francisco or transportation up the Sacramento River . The corresponding Isthmus freight on one locomotive was $8,100 , and the average freight cost for eighteen locomotives was $4,692.50 each . Freight charges on the first locomotive sent by way of Cape Horn was $2,282.25 . Much of the high freight cost was due to high war-risk insurance during the period of the Civil War . When material reached San Francisco , it was loaded on river steamers or barges and carried up San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River , 130 miles to Sacramento . In flood seasons the river furnished a reliable means of transportation , but at low water , even with the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment for building and operating the Central Pacific had to be shipped from eastern mills to Atlantic ports , loaded on vessels , taken on a long sea voyage by way of Cape Horn , or across the Isthmus , to San Francisco , there to be transferred again to river craft and by way of the bay and river carried to its destination . There it was again loaded on cars and forwarded to the place of use at the end of track . Iron for the track , in accordance with the Law of 1862 , was manufactured in American mills in the East . The rail varied from fifty-six to sixty-six pounds per yard , the heavier rail being used on the mountains where the height of the rail section was raised in order that the head would be above snow . Wrought- iron chairs to connect the ends of two rails were used on 115 miles of road , but the remaining length of the line was laid with fishplate joints , which were much superior . Ties and bridge timbers were cut from California forests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to San Francisco and were used from Sacramento to the summit . From there on , the native lumber , sawed in mills at Verdi and elsewhere on the eastern side of the mountains , was used . All of this timber was of a quality that made special treatment unnecessary . The number of ties varied from 2,260 to 2,640 per mile , depending upon alignment and grade . The forests also provided wood for bridges and trestles , some timber being hewn but most of it being sawed . From the forests , too , came fuel , since wood-burning locomotives were used during the entire construction . In this respect , the Central Pacific had a great advantage over the Union Pacific , but the Union Pacific had a similar advantage later when coal deposits were discovered along its line in Wyoming . Stone of good quality for culverts , bridge piers , and building foundations was found along the Central Pacific line through the mountains ; and for the long stretch across Nevada and Utah , stone for replacement of temporary structures could be brought from quarries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built . Ballast , also , was usually obtained from pits along the line . Up the Sierra Nevada and down the Truckee River there was an ample supply . Across the deserts , where the railroad was kept away from the Humboldt River in order to avoid the sediments of the former Lake Lahontan , material from the excavations was used as ballast . It generally consisted of coarse sands and gravels washed down from the near-by mountains . On the open plains east of the Sacramento Valley and from Reno eastward to Promontory , no clearing or grubbing was  | necessary . On the slopes of the Sierra Nevada , especially in the center portion , the line passed through dense forests where trees 100 to 150 feet in height were common . Brush was also abundant . In some sections the cost of cutting trees and brush and grubbing out stumps was an item of considerable expense . For eighteen miles eastward from Sacramento to Roseville , the grading was light , inasmuch as the road was located over the flat lands of the Sacramento Valley . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad leading northward from Folsom , the work became heavier ; and from Newcastle , thirty-two miles from Sacramento , to a point near Truckee , a distance of nearly ninety miles , grading work was the heaviest order of construction . In order to keep within the ruling grades , deep cuts and high fills were essential over most of the distance . Bloomer Cut , west of Auburn , about 800 feet long and sixty-five feet in average depth , had to be blasted through a mass of cemented gravel . Higher in the mountains the excavation was through stained earth and shale , or sometimes sandstone ; and when beyond Emigrant Gap the line passed to side-hill construction the material encountered was granite . Wide ravines were passed by trestles that were afterward filled , and in the upper region , tunnel succeeded tunnel . From Truckee eastward the work was lighter , except in the two canyons of the Truckee River . Out on the plains of Nevada and Utah the grading was all light , except for rock work in narrow canyons . All earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laborers , who loaded the material in wheelbarrows or on onehorse wooden dump carts . Animal traction was the only power used . Blasting was mainly done with black powder , which was far less expensive than the newly patented nitroglycerine that was just coming into use . Nitroglycerine was put to good use , however , in some of the tunnel blasting operations .  | The Central Pacific was built largely by Chinese laborers , imported for that purpose from southern China . The Chinese had a well-developed system of contracting for labor , which was used on the railroad . As organized by Strobridge , the work was under the supervision of riding bosses , whose responsibility it was to keep the work going and to provide supplies for the workmen . At first Strobridge was opposed to the use of Chinese laborers , but later changed his mind , since white laborers were not available . Clement thus described the situation : " California laborers were mainly miners accustomed to work in placer mines or not , as it suited them . Mining was more to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent , independent , and their labor high priced . Labor sufficient for the rapid construction of the Central Pacific was not then on the coast and the labor as it existed could not be depended upon ? the first mining excitement meant a complete stampede of every man and a consequent abandonment of all work . " Strobridge expressed his revised opinion of the Chinese when he said : " They learn quickly , do not fight , have no strikes that amount to anything , and are very cleanly in their habits . They will gamble and do quarrel among themselves most noisily but harmlessly. " / ! ' - The Chinese , who numbered about 12,000 at the most , worked in groups , each with his own cook , who also provided hot water for bathing . Their drink was tea , which , being made with hot water , avoided the danger of disease to which white men were subject from drinking all kinds of water along the line . The pay of the Chinese ranged from $30 to $35 a month , on which they boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by the railroad paymaster , the payment being made to the Chinese labor boss of the gang , who kept the time of the men during the month . The Chinese gave very little trouble , but out in Nevada they sometimes wanted to quit . The  | Piute Indians spread the story that in the desert toward which they were heading there were snakes big enough to swallow a Chinese whole , which of course had its effect . However , the Chinese were kept on the work to the finish , and years later the people of California came to recognize the splendid character of the Celestials . White labor , as stated , was difficult to obtain and was used only on important tasks . After the Civil War , white labor was more readily available with the Irish predominating . White common laborers were paid about the same as were the Chinese but were provided with subsistence and living quarters by the contracting company . The number of whites employed ranged  - -  from 1,200 to 1,300 , the largest number being used in the years 1866-1868 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stone masons of which some 500 were used , were paid higher wages , ranging from $3 to $5 a day . All wages were paid in coin usually gold . In contrast to the Union Pacific , the tunnels on the Central Pacific were one of the major problems of construction . In all , there were fifteen tunnels , with a total length of 6,213 feet . The shortest was the Red Spur Tunnel , ninety-two feet long , and the longest was the Summit Tunnel , 105 miles from Sacramento , which was 1,659 feet in length . Some of the tunnels were built on curves and some were on tangents , the long tunnel at the summit being constructed on a tangent . All of the tunnels were located over a distance of sixty miles on the upper reaches of the Sierra Nevada , but the heaviest tunnel work was in the twenty miles from Cisco eastward to the summit . Nine tunnels , having a total length of 5,158 feet , were necessary in this stretch of the road , which lies at elevations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region of heaviest snowfall . Here the road was built along the sides of steep mountains , with an average slope greater than forty-five degrees , sometimes on the side of bare granite cliffs that were  | broken by projecting ledges and boulders . Embankments were impracticable , as the excavated material from cuts slid far down the mountainside . Under such conditions it was best to locate the road inside the mountain , since tunnels made snow sheds unnecessary , heavy retaining walls were avoided , and work could be carried on in the wintertime . In one place there were seven tunnels in two miles of line . Most of the tunnels were excavated in solid granite . The cross section of a tunnel was a rectangle at the bottom , sixteen feet wide by eleven feet high , above which the section was arched with a diameter of sixteen feet . Grade was at the center of tie , being one foot three inches above subgrade . Tunnel 11 was partly lined , and Tunnel 13 wholly lined with timber . Sills were 12 inches by 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch was formed of three 5- by 12-inch planks bolted together at breaking joints . The distance between the centers of the timber supports varied from one and one half feet to five feet , according to the type of earth material to be supported . Wall and ceiling clearance in mixed soil runnels was greater than in rock tunnels , allowance having been made for future lining with masonry . However , after completion of the road , the size of rolling stock increased so rapidly that the original tunnel sections had to be enlarged . Tunnel 6 at the summit , the longest on the road , was 1,659 feet in length , and was the greatest depth below the surface , 124 feet . It was built through granite of medium hardness , crossed by seams . The excavation of this tunnel caused such a serious delay that to expedite matters a shaft was sunk about halfway between the tunnel openings , a hoisting engine was installed , and the tunnel was simultaneously excavated from both ends and from the middle . It was at Tunnel No. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been discovered in 1846 , but it was not until 1867 that Alfred Nobel patented it as being usable for blasting . It was made by treating glycerine with nitric and sulphuric  | acids , which produced a light yellow-colored oily liquid that was highly explosive . It was possible to use nitroglycerine in small holes , thereby reducing drilling costs and correspondingly increasing the speed of excavation . At Tunnel 6 , and to some extent at Tunnel 8 , nitroglycerine was used , being prepared on the spot by James Howden at a cost of about seventy-five cents a pound . It was thought to be eight times as effective as powder , and building progress was increased by 50 per cent . Work on the tunnels was carried on throughout the winter of 1866-1867 , although Tunnels 1 and 2 , both west of Cisco , were finished in 1866 . Some work had been done on the approach cuts to the Summit Tunnel late in 1865 , but winter set in before much was accomplished , and the work gangs were driven out . During 1866 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three shifts of eight hours each . Some storms occurred in November and December , but by the time winter arrived the headings were all under ground . The work was then independent of the weather , except as storms would block tunnel entrances or avalanches would sweep over the work camps . In spite of these difficulties , excavation went on inside and much was taken out through tunnels in the snow . Tunnel 6 took longest to complete on account of its length and its position at the head of Donner Pass , but it was finally holed through in November , 1867 . Much of the foregoing information regarding tunnels was obtained from an account contributed to the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1870 by John R. Gilliss , engineer in charge under L. M. Clement . In describing the work , Gilliss dwells on the snowstorms of the high Sierra and the difficulties of carrying on work . All accounts of the winters emphasized the violence of the storms and the deep snows . Speaking of the winter of 1866-1867 Gilliss says : " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short snow squall to a two-week gale , and in depth from a  | quarter of an inch to ten feet ? none less than the former number being recorded , nor had we occasion to note any greater than the latter . This , the heaviest storm of the winter began February 18th at 2 P. M. and snowed steadily until 10 P. M. of the 22nd , during which time six feet fell . . . . It snowed steadily until March 2nd , making ten feet of snow and thirteen days of storm . It is true that no snow fell for five days , but it drifted so furiously that in time the snow tunnel at the east end of Tunnel No. 6 had to be lengthened fifty feet . " The storms were grand . They always began with a fall in the barometer and a strong wind from the southwest . . . . The thermometer was rarely below twenty degrees at the beginning of a storm , and usually rose to thirty-two degrees before its close so that the last snow would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The storms ended and clouds were scattered by cold winds blowing over the eastern range of the Sierra Nevada ; these raised the barometer and dropped the temperature at once . The lowest temperature of the winter was from a wind of this sort , five and a half degrees above zero . " Gilliss gives a picture of the furious winds that roared through the pass , piling the snow into towering drifts . He tells also of the difficulties in breaking roads , and of the use of snowshoes by the men . Of the snow slides or snow avalanches , he gives the following graphic account : " Snow slides or avalanches were frequent . The storm winds being always from the southwest , form drifts or snow wreaths on the northeast crests of hills . When these become too heavy , which is generally towards the close of the storms , they break off , and in falling start the loose snow below . This slides on the old crust . I never knew of a slide from the ground . " Near the close of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Scotchmen , brothers , and sub-contractors with their gang , some fifteen or sixteen men in all , was crushed and buried up at day-break . The storm ended at noon . Towards evening a man coming up the road missed the house and  | alarmed the camp , so that by six o'clock the men were dug out . The bulk of the slide had passed over and piled itself up beyond the house , so that it was only covered fifteen feet deep . Only three were killed ; the bunks were close to the log walls and kept the rest from being crushed . Most of them were conscious and strange to say , the time had passed rapidly with them , although about fourteen hours under the snow : . . . ( The snow slides ) were so frequent across the trail leading to Tunnel No. 9 , some fifteen or twenty Chinamen were killed by a slide about this time . The year before , two road repairers had been killed and buried , too , by a slide , and their bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnels were carried out to the waste banks through tunnels dug through the snow that filled the approach cuts . The length of the snow tunnels varied from 50 to 200 feet , and some of the tunnels were big enough for a twohorse team to walk through . At Tunnel 8 a snow tunnel for the men was dug around the outside of the rock ledge through which the tunnel was being excavated . As the rock tunnel was 375 feet in length , the snow tunnel must have been at least 500 feet long . In the spring , when the wagon roads down the mountain had begun to be bare , snow had to be dug out of the cuts in order that the road could be used . One such snow bank was twenty-five feet deep . The snowfall in the winter of 1866-1867 and also in the following winter was extremely heavy . Over forty-four feet of snow fell and the depth of hard packed snow in Summit Valley was eighteen feet . This extraordinary snowfall comes from the storms that sweep in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain precipitation increases about one inch for each 100 feet up to 5,000 feet as a storm climbs up over the Sierra . While the average rainfall may be eighty inches , it has occasionally reached more than 100 inches . Once the storm passes over the summit of the range the snowfall rapidly decreases . At Truckee there may be from two to three feet , and at  | Reno , at the base of the mountains , only a few inches of snow may fall . As has been mentioned , when the railroad over the Sierra Nevada was projected by Theodore Judah , he believed that the railroad line could be kept open during the winter by using the ordinary snow plows of that period . Such plows only shoved the snow to each side of the tracks , where it packed . In the fall of 1866 the road had reached Cisco , where experience during the following winter proved that snow plows would not solve the problem . Most of the snow had to be removed by hand and it was therefore necessary to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obvious that some other method had to be found to keep the road open . Much discussion followed before it was finally decided that snow sheds and galleries were the only solution . To build fifty-odd miles of these structures was unprecedented in railroad work and the cost would be heavy , but there was no alternative . The work was entrusted to Arthur Brown , Engineer of Bridges and Buildings . In the summer of 1867 some experimental sheds were erected from a design that was later modified . In 1868 the building of the sheds was begun , all the cuts were covered with sheds , and at the points where there was danger of avalanches , snow galleries were built . As the great rush across the deserts of Nevada and Utah was then under way , it was vitally necessary to keep the railroad open for through traffic in order that supplies would reach the builders at the end of the track without interruption . Men were gathered from every source and were paid high wages for the work . About 2,500 men were employed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not until the fall of 1869 , months after the rails had been joined at Promontory , that work on the snow sheds was finished . The sheds were built with two sides and a steep peaked roof . Owing to the lack of sawed timber , hewn timber and round  | logs were often used . The galleries differed from the sheds in that they had but one side and a roof that sloped upward until it met the mountain side . This design permitted avalanches to slide over the gallery , some of which extended up the mountainside as much as two hundred feet . In some places , masonry walls were built across canyons where avalanches occurred , to prevent an avalanche from striking the side of the vulnerable wooden construction . The total completed length of the sheds and galleries was about thirty-seven miles , the building of which consumed 65,000,000 feet board measure of lumber and 900 tons of bolts , spikes , and other iron . The cost was over $2,000,000 , but the sheds and galleries did accomplish the purpose of protecting the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about changes in the design of snow sheds , but the railroad still depends upon such works to keep the line open for traffic throughout the entire year . With the exception of the great bridge over the American River at Sacramento , spans were of moderate size on the Central Pacific . However , over the Sierra Nevada the location of the line was such that long , high trestles were often necessary . They were employed as an economy measure on the first construction , but it was also true that they speeded up the progress of the road . For a number of years after the opening of the road to traffic , the work of filling the canyons crossed by trestles was carried on , the time for the fill-ins being determined by the condition of the individual wooden trestle . Where fills were made across small water courses , cut stone culverts were generally used , the stone being set in Portland cement . The bridge over the American River was a work of considerable magnitude . As first built , there were two spans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 400 feet . In addition , there was a trestle approach on the south or Sacramento side  | of 2,196 feet , and one on the north side of 2,890 feet over the bottom lands of the river . The total length of trestle was thus 5,086 feet , making the total length of the bridge 5,486 feet , or over a mile . Trusses of the bridge were simple Howe trusses , where all members , including the lower chord , were of timber , with only the vertical members being of iron . The original bridge was founded on pile piers that were later replaced by stone masonry piers . The stone piers rested on piles that had been driven into the bed of the river , cut off below low water , and covered with a timber grillage . The first bridge burned a few years after it was built . Most of the bridges on the line were also erected with a truss span having trestle approaches at one or both ends . At Long Ravine there were three Howe trusses with a combined length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trestle of a maximum height of seventy feet , the total length of the bridge being 878 feet . Others of this type , with truss spans exceeding 100 feet , were the bridges at Lower and Upper Cascade Creek , each with spans of 204 feet ; at Cold Creek , 126 feet ; at Little Truckee and at Prosser Creek , each with spans of 105 feet ; the first , third , fourth , and fifth crossing of the Truckee River , with spans of 150 feet ; the first crossing of Humboldt River of 129 feet and the second crossing of the same stream of 150 feet . All of these truss spans were of the Burr type , which was the same as the Howe truss , with a wooden arch in addition , built alongside the trusses from end to end and abutting upon the piers or abutments . The Burr type was popular with bridge engineers at that time , but went out of use a long time ago . All of these bridges rested upon stone masonry piers , usually on rock sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were numerous trestles made with bents spaced about sixteen feet apart , with wooden stringers spanning the space between on which the ties of the track rested . The bents were made of four posts , one on the bottom , two inclined , and one as a cap at the top . Longitudinal girls connected the  | several bents , which were sometimes in two or more stages . The bents rested upon stone masonry foundations . In some cases , where the track was high above a gully , the trestles were made up of short spans of trusses , about forty feet in length . An example of this combination was the Secret Town trestle , where there were 280 lineal feet of forty-foot spans and 820 lineal feet of trestle , a total of about 1,100 feet of timber structures with a maximum height of ninety feet . There were originally a number of long , standard-type trestles crossing low places or ravines . Among these , on the ascent of the Sierra Nevada were : Newcastle , 528 feet long ; Auburn , 416 feet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gap , 496 feet ; Clipper Gap , 464 feet ; Clipper Ravine , 450 feet ; and Butte Canyon , 48 feet . The height of the trestles ranged up to seventy feet . At the time the road was nearing completion , culverts had been built on 375 miles of line . They were usually of stone , but some were of brick , and all were laid in hydraulic cement . The bottoms were paved , and some of large size were made to be used as cattle crossings . On the line across the desert , where stone could not be easily obtained , short trestles were built in place of culverts , although as a rule the water courses were small . Culverts were afterward built at these places . A telegraph line and other adjuncts of a railroe , d were built along the main track . The track sidings and turnouts aggregated about 71/2 per cent of the length of the main line . The necessary rolling stock was determined at first by the needs of construction . Near the close of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two drivers , 110 had four drivers , and fifty had six drivers , the number of drivers depending on the capacity of the locomotive . One locomotive had been constructed in San Francisco , the others had been purchased from various companies in the eastern states . At that time thirtysix additional locomotives were being shipped west and twentyeight more were under construction . There were some passen- ger cars , but when the road opened there were not enough . The first sleeping car , the " Silver Palace Sleeping Car , " arrived at Sacramento June 8 , 1868 . There were 1,694 freight cars of various types , with additional cars being manufactured at the company 's shops at Sacramento at the rate of eight a day . Snow plows were provided for all the locomotives . Turntables had been built at section points , with principal shops being located at Sacramento , where all necessary machinery had been installed for repair and construction of both cars and locomotives . Passenger and freight stations had been built at depots , while at Sacramento a wharf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watering stations as far east as Wadsworth were easily found , but across the desert water had to be obtained from wells or from springs from which it was piped to the railroad . The wells at Humboldt Wells and in Thousand Springs Valley furnished much of the supply . One reason for locating the road north of Great Salt Lake was the fact that water was available on that route , whereas it was lacking on the salt deserts south of the The Central Pacific Railroad of California was incorporated June 28 , 1861 , and a year and six months later , on January 8 , 1863 , ground was broken at Sacramento , marking the commencement of the actual work of building the railroad . As a local newspaper described the event , there were gathered on the water-soaked levee on Front Street near K , " Dignitaries of the state , representatives of every portion of the commonwealth and a great gathering of citizens to see Leland Stanford , newly elected governor and president of the Central Pacific Railroad of California , break ground for the commencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States for the first time a united country and open to California an era of great development . " Women looked on from near-by balconies , a brass band played , a preacher called for divine blessing on the work , and Stanford said that the work would go on with " no delay , no  | halting , no uncertainty in its continued progress . " He cast a few shovelfuls of earth from a cart and told his hearers that they could look forward with confidence to the completion of the road . He used more flowery terms that seemed appropriate for the occasion , and then followed a spate of oratory by a group of politicians whose names have since passed into oblivion . Charles Crocker , who was master of ceremonies , then said , in a more practical vein : " This is no idle ceremony . The pile driver is now , while I am talking , driving piles for the foundation of the bridge across the American River . Tomorrow morning one of the subcontractors who owns these teams and has brought this earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will proceed across the river and commence the labor of grading . It is going right on , gentlemen , I assure you ! All that I have ? all of my own strength , intellect , and energy ? are devoted to the building of this section which I have undertaken . Amen . " A mural painting in the Southern Pacific depot at Sacramento idealizes the scene , which was more significant than many of those present could appreciate . It is probable that Judah was there , but there is no record of a speech being made by the man who had originated the project and to whom much credit was then due . Grading and bridge building went forward slowly and it was not until October 8 , 1863 , that the ship , Herald of the Morning , arrived at San Francisco with rail . The first rail was laid on October 26 , and the next month , on November 10 , the first locomotive , the " Governor Stanford , " moved over the rails , Grading across the level plain was easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been finished to Roseville , eighteen miles distant , train service started . It had taken fourteen months from the time when ground was first broken to build those eighteen miles . Judah had been in his grave four months . The fundamental trouble with the constructive progress , or rather lack of progress , was due to a lack of money . The Law of 1862 had not produced any securities that would sell , other  | than government bonds , and forty miles of road had to be built before those bonds became available . However , the builders went on slowly with the construction , and Newcastle , thirty-one miles from Sacramento , was reached on January 31 , 1865 . Two years had been consumed in building thirty-one miles of railroad under favorable physical conditions . But by that time the Law of 1864 had been passed , and the Civil War was soon to close , and from that date on until the line was completed to Promontory , four years later , progress was rapid . The contract for constructing the first eighteen miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the firm 's board of directors , and Crocker had sublet the work of grading to several other contractors . On the section as far as Newcastle , Crocker was given only two miles to construct , the remaining road being awarded to other minor contractors . This method was unsatisfactory from a number of standpoints . The contractors bid against each other for the scanty supply of labor ; some work was finished and other parts left unfinished , as the small contractors failed to complete their work on time . For these and other reasons , a general contract was given to Charles Crocker to build to the California-Nevada line , and from that point on the work was in the hands of the Contract and Finance Company , which was the Big Four under a different name . In building the railroad to Dutch Flat , the construction forces relied on local wagon roads that had been built by the mining interests , but beyond Dutch Flat there was no road of any importance . As a wagon road is a vital adjunct to the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high range of mountains such as the Sierra Nevada , the directors of the Central Pacific organized the Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road . This was the basic reason for the road , but there were other reasons that were also important . At that time the mines of the Comstock Lode at Virginia City and Gold Hill were under intensive development and thousands of people had gathered in that region . All supplies had to be obtained in Cali- fornia , and therefore a highly developed system of animal-drawn freighting had been organized . It was a profitable business while it lasted . The route led from Folsom , at the terminus of the Sacramento Valley Railroad , and over the mountains by way of Placerville and the South Fork of the American River , across two summits to the Carson Valley , thence to Virginia City . The ninety-mile Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Road , which was started in 1862 , was built at a cost of $100,000 , being completed in June , 1864 . There was some profit from it but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad reached Reno in June , 1868 , the highway was completely abandoned , but it had already served its principal purpose as a construction road . The road was located over the Donner Summit , where the railroad was to be built , because no road crossed that rocky gap . There was some semblance of a road that led up Cold Creek and across Emigrant Pass to Summit Valley , but this pass was some 700 feet higher than Donner Pass , although easier for wagons to cross . Today , tourists traveling through the pass by automobile can see portions of the old construction road where it leads eastward from the summit . The road could not be kept open for wagons during the ' winter , so animal-drawn sleighs were used for the transportation of men and animals for the construction forces . It was over this road that the rolling stock and materials were moved in the winter of 1866-1867 . Three locomotives , forty cars , and material for forty miles of track , together with camp supplies , were hauled from Cisco across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over twenty miles . The locomotives were carried on sledges made from logs that had been split down the middle and rounded at the ends . This work was often done during raging blizzards and it was sometimes even necessary to transfer construction forces from the snowbound western side of the Sierra to the eastern slope , where the snowfall was less and work could go on . In this manner about fifty miles of road were corn- pleted down the eastern side of the mountains before the summit tunnel had been opened and the final track laid across the summit . Track laying was organized under Strobridge as a part of the general construction contract , and not , as on the Union Pacific , as a separate contract . A camp train moved ahead with the track at the speed at which the track was being laid . Trains of track material came from Sacramento , with ties being obtained from mills along the Truckee River . Rails , fastenings , and ties were first dumped on the ground and were then loaded in horsedrawn cars that carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of ties were then placed in position to hold the rail and the rail gang carried forward two rails to place them on the ties , where a spiking and bolting crew fastened them into place . The small car was then moved ahead and the operation was repeated . When the car was empty , it was tipped off the track so that another car could be pulled past it . The empty car was then returned to the track and sent back for another load . It was on the track of the Central Pacific , near Promontory , that the laying of ten miles of track in one day of twelve hours was achieved on April 28 , 1869 . This accomplishment stands as a record even today . The Union Pacific under the able management of the Casement brothers , had stepped up track laying from one mile a day to an average of about three miles , and on one occasion , when everything was favorable , had laid eight and one half miles . The uncorroborated story runs that Durant bet Crocker $10,000 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , Crocker was determined to beat the record of the other road . It was close to the end of the great race of the two roads across the country ; therefore Crocker waited until the distance between the track was so short that there was no chance for the rival road to beat the record he hoped to make . An accident on April 27 delayed the start , but on the next day the contest was held , with a newspaper correspondent timing  | the movement of the track layers . The first rail was laid and others followed at the rate of about 240 feet of rail in one minute and twenty seconds . A 's the reporter said : " It may seem incredible , but nevertheless it is a fact that the whole ten miles of rail were handled and laid down this day by eight white men . . These men were Michael Shay , Michael Kennedy , Michael Sullivan , Patrick Joyce , Thomas Dailey , George Wyatt , Edward Kioleen , and Fred McNamara . These eight Irishmen in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The rails were fifty-six pounds to the yard and weighed 560 pounds each . On curves , the rail was bent in the usual manner . In all , there were brought up and placed 25,800 ties , 3,520 rails , 55,000 spikes , 7,040 poles , and 14,080 bolts , a total of 4,362,000 pounds . The distance was ten miles and 200 feet , and representatives of the Union Pacific were present to measure the distance . The track was ballasted with the ties tamped , so that a train was run over the line that night . It was a notable achievement . That ten-mile stretch of track was later marked by signs recording the feat . The telegraph line was built at the same time the track was laid . Poles were brought out on the material trains and distributed by wagons . The cross-arms were fastened to them , a gang of laborers under a foreman dug the holes , and a third gang erected them . The wire was then brought forward on a wagon and unwound from a reel as the wagon went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the insulators . Great rivalry existed between the telegraph gangs and the track gangs , the former being sometimes delayed by lack of poles . However , at the end of a day the wires were connected to a temporary telegraph set and communication established with the supply points at the rear . It is customary to indicate the progress of construction of a railroad by the position of the rail head , or end of track . That is the measure of the advance of the operated track but not of the progress of the entire project , as much difficult work may be  | in progress beyond the end of track that must be completed before track laying is resumed . The tunnels at the summit of the Sierra Nevada held the end of track at Cisco for over a year , but still work went on beyond Truckee . The following record of track should be of interest . The first rail was laid at Sacramento October 26 , 1863 ; and Roseville , eighteen miles away , was reached February 29 , 1864 . Newcastle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1864 , and then there was a long delay . The line was in operation to Clipper Gap , forty-three miles , June 10 , 1865 , and to Colfax , fifty-five miles from Sacramento , September 10 of that year . Grading had begun beyond Colfax on August 1 , 1865 , when work was started on the Summit Tunnel . In July of 1866 trains were running to Dutch Flat , and by November 9 to Cisco , ninety-four miles from Sacramento . At this point the track was held up , although about fifty miles of track were laid east of the mountains . In August , 1867 , the Summit Tunnel was completed , together with the other tunnels , leaving only a sevenmile gap in the track at the end of that year , between Coldstream and Tunnel 12 . The completed track reached Truckee April 3 , 1868 ; Reno , 154 miles , June 19 ; and Wadsworth , 189 miles from Sacramento , July 22 . The road across the desert from Wadsworth to Promontory , a distance of 501 miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of May , 1869 . Actually , 523 miles of line were built in ten months , July 1 , 1868 , to May 1 , 1869 , and about fifty miles of grading had been done beyond Promontory . Afterward the Central Pacific purchased forty-seven and one half miles and leased five miles of line from the Union Pacific so that a connection could be made at Ogden . In this manner the Central Pacific comprised 742 miles of line from Sacramento to Ogden , and the Union Pacific 1,032 miles of line from Omaha to the same place , a total length from Sacramento to Omaha of 1,774 miles . Accounts differ as to the number of men that worked on the Central Pacific . On the western side of the Sierra Nevada there  | were about 11,000 men employed at the time of maximum effort . It has been stated that , in the race with the Union Pacific , from western Nevada to Promontory , the Central Pacific employed from 5,000 to 6,000 men . Thirty vessels were at sea at one time carrying supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning out ties , bridge timbers , and fuel . The men on the western side of the mountains were moved eastward as the construction work progressed . The experience of one engineer , J. M. Graham , was typical of this progress . Employed first at the Summit , Graham moved progressively to the Truckee River , to the Truckee Meadows , to Wadsworth , to Humboldt Station , to Emigrant Canyon , to Palisade , and finally to the Toana Mountains . In a report to Leland Stanford , Strobridge describes the construction work under his charge : I was superintendent of construction , during the building of the road . The work was pushed with the utmost vigor ; all the men were hired that could be found and no effort or expense was spared to complete the road as quickly as possible . In this way it was finished and in operation from Sacramento , Cal. , to Ogden , Utah , about seven years sooner than was required by the act of Congress . During construction very high prices were paid for powder and all tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared that would hasten its completion and the work was pushed regardless of the season . The winter of 1865 and 1866 was a very wet one , making the roads on the clay soils of the foothills nearly impassable for vehicles . Large numbers of pack animals had to be brought into use and on them were carried nearly all supplies and even hay and grain over steep mountain trails to the construction camps . ... During the winter of 1866 and 1867 and the following winter of 1867 and 1868 there were unusual snowfalls in the upper Sierra Nevadas where the road was then under construction . The tunnels were got under way with as large a force as could be used on them and the remainder of the force was sent to the Truckee canyon on the east slope of the Sierras where the snowfall was not so great as to  | prevent entirely grading during the winter , the total force being about 13,500 men at that time . . . . In the spring of each year the men were taken back from the Truckee into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of snow was cleared away before grading could be commenced . In crossing the deserts eastward from the Truckee River , water for men and animals was hauled at one time forty miles . It was necessary to have the heavy work in Palisade Canyon done in advance of the main force , and 3,000 men with 400 horses and carts were sent to that point , a distance of 300 miles in advance of the track . Hay , grain , and all supplies for the men and horses had to be hauled over the desert for that great distance , there being no supplies to be obtained on the entire route . The winter of 1868 and 1869 was one of severe cold . The construction was in progress in the upper Humboldt Valley , where the ground was frozen to a depth of two to three feet , and material required blasting and treatment like rock which could have been cheaply moved in a more favorable time . The road from Wadsworth to Ogden , about 555 miles , was built between July , 1868 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force averaging 5,000 men . As the road advanced across the desert , the same procedure of sending men and supplies to advance points was followed . The final advance outfit was sent from Wadsworth to Promontory , as construction east of that point was done by the Mormons . On the Central Pacific there was little or no trouble from liquor , gambling , and prostitution such as troubled the builders of the Union Pacific . The common laborers were Chinese , who kept to themselves . The white men were above the grade of ? laborers , but credit for the absence of saloons was due to Sacbridge . He hated liquor , and whenever someone set up a tent to sell it , the superintendent sent men to destroy the tent and if objections were offered to destroy the liquor . His actions may not have been quite legal , but the railroad builders were the only law in that uninhabited region , and drastic action was deemed necessary .  | There is no record of any particular Indian trouble on the Central Pacific , in contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In western Nevada the Piutes were the only tribe of any consequence , and they had been subdued in what was known at Virginia City as the " Indian War . " In previous years Indians had murdered a number of emigrants and had robbed the pioneers ' wagon trains , but much of the trouble should have been laid to the deeds of renegade white men , bad whiskey , and outrages committed by the whites against the Indians . In 1860 , several white men were murdered by Indians at William 's Station in revenge for assaults on Indian women . When a party of men under Major Ormsby was sent out after the redskins , the party was trapped on the Truckee River near Pyramid Lake , and a number , including Major Ormsby , were killed . A larger expedition soon afterwards defeated the Indians and drove them into the northern deserts . In eastern Nevada and in Utah there were constant conflicts betwen the Indians and the operators of the stages , which finally led to the establishment of a number of military posts through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Pacific , the federal government in 1867 established Fort Halleck near the north end of the Ruby Mountains , not far from the Humboldt River . The presence of troops at Fort Halleck and the operations of General Patrick E. Conner in cleaning out the Indians had its effect , and while brushes with the Indians occurred from time to time , this did not delay the building of the Central Pacific . By the Law of 1862 , the Central Pacific was authorized to build eastward as far as the Missouri River , provided the eastern roads had not built westward . The Law of 1864 , inspired by the Union Pacific , limited the Central Pacific to building to a point 150 miles east of the California-Nevada line , the Union Pacific to meet with it at that point . Huntington was not espe- cially worried by that provision , preferring to allow the matter to come up later . The subject was brought to a head in 1866 , and by the Act of Congress of July 3 of that year the " Central Pacific Railroad Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Interior , are hereby authorized to locate , construct and continue their road eastward , in a continuous completed line until they meet and connect with the Union Pacific Railroad . " Each company was prohibited from working more than 300 miles in advance of their completed lines . At all times it was the intent of the laws that the two railroads should join when and where they met . The men of each road , however , interpreted this statement to suit themselves . The Union Pacific graded a complete line to Promontory and a partial line to Monument Point , and did a small amount of work as far west as Humboldt Wells , about 168 miles west of Promontory . The Central Pacific made its surveys and filed its maps beyond Ogden as far east as the eastern end of Echo Canyon , and had graded to Ogden . Thus the grading of the roads , more or less complete , paralleled each other for about 200 miles . The struggle was for the trade of the Salt Lake region and for the subsidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul over the total distance . Over a million dollars were wasted in the struggle between the two roads . A compromise was finally offered to the Union Pacific by Huntington , by which the Union Pacific would build its road to Promontory and the Central Pacific would then purchase enough of the line to enable it to reach Salt Lake Valley . As an alternative , he would continue with his plans of extending the Central Pacific to Ogden . He seemed to hold the trump cards when he applied for and received over a million dollars in government bonds for the line east of Ogden . The struggle had reached a point where the grading crews of the two railroads were setting off blasts that killed men on the rival line , when Huntington 's compromise was accepted by the Union Pacific . The Union Pacific agreed  | to join rails at Promontory and to sell forty-seven and one half miles of line extending to within five miles of Ogden for 54,000,224.96 . When this agreement was reached , Congress ratified it on April 10 , stating that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Railroads shall be at or near Ogden ; and the Union Pacific Railroad Company shall build , and the Central Pacific Railroad Company shall pay for and own , the railroad from the terminus aforesaid to Promontory Point , at which point the rails shall meet and connect and form one continuous line . " Later the price to be paid was reduced and the Central Pacific leased the remaining five miles into Ogden for 999 years . Thus , after much pointless struggle and waste of money , the meeting point was settled and the proper junction , Ogden , was determined . The early building years of the two railroads did not interest the general public especially , but after the Civil War ended and as progress on the work was accelerated , the attention of the American people became focused on the great project . Prominent men journeyed into the West to see the work , and editors all over the country described it . In the year 1868 , the race across the Utah and Nevada deserts by the Central Pacific and across the Wyoming Basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union Pacific was in full swing . Every day the newspapers of the country carried bulletins of miles laid and vivid descriptions of progress made . It soon became apparent that the meeting of the rails would take place some time in the first part of 1869 , almost seven years sooner than the date set by Congress for completion . In April came the last rush , and on the 28th of that month Crocker and his men laid the ten miles that set the track-laying record . The gap between the tracks grew smaller and smaller until finally early in May it was seen that it would close on or before May 8 . The Union Pacific permitted the last of its rowdy construction towns to be established at Promontory , complete  | with saloons , gambling dens , and houses of prostitution . The celebration of the meeting of the rails and the driving of the last spike was set for May 8 , but the Union Pacific train bearing the official delegation was late , and so the ceremonies had to be held on May 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various writers , but the eyewitness account given by Sidney Dillon , then a director and later president of the Union Pacific , covers the essential points . He said : The point of junction was the level circular valley about three miles in diameter surrounded by mountains . During all the morning hours the hurry and bustle of preparation went on . Two lengths of rail lay on the ground near the opening in the roadbed . At a little before eleven the Chinese laborers began leveling up the roadbed preparatory to placing the last ties in position . About a quarter after eleven , the train from San Francisco he should have said from Sacramento with Governor Stanford and his party arrived and was greeted with cheers . In the enthusiasm of the occasion there were cheers for everybody , from the president of the Union Pacific to the day laborers on the road . The two engines moved nearer each other and the crowd gathered around the open spaces . Then all fell back a little so that the view should be unobstructed . Brief remarks were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . It was now about twelve o'clock noon , local time , or about two P.M. in New York . The two superintendents of construction , J. H. Strobridge of the Central Pacific and S. B. Reed of the Union Pacific , placed the last tie on the rails . It was of California laurel , highly polished , with a silver plate in the center bearing the following inscription : The last tie laid on the completion of the Pacific Railroad , May 10 , 1869 , with the names of the officers and directors of both companies . Everything was then in readiness , the word was given and " Hats Off " went clicking over the wire to the waiting crowds at New York , Philadelphia , San Francisco , and all principal cities . Prayer was offered by Mr. Todd , at the conclusion of which our operator tapped out : " We have  | got done praying . The spike is about to be presented , " to which the response came back : " We understand . All ready in the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four spikes , two of gold and two of silver , from Montana , Idaho , California , and Nevada , stepped forward and with brief appropriate remarks , discharged the duty assigned to them . Governor Stanford , standing on the north , and Dr. Durant on the south side of the track , received the spikes and put them in place . The operator tapped out , " All ready now . The spike will soon be driven . The signal will be three dots for the commencement of the blows . " An instant later the silver hammers came down and , at each stroke , in all the offices from San Francisco to New York , the hammer struck the bell . The signal " Done " was received at Washington at 2:47 P.M. , which was about a quarter of one at Promontory . There was not much formality in the demonstration that followed , but the enthusiasm was genuine and unmistakable . The two engines moved up until they touched each other and a bottle of champagne was poured on the last rail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were several photographs taken , in one of which General Dodge and Montague , the engineers of the two roads , are shown shaking hands . It was fitting that Strobridge , superintendent of construction on the Central Pacific , and Reed , of the Union Pacific , should be there and take a prominent part in the ceremony . For some reason never explained , Crocker was not there to meet Durant of the Union Pacific , though they represented the driving forces that had pushed the construction over the plains , mountains , and deserts for nearly 1,800 miles . The memory of General Dodge must have gone back over the years to that day in 1853 , sixteen years before , when he had crossed the Missouri River with his survey party on the first investigation of the Pacific Railroad . The other great engineer , Theodore Judah , had been dead for six years , but undoubtedly he was not forgotten by those at the ceremonies .  | There were celebrations in many cities of the country . The telegraph company had arranged for bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Boston , and Omaha by the strokes of the hammer that drove the last spike . A gun was fired at Fort Point in San Francisco . In Chicago there was a parade . In New York a salute of 100 guns was fired , and the bells of Trinity Church . were rung . There were celebrations at Omaha and Sacramento , and ministers throughout the nation preached sermons about the work . The importance of the great achievement was everywhere appreciated with the closing of the line at Promontory , being justly regarded as the greatest engineering and construction feat of the ninetenth century . When the ceremonies were concluded a luncheon was held in Stanford 's car , and then the trains separated . There was still work to be done , but in the weeks that followed the working forces gradually melted away . Many of the men went into the operating forces of the two railroads , but most of the engineers moved to other railroads and were active in later construction . Many railroads were to be built across the continent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been completed . It was not long before the shacks that formed the town of Promontory Point disappeared and nature reclaimed the lonely valley . Since that time some attempts at farming have been made there , but today the desert mountains with their sparse growth of stunted trees look down in silence upon the historic spot where the great enterprise was culminated . A concrete monument erected there bears this inscription : LAST SPIKE COMPLETING FIRST TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD DRIVEN AT THIS SPOT MAY 10TH 1869  | The line over the Promontory Mountains was operated for more than thirty-three years , but was largely discarded when the Lucin Cutoff across the Great Salt Lake was opened for service in 1903 . Later , most of the western end of the line was abandoned , and in 1942 , during the World War II , the entire line of , rails from Corinne to Lucin was scrapped . The railroads were not completed when the tracks were joined . There was still much work to be done , even to comply with the requirements of the government . To settle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a special commission of five men that was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior , J. D. Cox . The Central Pacific was examined in September , 1869 , and the commission 's report included a list of twenty-seven items to be completed at an estimated cost of $576,650 . The inspection of the Union Pacific was made in the same month , and the cost of the sixty-four items listed was estimated as $1,586,100 . The commission concludes its report , which is dated October 30 , 1869 , with the following statement : " This great line , the value of which to the country is inestimable , and in which every citizen should feel a pride , has been built in about half the time allowed by Congress , and is now a good and reliable means of communication between Omaha and Sacramento , well equipped and fully prepared to carry passengers and freight with safety and dispatch , comparing in this respect favorably with a majority of first-class roads in the United States . " The actual date of the completion of the two roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . The report of the commission was not conclusive , as it noted in the case of each road that additional work was necessary . In November , the Secretary of the Interior released to the companies the remaining bonds that were due them , but required that collateral securities be deposited with him . However , the Secretary refused for five years to issue patents for the lands . On request of the Union Pacific another commission ,  | this one of three men , was appointed , and after an examination rendered a report that the roads had been completed as required by law , by the report of the former commission , and by the instructions of the Department of the Interior on October 1 , 1874 . However , when the Secretary of the Treasury , acting under the Law of 1874 , demanded payment of 5 per cent of the net earnings , he gave the date of completion for the Central Pacific as the 16th of July , 1869 , and of the Union Pacific as the 6th of November , 1869 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Pacific , in which the court held that the above completion dates would hold as far as payment of the 5 per cent was concerned , inasmuch as these were the dates when the last bonds were delivered by the government to the railroad companies .  | IN THE group of men who built the Union Pacific , three were most outstanding for determination , natural ability , and force of character . They were Durant ; the projector , vice president , and general manager whose incessant activity carried all before him ; Dodge , the chief engineer , under whose direction the difficult location was made ; and Oakes Ames , the financier without whose efforts financial failure would have been almost certain . Close behind these three were General Dix , Oliver Ames , Sidney Dillon , Peter A. Dey , the first chief engineer , Samuel B. Reed and James A. Evans , at first engineers on location and later superintendents of construction , and General J. S. Casement and his brother Dan . They were all strong characters and often clashed , but the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weaklings.  | As the first president of the Union Pacific Railroad , mention must be made of General Dix , but as he performed none but the most casual duties of the office he was never a factor in the construction of the road . Dix was born at Poscawen , New Hampshire , July 24 , 1798 , and joined the army at an early age , yet somehow found time to study law . He moved to Albany , New York , was a Democrat in politics , served an unexpired term as United States Senator , was postmaster at New York , and in 1861 became Secretary of the Treasury at Washington . He was active in war work and was appointed Major General in command of New York State troops . In 1862 he was in command of Fortress Monroe , and in 1863 was placed in command of the Union Army 's Department of the East . He served with credit throughout the Civil War , and was appointed Minister to France in November , 1866 , a position he held until 1869 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor of New York and was defeated for a second term . General Dix had engaged in railroad work before the time of the Union Pacific , as president of the Chicago and Rock Island , and also as president of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad . He was therefore the logical choice for president of the Union Pacific . However , the outbreak of the war , his services in the army , and his appointment as Minister to France , together with increasing age , made it impossible for him to attend actively to the affairs of the railroad . General Dix was an accomplished gentleman and a scholar , and was everywhere esteemed for his honesty of purpose . He died April 21 , 1879 . The duties of active service on the railroad fell upon Thomas Durant , vice president , and later on Oliver Ames , who became president . General Dix was little more than a figurehead , having been given the position of president largely because of his excellent reputation .  | Of all the men who were connected with the building of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he who conceived the project , fought for it during the years when its future was most uncertain , and remained with it through the rush of construction to the climax on that day in May , 1869 , when the rails were joined at Promontory . Thomas C. Durant was born at Lee , Massachusetts , February 6 , 1820 , and died October 5 , 1885 . At the age of twenty he graduated from Albany College , where for the next two years he served as assistant professor in medicine . It is from this experience as well as from some practice that he gained the title of Doctor . From medicine he passed into trade in his uncle 's firm , but it was not long before the young man became interested in railroads . The rush to extend lines into the West was on , and Durant was the kind of man who would never be satisfied with a humdrum existence at home . Thomas Durant came into contact with railroad builders through his uncle 's firm and quickly made his presence felt among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for an energetic young man such as Durant . In 1851 he was with Henry Farnam on the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad . Then , early in 1853 , the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad was organized , with John A. Dix as president . Other men connected with the enterprise were Sheffield , Jervis , and Farnam . It is not apparent what part Durant played in the organization , but it is known that he was active in raising money for the work . Peter A. Dey was chief engineer of the road , and his principal assistant was the young Grenville M. Dodge . Surveys were made in 1853 and reached Council Bluffs in November of that year , after which Dodge crossed the Missouri to examine the possibilities of extending the line westward up the valley of the Platte . The result was that the construction of the M. and M. Railroad was awarded to the firm of Farnam and Durant , as by  | that time Sheffield had tired of the work and had given it up . The M. and M. struggled slowly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1857 , when the original road went into bankruptcy . Reorganized , it was absorbed by the Chicago and Rock Island , and so did not reach Council Bluffs until May . or possibly June , 1869 . Henry Farnam , with whom Durant had formed a partnership after the withdrawal of Joseph Sheffield , continued his interest in western railroads , and was later named president of the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad Company . He was active in promoting a railroad to the Pacific coast , and became one of the incorporators of the Union Pacific . Not long afterward he became dissatisfied with the methods of conducting the affairs of that railroad , to a degree that he refused to have anything further to do with it . He lost money in the failure of the M. and M. Railroad in 1857 , and in 1863 he left the Rock Island and retired from active work . From that time on , Durant acted alone . During the latter part of the fifties Farnam and Durant furnished the money for surveys and reconnaissance work as far west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durant forwarded the project of a railroad west of the Missouri . He was one of the active proponents of the Act of Congress of 1862 , was a subscriber for fifty shares at the incorporation of the Union Pacific Railroad Company in 1863 , and became a member of the board of directors at the election on October 29 , 1863 . When the board organized , Major General John A. Dix was chosen president , Thomas C. Durant became vice president , Henry V. Poor , secretary , and John J. Cisco , treasurer . The burden fell upon Durant , as he was a member of two important committees , executive and finance . As vice president and general manager , he had charge of practically everything until the road was completed . Durant wrestled with the problem of starting the road and with the organization of the construction forces . He had ern- ployed as his consulting engineer Silas Seymour , brother of the governor of New York , who was an engineer of some experience in railroad work . The conflict over the location from Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , together with the Hoxie contract , led to the resignation of Dey . The Hoxie contract brought into being the device of the controlled construction company and the formation of the Credit Mobilier . In July , 1865 , Durant became president of the construction company that assumed the obligations that Durant and his friends had taken in financing the Hoxie contract . It was in 1865 that Oakes and Oliver Ames became interested in the Credit Mobilier through purchasing some of its stock . Later , in 1867 , Durant was removed from the Credit Mobilier , which act marked the beginning of the struggle between the two factions . Several court actions resulted in the Oakes Ames contract and the formation of a board of seven trustees , which included Durant . When the Oakes Ames contract was completed , Durant made a contract with J. W. Davis , which was assigned to the same trustees , and the road was completed . Durant at all times appeared on the railroad in a dual capacity . As vice president and general manager , he was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hoxie contract , first with his associates and then under the Credit Mobilier , he was a contractor , and as trustee under the two following contracts he shared in the profits . He insisted in having all the stockholders of the railroad become equivalent shareholders in the construction company . His lawsuits , while ostensibly in the interests of the stockholders , were in reality attempts on his part to fight the other interests . As soon as matters were smoothed out , he joined with the others in the contracts . Durant 's character was such that he seems to have quarreled with nearly everyone with whom he came in contact . He was supposed to have made himself so objectionable to Henry Far ? nam as to cause that gentleman to abandon ' further activities in  | railroads west of the Missouri River . He treated his chief engineer , Dey , in ways that caused Dey to resign , and afterward Durant attempted to cast slurs on Dey 's reputation . Oakes Ames , writing in September 17 , 1867 , to McComb , said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Durant in as a director , unless he withdraws his injunction suits and submits to the will of the majority . He can not hurt us half as badly out of the direction as he can in , and there is no pleasure , peace , safety , or comfort with him unless he agrees to abide by the decision of the majority , as the rest of us do . " When Durant ran into General Dodge he met an antagonist worthy of his steel . Through his subordinates , Dodge had made the location up the slope of the Black Hills , and Durant had caused or permitted his consulting engineer , Silas Seymour , to change it , to the detriment of the road . Then on Rock Creek , west of Laramie , by changing the location already made , they added some twenty miles to the length of the line , with a resulting higher cost to the railroad company . When General Grant and others came west , the subject was reviewed , with the result that Durant lost the controversy and no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in directing construction , and S. B. Reed , superintendent of construction thus describes his inter-ference : " Dr. Durant is still here and of all men to mix accounts and business , he is the chief . . . . To illustrate , I will give you a short history of our work for the past two or three months . In October last I had a large force on grading , enough to have kept the work well out of the way of the track . Davis and his associates had teams enough in the timber to haul ties to the line of the road as fast as they could be laid . The Doctor took all of Davis ' and his associates ' teams down the road to distribute ties and timber . He also took one half of all the force of all the graders on the line and put them on the same service . This reduction of the grading and tie-hauling teams retarded the work so much that before it could be done the ground was frozen  | and a large amount of earth excavation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had my arrangements not been interfered with , at a cost of not exceeding thirty cents per cubic yard , has now cost as much as any solid rock on the line of work , as it was done night and day by blasting frozen ground . Ties , of course , were all used up in a short time and then all the teams that could be obtained at enormous prices were rushed into the mountains to haul ties to the line of the road . Immense amounts of money were squandered uselessly and not as much work done as would have been done if we had kept steadily moving all branches , seeing that none were behind . Then no confusion would have occurred , each part of the work would have kept pace with the others and today more road would have been built than we now have and money enough saved to nearly complete the road to Ogden , thirty-eight miles ... . " A large amount of money has been spent during the past two months and the Doctor himself , I think , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of dollars extra every month he remains here and does not advance , but retards the work ... . " No one can tell by Mr. Durant 's talk what he thinks of a man , his best friends may not know what he means when talking to them . " These quotations are from a compilation of letters written by Samuel B. Reed to his wife and family covering the period of organization of the Union Pacific 's construction , 1864 to 1869 . Durant kept in touch with the road until the rails met at Promontory . He then returned east and never again visited the scene of his labors . On November 18 , 1870 , he was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers . Durant sold his Union Pacific stock and with his large fortune engaged in building the Adirondack Railroad , of which he was chief stockholder , president , and general manager . The panic of 1873 , however , greatly reduced his fortune . He died in 1885 . Thomas C. Durant was evidently neither better nor worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Pacific as a contracting job on which to make money .  | However , his restless energy pushed the road to completion years before it was expected to be finished . While he spent money recklessly , rapid construction might have been justified by the fact that interest charges were thereby reduced and the road placed on an earning basis much sooner . Durant 's dictatorial character repelled many who might have been his friends . His force of character , unceasing determination , and attention to all details in the office or in the field , justifies the conclusion that Durant was the man who above all others deserves credit as the driving force in the building of the great Union Pacific . Oakes Ames was also an indispensable man in the building of the Union Pacific . It was his task , which he took upon himself , to bring to the work sufficient cash resources to make the project financially possible . Oakes Ames , the son of Oliver and Susannah Ames , was born at Easton , Massachusetts , January 10 , 1804 , and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education was obtained in the public schools , with a few months being spent at Dighton Academy . He then entered his father 's tool and shovel factory as a laborer . When his father retired in 1844 , the factory was continued by Oakes and his younger brother , Oliver , who in later years became president of the Union Pacific . Shovels made by the Ames brothers were known over the entire country for their excellent quality . Like many Massachusetts men , Oakes Ames was a " Free Soiler , " with an interest in politics , so that in 1860 he became a member of the Executive Council of his state . In 1862 he was elected to the national House of Representatives , and was reelected four times , serving until his death . In the House he was a member of the Committees on Manufactures and of the Pacific Railroads , where he became familiar with the transcontinental railroad project . In 1865 Ames interested himself in the Credit Mobilier , and  | by his efforts the capital of that company was brought up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By that time it had become apparent that Durant and his friends did not have sufficient resources to carry on the work of building the road . In addition , a rupture took place between Ames and Durant . Durant was thereupon ejected from the Credit Mobilier , with Ames taking over the work of raising funds to complete the road . In this he was successful , although at times the brothers ' shovel business was badly in debt . At one point their private affairs carried obligations amounting to some $8,000,000 , which were liquidated only after Oakes Ames was dead . In order to forward the work on the railroad , Ames took a contract in 1867 for the construction and equipment of 667 miles of road . This section extended from the 100th meridian westward over the Black Hills , and in the opinion of many at the time , the contract was an insane venture owing to the unknown costs that would be encountered in such a region . The venture was ultimately profitable , but Ames made himself responsible for a contract involving over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven trustees and thus personal liability was avoided . It was only by Ames 's assuming a personal contract that financial interests in New England could be brought to the point where they were willing to buy the railroad 's securities . When the Ames contract was completed , the road was so far advanced that the moneyed men saw the project through to the end . It was Oakes Ames 's policy personally to interview men of means to show them the chances of profit in the railroad , which was a difficult job at best because not even Ames himself was positive that it would pay out . However , the construction company that received the railroad securities as payment for work done , did offer a chance to make an immediate profit on the investment , an argument evidently used by Ames . It was with this inducement that he sold a few shares of Credit Mobilier to  | members of Congress in 1867 and 1868 . Some of the most prominent members of Congress , twenty-two in all , purchased stock from Ames in small amounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad needed friends in that body . The road was being assailed from every side by a variety of enemies , some of whom were in Congress , at a time when the company was split by internal dissention . When , in 1872 and 1873 , the storm broke in Congress with the Credit Mobilier investigation , most of the members of that august body who had bought stock , ran for cover . Some denied their transactions and all had excuses for being " accidentally " involved . The result of the investigation was that the Poland Committee brought in a verdict of guilty and recommended the expulsion of Oakes Ames from Congress . Ames had given complete information regarding the transactions and throughout the inquiry had maintained his innocence . The House then changed the verdict to one of censure , which proved to be one of the most absurd verdicts in American history . By it , Ames was judged guilty of having given bribes , but Representative Schuyler Colfax , who was later Vice President , James A. Garfield who later became President , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alleged bribes . Oakes Ames returned to his home at Easton , a worn-out and disillusioned man , stung by the ingratitude of the people whom he thought he had served to the best of his ability . Ten weeks after the vote of censure , he died . His friends , however , did not accept the decision of the politicians in Washington . From all sides came expressions of confidence in Ames and belief in his innocence . A resolution to that effect was even put through the legislature at the time . At a later date the Union Pacific erected a granite pyramid sixty feet high on the Sherman Summit of the Black Hills , on which a bronze tablet records that it was erected to the memory of Oakes and Oliver Ames . The monument still stands , but the relocated Line of the railroad today passes several miles to the south .  | Oakes Ames was a strong , rugged , and tireless worker who gave his energies and his wealth to the building of the Union Pacific in what he believed was his patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for the railroad , since it loaded the road with debt , but it was the method common at the time and Oakes Ames took the situation as he found it . The chance of large profits was the only thing that could induce men of wealth to provide the necessary funds , and even so it required the example of Oakes Ames and his brother Oliver to induce them to subscribe . The condemnation of Ames by the House of Representatives was an ignoble example of politics brought about by the desire of the people for a scapegoat . In later years , long after Ames was dead , the people of Boston erected a memorial hall to record his services . It was opened November 7 , 1881 , with a ceremony at which tributes by prominent men from various parts of the country were read . General Dodge expressed his opinion of Oakes Ames and the proceedings in Congress in the following terms : " In 1865 Oakes and Oliver Ames of Boston became interested in the enterprise , bringing their own fortune and a very large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of the road . There was no man connected with it who devoted his time and money with the single purpose of benefit to the country and Government more than Oakes Ames , and there never was a more unjust , uncalled-for and ungrateful act of Congress than that which censured him for inducing , as it is claimed , members of Congress to take interest in the construction company . . . . Oakes Ames once wrote me , when it seemed almost impossible to raise money to meet of expenditures : ' Go ahead ; the work shall not stop , even if it takes the shovel shop . ' . . . When the clay came that the business of the Ameses should go or the Union Pacific , Oakes Ames said : ' Save the credit of the road ; I will fail . ' It took a man of courage and patriotism to make that decision and lay down a reputation and business credit  | that was invaluable in New England , and one that had come down through almost a century . " Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate at the time of the investigation was familiar with the proceedings , said in his Reminiscenses : " I do not feel disposed to discuss or criticize persons who were involved in the Credit Mobilier investigation , but Oakes Ames , notwithstanding the errors he unwittingly committed , deserves well of the American people , and his name should be cherished by all as a brave , energetic , enterprising man . " The unjust and violent criticism of the press and of ambitious partisans will be deplored in view of the accomplishments of the great work under embarrassing and adverse circumstances and particularly in view of the fact that the Government has received back all of the subsidy granted , dollar for dollar , with interest at six per cent per annum , while the Government was borrowing money for less than four per cent per annum , making a net gain in interest of from two to three per cent . " The boy who was to become a major general of the Union Armies in the Civil War , and who afterward was chief engineer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads , was born at Danvers , Massachusetts , on the 12th of April , 1831 . He died at his home in Council Bluffs on January 3 , 1916 , after having lived eighty-five eventful years . In fact , he outlived most of his comrades of the Civil War , as well as many of the men with whom he had been associated during the building of the Union Pacific . After the usual amount of schooling , Dodge was graduated from Norwich University in December , 1850 , and in the following year underwent a six month 's special military training . This training was to be of value when he entered the army at the outbreak of the Civil War .  | On leaving school , Dodge yielded to the fever that drove able men out of the civilized East into the undeveloped West . With some friends , he worked on survey parties at Peru , Illinois , and shortly afterward joined a survey party on the Illinois Central . Its was at Peru that he met Anne Brown , whom he married on May 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Illinois Central , so it was a stroke of good fortune when he was introduced to Peter A. Dey in 1852 . The next year Dodge was made chief of a survey party . As chief engineer of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad , Dey was about to begin location surveys across Iowa . The surveys commenced at Rock Island and across the river at Davenport , Iowa , on May 27 , 1853 , with Sheffield , Farnam , and Dey being the moving spirits . Dodge , who then was only twenty-two years of age , was appointed principal assistant in charge of party under Dey . The surveyors passed Iowa City and on the 22nd of November reached Council Bluffs , formerly known as Kanesville and at the time a river town of some importance . The Mormons had gathered near there in 1846 and it was from that point in 1847 that Brigham Young led the first party across the plains and mountains to found Salt Lake City . On instruction from Dey , Dodge took his party across the Missouri River and examined the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they reached the valley of the Platte . Unfortunately , financial troubles of the following years put a stop to railroad construction in Iowa , with the result that the M. and M. project failed . Dodge then engaged in various kinds of work , and at one time settled on a farm along the Elkhorn River . However , he continued to gather all information available on the emigrant trails to the Pacific and on the nature of the country , so that he was able to prepare a map that was used by emigrants who crossed the Missouri at Council Bluffs on their way west . In the spring of 1856 Dodge was again at work on the con- struction of the M. and M. Railroad , the promoters again were busy trying to get subsidies from the state and counties , and again the work was stopped , this time by the panic of 1857 . After a trip to New York , where he explained the situation to the directors of the M. and M. and of the Rock Island , Dodge moved his home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of banking , milling , merchandising , contracting , freighting , and real estate . However , in 1859 he was back again in the valley of the Platte making a railroad reconnaissance for Henry Farnam . It was in that same summer of 1859 that , in connection with real estate interests , Lincoln visited Council Bluffs , and Dodge was called on to give the future President a detailed description of the projected route to the ' West . Later , when President , Lincoln remembered the conversation with Dodge and called him to Washington for further information . Dodge was in Washington when Lincoln was inaugurated , having gone there with Farnam , Durant , and other railroad men . Farnam wanted him to give up business so that he could join the Rock Island , and a few days later Dodge did go to New York to talk with the men of that railroad . However , the Civil War broke out shortly after that , and all thoughts of railroading were forgotten for the time being . Owing to his military training at Norwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment . He was at the head of his regiment at the Battle of Pea Ridge , where he was wounded and out of action for two weeks . For his services at Pea Ridge he was made a brigadier general , and in 1862 was sent east of the Mississippi to repair railroads that the Confederates had destroyed . Much of his time in the war was spent in such work . He served under Grant in the western campaigns and was assigned to command a division of the Army of the Tennessee . When Grant went east to command all the armies , Dodge was transferred to Sherman 's command , being with that general on his march to the sea . Dodge next commanded the Sixteenth  | Corps at the Battle of Atlanta , which proved to be the deciding battle of the campaign . Later , in August , the general was critically wounded in the head by a rifle ball and lay unconscious for two days . In fact , a report reached his home in Danvers that he had been killed . On his partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Durant to discuss the affairs of the Union Pacific , and from there proceeded to Grant 's headquarters . He had been commissioned a major general and wanted to get back into the war , but both Grant and Sherman knew that he was physically unfit . He was ordered to the Army of the Tennessee at Nashville , but before reaching it was diverted to St. Louis , where he was given command of the Department of Missouri and told by Lincoln to pacify that state , which was half Union and half Confederate . Dodge took strong measures , remaining in command two months . The war was drawing to a close , so that when the headquarters of the Department of Missouri were moved to Fort Leavenworth to be combined with the Department of Kansas , Dodge was placed in command on January 30 , 1865 . When the war ended , Grant asked that Dodge remain in the regular army . At this time the Indians had become more troublesome than usual , and after Lincoln was assassinated and it was found that the Missouri troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given command of all the United States forces in Kansas , Nebraska , Colorado , and Utah . It was during the military movements of 1865 , when General Dodge was returning through the Black Hills from Fort Laramie , that the long sloping ridge from a mountain pass was discovered . It was the key to an entrance through the mountain fastness for which Dodge had been looking , and it was along that ridge that the Union Pacific was later built . During the war , and afterward in the Indian campaigns , Durant was in constant touch with Dodge and frequently asked him to leave the army to become chief engineer of the railroad , which was then getting started . Durant had tried to handle the  | engineering with several subordinates but had not succeeded , since in the meantime he had alienated Peter Dey . His associates were suspicious of his actions , with the result that after he had spent a large part of his own fortune he could not raise any more money . It was not until the Indian campaign was completed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodge in turn prevailed on Grant and Sherman to allow him to leave . Dodge met Durant in April , 1866 , and on obtaining a leave of absence from the army from General Grant , he entered upon his duties as the Union Pacific 's chief engineer at Omaha , May 6 , 1866 . At that time the Hoxie contract was under way and the railroad was moving west toward the 100th meridian . From that point on , the story of the Union Pacific was to a great extent the story of its chief engineer . Dodge 's attention was directed first to determining the route over the Black Hills and across the Wyoming Basin to Salt Lake . As chief engineer of the railroad he did not have charge of construction and had no control over contractors , but he did occupy a position of trust with the parties in the organization opposed to Durant and they relied upon him to counterbalance Durant 's questionable moves . It was Dodge who stood his ground when Durant revised the location of the line to the disadvantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which went into the treasury of the Credit Mobilier . Throughout the entire work Dodge had the full confidence of the men who were furnishing the money , and he also had the full confidence of Generals Grant and Sherman . While Durant had the power , and while he made enemies at every turn , the influence of Dodge went a long way in holding Durant in check and in keeping the project moving . Mrs. Dodge , with money probably furnished by her husband , bought 100 shares of Credit Mobilier stock ; and the Wilson Committee , in 1873 , endeavored to blacken Dodge 's reputation from this circumstance . Fortunately the attempt failed , and  | the honorable reputation of the great engineer increased with the years . After the Union Pacific was joined with the Central Pacific at Promontory , Dodge spent a good deal of his time in bringing the road up to standard . Durant was gone , and a large part of the internal strife that had marked the construction of the road vanished . Dodge played an important part in constructing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a work that finally completed the original Union Pacific . Although he resigned from the service of the road in 1870 , he served afterward on the company 's board of directors . In 1866 Dodge was elected a representative to Congress from the fifth Iowa district and served one term . He declined renomination , but afterward he was often in Washington in the interests of the Union Pacific and other roads . After completion of the Union Pacific , Dodge resigned to become chief engineer of the Texas Pacific in 1871 . That road failed in 1873 , whereupon Dodge became identified with the projects of jay Gould , for whom he worked ten years . Afterward he conducted the surveys that formed the basis for the extension of the Union Pacific to Portland and Puget Sound . Under Gould , Dodge became president of a number of southwestern railroads and was employed in the management of the large system of roads . He found time , however , to examine projects in association with Sir William Van Horne of the Canadian Pacific for railroads in Cuba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Increasing age finally compelled Dodge to retire from active participation in railroad affairs after 1912 . It was nearly sixty years since he carried his surveys across Iowa to Council Bluffs for the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad , and then had crossed the Missouri on a flatboat for the investigation westward that marked the beginning of the Union Pacific . In length of service and in magnitude of works , General Dodge must be classified as the foremost railroad engineer of his century . In recognition  | of his services to the profession of engineering , the American Society of Civil Engineers , on March 2 , 1915 , conferred upon him the degree of Honorary Member , the highest award the Society can bestow . The first chief engineer of the Union Pacific was a man of sterling character who enjoyed a long and honorable career . His connection with the railroad was brief and it terminated before much construction work had been done . However , as the predecessor of Grenville Dodge and as the man in direct charge of engineering at the beginning , his work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York , on July 27 , 1825 , and he died at the advanced age of eighty-six years . July 12 , 1911 . His ancestry was Dutch . His early life was spent in New York where after a two-year course at Geneva College , ending in 1840 , he studied law for two years and was admitted to practice . From there his inclination led him into railroad engineering , and for two years he worked for the New York and Erie Railroad , after which he was employed for two years oil the canals of New York , constructing locks . In 1850 he came into contact with Joseph E. Sheffield and Henry Farnam , the railroad builders , on the La Porte section of the Northern Indiana Railroad , and was with them when the Michigan Southern Railroad entered Chicago in March , 1852 . When the railroad builders were moving westward , Dey was made one of the principal assistant engineers under William Jarvis on the Chicago and Rock Island , in which capacity he hired young Grenville Dodge in 1852 . The surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platte Valley , and when the intermittent work on the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad was going forward , Dey was with that line as chief engineer of construction . It was while living in Iowa City that Dey married Catherine  | Thompson , on October 23 , 1856 . In 1860 he was elected mayor of the town . Three years later , in 1863 , Durant ordered Dey to make surveys for a railroad westward from Omaha to the Platte Valley , and also to make a reconnaissance up the Platte Valley across the Rocky and Wasatch mountains to Salt Lake City . Returning from the trip , Dey went to Washington and New York with the report . Ground for the Union Pacific was broken at the end of 1863 , and on January 3 , 1864 , Dey was appointed chief engineer of the railroad , a position he was to occupy for only a year . It was when construction out of Omaha was started on the line Dey had located that the controversy over the route took place , and this was also the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract , that was later turned over to the Credit Mobilier , was drawn up . Dey strenuously opposed the contract , with the result that he resigned rather than be a party to a form of proceeding that had hindered the construction of the M. and M. line . His resignation and protest to General Dix , president of the railroad , had no effect , and from that time on Dey had no connection with the railroad he had helped to start . However , he testified at the Credit Mobilier investigation in Washington in 1873 . Of Dey , General Dodge said : " Mr. Dey was made chief engineer of the M. and M. and took me to Iowa as assistant , and placed me in charge of the party in the field ? certainly a very fine promotion for the limited experience I had had ? and it is one of the greatest satisfactions and pleasures of my life to have had his friendship from the time I entered his service until now . Mr. Dey is not only a very distinguished citizen of Iowa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . He is known for his great ability , his uprightness , and the square deal lie gave every one , and he has greatly honored the state in the many public positions he has held . I look back upon my service with him with the greatest pleasure . My practical ex- perience under him and the confidence he placed in me were of incalculable benefit to me , and the example he set us has lasted me through my life , and I shall always honor , respect , and hold him in the highest consideration and friendship . " By perusing the biographies of the engineers who were connected with the Union Pacific , one can trace the history of American railroad construction all the way from the eastern states in the early part of the nineteenth century to the Far Vest when the line across the continent was completed in 1869 . Take , for example , the life story of Samuel Benedict Reed . Reed was born at Arlington , Vermont , November 18 , 1818 , and after a long life mostly taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Christmas Day , 1891 . In 1855 he married Jane Eliza Earl , a Pennsylvania girl , whose letters from her husband show that she was a good and faithful wife . Reed was educated at Middleport Academy and , like many another young engineer , worked on the Erie Canal in 1841 . In 1842 he went west to find employment on the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad . Then he moved to Joliet , Illinois , with his father , and later became locating engineer on the Michigan Central . It was there that he became friends with Sheffield , Farnam , John B. Jervis , and Peter A. Dey . Before the road was completed to Chicago , Reed was engaged on location for the Chicago and Rock Island from Joliet to Chicago . In 1859 he was in Iowa on the Burlington Railroad , and finally in 1864 he began work for the Union Pacific . Reed was sent to Salt Lake City by Peter A. Dey as chief engineer in charge of one of the three parties on the final surveys before definite location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the country had been made by a son of Brigham Young in the previous year . After extensive surveys , the work closed down for the winter , but by 1865 Reed  | was again in charge of the job in that region . He also conducted a reconnaissance of the Wasatch Mountains and surveys across the deserts south of Great Salt Lake to the Humboldt River . Active construction work on the railroad started in 1866 , whereupon Reed was taken from the surveys and made superintendent of construction . For the next three and a half years he was at the head of the construction forces and , largely in response to his efforts , the railroad was driven westward at a speed never before equaled . It was a time of trial , hard work and disappointments , due to the high-handed actions of Dr. Durant . At one time Reed wanted to resign , but Dodge supported him , as did other men in the East , with the result that Durant reappointed Reed to his former position . In the end Reed carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strobridge of the Central Pacific , he placed in position the polished laurel tie that held the last spike of gold . That Mr. Reed was a competent engineer was well recognized during his life time , nor was he forgotten after his death . When a celebration was held on October 10 , 1922 , at Joliet by the Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railway to commemorate its seventieth anniversary of service , a monument supplied by that road and the Union Pacific was dedicated to Samuel B. Reed . It was an eighteen-ton granite boulder from Echo Canyon and was placed in the courthouse yard , that being the spot where Reed began his surveys for the road seventy-two years before . A bronze tablet set in the boulder recites the facts of the first survey , together with the manifold services of the engineer . General Casement 's career is a good example of how an able man of character and determination could reach a position high among those who developed the country when the movement westward was in full tide . His parents came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was born at  | Geneva , New York , January 19 , 1829 . As a boy , he found a boy 's employment on a railroad . Later , when he was fourteen , the family moved to a farm near Ann Arbor , Michigan , near which he worked as a common laborer on the Michigan Central when he was sixteen . Although of slight stature , young Casement was noted for his strength and ability in railroad work . His father having died at an early age , the young man made a home for his mother and maintained it . At the age of twenty-one , in the spring of 1850 , Casement worked as a laborer on the Cleveland , Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad , later becoming foreman of a track-laying gang . From 1852 to 1853 he ran a freight train on the Cleveland , Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad , now a part of the New York Central System , and in the spring of 1853 he took his first contract for filling ravines crossed by trestles , as well as for laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married Frances Jennings and made his home at Painesville , Ohio . His next contract was for laying track and ballasting 00 miles on one road and 150 miles on another line . While he was engaged in this work , the Civil War broke out . Leaving the contracts in charge of his brother Dan , John Casement enlisted in the 7th Ohio Volunteer Infantry , where he was made a major . At the battle of Cross Lanes in West Virginia he performed such good service that he was made a colonel , and mustered the 103rd Ohio Volunteers , which regiment he commanded to the end of the war . For distinguished service at the battle of Franklin , Casement was breveted brigadier general by President Lincoln . At the close of the war he formed a partnership with his brother Daniel under the firm name of J. S. and D. T. Casement , whereupon they took the contract for laying the track of the Union Pacific , which contract was to include a large part of the grading . On completing that work the firm engaged extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indiana , Kentucky , Nebraska and West  | Virginia . In 1897 , at the age of sixty-eight , he contracted with the government of Costa Rica for railroad work that required six years for completion . He served a term as delegate to Congress from the territory of Wyoming and he also served a term in the Ohio State Senate . He died in his eightieth year . His work on the Union Pacific was done , in the language of General Dodge , by " the best-organized , best-equipped , and best-disciplined track force I have ever seen . " Of all the men connected with the building of the Union Pacific Railroad , Sidney Dillon had had more railroad experience than anyone else , not even excepting Thomas C. Durant . In 1887 he testified : " I saw the first locomotive run in the United States over the Albany and Schenectady Railroad , the little ' John Bull , ' and since that day I have done nothing much but build railroads and manage them . " It was estimated that he built from 2,500 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000,000 , sometimes alone , at other times with associates . Dillon was born on May 7 , 1812 , in Northampton , New York , where the family had resided for several generations , his grandfather having served with the American forces during the Revolution . He received such elementary education as the times afforded , but native ability explained his rise to the position of success that he attained in his long life of eighty years . He first served as errand boy on the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad , and later on the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad . Next , as overseer for contractors and later as foreman , he worked on railroads in Connecticut and Massachusetts . He then entered the contracting business on his own account . In this capacity he executed contracts for a predecessor of the Boston and Albany , for the Troy and Schenectady , the Cheshire Railroad of Vermont , the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad , the Rutland and Burlington in Vermont , the Central Railroad of New Jer- sey , the Philadelphia and Erie , the Erie and Cleveland , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans , and the Mobile and Chattanooga . He had a contract for widening the Morris Canal , and even when the Union Pacific was under construction he was associated with John I. Blair in contracting for Iowa railroads as well as executing contracts on the Boston , Hartford and Erie Railroad , the Connecticut Valley , the Chillicothe , Council Bluffs and Omaha , and the Canada Southern , together with additional work on the Morris and Essex line . One of his major contracts was the building of the tunnel for the Grand Central Station in New York , a job that cost 55,000,000 . Dillon first became interested in the Union Pacific project in 1865 , when he became a stockholder in the Credit Mobilier . His wide experience in railroad building led him to take an active part in the work , so that when Durant was ousted from control of the company Dillon was made president , a position that he filled until the road was finished . He was a member of the board that had charge of the Oakes Ames and the Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , formed the executive committee of the trustees . Dillon became a stockholder in the Union Pacific Railroad and at a meeting in New York October 3 , 1886 , was elected a director , in which capacity he served for nearly twenty-six years . He was president of the Union Pacific for two periods : March 11 , 1874 , to June 19 , 1884 ; and again , November 26 , 1890 , to April 23 , 1892 , for a total of nearly twelve years . For a long time he was a member of the executive committee of the Union Pacific , especially during the construction of the road , and after his retirement from the presidency he remained as chairman of the board of directors until his death . Wealth came to him from his many contracts , so that after 1870 his time was largely taken up with financial affairs . He was an associate with Jay Gould in the management of the properties controlled by Gould , and later was a director of the  | Western Union Telegraph , the Manhattan Elevated Railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railway , the Canada Southern Railway , the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad , the Pacific Mail Steamship Company , and other smaller organizations . Dillon was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers on March 20 , 1870 . As a typical representative of the Union Pacific men , Sidney Dillon 's useful career has been set forth at some length . He was active in the construction of the railroad and was present when the roads were joined at Promontory on that day in May , 1869 , receiving the silver spike that was driven after the golden spike . He was highly esteemed by his associates and on his death a resolution was adopted by the Union Pacific 's board of directors , from which the following is taken : " The part taken by Mr. Dillon in the construction of the Union Pacific Company 's lines and in the administration of its affairs , his steadfast devotion through evil and through good report , and his long and honorable service in its executive departments have more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been associated with him know with what pride he contemplated the growth and development of the enterprise , his confidence in its future , and his zeal for its further growth and expansion . His pride was almost paternal , his loyalty to it was strenuous and constant . " While Train was not directly connected with the building of the Union Pacific , he was a factor in its organization , and as such merits our attention . He was born in Boston May 24 , 1829 , and died in New York , January 19 , 1904 . The son of a Boston merchant , he was sent to Liverpool at the age of twentyone to take charge of that branch of his father 's business . He became a partner in 1853 , and in 1854 he was in Australia . In 1858 , on terminating the partnership , he became interested in  | English street railways and also was instrumental in floating bonds for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad . During the Civil War he made speeches in England in favor of the Northern side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of railroading , where he was active in the organization of the Union Pacific , having subscribed for twenty shares of the original list . He was commissioned by Durant to purchase the charter of the Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency , which he did , the name being changed later to the Credit Mobilier . He was also in the Credit Foncier , which was organized to deal in lands along the Union Pacific when towns were laid out by the railroad company and lots sold . One who saw him in 1866 describes him this way : " He organized and conducted a heavy commission business in Australia and astonished his neighbors in that era of fabulous prices , with Brussels carpets and marble counters and a free champagne luncheon daily in his business office . Afterward he made the circuit of the world , wrote books of travel , fought British prejudice against street railways , occupying his leisure by fiery and audacious American war speeches to our island cousins , until he spent a fortune , and enjoyed the delights of a month in a British prison . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he is trying to build a belt of cities across the continent . At least a magnificent project . Curiously combining keen sagacity with wild enthusiasm , a man who might have built the pyramids , or been confined in a straight jacket for eccentricities , according to the age he lived in , he observes dryly that since he began to make money , people no longer pronounce him crazy . " Train was at the breaking of ground at Omaha and helped in the Grand Pacific Excursion , making speeches and trying to please everyone . Such a man could not possibly get along with Durant . Superintendent Reed observed : " The political fight . . . was terminated so that all were disappointed . George Francis Train , as he says , ' was sacrificed by  | the railroad men and cursed long and loud . He gave us all notice that none that are now in good places will be there in thirty days from the time of his starting for New York , including T. C. Durant . One stage coach or steamboat could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. F. Train on their way east . George Francis goes from Nebraska disgusted with western politics , and I think with a large flea in his ear . " In 1868 Train was a candidate for the presidency . He made five trips around the world , wrote many books , was in the Paris Commune of 1871 , and was finally adjudged insane . His land speculations at Council Bluffs were largely a failure and he claimed title to land in Omaha worth $30,000,000 , but nothing ever came of it . The sketches of the careers of the most prominent men connected with the building of the Union Pacific , as given in the preceding pages , illustrate the type of men that carried the enterprise to completion . It remains to mention others who played a greater or lesser part in the work . Oliver Ames , the younger brother of Oakes Ames , was president pro tern of the railroad company during the absence of General Dix , and in March , 1868 , became president , a position he held until March , 1871 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors either of the railroad or of the Credit Mobilier were John B. Alley , Cornelius S. Bushnell , Rowland G. Hazard , John R. Duff , at one time vice president , Henry S. McComb , and Charles A. Lambard . John J. Cisco was treasurer for a time , and at another time E. H. Rollins was treasurer and secretary of the railroad . Henry V. Poor was secretary when the Union Pacific was organized , the same position being held in 1876 by Charles Tuttle . Operation of the railroad was under the direction of Webster Snyder , who was an active and efficient railroad man . Among the engineers were Colonel Silas Seymour , the consulting engineer , B. B. Brayton , F. M. Case , and Samuel B ,  | Reed . James A. Evans and J. E. House , along with Reed , were division engineers in charge of surveying parties . Chief of the survey parties , designated as assistant engineers , were Percy T. Brown and L. L. Hills , who were killed by Indians , Colonel J. O. Hudnut , M. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Blickensderfer , Jr. , John O'Neill , James R. Maxwell , Francis E. Appleton , and J. F. McCabe . Reed and Evans became superintendents of construction on completion of the surveys . The first geologist employed was James T. Lodge , who was followed by David Van Lennep.  | THE ELECTION of Abraham Lincoln as the sixteenth President of the United States , together with the commencement of the Civil War , brought the subject of a Pacific Railroad clearly before the public and before Congress . Durant 's group had already paid the cost of the surveys and had urged that the road be built , It had also been decided by Congress that the road , if built , should be constructed by a private corporation assisted by the government . Politicians of many degrees of ability had their favorite plans , . but it was not until March , 1860 , when Samuel L. Curtis , representative from Iowa , was named chairman of the Select Committee of Congress , to which all Pacific railroad bills were referred , that a proper law began to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the fore . as had a proposal for two roads , one on the central route , favored by a majority of the committee , and one on the 32nd parallel of latitude , the southern route .  | With the secession of the Confederate States the southern route was , of course , eliminated , but the Northern Pacific supporters still remained active . St. Louis was situated too close to the disputed territory , which fact allowed the Chicago interests to become the most active and influential . A special session of Congress was called , and it was at this session that Representative Curtis introduced his bill for the creation of the company to build the road . Again the Northern Pacific and the St. Louis interests presented their bills . Notwithstanding , the final bill creating the Union Pacific Railroad and recognizing the Central Pacific Railroad was at last passed in June , 1862 . The Senate vote on June 20 was twenty-five to five , and the House vote on June 24 was 104 to twenty-one . The long contest over the project was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 21 . It has often been said that both the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific influenced Congress unfairly in the proceedings that led to the passage of the Act . The fact is that both parties did use their influence with Congress , but the efforts of the Union Pacific were greater , since the Union Pacific Company was organized by the federal government , while the Central Pacific Company came under the laws of California . It was also supposed at that time that the Union Pacific would build westward to the border of California , there to meet the Central Pacific . The Act of 1862 bore marks of the politicians ' work . The Union Pacific Company was created , to be composed of 158 persons , whose names were duly listed . To this body were added five commissioners representing the national government . These 163 men were from twenty-five states , including California and Oregon . The group , which was called the Board of Commissioners of the Union Pacific Railroad and Telegraph Company , were to open books for subscription for stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent paid in , a meeting of the stockholders was to be called by the commissioners , at  | which meeting directors were to be elected . After the work of the commissioners had been done , the stockholders were to conduct the affairs of the company . The stockholders were to meet annually and make the usual by-laws , rules , and regulations to govern the company . There were to be thirteen directors selected by the stockholders , with the government appointing two directors who could not be stockholders . The directors were to appoint the officers of the company . The corporation was " authorized and empowered to lay out , locate , construct , furnish , maintain and enjoy a continuous railroad and telegraph , with appurtenances , from a point on the one hundredth meridian of longitude west from Greenwich , between the south margin of the Republican River , and the north margin of the valley of the Platte River on the territory of Nebraska to the western boundary of Nevada territory . " The point was to be selected by the President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road was to meet the Central Pacific Railroad of California . Rights of way 400 feet wide over public lands were granted the company , as were necessary grounds for stations , shops , and other buildings . The land grant consisted of public lands " to the amount of five alternate sections per mile on each side of said railroad , on the line thereof , and within the limits of ten miles on each side of said road not sold , reserved or otherwise disposed of by the United States . " All mineral lands were excepted from the grant , but the timber could be used . Patents to the land were to be issued when forty miles of railroad had been completed . The credit of the government took the form of subsidy bonds given to the company as a loan to be repaid in thirty years . The bonds were to bear 6 per cent interest , which could be " paid in United States Treasury notes , or any other money of currency which the United States have or shall declare lawful money and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000 denomination , and on completion of forty miles of road and its acceptance by  | the government commissioners , sixteen bonds per mile were to be given to the companies . The bonds were to be a first mortgage on the railroad and telegraph line , and in case of default in repayment by the company , the government could take possession of the property . It also provided , " that for three hundred miles of said road most mountainous and difficult of construction , to wit , one hundred and fifty miles westerly from the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains , and one hundred and fifty miles eastwardly from the western base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains , said points to be fixed by the President of the United States , the bonds to be issued to aid in the contruction thereof shall be treble the number per mile hereinbefore provided , and the same shall be issued , and the lands herein granted to set apart upon the construction of every twenty miles thereof , upon the certificate of the commissioners as aforesaid that twenty consecutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections last named of one hundred and fifty miles each , the bonds to be issued to aid in the construction thereof shall be double the number per mile first mentioned . " It was further provided that " no more than fifty thousand of said bonds be issued under this act . " Other railroads were authorized to share in the grants . The Leavenworth , Pawnee and Western Company of Kansas could construct some line and a connection with the Union Pacific on the 100th meridian . The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad and the Pacific Railroad Company of Missouri could unite with the Kansas company . The companies could even enter California if the Central Pacific failed to build to the state line . The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California , " after completing its road across said state is authorized to continue the construction of said railroad and telegraph through the territories of the United States to the Missouri River , including the branch roads specified in this act upon the routes hereinbeforc and hereinafter indicated on the terms and conditions provided in this act to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads shall meet and connect and the whole line of said railroad and branches and telegraph is completed . " The Act provided for the initial point to be located on the 100th meridian , which in the Platte Valley was about 247 miles west of the western border of Iowa . That point was near Fort Kearney . The Union Pacific was authorized to build to that point on the same terms , and three other roads were given the same privilege . The Union Pacific was obliged to build the line from Sioux City whenever some other line had been built westward across Iowa to that point . The Missouri branch was to be constructed by the Leavenworth , Pawnee and Western Railroad Company . This road afterward became the Union pacific Railway Company , Eastern Division . From St. Joseph the branch was to be an extension of the Hannibal and St. Joseph . There were numerous other provisions of the Act , a few of which may be mentioned . The road was to be completed and ready for use by July 1 , 1876 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The railroad companies could arrange with existing telegraph companies to have the telegraph lines placed along the railway . When net earnings exceeded 10 per cent the government could reduce rates . The companies must keep the lines in repair and transmit dispatches and transport mails , troops , and munitions of war , supplies and public stores , and the compensation for such services must not exceed that charged private parties . The companies must accept the terms of the Act by a given date . The several companies might consolidate after completing the roads . The track should be of a uniform width as fixed by the President , and the grades and curves should not exceed the maximum of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . Provision was made for the retention of 15 per cent of the bonds until the road was entirely completed . After the first act was passed , the President set the gauge of the road at five feet , but Congress decreed , on March 3 , 1863 , that the gauge should be four feet , eight and a half inches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention of the commissioners of the Union Pacific Railroad and Telegraph Company was held at Bryan Hall in Chicago on September 2 , 1862 . Seventy-three delegates from twenty states were present , which number included the five members appointed by the government . From California came three delegates , James T. Ryan , D. O. Mills , the banker , and John R. Robinson . From that state also came O. M. Wozencroft , appointed by the President . Apparently from that time on , however , no California men were interested in the Union Pacific . The convention organized by selecting Major General Samuel R. Curtis of Iowa as temporary chairman . The permanent officers of the company were William B. Ogden of Chicago , president ; Thomas W. Olcott of New York , treasurer ; and Henry V. Poor of New York , secretary . The convention passed resolutions having to do with the Civil War , approved the action of Congress in delegating the railroad construction to an incorporated company , passed several other minor resolutions , and arranged to open stock subscription books in thirty-four cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the convention adjourned , sine die . The officers of the company appointed by the convention did indeed open subscription books in thirty-five cities and advertised them in numerous newspapers . Two weeks were allowed for the books to be open , but it was not until September , 1863 , after a year had passed , that 2,000 shares had been subscribed and the necessary 10 per cent paid to the treasurer . There obviously was no wild rush to subscribe , since the total of subscribers numbered only 123 . Most of the subscriptions were for twenty shares , although there were eight for fifty shares . Brigham Young purchased five shares . On September 25 , 1863 , a call for a meeting of the stockholders was issued , and at the meeting held October 29 , thirty di- rectors were named , even though the law provided for only thirteen . The list included General Dix and Thomas C. Durant . The next day sixteen directors and the two government directors met to elect Major General John A. Dix as president , Thomas C. Durant as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry V. Poor as secretary . Because of the scattered residences of the directors , an executive committee of seven was authorized to conduct the affairs of the company . Work on the railroad was to be started as soon as the President of the United States selected an eastern terminus . Dr. Durant submitted a report on the work he had done in sending survey parties into the field ant on the instructions given them . The Union Pacific Railroad , after years of talk and over a year spent in organizing , was at last started . To show that the company meant business , arrangements were made for breaking ground for the new line at Omaha . The misinterpreted decision of President Lincoln was rendered on November 17 , and the ceremonies took place December 2 , 1863 . Hosts of people came and politicians talked . The Governor of Nebraska and the Mayor of Council Bluffs spoke , as did George Francis Train , together with Messrs . Monell , Larimer , and Poppleton . Omaha itself made a general holiday of the great occasion . Numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York congratulated Peter Dey , and from New York Durant sent a long telegram of explanation to the committee in charge of the arrangements . Brigham Young was terse in his telegram . The Mayor of Denver pledged the mountains of Colorado gold to the aid of the enterprise , although no one seemed to know how he was going to deliver it . Even Leland Stanford waxed poetic when he stated that " mountain and desert shall soon be overcome . " Such things were always said on occasions of that sort . The troubles were to come later . In the year 1864 , following the ground breaking and after some work of grading had been done , Durant decided to change  | the location of the road out of Omaha . In so doing , the line was lengthened nine miles and the railroad debt increased $450,000 . This action stirred up controversy that lasted until late in 1865 . In the meantime the Hoxie construction contract of October 3 , 1864 , was signed , and a course charted that was to be followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1862 had created - the Union Pacific Railroad Company , efforts to attract capital had failed , owing to a number of causes . The country was involved in the Civil War , which claimed the attention of most of the better men of the country . Then , too , the fact that the government subsidy bonds constituted a first mortgage on the road and since it was not known what the road would cost nor what the future would be , the possibility that the government would foreclose its mortgage and take the property was frightening to private capital . Other important factors were the characters of Durant and of that flamboyant individual , George Francis Train , the men who were in possession of the railroad company and were the active promoters of the project . Cautious men simply would not invest when operators of their type were in control . Something had to be done in order to interest capital in building the road . In California , the men in charge of the Central Pacific were having the same difficulties about money , although their character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such conditions that a bill was introduced in Congress to liberalize the existing law in order to rectify the conditions that held the project back . President Lincoln was in favor of a change , and powerful lobbies led by Durant of the Union Pacific and Huntington of the Central Pacific worked for passage of the bill . What arguments they used will never be known , but the result was the Act of 1864 , passed in June and signed by the President on July 2 , 1864 . The most important change from the Act of 1862 related to the status of the subsidy bonds and to the amount of the land grant . The rate of bonds per mile for constructing different sections Of the road was not  | changed , but the two railroad companies were now permitted to issue first-mortgage bonds of their own in an amount not to exceed the government bonds . In this way the government held not a first but a second mortgage on the road . Thus the greatest stumbling block in the way of financing the project was removed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also liberalized . Two thirds of the bonds could be issued when grading was completed , and the other third was to be available when the rails were laid and equipment was in place . The Act also provided that no bonds were to be retained by the government . The land grants in the new law were doubled in amount . They consisted of ten alternate sections on each side of the line to a distance of ten miles each way , with permission to issue patents for the lands whenever twenty miles of railroad had been built and accepted . These grants included lands with coal and iron . Under the Law of 1862 , whatever the railroads earned for transporting government troops and materials was to be retained and placed to the credit of the roads . The Law of 1864 required that one half the sum earned should be paid directly to the railroads . The time for completion of the road was extended one year , to July 1 , 1877 . The right to condemn private lands for right of way was granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of government directors was increased to five . In addition , three government commissioners were provided , whose duties were to make periodic examinations . The Central Pacific was limited to an extension into Nevada of 150 miles , in place of the former provision that the road could build eastward until it met the road building westward . It was not until July 3 , 1866 , that the former permission was restored , under which the Central Pacific built eastward until it met the Union Pacific at Promontory , Utah . As a final evidence of government good faith , it was " further enacted , that Congress may at any time , alter , amend or repeal this act . "  | Even though the Law of 1864 permitted a satisfactory form of financing , and though the Civil War ended early in 1865 , only forty miles of railroad were completed by the end of 1865 . It had been left to Durant and his friends to raise money , some of which was indeed obtained by those promoters . In order to secure to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of bonds , the first of the construction contracts was signed . The laws that today govern and provide for the limited liability corporation had not been passed in 1864 . However , the legislature of Pennsylvania had chartered the Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency with general powers , and it was this charter that Durant bought , changing its name to the Credit Mobilier . This name was the same as that of a French company formed for general financing and construction purposes . The capital stock was set at $2,000,000 , later raised to $2,500,000 , and again to $3,750,000 . It obviated the risk that individual partnerships had for the several partners , as the liability for the debts of the concern was limited by the number of shares held by any one individual . This was the company that financed the Union Pacific , acting as the actual contractor in one case and as the real contractor in the other two contracts . While Peter Dey was in charge of the first world at Omaha , the work was awarded to small contractors , but such procedure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore Durant made an arrangement with an employee of the company , a man of no financial standing , to contract for the first 100 miles of the road . This was Mr. Herbert M. Hoxie , who made an offer to build that much of the line for the uniform amount of $50,000 per mile . On September 23 , 1864 , the offer was accepted by the railroad company . The contracts required that Hoxie build and equip the 100 miles of line and side tracks . There were several other clauses covering the burnetizing of ties ; the cost of any one bridge was limited to  | $85,000 ; and equipment of buildings , tanks , etc. , was not to exceed a cost of $5,000 per mile . If railroad iron cost over $130 per ton , the excess was to be paid by the company . Hoxie agreed to take the company 's first-mortgage bonds at 80 per cent of their par value and land grant bonds at 70 per cent of par and to subscribe for $500,000 of Union Pacific stock . On October 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 247 miles , which was the distance of the 100th meridian , the initial point of the railroad indicated in the law . The subscription for company stock was increased to $1,000,000 . Hoxie then agreed to assign the contract to five men : four directors of the railroad , T. C. Durant , Cornelius Bushnell , C. A. Lam bard , and H. S. McComb , and a fifth , H. S. Gray , a stockholder . The five men thus became the contractor . The provision of the law that full price should be paid for the railroad company stock was evaded by the contractor giving a check in full amount for the stock subscribed , which check was then handed back as payment on the contract without going through a bank . It was another illustration of a well-known fact that no law can be passed that is not easy to evade , provided all parties to a transaction desire to do so . The five men formed a partnership and together subscribed $1,600,000 , which was used to build the road . Twenty-five per cent was paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great . Hoxie and the other then assigned everything to the Credit Mobilier , with the $1,600,000 being applied to the purchase of Credit Mobilier stock . The Credit Mobilier thus became the actual contractor for building the railroad . It was because of the high prices paid for the construction that Dey resigned as chief engineer and notified General Dix that the road was being overcapitalized . General Dix , however , did nothing about it . The arrangement with the Credit Mobilier provided sufficient funds for the building of the 247 miles west of Omaha , including the excess length of nine miles added by the change  | at that city . On October 5 , 1866 , the contract was completed . It had taken nearly three years from the date of the groundbreaking ceremonies at Omaha to build 247 miles on the easiest part of the route of the railroad , namely along the Platte River from Elkhorn to a point near Fort Kearney . It was quite clear , therefore , that this first group of men headed by Durant could not finance the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Ames brothers , Oakes and Oliver . It was these men who brought to the project large wealth of their own and who were also able to bring in other investors of equal financial standing who would provide the funds . They knew of the Credit Mobilier and what it was doing in 1865 , for they were then stockholders . With them were friends and business associates , notably Alley , Hazard , and Dillon , whose names thereafter appeared in the proceedings of both companies . Oliver Ames was elected a director of the Union Pacific in October , 1866 , and became president in November of that year when General Dix was appointed Minister to France . Although a stockholder in the Credit Mobilier , he was never an officer of the company . Oakes Ames became connected with the Credit Mobilier in August , 1865 , and was also a stockholder in Union Pacific and a director , although he , too , was never an officer of the company . He was , as has been , mentioned , a member of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1864 when the Act of that year was passed . Practically all the stockholders of the Union Pacific , together with all the officers , were stockholders in the Credit Mobilier . For the most part , the personnel of the two companies was the same . By the time the Hoxie contract was completed in October , 1866 , the friction between Durant and Oakes Ames had developed to the point where it became necessary to oust Durant from his position in the Credit Mobilier . A similar effort to eliminate him from the Union Pacific failed , and Durant remained as vice president and general manager until the road  | was completed in 1869 . Oliver Ames , in his testimony before the Wilson Committee in 1873 , said , regarding the $435,000 that had been disbursed by Durant in 1864 : " We examined every hill that is there , in the details to the full amount of $435,000 . The charge was that Dr. Durant , instead of spending this money as he alleged he had spent it , for the purpose of getting a charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in his own pocket . " Durant 's opinion of the others was expressed in his testimony before the Poland Committee , in which he said : " As I have stated , Mr. Ames , Mr. Alley , and their friends were not original stockholders in the company . They came into it by virtue of their character as contractors and their interests in the Credit Mobilier , and did not come into the direction until after several hundred miles of road had been completed , and nearly five hundred miles had been completed at the time of the execution and assignment of the Oakes Ames contract . The claim of patriotism and of far-seeing , intelligent , and honest policy put forward in their behalf , is ridiculous . " All parties were in agreement that the work should proceed . Durant , in his capacity as vice president , and acting under the authority conferred by a resolution of the executive committee of the railroad , let a contract to L. B. Boomer of Chicago for 150 miles of road west of the 100th meridian , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the directors , but the work proceeded . Then the directors of the railroad passed a resolution extending the Hoxie contract fiftyeight miles , to a point where the Boomer contract had built the road . When Durant heard of this he protested and obtained a court injunction that caused the directors to rescind their action . Then the directors arranged a contract on March 24 , 1867 , with John M. S. Williams , a stockholder , to build 268 miles west of the initial point , the contract to include the part already constructed . The contract was assigned to the Credit Mobilier , but Durant stopped that with another injunction . In  | June the directors made yet another effort to sign a contract with Williams , but this , too , was stopped by Durant . Durant assumed great credit for himself in thus preventing contracts at high prices on a stretch of road easy to build and parts of which were already constructed . His efforts would appear more altruistic had he not himself later become a party to the Ames contract that covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Durant , having been ousted from the Credit Mobilier , was taking his revenge . It was finally recognized that both parties were necessary to each other . Oakes Ames concluded a contract with the railroad company by which he agreed to construct 667 miles of road , extending from the 100th meridian westward , for the following amounts and in this sequence : Of this length of road , 138 miles were already completed and had been accepted by the government . The engineering expenses were borne by the railroad company . The contract covered the line across the Black Hills and through Wyoming Basin about as far west as the present town of Evanston . Afterward there was considerable talk about the contract being a wild venture , which quite possibly it was , since the route had not been selected across the Black Hills and the cost of course was unknown . The Ames contract was ratified by the railroad directors on October 1 , 1867 . It is to be remembered that in 1865 General Dodge had discovered what he believed to be the favorable approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tree Creek . As soon as he  | became chief engineer in 1866 , he ordered surveys to be made at that place and in his report dated at Omaha , November 15 , 1866 , he said : " The Lodge Pole Creek main line . . . has the best alignment , costs less per mile , has the best grades and less bridging ; and when considered with branch to Denver , enters the best coal fields , and has less road to run and build than any of the other lines . " Considering the lines in a purely engineering point of view , I do not hesitate to give the opinion that the Lodge Pole Creek approach to the base of the mountains is superior to all others and should be adopted . " Maps and profiles , with grades , distances , and other information , were filed with the report . In forwarding the report to the board of directors , Durant said : " It will be found to contain all the information necessary to enable them to determine upon a location as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On November 23 , 1866 , the " Committee on Location and Construction , " to whom the report of General Dodge was referred , " unanimously recommend the adoption of the Lodge Pole Creek line crossing the mountains on the Lone Tree and Crow Creek divide line . " The matter was settled and the road was built on that line . It can hardly be maintained that Oakes Ames was ignorant of the character of the mountain crossing and of the decision as to the location when , ten months after the Dodge report , he entered into the contract to build the line over the mountains . The most inexcusible part of the Ames contract was that it included a section of the road 138 miles long that had already been constructed . When the Hoxie contract was completed to the 100th meridian , construction went on haphazardly while the factions in New York and Boston quarreled . The cost of the 132 miles in the Platte Valley was $27,000 per mile but it was taken into the Ames contract at $42,000 per mile , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No valid excuse for this procedure was ever made other than that  | Oakes Ames , in making his proposal , based it on average costs over the 667 miles covered by the contract . This argument will not hold water , for there is no proof that his costs per mile took this into consideration . The company ultimately paid the Credit Mobilier $1,104,000 on this account . When the Ames contract was settled in 1867 , the opposition of Durant had ceased . The contract contained most , if not all , of the objectionable features that he had protested in the earlier contracts proposed by Ames . Arrangements had obviously been made and a compromise effected . Oakes Ames did not perform the contract himself . Within two weeks the contract was assigned to the following seven trustees , who carried it out : Oliver Ames , Sidney Dillon , Cornelius Bushnell , John B. Alley , Henry S. McComb , Benjamin E. Bates , and last , but not least , Thomas C. Durant . In this manner Durant appeared as one of the contractors . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trustees provided that the contract was to be administered for the benefit of the stockholders of the Credit Mobilier . Durant had insisted that the written consent of all Union Pacific stockholders should be obtained first , which was done . After this struggle between the factions , the work of construction proceeded rapidly . When the Ames contract was completed , another was made with James W. Davis , who assigned it to the same trustees and the road was completed to the junction with the Central Pacific . While the conflict between the two groups was going on , the " Fisk raid " of 1867-1868 took place . It has since been stated that Fisk , who had become notorious in his dealing with the Erie Railroad , tried to blackmail the Union Pacific in an endeavor to have the Credit Mobilier thrown into receivership , all of which would have delayed construction work . Working with the Tweed Ring in New York and with corrupt judges , Fisk made an attempt to secure the papers of the Union Pacific Company . This was prevented by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress , the office of the company was removed to Boston . There was some intimation that Durant was assisting risk , but those charges , like many others that were made then and afterward , were never proved . As a part of construction of the railroad , interest attaches to the financing of the road , because in the end , without money and the anticipation of profit , the road would not have been built . The data of costs and financing , such as they are , are largely found in the reports of the Wilson Committee of Congress in the investigations of 1872 and 1873 . Testimony was given by Henry C. Crane , an officer and assistant treasurer of the Credit Mobilier ; by Benjamin F. Ham , a director , assistant secretary , and treasurer of the same company , as well as at times auditor of the Union Pacific ; and by E. H. Rollins , treasurer of the Union Pacific after May , 1869 . The total cost of the road , as computed by Mr. Ham was as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road had cost to the end of 1872 . Up to the end of 1870 , the reported cost was $108,722,134.35 . As work went  | on after the rails were joined in 1869 , the difference is explained . The sum given is merely the bookkeeper 's summation , which does not represent actual cost . In the sum is included 367,623 shares of comon stock at its face value of $100 per share , or $36,762,300 . The sixteen miscellaneous items mentioned in the table are made up of station buildings , shops and tools , snow sheds , roadway and track , bridging , fencing , telegraph , express outfit , the expenses of government commissioners , legal expense , revenue stamps , preliminary expense , and amounts paid to the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad . Of the total sum , the three contracts amounted to $93,546,287.28 , with expenditures or commitments of the railroad company direct of $20,487,441.24 . In both these categories , stock appears at its face value of $100 per share . Money for construction of the road , whether by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment for their work , was raised principally by the sale of bonds . The record of bond sales is as follows : It will be noted that the money realized from the sale of the government subsidy bonds amounted to slightly less than 43 per cent of the total . The statements of the Wilson Committee and of others since that the government furnished practically all of the money for building the road are largely without foundation . In addition , money from other sources was made available by the company . It can easily be seen that the bonded debt was a heavy burden on the company for many years , especially so when the  | following statement of the interest is added to the above table . The government paid the interest on its bonds until maturity , which relief was of great assistance during the years while the road was beginning to function . Even so , the accumulation of interest into one sum due in thirty years was one of the reasons for the company 's final insolvency . The interest on the three types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest on the total bonds was about 7 per cent , the actual rate of interest on the cash received from the sale of the bonds was 9 per cent . It was evident that the first-mortgage bonds , even with the government bonds placed second to them , were sold only at a considerable discount , about 12.8 per cent , and that the actual interest on the money received was 7 per cent . When it came to issuing land grant and then income bonds in the desperate struggle to obtain cash , great discounts were absolutely necessary and high rates of interest were paid to obtain money , reaching 12 per cent and 14.7 per cent , as shown in the table . The interest rates are mute evidence of the struggle of the railroad builders to complete the project . In addition to selling bonds , both the railroad companies and the Credit Mobilier sold the common stock of the railroad . No statement , however , is now available as to the amount or the receipts . In general , the stock was held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others sold their holdings in the years immediately following the joining of the rails in 1869 . Calculations as to the value of the stock have since been made on a basis of thirty cents on the dollar , but the price in the  | market varied . Again , the market value of a stock is not necessarily a criterion of its actual value . Only the earnings of the railroad in later years provided a basis of value and such a gauge of value was not available when the road was built . As soon as the railroad was opened for any distance , the completed sections were placed under the operating department , where they began to earn money , notwithstanding the fact that operating trains interfered with the construction trains passing westward to the end of track . By the second of January , 1867 , the government had accepted 305 miles of the completed road , which was operated by the company after April of that year . Statistics of operating receipts and expenses are given as follows : Thus , during the three active years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and three quartets million dollars that could be applied to construction purposes , and the first year of through line operation , 1870 , the profits justified the faith of the builders that the road would be a paying investment . In Table 1 , above , the total cost to the company , including the stock then issued at par value , was $114,033,728.52 . Included in this sum were the discounts on the several types of bonds , referred to by Mr. Ham as losses , of $10,740,747.91 . While this . amount would have to be amortized in future years , it was not a part of the construction cost . Deducting that sum leaves $103,292,980.61 , which may be considered as the sum directly  | contributed by the railroad company . However , as stated before , there is included in the sum noted the stock amounting to $36,762,300. estimated at its face value of $100 per share . The stock realized but a small fraction of this amount when sold . From here on , the estimates were made in 1873 on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock represented a real money value of $11,028,690 . This represents a reduction from the cost named above $25,733,610.00 , leaving the construction cost to the company of $77,559,370.61 . In their testimony before the Wilson Committee , Mr. Ham and Mr. Crane presented statements of the recorded cost of the three contracts , which are embodied in the following table , together with the face value of the contracts : It is again necessary to call attention to the fact that these are bookkeeper 's figures that include stock at its par value and also bonds . Various individuals have tried to determine the actual amount of profit to the contractors , but the data are so meager and lacking in essential parts that only general statements may be made . In estimating payments by the railroad company to the Ames and Davis trustees , Mr. Ham stated that the trustees subscribed for first-mortgage bonds at 85 per cent of the face value , the land grant bonds at 55 per cent and the income bonds at 60 per  | cent of the face value . As payment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the total stock issued being about $30,000,000 , which at thirty cents on the dollar would alone reduce the profit $21,000,000 , or from $42,825,328.34 to some $22,000,000 . Mr. Ham stated that these securities were sold by the trustees at less than the prices paid for them . They sold one $1,000 first-mortgage bond , one similar land grant bond , and fifty shares of stock for $2,000 . This , at the purchase price of the bonds as noted , would make the stock worth $12 a share . They sold one income bond and twenty shares of stock for $800 . At the stated price of $600 for the bond , the stock was rated at $10 per share . Mr. Ham also presented his calculated cost of the road , revised to include only the contractors ' cost instead of the contract prices given in Table 1 , as $71,208,399.18 . He also stated that , taking account of the prices that were received by the contractors in disposing of their securities , the profit on the two contracts was not more than $9,000,000 . Adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not examined , the total profit to the contractors was somewhat over $14,000,000 . Estimates that vary widely were prepared by others who examined the same figures , and may be mentioned briefly . Mr. Rowland Hazard , one of the executive committee of the seven trustees , in a paper , " The Credit Mobilier of America , " stated in 1882 : " On ( the ) basis of ( fifty cents on the dollar in 1881 for the Central Pacific stock ) the total profit received by the stockholders of the Credit Mobilier was about $15,000,000 and an expenditure of about $70,000,000 , or at a little over 20 per cent . This is a high estimate , and is probably more than realized by a great majority of the stockholders . . . . On ( the ) basis of ( the value of the stock as estimated at the time ) the total profit would be about $6,000,000 , or less than nine per cent on the expenditure . " Mr. Hazard apparently considered the contractors ' cost to have been over $70,000,000 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $19,548,455.80 , reached the conclusion that the profit was $23,366,319.81 on an expenditure of $50,720,958.94 . These calculations were based on the cash value of bonds and on the stock at thirty cents on the dollar . The committee reached the conclusion that the cost was $50,720,958.94 , the two totals being substantially equal , and that the contractors made a real profit of $23,000,000 on the work . There are several items for which general vouchers only existed as one payment to C. S. Bushnell for $126,000 and one to Thomas C. Durant for $435,754.21 , which were unexplained . calculation esti- mated at thirty cents on the dollar of face value , amounted to $8,744,169.81 or about 33 per cent of the total assumed profit . Had the railroad proved a failure in its earning capacity , the value of the stock would have been far less , and might even have been rendered completely worthless by foreclosure . In such a case , the profits of the contractors would have shrunk to about $15,000,000 . This was just one of the risks that the contractors shouldered when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their payment in stock . As it turned out , the contrary proved to be the case , but there is no question that it could have been otherwise . The Wilson Committee felt that the railroad builders had misused their trust and had gained enormous profits out of the contracts made with themselves . The railroad men had no such view . They took the stand that the railroad incorporators and the construction company were really one and the same organization , managed by the same individuals . It is no one 's affair how much profit they made as long as the security behind the government bond issue was not impaired . At that time the interest of the general public in the capitalization and profits of railroads was not recognized . The railroad belonged to those who built it , and if they repaid borrowed money that was all that was asked of them . A suit instigated by the Wilson Cornmitte to recover undue profits was lost in the Supreme Court . It remains to examine the statement of what the profits were . The Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the treasurer of the Credit Mobilier . Others differed with him . Oakes Ames stated that the cost of the contracts was $60,000,000 , and that on his contract the profit was about 15 per cent . General Dodge believed that the cost as given by Mr. Ames was correct . Where the Wilson Committee erred was in omitting the money obtained from bonds based on land grants and upon earnings . From the $10,400,000 land grant bonds there was obtained $6,063,992.04 , and from the $9,355,000 income bonds there was obtained $6,536,600 , ' a total from these  | two classes of bonds of $12,600,592.04 , which , added to the $50,863,172.05 obtained from the sale of first-mortgage and government bonds , makes a total of $63,463,764.09 . The records of the railroad show that the company expended directly $9,746,683.33 , which , added to the contract costs to the contractors , makes a total of $60,467,641.27 . The two sums are in fair agreement , the total expenditures being less than the sum obtained from bonds of $2,993,122.82 . It will be recognized that there are various viewpoints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That of the Wilson Committee has been stated . Henry Kirke White estimates the total profit was " $16,710,432.82 , or slightly above 271/2 per cent of the cost of the road . . . which does not seem an immoderate profit . " ' Mr. J. B. Crawford , using the data , finds that the cash value of the net profits was $8,141,903.70 after deducting from a total the loss of the Credit Mobilier capital of $3,750,000 ? a total loss . He gives the expenditure as $70,000,000 , the profits being about 12 ? per cent.2 Mr. Nelson Trottman , at a later date , using the same basic data , reaches the conclusion that the actual cost of the railroad from all sources was $60,467,641 , and subtracting this amount from the total capitalization of $110,996,812 , obtains what he terms " fictitious capital " of $50,529,171 . Repeating the statements of the Wilson Committee , he finds the total securities issued in excess of cost as $47,304,513.11 . The capital stock is entered at its face value of $100 per share and the land grant bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty cents on the dollar on the stock and the discounted cash realized on the bonds is entered in the table , the contractors ' profits amounted to $17,234,895 . Mr. Trottman , agreeing with the Wilson Committee , finds the cash profit to have been approximately $23,366,514.81.  | Mr. John P. Davis , also using the figures given in the Wilson report and after deducting the capital of the Credit Mobilier , estimates the contractors ' profit as $25,771,213.11 . ' He criticizes Mr. Crawford and Mr. Hazard for basing the profits on a percentage of the money spent , and seems to imply that the profits should be a reasonable percentage of the capital of the contracting company , or $3,750,000 . This contention is made because the contractor was reimbursed as each section of road completed was paid for . It would have been more helpful to Mr. Davis and the others had they been better acquainted with contracting and contractors . This writer has had contact with such men and their work for half a century . Contractors do not base their proposals on the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate the cost to them of doing the work on a project and add to that sum their anticipated profit as a percentage of the total estimated cost . The contract is taken and the work performed on that basis . For capital , the average contractor depends upon borrowing whatever he requires above his own resources , from a bank or from other sources of funds . Whenever a project is of such a size that it is beyond the financial resources of one contracting company , several combine to do the work with their united resources . Much of the large work in the West in recent years has been done in this manner . The Hoover Dam , for which a contract of approximately $165,000,000 was awarded , is an example . Here , six contracting firms came together to do the work , with money being borrowed from banks to finance the contract . On the other hand , no work of magnitude is done without the owner making payments as it progresses . The financial costs are thus very much reduced , since it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital in any amount , as in the example cited , and rely only upon one payment on completion of the work . In the  | end the owner would pay the cost of this capital , while presumably he would have resources of his own at hand . The return on capital is fundamental to modern industrial life . Men must make a profit on their ventures , or all industry would stop . What is designated as " costs " in all these discussions refers to direct costs of labor and materials . Contractors ' profits are also costs , as legitimate as the wages of the most humble laborer on the work . The contractors ' profits , however they may be estimated and whatever they were , are part of the cost of building the railroad . Money does not , of itself , get out and build a railroad . It takes the intense effort of many men ? in the present instance , of the Ames brothers and their associates in the East ; of Durant , Dodge , Reed , Evans , Casement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions and through long years to bring the enterprise to a successful conclusion . The commentators , casting and recasting the figures of the Wilson Committee Report , fail to appreciate this phase of the subject . Another element enters into the contractors ' profit , and that is the time consumed in doing the work . When the contract extends over a period of years , say four or five , the contractor must assume the risk of rising prices of labor and material . Such a rise may consume his entire profits or , in case of a decline in prices , may augment his profits . A proper contract would take account of such changes , since in the end the owner pays for them . In the case of the building of the Union Pacific Railroad , the contracting company assumed a number of risks . It had to depend upon selling the securities of the railroad , which it took as payment for work done . The construction period extended over five years and almost anything could happen to the security market in that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment , was dependent upon the future of the railroad and on the traffic that it would develop . It was quite possible that the stock of the railroad would be valueless . Many  | railroads , built into the fertile portions of the Mississippi Valley , had become insolvent and the stockholders had lost all of their money . Here was a railroad project into an uninhabited region , much of which was and remains a complete desert . No one could forecast the possible business for such a road . Of the $23,000,000 estimated profits on the contract , as determined by the Wilson Committee , close to $9,000,000 was based upon a valuation of the stock at thirty cents on the dollar . That valuation may have been a reasonable estimate in 1873 . In 1867 , when Oakes Ames assumed the burden of his contract , the value of the stock was on the knees of the gods . In this case , as in others , it is easy to be wise and critical after the event . In the history of contracting , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Oakes Ames . During the construction period and afterwards , the five government directors served with ability , although it does not appear that they were ever an important factor in the progress of the work or in solving the many problems that were presented . The law also provided for three government commissioners whose duty it was to make periodical examinations of the road and to report on its condition . These men gave attention to their work , and the fact that one commissioner was an extortionist should not obscure the work of the other two men . This one commissioner refused to accept a section of the completed road until his demands for $25,000 had been complied with . There may have been other attempts at blackmail of this type , but if so they are not on record . In commenting on the work of the commissioners , mention should be made of the good work done by J. L. Williams , a civil enginer of Fort Wayne , Indiana , whose reports bear evidence of careful study by a man competent to understand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also served as government director of the road .  | After the joining of the tracks at Promontory , a special fiveman commission of Congress , appointed by resolution on April 10 , 1869 , reviewed the entire railroad and in its report , dated October 30 , 1869 , gave general approval of the work . It also brought in an itemized statement of work remaining to be done and estimated that the cost would be $1,586,100 . The list of requirements dealt largely with temporary work on bridges and culverts , filling of trestles , and changes to reduce grades . The government directors and commissioners , with varying personnel , continued to function in the years that followed the completion of the original line . Their reports are of interest as showing the work of extending the railroad system and the gradual improvement of the line , and as a discussion of the financial relations with the government . They are not properly a part of this history . The first section of forty miles was accepted January 24 , 1866 , and on the 27th , government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . In all , forty sections were approved from time to time , the last issue of bonds being dated July 4 , 1870 . A total of $27,236,512 face value government bonds were issued to the company . An important item in the financing of the railroad was the land grant , upon which bonds were issued and sold by the railroad company . Up to May 26 , 1886 , the statistics of the land grant were as follows :  | The selection of lands was a phrase used to designate lands for which sales had been made , such lands being patented only when sold . In this manner the company avoided taxation on the lands by the states , which point was made the subject of lawsuits that were carried to the Supreme Court of the United States , the Court deciding that unpatented lands were not subject to taxation , as they were legally still in the possession of the government . The character of the lands varied widely . From the compilation , it may be seen that by far the largest acreage sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government directors for 1883 it was stated that 8,877,893 acres remained unsold : These lands were classified as : agricultral , 1,000,000 acres ; grazing , 7,477,893 acres ; and coal , 400,000 acres . A different estimate made by the company listed : The agricultural lands were in Nebraska . The arid plains of Utah and western Wyoming were covered with sagebrush or desert sand . The grazing lands were located in central and eastern Wyoming , northern Colorado , and western Nebraska . At the present time there remain unsold 905,250 acres of the original grant . A final determination of the land grant showed an area of 11,401,296 acres , of which 11,401,176 acres were patented , a difference of only 120 acres .  | The land grant was of value to the railroad company beyond the amounts obtained from direct sales . The lands were used as a basis of a bond issue during the construction of the railroad in order to obtain funds . In all , $10,400,000 worth of land grant bonds were sold at a large discount , the amount of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sixty cents on the dollar . In his report to the stockholders for 1880 , President Dillon stated that " there has been cancelled of these bonds $4,329,000 . The land contracts , cash on hand , accrued and accruing interest , amount to a sufficient sum to retire all of the land grant bonds . " For a number of years the question of a bridge over the Missouri River between Omaha and Council Bluffs was in dispute . The Union Pacific Railroad Company did not want to build the bridge , as it would cost a considerable sum and would add little or no revenue from traffic . It was obvious that the railroads centering in Council Bluffs would not build the bridge for the same reasons . Finally , in 1871 , the Union Pacific built the bridge but refused to run its main line trains across the structure . A shuttle train was operated across the bridge , with all passengers being forced to change trains at Omaha and again at Council Bluffs , where tolls were charged for the crossing . The company claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the western boundary of Iowa , east of and opposite to the east line of section 10 , in township 15 , of range 13 , east of the principal meridian in the Territory of Nebraska , " really meant on the western bank of the river . They claimed that the Iowa border was the western bank of the stream and the maps of that time show a point on the shore labeled " The Initial Point . " The subject eventually reached the courts , with the United States Supreme Court ruling that the Union Pacific should operate its trains across the bridge , evidently relying upon the well- established principle that the center of a stream is the boundary line between two jurisdictions . Undoubtedly General Dodge , when he advised President Lincoln to fix the initial point in Iowa , intended that the terminus of the road should be at his home , Council Bluffs . The river has shifted its course since those days of the builders , with the result that the initial point , as claimed by the railroad , is probably now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge , bonds in the face amount of $2,500,000 were issued and sold at a discount , which provided about $1,750,000 in funds to meet the cost .  | THE PROBLEMS encountered by the engineers in locating the Union Pacific Railroad were , in general , the same kind of problems as those faced by the engineers of the Central Pacific . There was , however , considerable difference in detail . Once the terminal point on the Missouri River had been fixed near Council Bluffs by President Lincoln , the general route of the road was west toward central California . The east and west valley of the Platte River fixed the route for some 500 miles westward from Omaha . The Rocky Mountains were then encountered where the Wyoming Basin offered the best location for that part of the line . Then the basin of Great Salt Lake had to be reached , and from there on the obvious route was by way of the Humboldt River to the border of California . There were thus a number of possible solutions to be investigated before the best location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reached , should the route follow the  | Emigrant Trail up the North Fork and thence by the Sweetwater River , through South Pass to Green River ; or should the route take the South Fork of the Platte and by way of Lodgepole Creek or the Cache la Poudre branches , reach the divide of the Black Hills ( Laramie Mountains ) and there cross the Wyoming Basin to Green River ? From Green River , several routes were possible across or around the Wasatch Mountains to the plains of Great Salt Lake . Should the route pass north or south of Great Salt Lake , and what line should be followed to the Humboldt ? Once that stream was reached , there were no uncertainties as to where the railroad should be built . To solve these problems many surveys were required , just as the desires of several localities , such as Denver and Salt Lake City , had to be considered . In commenting upon the location of the Union Pacific Railroad , General Dodge said : " It is a singular fact that in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible line in an engineering and commercial point of view , the line with the least obstacles to overcome , of lowest grades and least curvature , was never explored and reported on . Private enterprise explored and developed that line along the forty-second parallel of latitude . " This route was made by the buffalo , next used by , the Indians , then by the fur traders , next by the Mormons , and then by the overland immigration to California and Oregon . It was known as the Great Platte Valley Route . On this trail , or close to it , was built the Union and Central Pacific Railroads to California , and the Oregon Short Line branch of the Union Pacific to Oregon . " The statement is essentially correct , as there were no government surveys for a railroad from Council Bluffs to Fort Bridger , a distance of 942 miles . However , surveys had been made by the government engineers westward from Fort Bridger via Salt Lake City to and along the Humboldt River as far west as Winnemucca . The Weber River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been selected as one of two possible crossings of the Wasatch Mountains , and the route along the Humboldt had been explored . The route along the Platte River needed no surveys , while the line across the Wyoming Basin had been explored but not surveyed by Captain Howard Stansbury , and to some extent by Fremont . In the summary of the several routes as surveyed by the government in 1853 and 1854 , Captain A. A. Humphreys stated : " The eastern terminus of the route may be either Council Bluffs or Fort Leavenworth . It ascends the Platte and passes through the eastern chain of the Rocky Mountains ( the Black Hills ) , either by the North Fork and its tributary , the Sweet Water , or the South Fork and a tributary called Lodge Pole Creek . By the former it enters upon a great elevated tableland in which the headwaters of the Platte and the Colorado of the West are found , by the South Pass , the ascent having been gradual from the first mountain gorge in the Black Hills , 30 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , a distance of nearly 300 miles , bounded generally on either side by mountains . . . . By the second route , the same difference of elevation is overcome by the Cheyenne Pass , probably in about the distance usual in the Rocky Mountain passes , the route thus entering the Laramie plains , which may be considered to form the eastern part of the Great Plateau first mentioned . " In a later paragraph he adds : " The route along the South Fork of the Platte and Lodge Pole Creek , by the Cheyenne Pass and Bridger 's Pass , is not so well known as the other . Lodge Pole Creek has never been continuously explored , and there is no profile of this route . " With regard to the Cheyenne Pass , Captain Stansbury says his " examinations fully demonstrate the existence of a route through the Black Hills , not only practicable , but free frorn any obstructions involving in their removal great or unusual expenditure . " He gives no estimated grades , and had no barometer or other instruments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Bridger , " Stansbury continues , " the country can be crossed in many places , the choice being determined by considerations of fuel and water . " As has been stated before , the route indicated by Captain Stansbury from his exploration in 1850 was substantially that upon which the railroad was built from the head of Lodgepole Creek across the Black Hills and the Wyoming Basin to Green River . The surveys westward from Green River made by Lieutenant E. G. Beckwith , indicated the possibility of using the Weber River as a passage through the Wasatch Mountains to the plain of Great Salt Lake . It can be seen from these abstracts that the general route of the railroad from Council Bluffs to Salt Lake Valley had been outlined before the surveys of the railroad company started . In June , 1856 , Lieutenant F. T. Bryan , of the Topographical Engineers , accompanied by three topographers , a geologist , and thirty men , escorted by a company of infantry , traveled up the Kansas River and passed over to the Platte at Fort Kearney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region was explored , the Black Hills were crossed at the head of Lodgepole Creek , and the Wyoming Basin explored as far west as Briclger Pass , the party going south of Medicine Bow Butte . Returning , they passed north of that mountain , and from the Laramie Plains crossed probably by Antelope Pass , to the Cache la Poudre , and by that stream to the south fork of the Platte . A detachment explored the region from Howard Creek to Crow Creek . The Republican River was explored on the return trip . The party had been close to the future line of the Union Pacific along several hundred miles of the trip . The selection of the general route for the railroad was comparatively simple , because the way was an open one , over a route that had been known for many years . In referring to this subject , General Dodge said : " There never was any very great question , from an engineering point of view , where the line crossing Iowa and going west  | from the Missouri River , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any engineer who failed to take advantage of the great open road out of the Platte Valley , and then on to Salt Lake , would have not been fit to belong to the profession . " When Congress passed the first law for building the road , every populated center along the Missouri River started campaigns to have the initial point located at their town . How the point at Council Bluffs was selected was later related by General Dodge : " I returned to Council Bluffs ( 1857 ) and continued my examinations until 1861 . I remembered that in 1859 , when I returned from a trip on the plains , I met Mr. Lincoln at the Pacific House . Mr. Lincoln came up from St. Joseph on a steamer to look after an interest he had bought in the Riddle tract from N. B. Judd , of Chicago . He also found here and visited some old Springfield ( Illinois ) friends , W. H. M. Pusey , Thomas Officer and others . Mr. Lincoln sought me out , and was greatly interested in the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information I had , going fully and thoroughly into it . I was very decided that the Great Platte route was , from our explorations and surveys , the best , most feasible , and far superior to any of the routes explored by the Government ... . " In 1863 , I think about June , while in command at Corinth , Miss. , I received an order to report in Washington , and was informed that the President wished to see me . I had no idea what the President could wish to see me about ? in fact , was a good deal puzzled at the order . When I reached Washington and called upon the President , I found that he desired to consult me upon the proper place for the initial point of the Union Pacific , and that he had not forgotten his conversation with me in 1859 .... " After his interview with me , in which he showed a perfect knowledge of the question , and satisfying himself as to the engineering questions that had been raised , I was satisfied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council Bluffs . " Lincoln 's first order was issued on November 17 , 1863 , in these words : " I , Abraham Lincoln , President of the United States , do hereby fix so much of the western boundary of the State of Iowa as lies between the north and south boundaries of the United States township within which the city of Omaha is situated as the point from which the line of railroad and telegraph in that section mentioned shall be constructed . " This description was not considered definite enough by the Union Pacific Railroad Company , and on March 7 , 1864 , President Lincoln issued the second executive order : " I , Abraham Lincoln , President of the United States , do , upon the application of said company , designate and establish such first-named point on the western boundary of the State of Iowa east of and opposite to the east line of section 10 , in township 15 , south of range 13 , east of the sixth principal meridian in the Territory of . Nebraska . " Formal notification was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Lincoln explained the later change . That closed the subject . The Union Pacific Railroad Company was organized in late 1862 and early 1863 . Before completion of the organization , Durant had selected Peter A. Dey to make a complete reconnaissance from the Missouri River to Salt Lake Valley , instructions for which were contained in a letter dated September 6 , 1862 . He was to examine the passes between the 100th and the 112th degrees of longitude with reference to their practicability for a railroad route . Dey 's preliminary report covered the salient features of the country to Salt Lake City . The rolling prairie between Omaha and the Platte Valley could be crossed without difficulty . ' The Platte Valley , with its tributaries , as far as the mouth of Lodgepole Creek , was an excellent location for the road . Three possible routes through the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains
