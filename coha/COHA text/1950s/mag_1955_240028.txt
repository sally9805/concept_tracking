Zhukov 's path is thoroughly paved with the maimed and dying soldiers he found so expendable . . . and I believe we would do well to weigh any friendship that holds life and moral obligation so cheaply . <P> The repetition of the vow Alexander Nevsky made 800 years ago may have been made by Zhukov to save Moscow , but Nevsky meant it for all of Russia and the lands he took .

Raimondi 's or Raphael 's Judgment of Paris is lifted directly from a Roman late 2nd century A.D. sarcophagus or coffin relief of similar subject , which since the late 16th century has been walled up in a prominent place on the garden facade of the Villa Medici in Rome . This sarcophagus relief influenced the work of other artists who saw it before or after its arrival in that garden still much frequented by painters .
