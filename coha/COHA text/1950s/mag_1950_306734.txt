Two years ago a British wit named Stephen Potter published a little book called The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship ( TIME , Sept. 6 , 1948 ) -a waggish study of how to win games " without actually cheating . " Last week , in School and Society , a U.S. dean did much the same thing for " Academic Respectability " - how to attain it without actually knowing how to teach . If members of the profession will only follow a few simple rules , writes Dean H. T. Morse of the University of Minnesota 's General College , such respectability is assured . <P> <P> The first thing , says the dean , is to ditch class discussion and stick to the lecture method . This places the professor right off in a position of advantage and makes it unnecessary for him to answer questions . " It helps , too , if you avoid the practice of organizing your lecture 's , " for this will give the impression that " yours is the brilliant , untrammeled mind , of genius . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these should preferably be citations to little-known reference works of a highly technical or abstruse nature . " It is also wise to require students to read books and articles that are in short supply ' ' or not even available at the college library , " thus providing " a splendid opportunity for you to make deprecating remarks about the provincialism and superficiality of the library and its lack of service to real scholars . " Furthermore , a professor can do wonders for his prestige by occasionally pointing out " that the general educational level has fallen off lamentably since the days when you were a student . . . <P> " One useful device for adding to one 's own status is to cut down the stature of your colleagues . . . and one most effective way to do this is to affect shocked surprise when a student cites another instructor . Just raise your eyebrows and say , with the proper emphasis , ' Did Professor Jones say that ? ' It is more devastating if you do not make any other comment , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deadpan conclusion : in addition to insuring respectability , following these general rules is often enough to guarantee a man a lifetime career in the rank of instructor or even , perhaps , assistant professor .
