The Worst Crime Does n't Pay Few crimes bring as much suffering and anguish kidnaping . The vermin Who prey upon delenseless children are detestable parasites who should be removed from society . it is the duty of each citizen to be ever vigilant against this type of criminal . Vigorous investigation , swift prosecution and appropriate punishment are weapons in our hands to discourage future depredations . While the prompt solution of kidnapings is a deterrent , greater preventive action is imperative . Mr. Stanley Frank 's article serves to alert the public to the dangers of kidnaping , and it Is hoped that his coverage of the problem will cause many parents , teachers , youth leaders and law enforcement agencies to once again analyze the measures of protection afforded our youngsters . John Edg Hoover Director Seven days after the kidnaping of month-old Peter Weinberger , the identity of his abductors was still a mystery . But on this day , July 11 , 1956 , the kidnaper 's chances of escaping capture and conviction suddenly dropped to 1-in258 . The Federal Bureau of Investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back by an outdated law  --  and the odds against the unknown fugitive were easily reckoned : the FBI had already solved all but two of 516 major kidnapings in its jurisdiction . This remarkable record is the product of brilliant detective work in tracking down such vague clues as a squeaking windlass in a water well and the name of an alligator . More pertinently , it reflects the top priority the FBI gives kidnaping . No crime , not even wartime espionage , is investigated more grimly . It does n't matter whether the victim 's family is rich or poor , or whether the ransom demanded is large or small ; the FBI saturates every case with specially trained agents . The Weinberger baby came from a middle-class Long Island family , and the t:42000 asked for his return was a trifle compared to the - : .600,0(X) paid in 1953 for Bobby Greenlease. who was murdered less than two hours after being seized . Yet 206 FBI men were on the Weinberger investigation at its peak , and experts waded through 1,974,5-14 specimens of handwriting to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything we have into a kidnaping because we regard it as one of the most heinous crimes in the book , " says J. Edgar Hoover , director of the FBI . - Murder usually is committed impulsively , but a kidnaping for ransom always is a deliberate , cold-blooded job that subjects both the victim and his family to cruel , inhuman anxieties . " There 's another reason why we bear down especially hard on kidnapers . No one ever will know how close organized criminal syndicates came to undermining law enforcement in this country a generation ago , when kidnaping was their Number One racket , It will be used as a terrorizing weapon again unless all abductors arc hunted down and given sti If sentences that convince the underworld the penalty for kidnaping is prohibitive . " Hoover does not exaggerate the upsurge of kidnaping a quarter century ago . It was estimated that Chicago gangsters extorted ransoms totaling S2.5,000,000 in 1930 and ' 31 ; the total in Kansas City alone during the fall of 1929 was 5.563,000 . Local police were so helpless against kidnaping rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker of Granite City , Illinois , tried  --  unsuccessfully ? to deduct a $.10,000 ransom from his income tax . He argued that it was a business expense . It 's difficult to believe now how bold the racketeers were in t be 1990 's . Col. Robert I. Randolph , head of a " Big Six " committee formed by the Chicago Chamber of Commerce to fight criminals , declared in 1931 that more than 2000 ransoms had been paid throughout the country in the two preceding years . Gangs collected 1 : ; . ; 100,000 from Michael H. Katz , of Kansas City , owner of a drugstorii chain : ti.50,000 from Howard Wolverton. a South Bend industrialist ; tit .40,000 from James Hackett , a Chicago gambler ; : 350,000 from Benjamin P. Bower , of Denver ; 57. ' ; , 000 from Mrs. Nell Donnelly , of Kansas City . Detroit police nipped a scheme to seize Edsel Ford . Virtually every movie star hired a bodyguard after threatening letters were received by Mary Pickford , Charlie Chaplin , Wallace Beery , Joan Crawford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth C.thatterton and Joe E. Brown , Passage of the so-called Lindbergh Law in 19t12 , making kidnaping a Federal offense when victims were transported across state lines , enabled the FBI to get into the fight . But there was no immediate relief . After the repeal of prohibition , gangsters turned to hijacking wealthy people instead of bootlegging booze . Hardly a week passed without a kidnaping story in the newspapers . On one day , March 14 , 1954 , The New York Times carried four such stories . In 1935 there were fourteen known cases involving ransoms adding up to nearly $1,000,000 . Members of the Barker-Karpis gang , who got $20,000 for the release of Edward G. Bremer , confessed later that they had first planned to rob the Commercial State Bank in Si . Paul , Minnesota . Instead they seized Bremer , the bank 's president , because kidnaping was easier than bank robbing and more profitable . The rise in abduction cases was underscored by an emergency measure adopted in 1933 . To speed up reports of kidnapings to FBI headquarters in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the police were told to call directly on that phone , and the number was widely publicized . A few minutes after Charles F. lirschel , an Oklahoma oilman , was taken from his home , at midnight on July 22 , 1933 , his wife was giving Hoover an eyewitness account . Although abduction for ransom has decreased sharply in recent years , National 8-7117 still appears in the Washington telephone directory as the number of the FBI Kidnap Bureau . The FBI is well aware that kidnaping is one of the most difficult crimes to solve . The trail must be found quickly ; the longer a victim is held , the greater is the danger that the kidnapers will get panicky and murder him . Yet the FBI and police move with extreme caution . " The safety of the victim is our first concern , " Hoover says . " If the family asks us to hold off until the ransom is paid , we respect its wishes scrupulously . We pull out all the stops only after the victim is returned or we have good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case last July was a typical example of the FBI 's painstaking methods . The only definite clues were peculiarities in the b 's and r 's in two handwritten ransom notes left at the baby 's home in Westbury , Long Island . The FBI knew from experience that the same characteristics would show up in another specimen of the kidnaper 's handwriting , if it could be found . Operating on the premise that every adult fills out an official form at some time , agents tackled the stupefying job of examining the mass of public records in the New York area . Six weeks later the search ended after 1,974,544 documents , by actual count , had been scrutinized . At that , the decisive clue would have been overlooked if thoroughness were not a rule with the FBI . An agent who had examined some 900 probation reports in Brooklyn Federal court  --  without result  --  asked whether he had seen the complete file . He was told that the papers of three men who had finished their probations were being processed elsewhere in the building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enormous , but he sent for them . One report was signed by Angelo J. LaMarca , who had been arrested two years earlier in a raid on a bootleg still  --  and the agent spotted the distinctive b 's and r 's that were the keys to the case . LaMarca confessed he had taken the baby to get $2000 to pay overdue bills , but lost his nerve after failing to collect the ransom . He led the FBI and police to a thicket where he said he had abandoned the baby the day after the kidnaping . Lying there was the infant 's decomposed body . An even flimsier clue led to the downfall of the Barker-Karpis gangsters , who turned to kidnaping in the early ' 30 's after a series of murders , bank stick-ups and robberies . Kidnaping brought the gang under FBI jurisdiction for the first time , and the G men put the heat on Ma Barker and her bully boys . Mrs. Arizona ( Mat Barker was unusual among criminals in that her notorious career did not begin until she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a thrifty , religious woman , struggling to support four sons on the meager earnings of George Barker , her shiftless husband . By the time Ma 's four boys were adolescents , they had long police records . Ma invariably stormed the station house after an arrest , crying that the cops were persecuting her poor boys . " She was one of the easiest weepers in the history of criminality , " Hoover once remarked , One of Ma 's favorite dodges was planning bank holdups while posing as a hapless widow seeking advice on investments , Bank officials never suspected she was casing the joint . She kept a house in St. Paul where all desperadoes on the lam were welcome , and after her husband moved on in 1928 , she took a paramour , Arthur Dunlop . He later was murdered on her orders for talking to the cops . In the end , Ma Barker and her four sons met violent deaths . Herman was killed resisting arrest in Kansas in 1927 . Albert , given a life sentence for kidnaping , was fatally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed by his wife in Colorado in 1949 . Ma and Freddy , her youngest son , were killed in a gun battle with the FBI at Lake Weir , Florida , in 1935 . Ma never knew that the FBI found her hide-out with help from an alligator , of all things . During the search for the Barkers , FBI agents in Chicago heard that Freddy , wherever he was hiding , passed his time hunting an alligator known locally as Old Joe . The FBI methodically traced what amounted to a bit of folklore . Old Joe was located at Lake Weir , and Ma was spotted in the yard of a cottage . A task force surrounded the place and ordered Ma to surrender . She answered with a fusillade of bullets . FBI sharpshooters hemstitched the cottage with a blast of fire that riddled Ma and Freddy . Ma died clutching a machine gun , and Freddy fell with a pistol in his hand . Elimination of the Barkers promoted Alvin Karpis , who had been Ma 's first lieutenant , to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To escape the tightening dragnet , Karpis had undergone plastic surgery on his face and finger tips . But he could have spared himself the trouble ; he was betrayed by a hobby . Karpis spent so much time in isolated areas while he was on the lam that he developed a fondness for fishing . By keeping tabs on tourist camps in fishing season , the FBI picked up his trail . Karpis ' present address is Alcatraz , where he is serving life for kidnaping William A. Hamm , Jr. , a St. Paul businessman . Every FBI agent gets intensive training in kidnap investigation , and is required to take refresher courses every other year to learn techniques and review old cases . One of the cases studied is the kidnaping of Urschel , a classic example of the value of seemingly trivial clues . After a $200 , - 000 ransom had been paid for his release , Urschel was asked by the FBI to relate every detail of his nine-day captivity . Although he was blindfolded when he was taken to and from the hide-out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over the house at 9:45 A.M. and 5:45 P.M. every day , except one Sunday . Also , he was given water from a well , and every time the bucket was lowered the windlass squeaked loudly . It was n't much , but it was enough . A check of commercial-airline schedules revealed that an American Airways plane flying between Fort Worth and Amarillo was due over Paradise , Texas , at the times Urschel mentioned . On the Sunday he did not hear it , the plane had skirted Paradise to avoid a severe rainstorm . The FBI drew a bead on a ranch near Paradise owned by the parents of Kathryn Thorne Kelly , once labeled by Hoover as " one of the most coldly deliberate criminals of my experience. - An agent gumshoeing around the ranch asked for a drink of water and , sure enough , the windlass squeaked . Those two clues led to evidence which resulted in the convictions of twenty-one people . Six were given life sentences , among them Kate Kelly and George ( Machine Gun ) Kelly , her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kidnaping of Arthur Fried , a young contractor . Thousands of leads had to be checked to reconstruct the crime . At midnight on December 4 , 1937 , Fried was going home with his wife and another young couple from a movie in White Plains , New York , when two armed men forced him into a car and drove off . Two days later , Fried 's family received a note demanding $200,000 for his release . A brother knocked the ransom down to $1800 in subsequent phone calls , but insisted on a guarantee of Arthur 's return before he would pay . The dickering went on for a month , and then nothing further was heard . The FBI was stymied for several months . Then there were two similar abductions . Benjamin Farber , a Brooklyn coal dealer , was seized in April and held for $25,000 . He was released after the kidnapers agreed to take $1900 . In July , Norman Miller , a college student , and his friend , Sidney Lehrer , were forced into a car in Brooklyn and driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , but 5100,000 was asked for Miller . He was released a day later , after his father paid $13,000 . Two circumstances led the FBI to suspect that young punks , the same ones , were behind the three kidnapings . They had asked for exorbitant ransoms which the victims ' families could n't pay ; experienced hoodlums would have scouted the prospects better . Then , they had agreed to accept much cheaper payoffs  --  another indication that they were small-timers . The FBI questioned Miller exhaustively , and found him a sharp reporter , ' Tiller , whose eyes had been taped , estimated that the kidnap car was driven for thirty minutes at moderate speed along a main street to the hide-out . Street noises indicated the hide-out was in a crowded tenement district . He heard references to a movie that suggested a theater was nearby . He was taken ' into a building where he had a strong impression of passing through an assembly hall tilled with folding chairs . While he was held captive , he heard the click of pool halls ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells . An army of FBI agents began putting the pieces together . After a series of thirty-minute trial runs from the kidnap point , they concluded the hide-out was in downtown Brooklyn or lower Manhattan . Those areas were divided into seventeen zones . Agents pounded the pavement looking for a needle-in-the-haystack combination : a poolroom and assembly hall in a building near a theater within sound of church bells . Brooklyn was soon eliminated as the location of the hide-out . While the search was focused on lower Manhattan , Miller and Lehrer were blindfolded and put into five different kinds of club coupe , the type of the kidnapers ' car . After testing the interiors and listening to the engines , they were sure the kidnap car had been a Packard Six coupe , a type newly on the market . When Fried was abducted , five high-school students had spotted a sedan with a New York license beginning 7N . That fact did n't establish a link between the Fried and Miller kidnapings , but the FBI decided to look for the owner of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a bright idea , but in 1935 there were 2,232,936 private cars registered in New York State . Where to begin ? Miller remembered that the kidnapers had made remarks indicating they knew his father was a racing fan . A squad of agents went to Saratoga , where a race meeting was in progress , noted the licenses on all Packard coupes at the track ; then examined the records to determine whether an owner had been issued a 7N license the year before . The cross-check produced one Denis Gula , whose phone was listed at Ukrainian Hall on East 6th Street . Ukrainian Hall was one door from a movie theater and it adjoined a church . Agents ' posing as &liverymen; went into the building and found there was a poolroom in the basement and an auditorium on the main floor . Denis Gula , who ran the poolroom concession , had no police record ; but a son , Demetrius , had served a prison term on a counterfeiting charge . The FBI took Demetrius into custody and got a confession that solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another ex-convict , had kidnaped Fried , Farber and Miller . Fried had been shot and thrown into the furnace at Ukrainian Hall . Gula and Sacoda also burned , under legal sanction , in the electric chair at Sing Sing . Unlike ordinary criminals , kidnapers do not conform to a fixed pattern of behavior or background . They may be intellectuals or morons , amateurs or jailbirds  --  or even a Dr. Nancy Campbell , a Phi Beta Kappa and graduate of the Yale Medical School , who abducted nineyear-old Linda Stamm at Santa Fe , New Mexico , in 1950 . Doctor Campbell , forty-three , a highly respected obstetrician , had delivered Linda 's brother and the children of two FBI agents who apprehended her . Her income was about $20,000 a year , but she seized Linda for a $20,000 ransom , and left the child shackled in a but on a night when the temperature dropped nine degrees below zero . Fortunately , Linda survived . Otherwise , Doctor Campbell would not have wound up with a sentence of only ten to fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's infant son on March I , 1932 , is generally believed to have been the outrage that spurred passage of the law making kidnaping a Federal offense , punishable by death . Actually , the bill had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee two weeks earlier , after disclosure of a plot to kidnap former Vice-President Charles G. Dawes . The measure plugged a loophole that kidnapers had been exploiting . Kidnaping investigations had been in chargeof local and state police , who could n't pursue suspects across state boundaries . The Lindbergh Law empowered the FBI to investigate kidnapers and make arrests anywhere . But an amendment impeded prompt action ; G men had to wait seven days before going to work , ostensibly to give local police time to solve a case . Last July , after , theWeinberger kidnap-murder , Congress cut the waiting period to twenty-four hours . In many kidnapings , the FBI had immediate jurisdiction , under the Federal Extortion Statute , passed two weeks after the Lindbergh Law . This measure made it a Federal offense to send a ransom demand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1932 , however , the FBI did not have the manpower or the prestige it commands today . The bureau cracked a number of tough cases , but it was slow work . In the meantime , public indignation was on the boil . The blowoff came on November 26 , 1933 , when a mob of 3000 broke into the iail at San Jose , California , and seized Thomas Thurmond and John Phillips , who had admitted murdering Brooke Hart after holding him for 540,000 . The mob strung up the kidnapers in St. James Park . Informed of the lynching , Gov . James Rol ph said , " This is the best lesson California ever has given the country . We 've shown this state is not going to tolerate kidnaping . " On the following day Rolph announced that " if anyone is arrested for this good job , I 'll pardon him . " After Rolph 's defense of mob violence , respect for the due processes of law was gradually restored by the FBI 's near-perfect score in capturing kidnapers . The breakup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kidnaping was a sucker play . Ruthless as they were , gangsters rarely murdered hostages in the old days . In recent years , however , jittery novices have killed an increasing number of victims when the police net closed in on them . rH Whenever murder is the aftermath of a kidnaping , there are bitter recriminations on two questions of vital interest to the public . One is whether the press should rush into print with news of an abduction or suppress the news for the protection of the victim , Every newspaper in New York was informed of the Weinberger baby 's disappearance by the authorities , and asked to hold off until contact was made with the captor . One tabloid broke the story , claiming the request came too late  --  the story was in an edition already printed . LaMarca , the kidnaper , confessed later that in hope of getting the ransom , he drove to the Weinberger home the day after taking the infant , but the crowd drawn by the publicity scared him away . It was then , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Weinberger tragedy was made more poignant by the outcome of the Leonard Moskovitz kidnaping in San Francisco in 1954 . Every newspaper and broadcasting station in the Bay area knew of the crime , but all honored a pledge of silence . Consequently , the police could work unhampered by the crackpots , rubbernecks and jackals who invariably flock to a kidnaping . Sixty-four hours after Moskovitz was seized , a phone call was traced to a booth where Joseph Lear and Harold Jackson , a former private detective , were arranging for the payoff . Both were nabbed . Another controversial question concerns the moral obligation of law-enforcement agencies in kidnapings . Should their primary aim be the safety of the victim or the capture of the criminal ? The answer affects the agonizing decision that confronts every victim 's family ; for kidnapers always warn the family that the hostage will be killed if the FBI or police are notified . " In all good conscience , I urge parents to disregard the warning and call us immediately , " Hoover declares . " I say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who has seen too many people suffer heartbreaking anguish . Reporting a kidnaping to the FBI is the best insurance of the victim 's return . We 've had more experience with it than anyone and , I repeat , we will do nothing that jeopardizes the safety of the innocent . " In the Linda Stamm case , the FBI suspected an amateur was the culprit . With the permission of the child 's parents , two agents were hidden within six feet of the ransom money when Doctor Campbell tried to take it . These tactics were reversed in the 1953 kidnaping of Bobby // Greenlease . The FBI was convinced the boy was held by a hard-boiled criminal who would commit murder if he did not get the $600,000 demanded . Accordingly , the FBI helped to assemble the ten- and twenty-dollar bills stipulated in the ransom note . Following instructions , the money was put in a duffel bag and thrown over a culvert near Kansas City , on the night of October 4 , 1953 . The bag weighed eighty-five pounds , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to protect Bobby no attempt was made to grab the recipient . Two days later , while the boy was still missing , a St. Louis cab driver tipped the police that a man was spending money wildly in a barroom . Carl Austin Hall , who had served five years for armed robbery , was arrested . He admitted murdering Bobby . Hall and Mrs. Bonnie Heady , his accomplice , were executed , but the FBI did not close the case . A search was begun for $303,720 missing from the ransom money . Police Lt. Louis Shoulders and Patrolman Elmer Dolan had reported finding $293,740 in the possession of Hall and Mrs. Heady when they were arrested . Hall swore he had turned over practically all of the $600,000 . Both officers were indicted for perjury , found guilty and given jail sentences  --  three years for Shoulders , two years for Dolan . In August , 1955 , a twenty-dollar bill from the Greenlease ransom popped up in Minot , North Dakota , and within the next few months a total of $1710 was recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation again . The FBI is still looking for the remainder of the ransom , hoping to catch and prosecute the people who have knowingly handled it . The FBI never gives up on a kidnaping , no matter how remote the chances of cracking it . Agents are still working actively on the 1936 disappearance of tenyear-old Charles Mattson , of Tacoma , Washington , and the case of Peter Levine , twelve , who was kidnaped in New Rochelle , New York , in 1938 . Both boys were murdered . To date , the FBI has eliminated 25,548 suspects in the continuing Mattson investigation . The FBI 's best send-off came from Machine-Gun Kelly , while he was on the lam for the Urschel kidnaping. " 1 was making fifty grand a year knocking over tin-can banks with no heat on me , and now look what 's happened ! " Kelly lamented . " There 's nowhere to turn without one of those damned Federal agents breathing down my neck . "                @ @ @ @ @
