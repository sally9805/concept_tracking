txt Father Ted Hesburgh , sitting on a pile of bricks atop the half completed building we had ascended , lighted another cigaret . In soft tones he had told plans for moving atom smashers into the new science center nearby  --  and for installing a juke box in the half completed liberal arts building beneath us . Then his eyes centered on Notre Dame 's legendary Cartier field directly to the east . " You get a fine view from this building , " he said laughingly , " but that sure means the end of secret football practice . " This reporter had spent four hours with Father Ted , more formally known as the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh , and this was the first mention of football by the handsome priest who , less than two months ' after his 35th birthday , was marking his first week as president of the University of Notre Dame . No Apologies for Football " We do n't apologize for football , " said Father Hesburgh . " Note Dame wants to be best in everything . We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will argue that Notre Dame did n't come close to the best in selecting its new leader . This was not accidental . Father Hesburgh long was groomed for a key executive post . He was the logical choice to replace the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh , one of the university 's most illustrious presidents , when Father Cavanaugh 's six year term expired . Father Hesburgh was steered into administrative work by Father Cavanaugh and became the former president 's top lieutenant in 1949 . In this role he administered an $8,000,000 building program and shaped Notre Dame 's athletic policies . His immediate demonstration of ability convinced alumni they could guess the name of their school 's next boss . Retains Former Post A talent for squeezing the most from a minute f or from a dollar has enabled Father Hesburgh to continue as administrator of the building program while assuming the president 's duties . He also will continue to conduct a seminar law course with Judge Roger Kiley of Chicago . Traveling with Notre Dame 's football squad two years ago , Father Hesburgh , relaxed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This mistake is not common , however , since there are touches of silver in his jet hair and , besides , football players generally have bigger frames than Father Hesburgh 's 5 foot 10 inch , 165 pound physique . Football players also are unlikely to pursue the writing of philosofical books as a hobby . PRESIDENT HESBURGH , On the other hand , few top college executives ride in the cab of a diesel locomotive , as Father Hesburgh was doing when a trainman mistook him for an athlete . - The questions most frequently asked of Father Hesburgh since his appointment are : 1 How does a man become head of a university at the age of 35 ? 2 How did a priest with the Belgian name of Hesburgh slip into a position that almost traditionally has been filled by Welshes , Cavanaughs , O'Donnells , O'Haras , and so on ? The jesting second question was answered quickly . His mother was Irish Murphy , Father Hesburgh explained , her parents coming from County Wexford . He pondered the serious query . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've wondered myself how I became president . Actually , I just became the one who pulls the strings . The real responsibility is on the strings  --  the academic and administrative aids . " ? Explains His Program What are the president 's future plans for Notre Dame ? " Father Cavanaugh left a great impact , " he said . " I 'll attempt to keep up his work . A person ca n't he too smug when he takes this job because you never know . You just give it what you have . A college president should talk about things after he does them . It is n't like politics , where you crow about what you will do . You remember that a tremendous number of great men have preceded you and that you are inheriting what they have accomplished . Fortunately , I can count on Father Cavanaugh for help . " The lack of moral integrity in today 's world has convinced Father liesburgh that a university must he increasingly vigilant to discharge its responsibility .. This responsibility , he sums up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal excellence with a developed and disciplined mind 1 , a man of professional competence measured against the most exacting standards of his vocation , and a man of social responsibility . Religious Aspect Told Because Notre Dame is a Catholic university , the part of religion in education necessarily was ' discussed . " We do not hold that piety is a substitute for competence , but it should not be divorced from competence , " he said . " If a man is responsible to God he will be responsible to his neighbors , his family , and his country . Our emphasis on religion is n't something that is tacked on to the program , but a fiber running thru our entire educational structure . " We want religion to be important , but we do not want it in a sentimental or superficial way . " He pointed out that Notre Dame 's national alumni president and its former board of trustees chairman were not Catholic and that non-Catholics annually comprise between 5 and 10 per cent of the enrolment , which currently is 4,500 . Priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty . Reads Three Books a Week The life of Father Hesburgh is an example of the person he believes a university should develop . He reads more than three books a week  --  some of them laborious philosofical works , others 25 cent pocket books grabbed while waiting at an airport . The Detroit airport , he believes , has the best selection . Many times during the day you can find him at prayer , but there also are times when you can find him ordering a double-dip chocolate ice cream cone . Father Hesburgh probably is the finest bridge player  --  and the poorest golfer ? in the Notre Dame community . Lack of time to practice golf has kept his score over 100 . The president admits one educational weakness ? he never learned to play poker well . He ca n't bluff . Television programs , unless exceptional , rarely interest him , but he is concerned about the effect of television on education . He is a member of several committees on educational television and theorizes that the development of television may have almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Programs Held Key " " You ca n't say that television itself will have a good or poor effect on us , " he says . " Television is only a means of communication . It is what will be communicated that will exercise the influence . " In his residence quarters , an austere bedroom , study , and bath , on the second floor of ancient Corby hall , the president lives as any other priest , but he does n't think his rooms should be described as austere . " You see , I 'm not really austere , " explains the president , who comes from a moderately well-todo family in Syracuse , N. Y. To live the day with Father Hesburgh , one would have to arise at 5 a. m . He is in meditation from 5:30 to 6 a. m. and during the next hour celebrates mass and says prayers . His breakfast at 7 starts with coffee , orange juice , and toast . Sometimes he has only coffee . Keen Eye for Saving By 8 a. m. he is in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration building where the building directory still lists Father Cavanaugh as president and has a busy appointment schedule until lunch . He inspects me new construction immediately afterward and has a keen eye for saving a dollar . This vigilance once enabled him to reduce the cost of a heating extension from the estimated $.98,000 to approximately $14,000 . Engineers had routed the extension for 9S0 feet at $100 per linear foot . Father Hesburgh suggested a rerouting that cut the distance and cost in half . Still not satisfied , he arose from bed one night to telephone the engineer with a routing plan that was even cheaper . This was the shortest possible route anti the engineers figured they had seer , the last of the priest 's money saving miracles , They had n't . Father Hesburgh next started whittling clown the cost per linear foot . The final saving was approximately $84,000 . Leaves Office at 5:15 Appointments , long distance calls , and meetings are on schedule after the midday building inspection . He leaves the office at 5:15 for prayers until 6 . Then dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most often the recreation time is taken up by business visitors , telephone calls , another session in the office , or , as at 9 o'clock last night , a visit to a downtown hospital when he suddenly remembered the um% ersity 's librarian , Paul Byrne , was confined with a broken leg . By 11 or midnight , at the latest , he is reading in bed and has no trouble falling asleep . " My trouble , " he laughs , " is in waking up . " Yesterday 's compact schedule postponed the building inspection until evening and he invited the reporter along . The liberal arts building was the first stop and the president set a fast pace over and around stacks of brick , lumber . and steel . By the time the liberal arts building had been toured , Father Hesburgh 's companion will have learned that student fees account for only 70 per cent of a 10 million dollar annual budget , that foreign universities generally place more responsibility on the individual student , that a Notre Dame boy has a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts a blind date , and that next fall 's football schedule is a good one . He hopes , says Father Hesburgh , that the football team is as good as the schedule . Once Vetville Chaplain Young married students and their small children wave as the president drives you thru Vetville , the veteran housing unit on the campus , and you get the impres ' sion that of all Notre Dame , Father Hesburgh likes Vetville best . He was Vetville chaplain from 1946 to 1948 and frequently reminded the struggling couples that they probably " never would be as poor as they were then , and probably never would be as happy . " The vets will tell you that Father Hesburgh worked overtime to preserve happiness . He arranged dances for a 25 cent admission charge , then , to keep young wives from wrecking the family budget in a clothes race , posted prizes for the worst dressed couples . With Father Hesburgh you inspect the other new buildings . " You know , " he says , hopefully , " what we need after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one like they have at Princeton . We 'll need more residence halls , a student union building , and another dining hall . We sure need a lot . " Makes His Views Clear You interview others about their attitude towards the new president , and find a trace of evidence that some older members of the community may have been disappointed at being by-passed in Hesburgh 's rise to the top . Some faculty members express anxiety that the emphasis on building may overshadow other things . Rev. Thomas Duffy , C. S. C. , took a Notre Dame mission band to Syracuse in 1928 and met 11 year old Ted Hesburgh . Ted became a friend of the priest and frequently corresponded with him back at Notre Dame . By 1934 Ted Hesburgh was at Notre Dame , studying for the priesthood . Next he studied at Gregorian university in Rome and received his degree in philosofy . When he was ordained to the priesthood at Notre Dame in 1943 , it is doubtful if one student in 100 at Notre Dame knew the young priest who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform School Father Hesburgh was chaplain of the National Training School for Boys , a federal reform school , in Washington , D. C. , while studying for his doctorate at Catholic university the next two years . In 1945 , Father Hesburgh returned to Notre Dame to stay . He stepped into administrative work in 1948 as head of the religion department . Appointment as executive vice president came a year later . Miss Helen Hosinki , presidential secretary for more than three years , sees a resemblance between her former and new bosses . " Naturally , " she says , " Father Cavanaugh and Father Hesburgh worked together for so long . " The secretary was asked if Father Hesburgh had initiated any changes when he took over the office . " 0 , yes , " Miss Hosinki said . " He makes coffee . Father Cavanaugh never made coffee ! "
