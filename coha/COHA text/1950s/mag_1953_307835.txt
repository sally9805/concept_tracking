Silvio Capuana could never forget the poverty of his youth , or the pain and contempt it had brought him in the Apennine village of Contrada , where he was born 60 years ago . Reared in a two-room hovel swarming with flies , brothers and sisters , all as dirty and hungry as himself , he had spent his childhood working long hours in the local wheatfields for a few pennies a day , resenting the shouts of harsh masters and dreaming of a better life . As soon as he was old enough , he fled to seek his fortune in Canada . <P> When Silvio came back to Contrada in 1933 , he was 40 years old , a man of substance , with a real pearl stickpin in his cravat . He built a luxurious villa outside the village , and proceeded to show his contempt for the Contradese in a perverse display of ostentation and charity . He refused to enter the village but gave generously to the local church , and twice each year he would drive his blooded Arab horse around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some Contradese girl cried her heart out because her family lacked money for a dowry . Contradese parents soon learned to come running when they heard the crack of Silvio 's whip , for it meant that he had come with a dowry fit for a patrician . " I know the bitter humility impoverished youth is made to feel in Contrada , " he would say . <P> <P> Wealth v. Brains . At home , Silvio amused himself by decorating the gardens of his villa with a weird menagerie of statuary whose faces bore a startling resemblance to the stuffier citizens of Contrada . Nevertheless , most of the villagers were content to accept Don Silvio as a wealthy , if eccentric , benefactor . <P> The one exception was Carmine Guarino , nicknamed " the Toad . " Like Silvio , Carmine had been born to poverty , but he had found escape along another road , by burying his nose in books until his eyes dimmed and his skin grew waxen with the pallor of lamplight . Carmine 's studies brought him no money , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of respect for the ordered and privileged past and contempt for illiterate successes such as that of Silvio . <P> As president of Contrada 's town council , Carmine , a dedicated Monarchist , set himself to bait the sulky showoff , Silvio , an ardent Demo-Christian , at every turn . When Silvio planted cherry trees on the borders of his property , Carmine made him cut them down because they overhung the village highway . When Silvio built himself a tomb in the local churchyard , Carmine complained that its steps were on public property . " Material wealth can never replace brains , " he gloated when the steps were ordered removed . <P> Faction v. Faction . Soon afterward , a new statue appeared on Don Silvio 's lawn -a large toad with a human head . Carmine Guarino saw it and made the mistake of complaining in public . Soon all of Contrada was flocking to the Capuana estate to look at the new portrait and laugh at its subject . Professor Guarino writhed in an agony of shame . Silvio broke precedent by driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , " in bold , black letters on the side of his desecrated tomb . Carmine promptly brought suit for defamation of character .
