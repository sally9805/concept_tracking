Decking their streets and buildings with flags to symbolize a mood of national optimism , Colombians last week voted 18-to-1 for a novel experiment in government . They approved a constitutional amendment for a long cooling-off period in which all offices will be split equally between the long-warring Liberal and Conservative parties . At elections for the next twelve years , members of each party will choose only their own party 's 50% delegation to Congress , departmental legislature and municipal councils . The executive branch will divide political appointments , half to each party , will name Supreme Court justices the same way . <P> The first election is to be held early next year , and the Congress chosen then will select a President . Presently favored by all but right-wing Conservatives is Guillermo Len Valencia , a middle-of-the-road Conservative . He will take office Aug. 7 , and the ruling five-man military junta has promised for its part to step out on that date . <P> <P> The truce plan is largely the work of Alberto Lleras Camargo , the Liberal President of Colombia who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of Colombia 's recent political misery grew . A split among the Liberals let the minority-choice Conservative candidate win . Four years later , panicky Conservative leaders closed Congress , put Colombia under a state of siege , imposed their most forceful caudillo , Laureano Gmez , as President . Bitter interparty rural fighting , in which 20,000 died , finally led to a military dictatorship under General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla . Modest , brainy Alberto Lleras , meanwhile , moved to Washington and a prestigious appointment as Secretary General of the Organization of American States . <P> Peace Voter . In 1954 , Lleras gave up his plush OAS post , returned to Bogot as a private citizen . Talking and writing , he made himself the sober advocate of truce in the passionate political war , of a return to political sanity . Then , flying to Spain , he sat down amicably with exiled Laureano Gmez , once furiously hated by all Liberals , and persuaded him to agree to the essentials of a plan for sharing power between the parties . The truce , giving promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important role when the present caretaker military junta took over from Rojas Pinilla last May . Last week 's plebiscite certified the success of Lleras ' long effort . <P> Will Congress , split 50-50 , be able to work effectively ? Wo n't the parties clamor threateningly for the more important Cabinet posts ? Lleras knows well that his truce may collapse over just such stumbling blocks . His answer : " No one has thought that other courses could be harder-for example , living eight years under a state of siege . But we have just done that , and I do not see why we can not now coexist peacefully , rebuilding the country , for twelve years . " A crippled beggar in Bogot spoke for most Colombians when asked if he knew what the plebiscite issue was . " I know , " he said , " that yes means peace and no means violence . I want peace . "
