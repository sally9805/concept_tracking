THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ( 423 pp. ) - J.R.R. Tolkien - Houghton Mifflin ( $5 ) . <P> THE VISIONARY NOVELS OF GEORGE MACDONALD ( 434 pp. ) - Edited by Anne Fremantle-Noonday Press ( $5 ) . <P> <P> The literary world of elves , trolls , pixies and wizards is a victim of technological unemployment . Science fiction , with its flying saucers and its legions of Martian midgetmen , has just about monopolized the literature of fantasy . But two new books roll out the old-fashioned magic carpet . The Visionary Novels of George Macdonald ( containing two stories , Lilith and Phantasies ) are by a 19th century Scottish Presbyterian who deserted the pulpit for the pen , and The Fellowship of the Ring is by J.R.R. Tolkien , a pipe-smoking , 20th century Oxford philology professor . Both books are fashioned as fairy tales for adults , and fueled by strong and unorthodox imaginations . <P> Frodo at Fifty . Author Tolkien is the more disciplined storyteller , and The Fellowship of the Ring is the more appealing book . Actually , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle . The novel centers on a plain gold ring , magic but evil . The power of the ring varies . A simple soul can slip it on and make himself invisible , but a tyrant can slip it on and rule the world . In The Fellowship of the Ring , which takes place in the " Third Age of Middle Earth , " the drama springs from the fact that a simple soul has the ring and a tyrant wants it . <P> The simple soul is Frodo Baggins of Bag End , who has been bequeathed the ring by a rich old cousin . Frodo is a hobbit . Hobbits are under three feet tall , eat six meals a day , like to give parties , and both the rich and the poor live in holes . Hobbits are " soft as butter . . . and yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots . " In the end , of course , hobbits turn out to be more like people than people . Frodo is a happy hobbit who whiles away his " tweens " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at thirty-three . " Only at 50 is Frodo driven onto the road to trouble and adventure , by a touch of wanderlust and by the minions of the tyrannical Lord of Mordor , who are scouring hobbitland for the ring . <P> A silver-bearded wizard outlines Frodo 's task and quest . He must " find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin , the Fire-mountain , and cast the Ring in there ... to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever . " <P> Ores , Balrogs &; Ringwraiths . Frodo is about as eager to do this as P. G. Wodehouse 's Bertie Wooster would be to play Siegfried . The bulk of the novel describes his trials . Some of them would scarcely faze a cub scout , and there is so much hiking in fog and snow , up hill and through bog , that Frodo seems at times like a mythical postman . His enemies , however , send shivers rippling along the spine : toeless , green-scaled Ores , fire-breathing Balrogs , Barrow-wights who put their prey in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nine black horses . Frodo and friends best them all , but in the modern manner , more by muddling through than by measuring up to their challenges . Obscure in allegorical meaning but apocalyptic in tone , The Fellowship of the Ring sometimes melts its magic in plausibility , forgetting that a fairy tale is a snow man that can not be brought into the house .
