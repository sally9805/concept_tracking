THE GREAT DAYS ( 312 pp. ) - John Dos Passes-Sagamore Press ( $4.50 ) . <P> Ro ( for Roland ) Lancaster is an elderly , gangling man with a " raddled old face . " Elsa is an untidy drifter of 28 , thirty years his junior and fond of reminding him of it . Ro wants to while away the day talking about the years when he was a famous U.S. newspaperman ; Elsa wants to spout her own grievances , including how she meant to write a novel but had twins by a bandleader instead . Ro and Elsa have come to Havana to make love , with a view to marriage , but when he touches her , she starts to protest : " Not yet . . . It 's got to be right ... " Frigid Elsa drinks one Daiquiri after another and does not stop talking until she is unconscious , so Ro lets her drone on and tells his life story to himself and the reader . <P> The Great Days is John Dos Passos ' saddest , sorriest novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of F.D.R. 's Blue Eagle . Then he had a beautiful wife and enthusiastic , high-placed friends who confided their problems to him and in return got the feel of the country from his shrewd , perceptive articles . When World War II begins , Ro goes right along with it , from blitzed London to the Pacific to the Nurnberg trials . He comes home still carrying in his heart the words spoken to him by H. G. Wells : " If you Americans ca n't find some way of carrying the burden of Empire , we are sunk ! " <P> But to Ro Lancaster the postwar U.S. is a broken Samson . Old New Dealing pals turn against him when he warns of the rising Communist menace . His best friend , ex-U.S . Defense Secretary Roger Thurloe ( a fictional double of the late James Forrestal ) , exhausted and embittered by the spectacle of U.S. fumbling in the face of Communism , jumps to death from a hospital window . Ro 's wife dies of cancer ; their two sons mature into selfish little parasites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a paltry redhead . <P> In his own great days ( Manhattan Transfer , U. S. A. ) Author Dos Passos , whatever his prejudices , could be literarily convincing , but in this book little of that gift shows itself . As a writer who has come a long way , from left-wing radicalism to earnest antiCommunism , Dos Passos makes clear Ro Lancaster 's political displacement but not his personal disintegration . Sketches of Washington days that were both bracing and silly , a caricature of a monumentally pompous pundit , are apt yet perfunctory . Fortunately , time has not weakened Author Dos Passes ' power to describe places and incidents . The Great Days has fine sketches of World War II and a sharply drawn portrait of the fallen Ro wandering the streets of Havana and maundering of the days when " there were all the fish in the sea to catch , all the whisky in all the pubs to drink , all the grand guys in the world to be friends with . " There is a certain poignancy , however vague , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himself , reduced to dropping yesterday 's names .
