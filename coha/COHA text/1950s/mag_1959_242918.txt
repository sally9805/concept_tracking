In all Europe there is no street quite so lively , quite so cosmopolitan or quite so zany as Rome 's Via Veneto-the broad , tree lined avenue known to Italy 's American colony as " the Beach . " And for a decade past , the heart of the Beach has been the polyglot , block-long Caff Doney . There in the soft Roman night , Italians and tourists alike sat till the wee hours beneath bright sidewalk umbrellas , sipping whisky , apritifs or coffee , and watching the Via Veneto 's endless parade of smartly dressed girls , pomaded gigolos and international celebrities , ranging from Brazilian Playboy " Baby " Pignatari to Hollywood 's Clark Gable . <P> Last week for devotees of the Beach all around the world , there was earth-shaking news : Doney 's was no longer unquestioned monarch of the Via Veneto . The challenger : the bustling Caf de Paris , which occupies the sidewalk opposite Doney 's , and for the last few months has been looking more and more like a winner . <P> Chief strategist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nozzi , 44 , who learned his trade in Manhattan 's Quo Vadis restaurant . Di Nozzi 's first significant victory over Doney 's was gained by capturing the patronage of shapely Artist Novella Parigini ( TIME , Jan. 25 , 1954 ) , famed both for her slickly painted nudes and for her girl friends who wear tight slacks , wild hairdos , and exude the sort of animal magnetism that , draws crowds on the Via Veneto . Another Di Nozzi inspiration was the ivory telephones that Caf de Paris waiters plug in at the tables . This won the Caf de Paris the patronage of many of Rome 's ubiquitous movie agents , one of whom cheerily explained : " I can get on the horn there if I want to . " <P> Bit by bit , Roman nobles began drifting into the Caf de Paris , too , and nowadays Principessa Giovanelli , Marchese Bottini and assorted Orsinis and Caracciolos are regularly paged over the Caf 's new loudspeakers . Says a less exalted Roman who recently abandoned his longtime table at Doney 's : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . And the place to see them is at the Caf de Paris . " Inevitably , more and more Americans in Rome are beginning to take the same line . Said one two-week tourist : " I like to watch strange people , so I go to the Caf de Paris . Doney 's is too touristy . " <P> Most ominous shift in the tide of battle came not long ago when Director Federico ( La Strada ) Fellini shot a long sequence for his new film La Dolce Vita in front of the Caf de Paris . Last year he would have used Doney 's for his background . But the management of Caff Doney is not panicking . Surveying his tourist-crowded tables last week , a Doney manager said disdainfully : " When people ask us where the Caf de Paris is , we tell them . "
