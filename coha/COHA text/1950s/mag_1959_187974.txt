Beset by an incorruptible , court-appointed board of monitors and by U.S. Senator John McClellan 's labor-rackets investigators , Teamster Boss Jimmy Hoffa last summer bought a bright stunt thought up by his lawyers* : Why not set up an investigating commission of his own ? Promptly named as chairman of the Teamsters ' three-member Anti-Racketeering Commission : Ohio Insuranceman George H. Bender , sometime Republican Congressman ( 1939-48 ; 1951-54 ) and U.S. Senator ( 1955-57 ) , memorable to televiewers as the boar-shaped man at the 1952 Republican Convention who made himself conspicuous by ringing a cowbell at every mention of Senator Robert A. Taft 's name . <P> Verbal Report . Bender proved equally diligent at wielding a whitewash brush . Breaking an understanding with the other two commission members-a Detroit judge and a Washington lawyer-Bender went ahead on his own , using an investigative method roughly comparable to trying to solve a murder case by going to an open window and yelling , " Is anybody out there guilty ? " To Teamster officials around the country-Hoffa 's own men-Bender sent a form letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came brief , negative replies . That was that . Without even bothering to draft a written report , Bender informed Hoffa that everything seemed to be O.K. Hoffa announced Bender 's finding to the press . <P> A few weeks ago , facts about the techniques and rewards of Bender 's investigation started leaking out . For his efforts , Bender collected $250 a day from Hoffa &; Co. -a total of $19,250 from August to December-plus an additional $9,000 for expenses , including rent on Bender 's regular Washington office . " I have never worked harder in my life , " protested Bender , but it seemed that the only hard work involved was typing copies of letters , and a secretary did that . <P> Written Denial . Last week , his investigation exposed as a sad and cynical farce , Bender was threatening to sue any publication that reprinted Washington Post and Times Herald Cartoonist Herblock 's devastating version of the Bender investigation ( see cut ) . But when a newsman asked to see some of the evidence that Bender claimed to have in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter he had sent to Charles C. Curran , secretary-treasurer of a bakery drivers ' ( Teamsters ) local in Tacoma , Wash . " We would like to know , " said Bender 's letter , " if there have been any cases of racketeering or gangster alliances in your local , and what action has been taken officially to eliminate such elements . " <P> Scrawled across the bottom of the letter was the straightforward reply : <P> No racketeering here <P> Charles C. Curran <P> * Rumor of the week in Washington : Hoffa and Star Trial Lawyer Edward Bennett Williams ( other clients : Frank Costello , Bernard Goldfine and Adam Clayton Powell ) will soon part company .
