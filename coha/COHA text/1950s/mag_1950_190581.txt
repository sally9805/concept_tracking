To a generation born in depression , weaned on world war , and greeted , at 18 , with a conscription number , President Henry M. Wriston of Brown University offered some stern guidance . <P> " Abandon the most fatuous and debilitating slogan that ever misled a generation , " he told Brown undergraduates last week at the opening of a new college year . " Give up security as an ideal . Anyone who promises security is misbranding his political , social and economic goods ... If you insist on being cheated , buy gold bricks or perpetual-motion machines . <P> " It is now clear that if you live at all , you will live dangerously-not only during the instant crisis but for all your lives . Peace has been so mishandled for more than a generation that its convalescence will be long and its full recovery a distant hope . . . "
