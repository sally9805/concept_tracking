I IF we can accept the word of any qualified expert , the future of show business always looks bleak ; the 10 per cent admissions tax has been killing the theater and the movies ever since the first World War . Now it 's 20 per cent and is , of course , killing show business twice as fast , with the aid of impossible operating costs and the consequent high price of theater tickets . A frightening gadget called television is stealing radio 's stars , and previously invaluable radio time goes begging . In all this haze of despair there is one bright ray ? the night club , that delinquent stepchild of the theatrical ? arts , is doing just fine . With no tradition , unless a dubious past can be counted as tradition , the night clubs have developed or possibly stumbled upon a new gimmick which is working out splendidly  --  a gimmick called Honesty . The great majority of New York 's night clubs are located in a neat geographical oblong of midtown Manhattan which is generally referred to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bounded by West 42nd Street , West 52nd Street , Fifth Avenue and the Hudson River . Covering only six tenths of a square mile , it is scarcely larger than a good-sized farm , yet into it and out of it pour millions of visitors annually . For generations it has been the ideal place for the hustler to find a visiting rube ready to be clipped . Within the confines of the Boob Trap are no fewer than sixty-five night clubs , seventy-one theaters , sixty-five hotels , 475 saloons and scores of dance halls , bowling alleys and other entertainment places . Business here is almost entirely pointed toward relieving the visitor of his money . Since the Boob Trap comes under the geographical jurisdiction of a single police precinct  --  the 16th  --  there is a single set of records and history on Boob Trap activities . In only one respect is this record amazing , and this part of the record has to do with the operation of Broadway night clubs in recent years . Not in the past six years , according to police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anybody has been robbed , clipped , abused , overcharged or otherwise swindled in any night club , saloon or cabaret in the district . In this and some other caf ? sectors , the Broadway night clubs have turned square . In recent years the cabaret business has made itself over . The inspiration for this is twofold . For one thing , the loose money and the silly spenders disappeared soon after the end of the war . And six years ago , the late Fiorello LaGuardia , then mayor , began to fingerprint night-club owners and employees , write his own laws on what entertainers could and could not do , and otherwise make it very rough for a certain number of hoodlums and griftera who were somehow under the impression that they were still operating blind pigs . With unsympathetic inspectors from a dozen different municipal agencies peeking over his shoulder and with a caf ? public at last learning to count its folding money , the Boob Trap grifter of other years has pretty much disappeared . Today it is doubtful that an old-fashioned clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is unlikely that any experienced caf ? operator would even try to open one . is sere downed when night clubs beram ? the most rigidly policed form of show business . This fireman , backstage at the Diamond Ilorseshoe , is checking on the club 's tire extinguishers . LOOK WHAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE NIGHT CLUBS ! ( Continued from Page 32 ) One of the best examples of the metamorphosis of the night club is offered by the new Broadway jazz spots . There have been three of these jazz clubs at this writing , and not one of them has failed through the fault of policy . Yet their policy is one which would make the old-time clip-joint operator gasp in horror . This policy is to let in anybody for ninety-eight cents and furnish a straight chair to be sat in for as long as the customer wants to listen to the continuous music . If the customer wants whisky or beer , there is a bar to furnish it . If the customer wants a ringside table , there is table and service available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants ice cream , soda pop or milk , there is an even bigger service bar for his wants . But if he wants non3 of these things , he can still sit in a chair , listen to the best jazz stars and go home  --  for an outlay of ninety-eight cents . The idea of mass audiences for jazz music in Broadway night clubs was launched just after the war by Ralph Watkins , a veteran jazz entrepreneur . Watkins started out with The Royal Roost , offering a combination of orchestras , singers and soloists , and found himself going exactly nowhere under the standard system . As a hypo for a dull Monday night , he offered a bebop concert for a flat admission , and the police had to be called to clear the streets . Watkins ripped out half his tables , stacked rows of chairs behind a rail and launched what is now known in the jazz joints as " the bull pen . " Dealing almost entirely with youngsters and other jazz enthusiasts , Watkins soon discovered that he was selling more soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which featured banana splits and frosted chocolates . In no time at all his milk bar was turning in $2000 more each week than his whisky bar . The Roost idea was doing so well that Watkins found new partners and moved up the street , where he founded Bop City , in larger quarters . At the height of its popularity it drew more than 13,000 customers in a single week and sold more than $6000 worth of ice cream and sodas . Bop City ran for more than a year , when dissension within the management forced its change back into a conventional night club with floor show and dancing . Yet the fact that the flat-admission-charge policy ca n't be blamed for the end of Bop City is proved by the newest of the jazz saloons , called Birdland and located almost across the street from Bop City . Birdland has been so successful that the American Broadcasting Company moved its late-hour disk jockey into the club . Sticking with the ninety-eight-cent admission , Birdland offers the most famous of the new jazz stars and seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs are being financed to operate on the same formula . For such a low-price policy , a night club must , of course , have capacity ; the operators have realized that they need a mass , rather than a class , audience . These clubs surprised and shocked many old-time operators and , it may be supposed , the most shocked of all were the three hoodlums who once ran a night club on one of the sites mentioned during the height of the illicit Boob Trap era . The trio of hoods opened and closed their night club in one night with a profit of around $28,000 from a single customer . The trap was launched with a six-piece orchestra , three or four waiters , a few bottles of near whisky and a half-dozen " hostesses " to promote spending . Prior to the premiere , the bosses promised bartenders , bellboys , cab drivers and news venders in the district ten per cent commission on any " good party " delivered . The first night was almost over , the place was empty and hope was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving male customer into the place . The six hostesses sat down at his table , ordering champagne , which seemed to drain away almost before it was out of the ice bucket . The customer danced with all the girls . The bosses joined the party and had some champagne with him . All was very gay indeed until the lone merrymaker began to show signs of collapse Then everybody disappeared , except for two very sober waiters who shook the customer awake and presented the bill . It was for somewhat more than $800 . This point was always a crucial one in the operation of a clip joint . If the sucker had money enough to pay the check , it was imperative to find out how much more he had , since it was unthinkable to let him get out of the place with anything but cab fare . This customer , aroused from his ersatz-champagne stupor , paid his bill readily  --  with a $1000 bill . The waiter ran it right back to a boss . The boss , who was as familiar with counterfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill was real and ordered a Mickey Finn for the customer . The customer swallowed his potion and again collapsed  --  this time for real . Waiters , hostesses and bosses dragged the unconscious spender into a back office , went through his pockets and came up with $28,000 . Cards and letters indicated that he was a Belgian diamond merchant , in New York on one of his annual visits . The clip-joint operators took charge of the $28,000 , paid off everybody according to protocol and comparative activity . Then they loaded the chump into a cab and dumped him off in an alley somewhere . They did n't even go back to lock up their night club . Anybody who wanted it could have it . January 27 , 1951 The same thing happened , with variations , time after time in the bad old days . Cabarets shifted and slid around like the floating crap game . One good Paper Hat , as the hoods contemptuously called a fun-seeking innocent , was usually enough to furnish a nice profit for the week . Even in that dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the cops would gladly go looking for the clip joint with the intention of smashing it , but a surprising number of victims could n't even remember where they had been . Some nice taxi driver or bellboy had delivered them there , and the whole night 's activities were lost in an alcoholic haze anyway . Recently a culturally low ex-operator who had a long and vivid career in the joints was asked which of all his nightclub operations he considered his outstanding success . " The place where I sold one boob four bottles of beer for $600 , " he decided , smiling proudly in memory . The disappearance of the heavy spender has been one of the reasons for the great change in night-club business in recent years . But there is another reason just as important . This reason is that no form of show business has ever been so rigidly patrolled and policed , or has ever had to operate under so many rules and unfriendly supervisions as the modern night club . The man who wants to open a caf ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step by step , in the following sequence : 1 . He must raise at least $25,000 if he 's building or opening a new club . To buy an old club will probably take as much . For a really big casino , the original investment will be closer to $100,000. 2 . He and his partners must stand up under a stubbornly careful police investigation of their finances , characters , histories and associations . 3 . He must operate his new club for a period of eight weeks as a restaurant without liquor , which means operating at a loss . 4 . Once his caf ? is under way , it is subject to regular inspections and examinations by the following : The State Liquor Authority , the Federal Alcohol Tax Unit , the Department of Health , the Fire Department , the Department ( Continued on Page 94 ) 94 THE SATURDAY ed from Page 90 ) of Water Supply , The Department of Buildings , the Department of Sanitation and the police cabaret inspectors , local precinct inspectors , headquarters inspectors , divisional inspectors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these agencies can force suspension or even revocation of a night-club license . Even the most dependably honest night clubs can expect at least two inspections a month . Considering the initial cost of buying or launching a cabaret and cost of operation , the club owner who takes a chance on cheating a customer stands a bigger chance of cheating himself . Three of the most successful Manhattan night clubs are Billy Rose 's Diamond Horseshoe , Lou Walters ' Latin Quarter and The Copacabana . Rose has been operating on the same premises for ten years and has played to more than 5,000,000 patrons . The Latin Quarter has been in operation more than eight years and it recently tabulated its 9,000,000th customer . The Copacabana , smaller than the two others , has been open for ten years and has never drawn less than 300,000 persona a year . Each of these casinos does a business which varies from $30 , - 000 to $50,000 a week , depending on the popularity of current attractions . These are large figures , but they break down to surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Podell , of The Copacabans , all declare that the average check in their places runs five dollars per person , a little more or a little less . These casinos and others of the same type must depend on the repeater ? that is , the satisfied customer , who may not come to New York often , but who , when he does come , will always pay a return visit to his favorite night club . That , by definition , is the spot at which he got the most in entertainment and food-and-drink value for his money , on his previous visit . Nobody is naive enough to think that a neat profit ca n't be made on a $50,000-a-week gross , or even a $30 , - 000 gross . Actually , a neat profit is made . But today such grosses are essential , or the night club must fold . Rose 's Diamond Horseshoe has about 300 employees . The Latin Quarter and The Copacabana employ about the same number . Virtually all these em- ? ployees are unionized , and many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ' salary for each employee . Rose or Lou Walters must invest about $90,000 when a completely new show is unveiled . The competitive drive for customers has forced average night-club checks down to a point where it is considered by many that the night club is the beat entertainment buy on Broadway , cheaper than going to the average stage show . Two tickets to Peep Show  --  if you can get them at box-office scale  --  cost $14.40 including tax ; the average check for two people at the Diamond Horseshoe is $9.60 . Almost any musical comedy charges six dollars per ticket , but the visitor to New York can see a famous star , a chorus of lovelies and several supporting acts , and can dance to two kinds of music at The Copacabana for a minimum of $3.50 per person on week days and $5.00 on Saturdays . This minimum means that food or liquor , or both , can be consumed to the amount of the minimum . No night club today has a cover charge . Operating costs in night clubs , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old come-on of " excluEVENING POST siveness " has just about outworn its appeal . The sharpest example of this can be had from Sherman Billingsley , whose Stork Club is the most-publicized caf ? in the world . The Stork has always been exclusive , but recently Billingsley ripped out a whole floor which had been used as a barbershop and informal office for veteran customers . He made it into a replica of his bigger room downstairs . " I like to think I 'm smart , " says Billingsley , " but I 've just discovered that I 've been losing thousands of customers who could n't get in here when we 're crowded . With running costs the way they are , you ca n't turn away anybody who is well behaved , decently dressed and wanting nothing but a chance to spend some money . " This does n't mean that your Aunt Minnie can necessarily get into the Stork on a busy night . But this fact is n't peculiar to the Stork or other New York cafes . It 's just as true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a big Saturday night . The interesting point is that even the famed Stork Club is ready for customers , known or otherwise , whenever it has room for them . Exclusiveness is too expensive for any cafe , these days . A fair example of what is meant by inflated operating costs is furnished by Nick Prounis and Arnold Rosafield , who have run The Versailles as a topflight East Side cabaret for fifteen years . " In 1935 , " says Prounis , " I paid musicians seventy-five dollars per week per man for a six-day week . Today I 'm paying $110 per man for a six-day week Steak has gone from forty-two cents a pound to $1.55 a pound . In 1935 a porter got eighteen dollars a week and so did a dishwasher . Each gets forty-five dollars today . Glasses which then cost $1.25 a dozen now cost $4.50 a dozen . Almost all other utensils coat from three to four times as much as they were . " Prounis and other " class " caf ? operators admit that they mat mark up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run their clubs at a profit . They claim that this is imperative to the economic safety of the modern cabaret . Every reputable night club now has elaborate safeguards to make sure that the customer 's bill is correct . " The only way a customer could be cheated here , " says Julie Podell , of The Copacabana , " would be with the connivance of nine separate employees . " With the improved tone of the night clubs has come an improvement in the behavior of the clientele . In ' the history of The Copacabana , the management has been handed exactly $140 worth of bad checks in eight years of operation . In the old days of free-spending drunks , a single night which brought only $140 worth of rubbers would have been considered historic . It is generally agreed , too , that the improved behavior of the average night-club audience has , in its turn , brought an improvement in the moral tone of night-club shows . No longer do seminude sidewalk photographs faithfully represent seminude antics inside . There are small clubs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smutty material , and there are the strip-tease joints in raffish West 52nd Street still operating . But night-club smut is pale in comparison with the old days ; the strippers may look nude , but are actually far from being wholly peeled . Evidence that the successful , mass-appeal casino no longer even tries to lure the few big spenders or even sophisticated New Yorkers only , is offered by the fact that for more than a year the owner of one of the most successful ones has not had a New York press agent . He has , instead , concentrated most of his publicity and promotion on a national campaign . He continues his New York advertising , but makes his greatest publicity pitch for the provinces . He wants the out-of-towners . The Copacabana , appealing basically to the sophisticated and shop-wise New York set , has launched a concentrated campaign to build future customers by making special party deals with colleges and even with high schools . From the moment the spring-prom season opens , the Copacabana has a mob of white-jacketed and evening-gowned youngsters standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . These college and prep-school youngsters are there on party rates , but they ca n't get in until opening time . Once the regulars are cleared out from the Copa rear tables , the service door is opened and the collegians file through the kitchen and , without interruption , are guided to a section of tables specially reserved for them . " We make them a flat price which is cheaper than for individual parties , " says Manager Podell , " and furthermore they get seated quicker by coming in through the side door than they would any other way . We have promotional men working all the schools . We treat the kids right , do n't make much profit , if any , but figure we 're building solid customers for the future . " There is no intention , in this thesis , to contend that every New York night club is a spotless , conscience-stricken temple of the arts . There are still little joints where girl " entertainers " will mix with customers , hustle drinks and possibly offer other services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it costs any joint its license as soon as the plain-clothes cops make the pinch . There is , also , some very blue comedy being tossed around in some of the side-street and Greenwich Village hideaways . It is likely that there will always be some cheating somewhere . The days of Bob the Bandit are gone and will stay gone . Bob operated during prohibition and afterward . He was typical of 100 others . He would rent the cellar or first floor of a brownstone house not too far from Broadway . He would rent an upright piano and a few tables and chairs , and add a few girls who were willing to hustle unsuspecting suckers for a percentage of the take . Then he would sit back and wait for the steerers to bring in a chump or two . Once a sucker arrived , the girls would go to work . They would work every angle to get the chump to remove his coat , because Bob was anxious to get at the victim 's private papers , identification and checkbook , to discover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . Bob was his own waiter and nobody was ever handier with a Mickey Finn or a sleeping pill . Bob also was his own distiller , and he was f ' his own accountant . As accountant , he had devised a neat system . Once he could persuade the sucker to write a ( Continued on Page 96 ) ( Continued from Page 94 ) personal check in payment of his bill , Bob would take it into the office for the " boss " to okay . There he would copy check and signature as best he could , stash the real check , return with the copy and , before the befuddled customer could get a good look , explain that the signature was unreadable . " We 'll destroy this one , " Bob would explain cheerfully , tearing up the copy . " Write me another , Mr. Jones , and be more careful . " Bob would keep tearing up the customer 's " checks " as long as the chump could hold a pen . " I have n't seen Bob the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates . " The last time I saw him , we moved his place out onto the sidewalk . Then Bob suffered a broken nose and broken arm . He was trying to climb over a fence in back of his joint , and we sort of moved the fence out from under him . " It is still possible , of course , for the unwary visitor to New York to run afoul of minor skulduggery by some professional offspring of Bob the Bandit . As long as there is anybody left who will take a chance at flouting the law , there will be misbehavior in all kinds and types of business . But the visitor who keeps to the beaten nightclub path , who patronizes established places , reads newspaper advertisements and listens to his friends for guidance , asks any respectable hotel or guide service for advice , and patronizes only such night clubs as operate during legal hours will get a fair shake for his money today . The most naive visitor , in fact , can have an evening of good fun at a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . Do n't go to night clubs when very drunk . You ca n't add figures or talk sense when drunk . No matter what grievance you have , nobody 'll believe it . 2 . Do n't go to any night club after legal hours , at the invitation of some friendly stranger or because of the promise of " lotsa pretty girls . " 3 . Examine your bill . It 's unlikely that you 're being cheated , but do n't pay first and complain later . If something 's wrong , call the boss . If he 's hostile , call a policeman . No boss wants a policeman around . 4 . Do n't invite strangers , even the prettiest strangers , to sit at your table . Anybody at your table can order anything , and it will be legitimately charged to you . Maybe you did n't hearthem order whatever it was or see it brought . You 're stuck just the same . 5 . If it 's a night club with a floor show , do n't assume that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're there for two sessions you 'll he charged two minimums. 6 . A tip of 15 per cent of your bill is all the waiter deserves . A tip of 20 per cent should bring a big , friendly smile . If the captain of waiters gives you a really good table , be nice and give him a dollar . 7 . The biggest and best clubs now run their own hat-check and cigarette-girl concessions . Some lease out this privilege . The lessee has to get back his lease money . If you 're not interested in helping pay for his lease , buy cigarettes before you go to the place . A quarter is a fair tip for the coat-check girl . 8 . If you must have your picture taken by the night-club photographer , tell the girl in detail just how many prints you want and find out how much they are per copy . Otherwise you 'll be loaded down with " individual shots " which are merely solos separated from the group picture . 9 . Call up before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the headwaiter you have sense enough to find out first whether there 's any room for you . 10 . Do not order any food or drink which is not on the printed menu . You have no answer when the boss tells you he had to send all the way to the Waldorf-Childs in Hoboken to get the " chateaubriand en vinaigrette " which , five drinks ago , you were insisting you had to eat . There 's fun to be had in almost all New York night clubs today at an honest price . But if you are unknown and are n't sure which ones will give you fair shake , do n't go around asking for advice except from trusted friends . Pick up any newspaper . The solid night clubs advertise . If you 're afraid that Aunt Minnie may be frightened by rough jokes or bawdy songs , pick up the telephone , call the club selected , and state your problem to whoever answers . In most cases you 'll be decently advised by the management itself . No management wants squawks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these methods appeal to you , just walk around until you find a night club with a big , bright electric sign . Then ask the doorman how long the place has been open . If he says more than a year , you 're pretty sure to be safe .
