Before anyone had said so officially , without needing someone to spell it out , the U.S. people had realized that this was going to be a long pull and a tough one . Said one veteran : " At first , all of us were sort of kidding about it , saying ' Well , are you ready to go ? ' Now the kidding has stopped . " Last week , looking at the news pictures as the First Marine Division embarked at San Diego , every veteran was wondering : How soon will they want me ? <P> The whole nation had the air of a man waiting . The economy twitched a little , nervously . With reflexes conditioned by World War II , consumers started a rush on cars , tires , nylons , washing machines and refrigerators , soap and even toilet paper . ( A Chillicothe , Mo . man wrote his grocer : " Give me 100 pounds of sugar before those hoarders get it . " ) <P> Harry Truman wore his air of determined calm , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still included old cronies from Kansas City but the unlisted callers were more important .

Dr. Billy Graham , agleam in a pistachio-colored suit and white shoes , called to warn him that the U.S. people are gripped by " a fear you could almost call hysteria " and suggested the President proclaim a national day of prayer and humiliation . Mildly , Harry Truman told Graham that the answers to today 's problems were found in the Sermon on the Mount , particularly the Seventh Beatitude : " Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of God . " Billy emerged pleased ; but there would be no national day of humiliation . <P> At week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the reports of his advisers , planned and considered in the awful loneliness of responsibility . This week he went to Congress to ask what everyone knew had to be asked - more men ( including National Guard units ) ; more controls ( on credit , and on allocations of scarce materials ) ; more money . There was little question that he would get what he asked .
