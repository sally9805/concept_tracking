txt Congress was told yesterday that a new law to clarify the legality of certain peacetime business pricing practices is more necessary now than ever , since firms are being asked to expand producti &; and build new plants in new areas . The statement came from H. Thomas Austen ' , member of the law firm of Covington do Burling and a long-time specialist in businessregulating laws . He testified before Eloese Judiciary subcommittee holding hearings on a bill to provide that a seller can reduce his price in good faith to meet the price of a competitor . Industry now is confused on what can be done legally in the way of absorbing freight charges to meet competition . Companies being asked to expand production under the defense program are wondering what their post-war sales situation will be , Mr. Austern said . He declared these firms are particularly concerned as to whether it will be legally possible in the future to absorb freight charges or otherwise meet competition . " Any knowledgeable lawyer . " he declared , citing the recent Supreme Court decision in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that the present law has been set by a one-vote margin of the Supreme Court . He must also point out that it is the continued view of the Federal Trade Commission that good faith meeting of competition may still be a violation of the law whenever free competition is injured thereby . " In the Standard of Indiana case . the Supreme Court held that a businessman can charge different prices to different customers for the same product if he can prove he was forced to do it to meet competition . The court specifically upheld the practice of making price cuts " in good faith " to meet a competitor 's reductions , even if the cuts result in price discrimination at the retail level . Referring repeatedly to the present legal rules , as " iffy " and " rubbery , " Mr. Austern said the proposed bill would " confirm the majority decision in the Standard of Indiana case and foreclose any administrative efforts to change that law . " The witness denied the bill went at all beyond the Supreme Court decision or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine whether the seller actually acted in good faith . " Legal uncertainty should cease on this vital issue , " Mr. Austern stated . " The time has come for Congress to confirm that there is a right to meet competition in good faith . " He noted that not only do sellers violating the law run into Federal Trade Commission prosecution . but they also have the hazard of private treble-damage suits . : , The inevitable effect of the confusion . " he stated , " is to drive all companies to a rigid . f.o.b. one-price basis . That is not competition . It is non-competitive . It would not hurt the large companies which can create warehouses and branches . Buyers would be restricted on where they could sell and the sellers would also be restricted on where they could buy . " Once the right to compete in good faith has been qualified , the committee was told , " you can not find a yardstick as to what is lawful and what is not . " At the same time a Senate small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point legislation , similar to that in the house . The Senate hearings are due to last through the rest of the month , after which debate on basing points will be scheduled for the Senate floor .
