For a half-century , Clarksburg , W. Va . ( pop . 32,014 ) has chafed under a one-party press . Its boss : a flinty old ( 79 ) party named Cecil B. Highland , who publishes the town 's only dailies , the Democratic morning Exponent ( circ. 13,572 ) and the Republican evening Telegram ( circ. 23,593 ) . Publisher Highland has fought radio ( by banning even paid program listings ) , television for Clarksburg , a public sewage-disposal project , daylight-saving time , and most attempts to improve the town 's playgrounds , schools and police . In his newspapers he has seldom bothered to print the other side of such issues . Last week , in full rebellion , Clarks-burgers began putting out their own weekly newsletter , to give Clarksburg " the straight truth about its government and city projects . " <P> The rebellion was sparked last month by City Manager Glenn Peterson , who , after nine months under fire by the Highland papers , announced that he would quit in May . Leading citizens formed the Clarksburg Non-Partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highland 's press : " It has dominated the city and consistently opposed worthwhile community projects . . . slanted city news , written editorials into news columns , indulged in character assassination , and continues its news blackout of the Non-Partisan Association . " <P> <P> No murmur of the civic protest reached the columns of the Exponent or the Telegram . But in Fairmont , 25 miles away , the evening West Virginian ran full accounts and , as an experiment , sent 2,000 copies into Clarksburg the day after the Non-Partisan Association was formed . Said a West Virginian executive : " We sold out between 12:30 and 2 p.m . When the people of Clarksburg saw our papers on the street , they actually hugged the carrier boys . " On the day of the mass meeting , Clarksburg businessmen bought 2,000 of the Fairmont papers , gave them away free . Since then the West Virginian and the Fairmont Times have been sending 1,000 papers a day to Clarksburg . But at week 's end Publisher Highland had still taken no notice of the biggest story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
