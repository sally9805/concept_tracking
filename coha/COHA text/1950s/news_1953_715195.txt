txt BUS STOCK JUGGLING CHARGED BY QUILL 4,500 Strikers Roar Approval of His Demand That Board of Estimate Be Investigated ** When 4,500 bus strikers were told yesterday that City Hall mediation conferences- had failed to produce any basis for settlement of their eighteen-day walkout , they roared their approval of union demands for an official investigation to determine whether " any member of the Board of Estimate or his brother-in-law " had acquired a controlling interest in securities of the struck bus companies . The call for an inquiry was made by Michael J , Quill , president of the Transport Workers Union , C. I. 0. , at a strike rally in St. Nicholas Arena . The union head charged that there had ' been " juggling " of the stocks and bonds of the two largest companies , the bankrupt Third Avenue Transit Corporation and the New York City Omnibus Corporation . He urged District Attorney Frank S. Hogan , the State Crime Commission , the Public Service Commission or the Board of Estimate itself to determine whether any city official was involved in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Asked after the meeting whether he had a particular member of the city 's highest legislative body in mind , Mr. Quill replied blandly that many members of the board must have brothers-in-law . " If they did n't have very large // families , " he added , . " I , am sure none of them could ever get elected . " The neW attack by Mr. Quill on the municipal high command underscored the near-collapse of weekend peace efforts by the Board of Estimate 's mediators , Victor S. Riesenfeld and Joseph E. O'Grady . The mediators and the union sought to reach agreement on an arbitration formula that would end the bus walkout , but the efforts foundered because of inability to find an arbitrator who would be acceptable to all three of the inter.ested parties  --  the union , the companies and the city . The mediators will meet at City Hall this morning to decide what their next step should- be . It was believed likely that they would schedule conferences with the major companies to discover whether the latter had any new ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of yesterday 's union rally was one of determination to held out for weeks , if necessary , to win a forty-hour week with no loss in pre-strike , take-home pay . Gustav A. Faber , secretary-treasurer of the parent union , turned over to the striking New York local a check for $10,000 to provide emergency aid to needy strikers , and the Greater New York C. I. 0 . Council , of which Mr. Quill is president , will meet tonight to mobilize additional financial support . The strikers draw no regular benefits from , the union , but both the international and the local have committed their combined , treasuries of more than $600,000 to providing emergency assistance and taking other measures to win the strike . Mr. Quill expressed , certainty that every C. I. 0 . union in the metropolitan area would ' pledge itself to assist the strikers a , t tonight 's meeting in the Henry Hudson Hotel . The C. I. 0 . Council is expected to make plans for a Madison Square Garden rally early next week , at which Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organizations ; Allan S. Haywood , its executive vice president , and other national union leaders will be asked to speak . The council also will designate a committee to visit City Hall to-1 morrow or Wednesday and confer ' , with the Mayor on the bus dispute. , The Quill union 's ability to carry , on the strike here was improved , over the week-end by the decision of 9,500 union members in Philadelphia to call off their wildcat strike against the Philadelphia Transportation Company and re , turn to their jobs on the terms I originally recommended by Mr. Quill . Philadelphia Provides a Lesson With the Philadelphia subways , buses and trolley cars back in , normal operation , the union is able , to concentrate all its attention on ' the New York bus strike . It also , is able to use the Philadelphia story as an object lesson in the " folly " of rank-and-file uprisings against the union leadership . Mr. Quill lost - no time in putting the lesson to use . At a secret session preceding the admission of reporters to yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Philadelphia workers as evidence that any settlement finally worked out here should be passed upon by secret ballot of the entire membership , rather than by voice vote at an open meeting . The Philadelphia contract proposal was hooted down at a meeting , only to be sustained overwhelmingly when put to a secret vote four days after the strike began . The New York strikers indicated their willingness to go along with a closed ballot when they had a settlement to vote on , even though at earlier rallies they had booed Quill suggestions that the vote to end the strike be a secret one . All of yesterday 's booing was reserved for the Mayor , Controller Lazarus Joseph , the other members of the Board of Estimate , the State Public Service Commission , the bus companies and the press . Mr. Quill and Matthew Guinan , president of the union 's New York local , reiterated their unwillingness to enter into any settlement that failed to take care of all the strikers or that entailed a surrender of gains the union had won in past years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
