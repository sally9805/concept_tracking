ANGLIQUE ( 890 pp. ) - Sergeanne Golon-Llpplncoff ( $5.95 ) . <P> Once upon a time , in the dank and gloomy castle of Monteloup in old Poitou , there lived an impecunious baron and his daughter Anglique , a wild and barefoot sprite who played , perhaps more than she should , with the peasant boy Nicholas . Looking to Anglique 's beauty to save him from ruin , the baron betrothed her to the Comte de Peyrac de Morens , known as the Great Lame Devil of Languedoc , who was said to be so ugly that girls ran away when he passed by on his great black horse . As it turned out . Anglique and the lame count hit it off famously , but the count dabbled in alchemy and was burned at the stake , leaving Anglique to disappear , nameless and forgotten , into the reeking underworld of 17th century Paris . <P> There she lived with beggars , cutthroats , cutpurses , dwarfs and cripples , including the leering , one-eyed gangleader Calembredaine , who had a " nightmare face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violet wen . ' ' It was Calembredaine who in a frightful brawl won Anglique as his mistress and carried her unconscious to his lair . When Calembredaine tore off wig and wen , who should he be but Nicholas , the ever-loving peasant friend from old Poitou ! <P> Anglique , already a U.S. bestseller , is an enormous fairy tale for adult children , of whom there are legions . The French eagerly took to Anglique as a serial in France-Soir . It ran for more than a year , time enough to catch a breath between one night 's adventure and the next . The reader of the 890-page U.S. translation must pace himself , and should be warned that the author is one up on him from the beginning . Novelist " Sergeanne " Colon is not one person but two-an apparently indefatigable French man-and-wife team ( Serge and Anne ) who claim to have primed themselves with 300 volumes of history before painting their cyclorama . Their scholarship is not intrusive .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
