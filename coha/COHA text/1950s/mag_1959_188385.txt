All week long , the tense and secret conferences went on in New Delhi . First , Prime Minister Nehru called at the red sandstone palace of President Rajendra Prasad . A few minutes after Nehru drove off , his daughter , Mrs. Indira Gandhi , the new head of the ruling Congress Party , drove up . Later , President Prasad called on his bedridden Home Affairs Minister . Finally , the decision that Nehru has so long dreaded was made . <P> Last week , under a constitutional provision empowering the President to assume control of any state government that is unable to function in accordance with the constitution , Prasad formally took over troubled Kerala until new elections could be held . <P> Violated Paradise . As India 's only Communist-run state-and the world 's only existing Communist government to have achieved power through legal elections-Kerala should have been a show place for Asia 's Reds . Instead , it seemed to violate almost every promise that a workers ' paradise is supposed to offer . Its local Action Committees not only disrupted law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist Chief Minister E.M.S . Namboodiripad tried to impose the Communist line upon Kerala 's private schools , he united against himself two usually antagonistic groups , the wealthy , conservative Hindu sect called the Nairs and the state 's large Roman Catholic population . Unrest that at first manifested itself in small student demonstrations soon became a statewide tide of revulsion . <P> For all their talk about " people 's democracy , " the Communists seemed unable to cope with Gandhi-style passive resistance except by mass arrests , using guns and steel-tipped lathees . On four separate occasions , the police fired into crowds . They killed 15 people , slapped 10,000 Gandhi-style demonstrators in jail . Nor did the Communists help their cause when they openly applauded Red China 's brutal invasion of Tibet . <P> Personal Regards . From the start , partly because of a genuine distaste for meddling with a democratically elected government and partly out of a fear of what the Communists might do in retaliation , Prime Minister Nehru balked at taking action . When Kerala 's governor finally sent in a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to persuade Namboodiripad to resign in peace . Namboodiripad himself talked as if he wanted to-but was talked out of it by higher Red authority . <P> Even in ordering Namboodiripad out of office , Nehru characteristically sent him assurances of " warm personal regards . " Nehru 's daughter Indira had no such attitude . What about the Communist threat to stir up trouble all over India ? Snapped Indira : " When have the Communists not created trouble ? " <P> The Communists lost no time in proving her right . Employing the same opening tactics that the opposition , used in Kerala , Communists in West Bengal issued a white paper against the Congress-run local government charging corruption and nepotism . Along with big Andhra Pradesh state , which also suffers from soaring food prices , West Bengal offers fertile soil for Communist propaganda . But by their own violence in Kerala , the Reds have lost much of the surprisingly strong sympathy they once commanded throughout India .                   @ @
