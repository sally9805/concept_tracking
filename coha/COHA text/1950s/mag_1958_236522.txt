THACKERAY : THE AGE OF WISDOM-1847-1863 ( 523 pp. ) - Gordon N. Ray-McGraw-Hill ( $8 ) . <P> William Makepeace Thackeray was the greatest prose stylist of his day , and the tallest ( 6 ft. 3 in . ) . Once , staring over the heads of a crowd , he saw himself being watched at a distance by " a strange visage " that studied him " with an expression of comical woebegoneness . " Just as he was getting interested in the " rueful being , " he discovered that it was himself , reflected in a mirror . <P> In his previous volume , Thackeray : The Uses of Adversity , University of Illinois Provost Gordon N. Ray , No. 1 living authority on Thackeray , described the tragedies that went into the making of the " rueful being " - particularly the death of Thackeray 's infant daughter Jane and the insanity of his young wife Isabella . The new volume shows the saddened giant in his prime-the famed , wealthy author of Vanity Fair and Henry Esmond ; the doting father of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all who detested the rambunctious literary supremacy of Charles Dickens . Author Ray 's biography is less remarkable for its discussion of Thackeray as a novelist than for its description of Thackeray as a man-the best pen picture of the novelist that has been drawn . <P> Public &; Private Man . In Dickens , the Victorian world came face to face with genius in its most overwhelming form , approaching the borders of madness and self-destruction . " No gentleman " was the well-bred Victorian 's verdict on Dickens-confirmed when his home broke up because of his passion for Actress Ellen Ternan . But Thackeray was a gentleman- " as polished as a steel mirror and as cold , " " a natural swell , " a Platonic lover who politely bowed himself out of his passion for a married woman when her husband objected . In public , Thackeray came to represent everything that Dickens derided in the life of high society . <P> Much of Thackeray 's hauteur was put on to conceal the violent , sudden spasms of pain that came from his malfunctioning stomach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness . The rest was a sort of game . He was proud of being a great gourmet-like his friend Lord Houghton . who died murmuring : " My exit is the result of too many entrees . " He was a wit ; once he greeted a quack doctor with " a very low bow " and the words : " I hope , sir , that you will live longer than your patients . " He tempered the generosity of a prince with a biting common sense-as in his answer to a request for money for a friend 's tombstone : " I lent Maginn 500 in his life time and he paid me 20 back . I think I have done enough in giving him bread-let other philanthropists give him a stone . "
