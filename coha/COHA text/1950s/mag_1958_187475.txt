" A year ago my show was 137th in the Nielsen ratings , " observed TV Comic Danny Thomas last week . " Today it 's in the top ten . What can I do after that ? " Actually , there were only 118 shows on the networks ' evening air last May when Thomas ' Make Room for Daddy squatted a miserable eleventh from the bottom , a position to which Thomas had become accustomed in the show 's four years on ABC . Today Danny averages some 44 million televiewers , is topped only by the two mighty westerns , Gunsmoke and Tales of Wells Fargo . <P> In its year on CBS The Danny Thomas Show has benefited from a better time slot ( Mon. 9 p.m. , E.S.T. ) and higher exposure ( 93 more stations than it had on ABC ) .

And then I say , ' And then we 'll go home and I 'll break every bone in your body . ' That 's the treacle cutter . " <P> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two possible worlds-the homy and the glamorous . Such notables as Bob Hope , Dean Martin and Hans Conried have dropped in on the noisy confusion of Danny Williams ' family , promptly found themselves entangled in its small wars . Hope stirred Father Danny to unworthy jealousy by offering to appear in a benefit show that Danny planned to star in ( at show 's end , Danny properly repented his pettiness ) . Crooner Martin was hauled in to make the point that bobby-soxers " collect " crushes , and crushes are not to be confused with true love . <P> " Your Sorrow Unmasked . " Born 44 years ago as Amos Joseph Alphonsus Jacobs , Danny Thomas was the fifth of ten children of a Lebanese immigrant laborer who , back in Toledo , often sold candy to make ends meet . Appropriately , Danny 's first taste of show business was as a candy butcher in a burlesque house . Before long , he was onstage , hamming it up in radio and nightclubs .
