He is also an ardent baseball fan ( New York Giants ) and the unofficial coach of the kids in &; around his suburban New York home . It was practically inevitable that his two interests should meet , and last week they did . Schuman 's The Mighty Casey , a baseball opera , had its world premiere in Hartford , Conn . <P> The operatic Casey is not the Yankees ' Casey Stengel but the Mudville hero of Ernest L. Thayer 's famed old rhetorical war horse , Casey at the Bat , which builds up to one of the biggest letdowns in all literature-Casey 's strikeout with two men on and two out . <P> <P> Librettist Jeremy Gury preserved the 13 stanzas of iambic heptameter intact , but also worked up a good deal of added story business besides two more stanzas .

Nonetheless , the Hartford audience seemed to like most of it , and gave the composer a rousing hand at the end . <P> <P> Composer Schuman decided on his baseball theme " in cold blood , " while searching his mind for an " American " subject .
