The big " if " for business in 1956 is the state of the auto industry . In January sales were slow ; on Feb. 1 inventories were abnormally high ( 856,665 unsold cars v. 462,673 in February 1955 ) . Then sales picked up . In February 's first ten days they were almost as high as during the same period last year . Last week Ward 's Automotive Reports estimated that February sales would total more than 500,000 , making it the second-best February in history .
