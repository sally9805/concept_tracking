Dear Senator : Considering the unscrupulous tactics of the opposition , you may be more embarrassed than pleased to receive an accolade from liberal sources . Yet if ten million Americans are asked to speak up for Senator McCarthy ' , you must expect that other millions will want to speak up for you , among them many individuals who do not agree with you politically . Basically the fight in which you are now engaged has to do with politics ; it is a struggle for morality , integrity , and courage in public life . Whatever the outcome , the American people will long remember you as one who held firmly to principle over party and who refused to retreat from the firing-line to the hospital even under the stress of genuine physical suffering . You have added more stature ? to the American Senate than your opponents can ever take away . The Soviets and Admiral Mahan The sinking by Chinese Communist torpedo boats of a ' Chinese Nationalist warship off the Tachen Islands on November 14 may be regarded in retrospect as the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of the seas " doctrine . The Soviets do not accept this doctrine ; they have a sea-power concept of their own . They believe that a great land power such as the U. , S. S. R. can control the seas around Eurasia despite the powerful American navy if " a zone of naval superiority " can be established for varying distances offshore . Under these circumstances , they argue , even the most powerful " high-seas fleet " can no longer count on control of the seas . Writing in the Soviet magazine Military Thought some years ago , Admiral V. Alafuzov pointed out that " naval battles are decided nowadays not only by major craft but also by air'power , submarines , small torpedo craft , and  --  close inshore  --  by seacoast artillery . And also , the closer the engagement to friendly bases , the greater the variety of naval ships and other resources that can be brought to bear . " Formosa , with its supporting islands , would provide a perfect setting for the test of this theory . While there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet theory warrants a good deal more attention here than it has thus far received . Naguib to Nasser to Chance In terms of power , the ousting of General Naguib froni the presidency of Egypt on November 14 made no difference ; he had been-shoved asidelong before by the junta of military , officers ; headed by Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser , that runs the country . But his dismissal , under charge of complicity , in the October 26 attempt by Moslem Brotherhood , terrorists to assassinate Colonel Nasser , was important on other grounds . It served ' as a dramatic announcement that the Revolutionary Command Council headed by Nasser could now afford to rid itself of the popular general who symbolized the national uprising which had deposed King Farouk , and also , of the troublesome fanatics who have violently opposed - every measure of change instituted by the present regime . The absence of any serious public reaction either to the ousting of Naguib or to the sweeping round-up of suspect members of the Moslem . Brotherhood testifies to Nasser 's present political dominance . Reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the New York Times correspondent put it , " are regarded by impartial observers as stabilizing actions . " So they may be . Acting as both Premier and pro tem Chief of State , Colonel Nasser signed on November 20 the long-delayed Suez Agreement with Britain ; and he is now supposed to be pushing a series of reforms designed , with the help of $40,000,000 granted by the United States , to improve Egypt 's miserable . standard of life and modernize its archaic economy . Yet one-man rule is seldom a very dependable basis for democratic change . Long before , the ousting of Naguib , Nasser and his officer henchmen had carried out a purge of three leading universities ; arrests and beatings of Jews on charges of pro-Zionism had multiplied ; and the regime 's basic attitude toward the West was revealed in a series of vicious attacks on France . Back in Septernber the semi-official daily Al Gonthouria announced " a new plOt against the Arabs being woven in France with Mendes-France , a Jew by descent and a Zionist by creed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its editor repeated the slander , referring to the French Premier as this little Zionist imperialist Jew . " That the earnest attempt of Mendes-France to extend autonomy to Tunisia , in agreement with Tunisian Nationalist leaders , is being daily sabotaged by propaganda and orders broadcast from Cairo is evidence enough of Nasser 's hostility . And the recent revolt in Algeria is directed from the same headquarters . In addition Nasser and his Revolutionary Command are responsible for the continuing border warfare with Israel , as they are for the economic blockade which resulted in the seizure of the freighter Bat Galim in the Suez Canal on September 28 and the arrest of its crew  --  an act of aggression now before the Security Council . So the realities of military dictatorship are not as assuring as Colonel Nasser 's admirers would have us think . Above all they are not evidences of " stability , " or of friendship for the " free world " ; and above all they should demonstrate the dangerous folly of putting modern weapons into the hands of men who will use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack Israel , ? Raising False Issues ... That Senator McCarthy is engaged in a desperate , struggle for political survival hardly excuses the attempt Of his partisans to make it appear that he is being " persecuted " because of his religious faith . That the charge is false even Senator McCarthy concedes . But it is being given the color of authenticity by some zealous Catholics . Some weeks back we pointed out that the columnist John O'Donnell , objected to the make-up of the Senate committee which was hearing the censure charges on the ground that its members represented states in which Catholic political influence was negligible . More recently , posters exhorting firemen to rally in Washington in support of Senator McCarthy , issued by an affiliate of the Knights of Columbus , were distributed in some New York fire stations . Still more recently , - Msgr . Edward R. Martin , introduced as a representative of Cardinal Spellman , told a Catholic War Veterans communion breakfast that a fund of $5,000,000 had been raised " to kick Joe out " and went on to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals . " To date , Cardinal Spellman has not replied to the question addressed to him by seven members of the Colgate University faculty : " Do you really want the American - people to believe that the Catholic Church identifies the widespread concern over preservation of the Bill of Rights with opposition to Catholic ideals ? " While Senator McCarthy was being presented by the Catholic War Veterans with 250,000 signatures to a petition protesting the censure resolution , Clarence E. Manion , former dean of Notre Dame University Law School , was telling the Laymen 's League of the Bishop Molloy Retreat House in New York that the resolution amounted to " the official commission of-treason " since it " gave aid and comfort to the Communist enemy . " Fortunately enough prominent Catholics have opposed Senator McCarthy to offset , to some extent , the effect of these inflammatory statements . But those who have made them will have only themselves to blame should the charges be taken seriously . -                  @ @ @
