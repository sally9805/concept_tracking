RETURN To PARADISE ( 437 pp. ) - James A. fAichener-Random House ( $3.50 ) . <P> Most veterans have a sneaking desire to go back to the scenes of the war they knew . Short of a return to service , few get to do it , fewer still are paid to do it . Storyteller James A. Michener is one of the few . He was paid to go back to the South Pacific , wrote eight articles for Holiday magazine , which footed the bill . He also wrote Return to Paradise , based on the articles , and it is the May choice of the Book-of-the-Month Club . <P> Ex-Seaman Michener knows his South Pacific . As an aviation-maintenance troubleshooter , later as a Navy historical officer , he probably saw more of the area than Melville , Conrad and Maugham put together . <P> He is not in their class as a storyteller . Michener 's slapdash device in Return to Paradise is to write a fact-packed essay on an old haunt revisited , then write a short story based on the central idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulitzer Prizewinning Tales of the South Pacific . The essays , however , are basically good reporting and have an interest of their own . <P> Back to Dinner Jackets . Michener writes with genuine affection for the island natives and their simple , relaxed culture . But he warns paradise-hunters and dreamy would-be beachcombers that the cost of heaven-on-earth comes high . Said a Tahiti businessman : " We want the rich tourists , not cheapies who have a high time on five bucks a day . " Michener 's own estimate : " You can get by in almost any part of Polynesia for only 50% more than you pay in Illinois . In Tahiti , of course , the cost is twice as much . " <P> On Guadalcanal , the pet puppies of the G.I.s are now wild dogs ; the British colonial officials again dress for dinner . At Espiritu Santo , once a huge U.S. base , now a placid French colony again , the natives wear T-shirts and tailor-made shorts . Said the chief of police when Michener departed : " You must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody dances and gets drunk and the chief of police never makes a fuss . " <P> Luck with an If . One day in Rabaul , Author Michener talked over with his wife the places they had seen , the people they had met . Their conclusions : " We would be willing to live on almost any Polynesian island . We 'd think ourselves lucky to be able to live on Tahiti or Rarotonga . We could enjoy a year or two on even the loneliest atolls . The inconveniences would be offset by the joyous life-patterns of the people who would share them with us . " <P> The same goes for Melanesia , but the Micheners add a practical if : " If we could earn some income , have screening , some kind of lighting system and some native boys willing to work for a decent wage ...
