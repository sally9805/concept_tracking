East and West , from within and without , news crashed upon the U.S. last week . There was something almost primitively different in the pattern of events . World news is usually government news . Last week it was the people , the nameless millions , who gave the news its dominant impulse . <P> In Korea , the people were 27,000 anti-Communist Koreans let free from prisoner-of-war stockades ( see WAR IN ASIA ) , and mobs of students and workers who shouted against the truce that the U.N . favors . Defiant Syngman Rhee led these people , releasing the prisoners , organizing the anti-truce demonstrations . But Rhee , wisely or unwisely , spoke what his people felt . The P.W . ' s slipping out of captivity , the white-clad civilians clamoring hysterically , were a reminder that many Asians know and fear Communism as deeply as anyone in the West . The U.S. was so accustomed to rousing other nations to awareness of the Communist danger that it came as a shock to find a people charging it with gullibility and softness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in sight . The U.S. had fought a war without a will to victory , and from that lack sprang snarl after snarl that might hurt U.S. prestige and influence among Asian peoples for years to come . <P> Shouts of Anathema . In East Ger many , the newsmaking people were workers who poured from their tenements onto the streets , shouting anathemas at Communism and defying Red army tanks with stones ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . Like the Koreans , they were jolting proof of a fact that the free world 's leaders seem all too reluctant or timid to act upon : the people who have suffered Communism hate it passionately . They are not necessarily afraid to rise up against it . East German rebellion against Communism seemed to give the anti-Communist world its greatest opportunity-and challenge-since the cold war began . <P> At home , the news was the final days of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg . Two years ago , their trial and its shocking revelation of espionage made Page One stories but evoked no public displays of emotion ; the long series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items of routine news . <P> The foreign press , which spoke of a " hysterical " U.S. public demand to execute the Rosenbergs , could hardly have been more wrong . Then Justice William O. Douglas granted his strange stay of execution . With that , the Rosenberg case finally got to the U.S. people-but not in the way that the " free the Rosenbergs " propaganda had intended . Without hysteria , but with an evident feeling that the Rosenbergs had been fairly convicted and sentenced , the people seemed to approve the Supreme Court decision , ending the confusion and doubt created by Justice Douglas . <P> Lost in the Shuffle . In 1953 , at least 35 criminals were executed before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg . The day before they died , . 129 U.S. soldiers were killed in history 's worst plane crash in Japan . They were returning to Korea to help defend the embittered Koreans against the great conspiracy that the Rosenbergs had served . No picket lines formed for the 129 . They , too , were of the people , who get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then emerge in their courage , their long-suffering patience and their strength .
