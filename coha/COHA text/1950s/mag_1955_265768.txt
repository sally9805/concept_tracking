With all the strength , intelligence and zeal he possesses-and he is well supplied with all-Vladimir ( " Vlado " ) Dedijer , a strapping ( 6 ft. 3 in . ) Serb , has devoted most of his life to Yugoslavia 's particular brand of Communism and to its rugged messiah , Marshal Tito . <P> In the struggling prewar days , Tito frequently found sanctuary from the King 's police in Dedijer 's house . In the terrible wartime days as a partisan fighter against the Nazis , Dedijer watched his first wife die in combat at his side , and was so shot up himself that a large part of his skull is surgical silver . After the war he edited the official party newspaper , Borba , sat in the Yugoslav delegation in the U.N. , and generally proved himself one of the most promising of the brash and brave young revolutionaries . He eloquently supported Tito 's break with Stalin in 1948 . His official biography of Tito so closely reflects Tito 's thoughts that it reads more like the dictator 's autobiography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I love Tito . " Vacant Home . Last week , still an eager Communist , Vladimir Dedijer found himself suddenly a pariah . His old friends cut him . His official car was taken away . His house-one of the hard-to-get good ones in Branka Djonovica Street-was without heat , and word went around Belgrade that it soon would be vacant . Summoned back from a sanitarium where he goes frequently for treatment of his old war wounds , Dedijer learned that he was being purged from government and party for the sin of " diversionism . " In Communist eyes , Dedijer 's waywardness began a year ago . When the regime 's No. 3 Communist , Milovan Djilas , was put on trial for publishing articles which publicly criticized both the loose morals and the political rigidity of the party 's top leaders , only two Yugoslavs spoke up in his defense . One was Djilas ' exwife , Mitra Mitrovic . The other was Vlado Dedijer , who dared to take issue with Edvard Kardelj , next to Tito the most powerful figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dedijer to Kardelj , " I am not a robot and can not automatically accept a view simply because of the authority of the man expounding it . " Dedijer taunted the Communist Party for fearing new ideas : " Let us be conscious of the fact that our revolution has become immortal because she has not eaten her own children , and because the children of this revolution are honest . " <P> The words were audacious , even courageous , but they were unwise . In his eagerness to democratize the regime , Vladimir <P> Dedijer failed to appreciate what his hero , Marshal Tito , and the harder Communist heads understood instinctively , that a totalitarian regime can relax only in limited and selective ways , or invite its own downfall .
