I got no choice ! " she said , scornfully . " You the one that 's got no choice , Mr. Smartypants ! I 'm only sixteen years old , they could put you in jail for this ! My old man hears about this , he 's liable to kill you ! " " Yeah , so you said before , " Sherry said . " Look , you ever stop to think , your Pa hears about this and the first thing he 'd have a chance to do is light into you before he did anything else , to me or anybody else . You claim you 're scared to death of your Pa , well then you . . . " Tude wavered . " All I want 's for you to do the right thing , " she said wildly . " Fay sure as hell ca n't last much longer . Then we could get married . Then I would n't have to go to no doctor . Then my old man would n't have nothin ' to say about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . Honey , you know I 'm crazy about , you , you know ... " Nell turned away , a look of utter distaste upon her face . " No , wait , Nella , " Sherry said , quickly . " Jesus , you talk some sense to the kid . Ca n't you get it through her head that . . . ? " " If you decide on the doe , I said I 'd take her and I will , " Nell said to him softly . " The rest of this is none of my business . I 've had , , enough of it ! " When she came out into the kitchen again , Margie said , quickly , " Nell , what is it ? You look so funny ! What they yelling about in , there ? Is something wrong ? " " Nah , it 's just Tude off on a real whing ding , " Nell said , with brittle cheerfulness in her voice . " Nothing for you to worry about , ' honey . How we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed her walking . " Well , du n no . The last pain was still twelve minutes apart . But they ' gettin ' harder though . " " Hey , you think maybe we should be getting started for the hospital then ? " " Well , I still do n't think just yet , " Margie said , dubiously . " I wo n't take us long to get there when we do go . My suitcase is . packed , all I got to do is put on my coat and go . Gee , the ba : a waters has n't even busted yet , it must be gon na take awhile yet . " Well , you say when , " Nell said . " Remember , I 'm an old maidp201that never had a chance to have a baby . I do n't know about these things . So you tell me when you think we should go . " " The doctor said wait till they was eight minutes apart , so let 's wait . I 'd a lot rather be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital . " Margie paused , and when she went on again , her voice was a little tremulous . " It gets kind of spooky when you 're at the hospital . You 're all alone and they put the sides up on the bed and . . . " Nell hugged her tightly for a moment , and then walked with her , her arm about Margie 's shoulders . " Okay , baby , we stay right here as long as we can ! " After a moment , Margie said , " I guess you did n't find Karl , those last places you phoned ? " " Nope . I. guess he 's gon na miss the party and it serves him right . " " That bum ! " Margie said , affectionately . " Gee , am I gon na kid him about this ! " " Yeah , me too , " Nell said .

" The beginning of anger was growing on Nell 's face . " Yeah , they are talking loud , are n't they ? " " Nell , you go on in there if you want to , " Margie said . " Maybe you can straighten it out , whatever it is . You can make Tude be quiet . Go on in , I 'm all right . " " You sure ? " " Of course I am ! " Margie was smiling again . " Nell , you know what I do , when I 'm walking around out here by myself ? I keep talkin ' to this little feller , I tell him I 'm trying to do my part of the job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and let 's get it over with . I tell him to hurry up and keep pushin ' and come on out here where I can see him and squeeze him and . . . "  |p202Nell  hugged her again , tightly . " Okay , honey . You talk to your little guy for a couple a minutes , and I 'll be right with you . " Nell closed the kitchen door behind her gently , but this time the sound of her feet was loud and angry across the floor . When she came through the doorway , she was breathing quickly , and her eyes were slitted green in her pale face . " Look , would you two lovebirds just as soon pipe down in here ? " In an instant the bright anger was loose , tangible and electric through the room . Tude and Sherry both talked at once , but for one time Tude was bested . " That 's a cute crack for you to make , of all people ! " Sherry shouted . " Of all people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you and . . . " Tude howled like a banshee in a protestation of sheer anguish , and through it Nell said , nastily , " You know , sweetie , it 's gettin ' to be quite a coincidence , is n't it , the number of women cluttering up your life , when all the while you 're telling me how I 'm the only one that . . . " " Do n't you go bitchy on me , " Sherry roared back . " I 'll beat the tar outa you ! This is just as much your business as it is mine and you know it ! " " Oh , brother , what a cute idea that is ! It was your business when you got hot pants and went sneaking off to Clyde 's with her , and now , when it comes to cleaning up the mess , now it 's my business ! " " Nobody cares nothin ' about me , " Tude screeched . " Nobody never cares nothin ' about me ! And now I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nell , and she darted away from under his hands . " Goddamn you ! " he shouted , furiously . " Come here and listen to me ! All it 's your business is because of the way we feel about each other , that 's all , and all the things we 've got ahead of us ! Why ca n't you help me talk some sense into her ? She 's your stray cat , is n't she ? You 're the one that brought her here ! " " Who 's callin ' me a stray cat ! Why , you feisty old tomcat , I 'll show you what ... "  | " Shut up ! " Nell screamed the words just once . She whirled upon Tude first , one straight arm jab that sent Tude sprawling backwards off her feet onto the davenport , and then she was upon Sherry , two rapid hard paralyzing kicks of her sharp slim pump heels into his shin . " Why , you little . . . " " I said shut up ! " Nell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that Sherry was silenced and stood where he was , and finally the room was still . Nell stood straight , looking from one to the other of them , her eyes glittering , her nostrils flaring . " Now , by God , there 'll be no more hollering , " she said , her voice quiet and intense . " Margie 's got enough tonight , without any more of this to worry her . You been wanting me to talk what 's in my mind , Sherry . All right . I 've got a couple things to say , and it wo n't wo n't take me long to say them . " She looked at Sherry first . " Your bus accidents are your own business , Sherry . Bus accidents happen to all of us , and I 've got nothing to say about that . But this one makes me sick to my stomach . She 's just a kid , a wacky little kid , and she lives in my house , and I 'm the one really responsible for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least I thought you had better taste in your women ! " " Go ahead , baby , " Sherry said , softly . " Say it , and get it all out of your system . " Nell ignored him and turned away to Tude . " And you , Tude . I 've got something to say to you , too , so wipe that chessy cat grin off your face and listen . I 've got one piece of advice to give to you . If the man does n't want to marry you , give it up . As long as he feels that way , there 'd be nothing in it for you anyway . You ca n't force things to come the way you want them , I told you that once before . So you better do like he tells you . You were big enough girl so you thought it was cute as hell to sneak off and play house with him behind my back , the one guy , you was always yammering , that you could tell I cared more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough girl to go to the doe , if that 's what he wants you to do , and he 's willing to pay the bill . " Tude stared back at her , her eyes big and frightened , and she licked at her lips before she spoke . Her voice was frightened too , not quite steady over the words she said . " I know why you 're talkin ' to me like this , " Tude said . " You 're jealous , that 's why , jealous ! You 'd like to have me go to a doctor and get fixed up and then go off and keep my mouth shut so you could have him yourself , would n't you ? Well , you 're crazy ! Listen here , you got a right to be jealous a me ! He likes me , do n't think he do n't ! If he did n't like me I would n't be in this fix , would I ? " Sherry caught hold of her wrist tight in his fingers . " Nella , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " Nell 's voice was deadly quiet , her lips scarcely moving at all over the words . " Sherry , go home ! Tude , you get the hell upstairs and out of my sight before I slap your ears off ! I 've had enough of the both of you ! You hear me , Tude ? Before I slap your ears off ! " Tude stared at her for another instant in mute panic , and then she gave ground and fled , her feet slipping over the rug and clatteringacross the hallway and up the steps . " You next , " Nell said to Sherry . " Beat it ! " Sherry stared back at her , his own face paling and furious . " Listen to me , Nella . . . " " I 've heard more'n enough outa you already . Go home ! " Nell spun around and Sherry after her , with long swift strides out into the hallway . He grabbed at her arm roughly and jerked her back to face him . " Now it 's my turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you , standing up there in the middle of the floor telling everybody off , little holier than thou ' ! Well , come down off from there ! None of this would have happened if you had n't thought it was cute and bitchy to take it out of my hide , to tease me along and then stay outa bed with me , all because ... " " Oh , baby , this I been waiting for ! " Nell said through her teeth . " This I been waiting for ! " She flailed her hand into his face with all her strength , and then again.  | " Now get the hell outa here and stay away from me ! " Nell ran , and behind her Sherry said in a cool impersonal voice , " I wo n't take this from you or anybody else , you bitch cat ! " When Nell burst through the doorway into the kitchen , Margie was bent down across a chair back , her hands gripped to the table edge with knuckles white , the breath whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Nell 's voice was shaking with alarm , her hands fumbling helplessly at Margie 's shoulders . Margie managed the lop-sided smile . " Now we cookin ' on the front burner , " she gasped . " Call the taxi , Nell . This little feller must be scared of his mother , I never said he had to push so hard ! "  |p206In  the still dark hours of the night , just before the skies above the city began to pale for dawn , Margie found her way back from anesthesia and opened her eyes to the blinding bright overhead lights of the hospitaldelivery room , and the rapid competent hands still working over her . She heard for the first time the thin angry cry of her child , and she closed her eyes again and smiled contentedly , luxuriously allowingherself to slide back into the fringes of unconsciousness , her whole body numbed and heavy and desperately tired and blessedly relieved of pain . And in a dimly lighted waiting room on another floor , Nell sat upright and motionless on a hard hospital bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed , the dark smudges of her lashes above the high flaring bones of her cheeks . She heard , suddenly , the soft rapid padding of rubber-soled shoes along the corridoroutside , and for a second her body was tense and expectant . But the footsteps passed swiftly by the door , and faded away down the corridor , bent upon some other urgent errand of their own . Nellp207sighed , and , without opening her eyes , she fumbled another cigaretteout of the package in her lap , and wearily lighted it from the butt of the one she had , the little rosy point of light pulsing for a moment in the dimness of the quiet room . Back in the house on the outskirts of town , Tude lay upon her stomach in the middle of her bed , clutching tightly in both arms the wet pillow in which her face was buried . She wept quietly , with the lack of conviction of utter misery , an easy constant welling forth of tears without ceasing , as though she were completely resigned , had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of her life in weeping . Outside her closed door , Hooper , the cat , stood lithe and silent , a miniature deadly jungle hunter , his eyes shining gold in the dim light of the upper hall , his head cocked attentively to the small sound from behind Tude 's door , quite as though he debated with himself the presence there of some prey to his sharp paws . The quiet street outside was a black gulch of shadows under the heavy stretching boughs of the trees , and , at that moment , in the house on the other side , Sherry wakened from light slumber , with the first sound of Fay 's faint stirrings in the bed . He was on his feet instantly , the light turned on , and bending over her . " Hey , time for your medicine , " he said , softly . " How you feel , baby ? " She swallowed several times , a convulsive knotting of her wasted throat , but she did not speak . His eyes were anxiously upon her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from around the sterile shining needle of the hypodermic that Doctor Hooker had taught him to use these past several weeks . Her incredibly slight body in the middle of the big white bed jerked in a kind of senseless reflex , and Sherry moved faster at his work . She spoke suddenly , the merest sound in the room . " Sherry ? You tell Tude ? " " Sure , " he said , quickly , as he frowned over the careful loading of the hypodermic . " Do n't you worry about it any more , baby . " Fay 's whisper was barely lifted above the busy insistent voices of the insects from the darkness outside the windows . " You will marry her , wo n't you ? You promised me you would . "  | " Sure , I will , " Sherry said , soothingly . " Did n't I promise you ? Now do n't you worry about it any more . " He bent down over her , his mouth set , the instant fine beading of perspiration springing out upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , he buried the slender needle beside the blue vein , ridged like a length of heavy cord lying just beneath her transparent skin . When he was done , his whole naked body was clammy , and he wiped at his face aimlessly with his hand . " Sherry , " Fay said . " Sherry , does Nell know now about you and Tude ? " " Yeah , " he said . " She knows . " She did not speak again . The corners of her mouth turned faintly upward , her breathing was the tiniest rasp of sound in the room , her face was loosened and quiet and at peace . Fay closed her eyes.  |p209It  was dawn before Nell came home thatmorning , the chilling gray half-light beforethe sunrise . She paid off her taxi driver , and the cab drove away , its motor roaring noisily in the somnolent stillness of the street . A little breeze rustled the tree leaves together , and there was the loud cheerful trumpeting of roosters as Nell silently crossed the lawn to the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dew-drenched grass . She entered the house quietly , and a peaceful snoring from the living room told her that Karl had returned before her . She hesitated , chewing at her lip as she stood there in the dark hallway , and then she slipped away up the stairs , getting out of her coat as she went . In her own room , she dropped her coat and purse upon the nearest chair , and went on to the bench before her dressing table . She sat for a moment , facing her own wraithlike image in the mirror in front of her , and then she switched on the lights and hunted a pad and pencil out of one of the drawers . Her face was pale and weary beneath the last vestiges of her cosmetics , but the pencil scratched rapidly and unfalteringly acrossp210the paper as she wrote : the baby was an eight-pound boy , he and Margie both were fine , Leota had better let Karl sleep this morning , Leota should also see that Tude was on deck and that Butch had had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unadorned upright letter N , ripped the sheet off the pad and wrote again withoutpausing : eight-pound boy , Margie is fine , hospital visiting hours at two-thirty , congratulations , you stinker . The same plain letter of signature , and then she arose with both sheets of paper in her hand . She kicked off her damp shoes before she went out into the hall again , walking swiftly and silently in her stocking feet . She knelt before Leota 's closed door and shoved the one sheet of paper well under it . The other , she carried with her as she crept quietly into the room where Butch still slept in his crib . With a safety pin from the dresser she affixed it securely to Margie 's empty pillow on the double bed , where Karl would be certain to find it , once the noise of an awakening household drove him here to continuehis sleeping . Then she edged quietly out of the room . When she returned , she closed the door of her own room behind her this time and snapped off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and the bedcovers turned back invitingly , she moved restlessly away . She prowled about the room , pushing at her heavy loosened hair . She lighted a cigarette and coughed and shuddered at the first puff , and snuffed it out again in an ash tray . She stood for a long time before the opened windows , her body drooping with exhaustion . The air warmed , the sky lightened and the sun came up . Birds began their noisy morning business in the treetops ; there was the sound of a screen door slamming and the muted voices of children from farther up the street . Somewhere a car backed out of a driveway and rattled by the house and on down the hill . Butch awakenedin his crib at the other end of the hall and prattled and jabberedthere happily to himself . Nell arose at last from the chaise and lowered the window shades to the sills against the bright slanting sunlight . She flung herself down upon the bed , her face against the pillow . After awhile , she slept . She slept through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and lifted voices , passing automobiles and ringing telephones . She slept too through a rumbling of thunder and light spatteringsof rain upon the roof . She awoke in the gray half-light at the other end of the day , an early twilight with dark rapid moving clouds low overhead , and a hard gusty wind moaning in the trees and rattling a loosened piece of cave spouting against the house . She arose immediately , her face still empty with sleep , and , belt -- ing a robe about her , she pattered off down the hall to the bathroom . When she came out again , the house was very still . The nearest door was ajar , and through it came the sounds of Butch once more in his crib , but this time his soft contented sounds of a full stomach and sleep pleasantly upon him . Light filtered out from the crack beneath Leota 's door , and Nell went to it , drumming upon the wood lightly with her fingers . With the sound of Leota 's voice from within , Nell opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door frame . " Hi , how you doin ' ? " she said , cheerfully . " Well , a couple of oldmaidaunts , that 's what we 're getting to be ! " Leota looked up from her book , spread open in front of her on the student 's table . " That 's right , " she said . " Anyway , I 'm glad it 's over , and Margie and the baby are all right . " " Fit as fiddles , they said at the hospital . Come on down and eat with me . We 'll drink a cup of coffee to the new small fry . Suppose we can talk them into naming him after Pop ? " " I 've already had my supper , " Leota said . " I thought you was going to sleep right on through the rest of the night or something . Well , sir , you 'd think this would make Karl sit back and think a little , two children now to support . But I do n't suppose it will . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he 's carrying on . I just do n't see what 'll ever become of ' em ! " " Or what 's ever gon na become of any of us , " Nell said , flippantly . At the look of instant disapproval upon Leota 's face , she added with ponderous lugubriousness , " Flee is the bird to the mountain ! Ah , flee is the bird to the mountain ! "  | " Nell , for heaven 's sakes ! " Leota said , her face baffled and disapproving , all at once . " Look , I do n't suppose they 'll let us in to see Margie , " Nell said , calmly . " But I 'll send her some flowers tonight . I 'll put both our names on the card . " Nell closed the door behind her softly , while the wind suddenly whooped around the house . There was a similar little streak of light shining from beneath Tude 's door . Nell looked at it , and turned away down the stairs . In the untidy draughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at cheese while she fixed the dry cereal and fruit in a bowl , and ate that standing by the sink shelf , while the coffee brewed . When she was done , she rummaged through a box of tin cans and trash on the back porch , the wind whipping at her hair , until she found an empty medicine bottle . She washed it carefullyand repeatedly under the hot-water faucet , scratching away the soaked label with her fingernails , scalding it under the steaming water . She dried it as best she could , shaking water out of it impatiently , and then she put it away in the pocket of her bright coralcoloredrobe , stopper and all . She carried the coffee pot and cups with her then , back up the stairs . In her room , she turned on lights everywhere . She lowered windowsagainst the wind , and raised window shades to the top , the full view of the wildly tossing tree limbs in the darkness outside . She turned on her phonograph and smoked and sipped at the hot coffee rapidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , suddenly , she shut off the phonograph and walked abruptly out into the hall to Tude 's door . She rapped lightly , and waited . After a moment , Tude 's voice came muffled from behind it . " Whatcha want ? " Nell opened the door part way . " Hi . " Tude , still dressed , was curled up against the pillows at the head of the bed beneath the light , a little mirror in one hand and a pair of eyebrow tweezers in the other . She looked up at Nell for a second , her eyes still puffed and red from weeping , and then away to the shiny tweezers in her fingers.  | " In case everybody forgot to tell you , " Nell said , " Butch has got a brother . Eight pounds . He and Margie are both fine . " Tude said nothing . " How about you come and have some coffee with me ? " Nell said , after a moment . " I do n't want any coffee . " Tude 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift her eyes . Nell hesitated , and then she stepped into the room , closing the door softly behind her . There was such contained energy and vitalityabout her , that , upon the bed , Tude was very still , her body drawing together and waiting . " You get along with Butch all right today ? " " Sure . " Nell came nearer , her eyes intent upon Tude , and then she leaned forward over her hands upon the footrail of the bed . " Look here , Tude . Awhile ago , you asked me to help you . You said I was the only one you had to depend on . You forget everything that was said around here last night , will you ? Just get it in your head that I 'm trying to help you right now . " Tude examined the little metal tweezers in her hand with infinite concentration . " I know just how you feel , baby . But tough things happen to all of us , things we think sometimes we never can live through . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all we think is , we just want to quit playing and go back to where we started . But it does n't work that way for anybody ; we ca n't go backwards . The only way there is ever to get out of a tough spot , is to go on through with it and finish it . You have to go ahead , no matter what it means , no matter how scared you are . You have to ... " " If you come in here to preach at me , " Tude said , " you can get outa here right now and save your breath . " Nell was silent , and the wind banged past the drawn window shade and into the room , fluttering loose sheets of Kleenex from the pillow to the floor , and ruffling the covers of the motionpicturemagazines stacked on the table beside the bed . " What 's in your mind , Tude ? " Nell said at last . " Do you reallyp214want to marry Sherry , no matter how , is that it ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has n't . Do you think he can take you to Hollywood and introduce you to the Warner Brothers and use their first names ? If you do , then you 're crazy , he 's ... " Tude looked up then , her eyes scornful . " Why you wanta talk like that ? He 's plenty good enough for you to want him , ai n't he ? Then he 's good enough for me . " Nell walked off abruptly to the dresser , putting out her cigarette in an overflowing ash tray there , and then she turned back to Tude . " Look here a minute , Tude . You talk like there 's just two things you can do now , if you really are pregnant , either marry Sherry or have an abortion . But you 're wrong , there 's one other thing you can do . You can go away , I could fix that up with your Pa pretty easy . You can go away and have the baby , and once it 's born you can give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on home , and then your Pa does n't ever have to know anything , or anybody else , and ... " " Why you keep tryin ' to stick your nose into this ? " Tude said , savagely . " This is none a your business ! You might just as well get outa here and save your breath , I 'm tellin ' you right now ! This is somep'n that 's between me and Sherry and nobody else , and we 'll settle it ourselves without you tryin ' to butt in . You 'd sure like to have me go away some place , would n't you ? All that 's eatin ' you is , you 're just jealous a me , like I told you last night . You 're so jealous a me you ca n't see straight ! " " Okay , baby , " Nell said , softly . She thrust her hands into her pockets , and her eyes were cool angry green as she looked down at Tude . " Okay , baby , that does it . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on , you 're gon na paddle your own canoe , go ahead ! You 're young and dumb and asking for trouble and , right this minute , I do n't give a damn whether you get it or not . Everything I try to say to help you , you 've got that one idea in your head , so the hell with it . Now you go ahead and do it your way . " With her hand on the doorknob , she turned and tossed the empty bottle from her pocket onto the bed at Tude 's feet . " Here , wee wee in this the first thing in the morning , " she said , impersonally . " And do n't drink a lot of Cokes tonight . "  |p215Tude  sat bolt upright in instant suspicion . " Why should I do that for ? " " Relax , it 's just for a bunny rabbit test , " Nell said . " I 'll take it to the doc myself , you do n't have to go . You 'd feel pretty damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , come to find out you were n't even pregnant . " Tude considered it warily . " I do n't mind , " she said , reluctantly . " I ai n't afraid of no tests . But I 'll tell you right now , I would n't go to no doctor with you for nothin ' , not with you jealous a me the way you are , and tryin ' to ... " " Oh , for God sakes ! " Nell said , from the door . " Come on down outa the clouds , twerp ! You do n't play ball in my league yet , nor I do n't think you ever will ! " She closed the door behind her with a sharp little bang . Tude sat stiff and breathless , listening intently . Once the sound of Nell 's footsteps had diminished away down the hall into silence , Tude caught her breath and fell back relaxed upon the pillows . She was breathing hard and rapidly , but there was a little satisfied smile upon her face.  |p216Several  nights later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided attendance upon her into shifts , Aunt Ethel , Margaret and Sherry ; and it was during the late hours of the night , while Sherry sat half-drowsing beside the bed , that her death occurred . A simple uncomplicated stopping that was over before Sherry realized it , breath and the functions of living suddenly gone from her skeletal drug-possessed body , and the strong unmistakable feel and presence of death suddenly close about him . Sherry knew , even though he strained his ears frantically in the dinning silence for the small rasping sound of her breathing gone from the empty room ; knew , too , before the quick automatic reaching for the absent pulse , her warm wrist still in his cold fumbling fingers . Then he stood beside her for a moment stupidly , her hand in his , his eyes fascinatedly upon her vacant sunken face , lost in the awe of the vast incomprehensibility of why so suddenly there was no further need to feel for her pulse ever again , or listen for herp217shallow breathing , or sit at her bedside , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for her relief , none of it , nothing more , ever again . Sherry lay her hand slowly back upon the bed , and in a final fumbling gesture of tenderness he tucked the sheet closer about her shoulders , before he left the dimly lighted room . At the telephone downstairs , he made the call to the doctor , and then he walked on slowly to the deserted kitchen . He turned on lights there aimlessly , and then because suddenly his legs were trembling under him , he sat down in a chair , his head dropping into his hands . Aunt Ethel hurried into the room upon his heels , clutching at her green kimono , her face pale and lips quivering . " Oh , Sherry , I heard you callin ' the doctor , " she said , in a hushed voice . " So I ran in to Fay to see how she was . Oh , Sherry , she 's gone ! " " Yeah , " he said . " It was a few minutes ago , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden I heard she was n't breathingany more . That was all , she did n't wake up or anything . It was all over just like that . " The tears sprang immediately from Aunt Ethel 's eyes as she came to him . " Oh , Sherry , I 'm so . . . Why , Sherry , how can we say we 're sorry ? ' T would be her own worst enemy that could wish that poor girl back to suffer any more ! " Aunt Ethel wept out loud as if this were the most tragic fact of all . " Do n't , Ethel . " Sherry patted her hand upon his shoulder . " Sure , it 's better . I know that . " Aunt Ethel wept on for several minutes , leaning against him , patting and soothing at his shoulders , and then she said , catching her breath a little , " Well , I better go wake your Pa and tell him . He 'll want to be up before the doctor gets here . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , futilely , as she bustled away , turning on lights through the house as she went . He heard her light quick steps running up the stairs , and then coming down again almost immediately . " Your Pall be right down , Sherry , " she called out to him inp218a hushed voice , from the living room . " I 'll phone to Margaret now , and Clyde . " " Why do n't you wait till morning ? " Sherry called back , wearily . " What 's the use of waking everybody up tonight ? " " Oh , I told Margaret I 'd call her right away if there was any change , Sherry . And I better call Clyde . They 're the family , and ... " Sherry listened apathetically to her dialing and her quick muted voice trembling with tears into the telephone . He heard too the soft chime stroke of the clock in the living room , and remembered with a guilty start that it was time for Fay 's injection , and remembered after that with a total sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sherry dropped his head back into his hands . In a moment , Aunt Ethel was speaking to him again softly from the doorway . " Sherry , do you want me to call Nell ? " Sherry sat up . " No , " he said , quickly , and then again more slowly , " No . Thanks , Ethel . " " Well , I thought I 'd ask you . " Aunt Ethel hesitated , and then she said , uncertainly , " Sherry , do you want some coffee , or should n't I go upstairs ? It do n't seem right for her to be up there all alone . " " I do n't want any coffee . You  --  you go up there , if you want to . " With the sound of her feet on the stairs . again , Sherry was instantlyrelieved . He told himself that Fay had died tonight and no longer needed anything that they could do for her , but the argument had no validity for him . He only knew that he was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as someone had so constantly sat there now for so many days . And then it was Pa coming into the kitchen , dressed in clean denims , clearing his throat loudly as he came , and tears sparkling in his bright blue eyes . He stopped beside the chair , wordlessly , his work-gnarled fingers gripping tightly into Sherry 's shoulder several times . " Hi , Pa , " Sherry said , stupidly . From the refuge of his rocking chair by the cold cheerless stove ,  |p219the  old man cleared his throat again noisily , and then he said , " Well , Sherwood . It 's a hard thing for a man to have to bury a wife . I remember when ' t was your Ma , upstairs there in this same house . . . " His voice trailed away , his eyes blinking faster . It came to Sherry , for no reason , that not once since he had been home had he sat down for a real talk with Pa , and , unaccountably , a childish lump of pity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's better off , Pa , " Sherry said , steadily . " She could n't ever get well . " They were silent after that , each with his own thoughts , and finally Pa blew his nose hard into a handkerchief , and then leaned forward in the rocker as he searched his pocket for the package of chewing tobacco . " Why , there 's plenty of room for her on our lot out to the cemetery , " he said . ' Unless you was thinkin ' of takin ' her back to California , Sherwood . And old man Duffy 's is still about the best undertakers around here . " " Okay , Pa . " After another moment , Pa said , " You 'll be needin ' to send a lot of telegrams , most likely . If you was to write down a list , I could get at it right away on the telephone . " " No telegrams , " Sherry said , his head suddenly reeling at a whole sea of unsuspected attendant details swimming before him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She . . . " " There 's the doctor now , " Pa interrupted . " Sit there , Sherwood . I 'll let him in . " From there on , the wheels of ritual and tradition began their relentless accustomed turning , and Sherry was dragged along , willynilly , in the wake of the juggernaut . He slept for several hours , at the family 's insistence , and then arose , groggy and aching with fatigue , to a crowded nightmarish day . There was the conference with the undertaker and the bewilderingtask of selecting the casket , there was the trip upon which Aunt Ethel insisted to inspect the cemetery lot , and the decision made concerning the grave site , then the shopping for and measurementsfor alterations upon the dark suit which both Aunt Ethel and Margaret insisted that he must have for the funeral , and in between ,  |p220the  endless discussions concerning flowers , and a minister , and as to whether or not Fay had been known to have a preference in hymns . It was Pa and Aunt Ethel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some details , where it seemed to Sherry that Fay would have had a very clear preference , he was adamant : the immediatelyclosed casket , the use of the undertaker 's chapel rather than the house , a short funeral service without singing . And always there was the personal sense of unreality in the presence of death , so that , in spite of himself , Sherry would find himself listening alertly for the sound of Fay 's weak plaintive voice calling his name down the stairway , at the exact moment that he was ordering the small spray of white orchids to adorn her coffin . He sent a telegram or two of notification after all . It was early evening before he found time to sit down at the telephone for a moment , with Fay 's battered small address book in his hand . The house was full of hushed activity and overflowing with people , Margaret 's family , and Clyde , and the first wave of friends and neighbors who came bearing offerings of sticky frosted layer cakes and pans of escalloped potatoes and baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sherry 's head ached in pounding thumps , as he fingered through the thin little pages of the book . He found the particular address that he sought for at last , Fay 's one close woman friend of some years ' standing , and he dictated a briefly worded message into the telephone . He sat a moment longer after that , turning the pages , brooding over the names and addresses jumbled together there unsystematicallyin Fay 's careless scrawling handwriting , wondering to which if any of them it might be of some concern to learn that Fay herself was no longer living . Finally , after a little hesitation , he sent one more wire , this one to Fay 's former employer for whom she had worked ever since he had known her . He had just put down the telephone when it began to ring , the jangling bell tone jarring inside his aching head . Sherry answered it quickly , his voice strained and irritable . " Hello ! Hello ! "  |p221The  line was alive and still in his ear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherry . " And it was Sherry 's turn to hesitate . " Hello , Nella . " The line was still again , and Nell said , " I 'm glad Fay did n't have to go on with it any longer . Nothing can hurt her any more , poor baby ! " " Yeah , " he said . " Is Ethel handy , Sherry ? " And then she said very rapidly , her voice almost angry , " Sherry , go to bed ! Have you got sleeping tablets ? Get some rest . You sound awful . " " Yeah , Ethel 's here , " Sherry said , quietly . " What 's the matter , too far to walk across the street ? " She was silent , and Sherry groped suddenly for a cigarette from his shirt pocket , and spoke again , his voice the merest murmur into the mouthpiece of the telephone . " Listen , Nella . What 's with the kid ? " " Forget it for a few days , " she said , softly and impersonally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , tell me ! What 's up ? " Nell hesitated before she said it . " She 's pregnant , Sherry . The doc ran a test . I found out this morning . " " Jesus , how unlucky can a guy get ! " Sherry said . " She go to the doc with you ? " " No . Nor she wo n't . I ca n't drag her , for God 's sakes , " Nell said . And then , spacing the words a little , " Even if I wanted to . " " You 're still like that , huh ? " Sherry said . " I 'll get Ethel . " And Aunt Ethel came hastily from the kitchen at his summons , wiping her hands upon her apron . " Nell on the telephone ! " she was saying , incredulously . " Why , why on earth did n't she just run over if she 's home ? I 've been watching for her to come all day long ! " Nell did come , later that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she was able to until the funeral was over . Amid all the solemn hustle bustle of the occasion ,  |p222Sherry  was aware of her participation mainly in terms of the infrequentfleeting glimpses he sometimes caught of her , the turn of her shoulder and her swift hands busy with scraping dirty plates togetherfrom the dining table just as the family was leaving the house once to drive to the funeral chapel , the tone of her cool pleasant voice answering the telephone below as he awakened from an hour 's napping on Aunt Ethel 's bed , her smooth dark head beside Pa 's grizzled one , when Pa arrived for a tour of duty at the funeral chapel so that Aunt Ethel and Sherry might go home to rest . And it was Nell who was responsible for the one touch which likely would have pleased Fay the very most , amid all the funereal trappings and ceremony . She selected one of the largest and best of the glamorized publicity pictures from Fay 's treasured gallery on the bedroom wall , and carried it to the undertakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedestal among the flowers near the head of the closed coffin , so that when all of Sherry 's boyhoodneighbors and associates came to make their calls of condolenceor curiosity , they might see , as Fay herself might have put it , that Sherry had indeed had a very pretty wife . And there was a matter of flowers . It had been Aunt Ethel 's constantand tearful worry , continually expressed in the circle of the immediate family , that there might not be many flowers , since , after all , Fay had been a stranger in the town , and Sherry absent from it for so many years . As it turned out , there were flowers in plenty at the last , and Aunt Ethel 's mind was finally put at rest . But once , during a lull of callers at the chapel , when Sherry had been restlessly fingering the cards on the banked floral pieces , there in the quiet solemn room , he had come across an interesting coincidence : four separate cards affixed to four separate offerings , all written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , Leota 's on another , Karl 's and Margie 's and , on still another , Marney 's . Sherry smiled for the first time in all the dreary business . Actually , for Sherry , the whole period until the funeral was finally over , was one of nightmare unreality and confusion , more than of anything else . There was too much food and too many steaming coffee cups urged upon him , and always too little sleep.  |p223There  was the constant stream of callers at the chapel and at the house : little old ladies , tearful in black , and pleasant-faced housewives , all friends of Aunt Ethel 's , solemn uneasy men dressed in their good suits who were co-workers of Pa 's from the factory , and none of their names could Sherry recall at the instant required , for the life of him . There was only one brief time that he was alone in all his waking hours until the funeral was over . After his dark suit had been deliveredsafely , to Aunt Ethel 's and Margaret 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single pair of shoes that they considered suitable for him to wear with it . Sherry had lost his temper and shouted at them that it must certainly be quite immaterial to Fay whether he trod after her bier in sports shoes or barefoot , but the power and determination of the argument had been on their side . And so it was , that , early upon the morning of the day of the funeral , a hot sultry morning that gave promise of a hotter afternoon to follow , Sherry had , incongruously , gone off to buy a pair of shoes . It was while he sat there in the anonymous privacy of the store , mopping at his moist warm face , with the kneeling clerk fussing at his shoelaces , that Sherry had the time and quiet to think of Fay , finally , and of her life , and , inevitably , of whether it had been worth it to her . He remembered her laughter , and her insatiable enthusiasm for night clubs and crowds and fun . And he remembered , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one too many drinks , she always wept over the failures and the bastards and the cheats of her living . He saw it all whole , in an instant 's clarity : the restless energy and ambition that had brought her away from the slow stream of life of some hated small town , the precarious scramblings of her handto-mouthexistence ever after , the bitterly lamented successes and triumphs that were always just beyond her grasp , which she always insisted were denied her out of sheer prejudice , or , failing that , at least bad luck , and still her complete unshaken faith and belief that a bright destiny belonged to her by the right of her one simple un-unique talent , her beauty , that perishable asset that she guardedp224and tended a little more desperately in the unspoken panic of every passing year of time . And there was , inescapably , the slow dreary falling apart of their marriage for him to remember in that same instant , and the love he could not give to her . And then the terrifying encroachment of her illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the same relentless end that no power of geography could alter , the slow dreadful wasting away to a death under morphine , in another despised small town at the back end of nowhere , unloved and unlovely among strangers . Had there been fun enough to make it worth it to her , Sherry wondered sickeningly , had there been fun enough ? He obediently trod the length of a strip of carpeting in the stiff new shoes , his eyes staring blindly ahead of him . With a little cold breath of prescient forboding , he wondered that if he himself were to die today and his life be similarly examined , could there be found in it so very much more of any achievement or fulfillment than he had been able to find in Fay 's ? He put the thought instantly away from him , with the unconscious sense of superiority of the living over the dead , secure in his knowledge that , in spite of everything , living was good and valuable to him , his own life , the only time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk painstakingly wrapped the shoe box in paper and string , and ached with a despairing regret that there had not been more fun for Fay , more youth , more clothes , more admiring crowds to view her loveliness , and fewer failures at every turning of her life to spoil with bitterness her real capacity for buoyant gaiety and warmth and generosity . And knew the guilt , too , of knowing that out of no emotion he had ever felt for her , neither the excitement of their first days , nor the tenderness of the last ones , had he been able to alter her pathetic fate by one jot or iota . Sherry left the store and closed the door behind him , walking away over a hot steaming sidewalk to where Clyde waited for him in the car . After that , there was only the funeral service itself . When the hour came to leave the house , Sherry felt a girding together of ener/gies and controls within himself , for this one last most poignant business of the ceremony of death . Afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The silence among them in the car during the drive to the chapel , the hushed rustle and whisper of the people gathering there in the quiet cool rooms , heavy with the sweet perfume of the flowers , a glimpse he caught of Ned and Verna among the others , dressed in their Sunday best , awkward and unwontedly sober in such somber company . Then an unseen organ played soft and melancholy music , and Sherry stared at the coffin and could not make it seem in the least possible to himself that that box at this moment actually contained Fay 's frail insensate body . The minister appeared , walking gravely to the podium , and Aunt Ethel , beside Sherry , sobbed out loud softly , and covered her mouth with her handkerchief . When the minister opened the book before him in the silence after the music was stopped , it came to Sherry with a little start , that it had never once occurred to him to ask Fay during her illness if she would care to have a minister summoned to visit her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of somethingperhaps left undone . " In my Father 's house there are many mansions . . . " Sherry listened to the words and wondered uneasily if Fay would have found any meaning or comfort in them , or if , for that matter , they had any possible meaning or relation to his own life . After that , the minister spoke of Fay briefly and kindly , spectaclesupon his nose as he referred to a paper of notes in his hand . The words began to run together in Sherry 's ears , just as the mass of overpoweringly sweet-smelling flowers in front of him ran together in a great kaleidoscope of color . Sherry was light-headed suddenly ; he felt his own heavy churning heartbeats in his body , and the great and urgent desire to be done and away from this place , only to be released and done and away . He looked quickly and desperately to Pa on the other side of him , unfamiliarly clad in a rusty dark suit of old-fashioned cut , his head bowed against his hand . Then Sherry realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the coffin . This was a time to think of Fay , Sherry told himself wildly , and top226make his last farewells to her , but how was it possible for him to do so when he had not the least sense of her presence here , but rather the sense of her irrevocable absence ? Sherry stirred and Aunt Ethel reached out her hand comfortingly to his knee . Then at last the service was done , and the coffin lifted and carried , and they left the cool dim suffocating room for the breathless sultry heat without . For a moment , blinking and blinded in the sun , Sherry welcomed the sticky heat enveloping him in his relief to be finally away from the chapel , and then he remembered that there was still more and worse to come . He rode in the car immediately behind the hearse , with Pa and Aunt Ethel still on either side of him . The shiny black hearse traveled sedately through the streets , and their automobile after it , and through the windows Sherry saw sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The procession rounded a corner , once , and upon the sidewalk a child in a pink-cotton dress was skipping rope , rapidly and effortlessly , unheedful of them , the looped rope skimming over and under her faster than the eye could follow , her body bouncing in mechanical repetitive senselessness in the glaring sun . Sherry fumbled for his cigarettes , and then aware of the dubious propriety , returned them to his pocket again and wiped perspiration from his face instead . " Oh , it all went off so nice , and I 'm so glad ! " Aunt Ethel said , in a soft tear-choked voice . " Nor I never heard a minister talk any nicer than Reverend Murray did , did you , Sherry , what he said about her and everything ? " They reached the cemetery , and began the last slow winding progress to the end of their journey . The brief ceremony at the grave was wholly nightmare to Sherry : the heat gathered there under the tall still trees , the far-off rumbling roll of thunder , the pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green-colored blanket of paper grass , the weeping about him , the droning voice of the minister , and finally the symbolic handful into the grave , and the end of it . The crowd behind him slowly began to shift and break , and sud/denly Sherry 's legs were trembling as they had on the night she died . Just as the minister was approaching him with a sober sympatheticface , Sherry spun around and bolted . Somehow , without having searched her out , as he pushed his way through the crowd , head lowered and face driven , he bumped against her . He seized hold of her arm , then , and pulled her along with him to the waiting car , door opened and the little fluttering flags upon the fenders . " Get in , for God sakes , " Sherry said , unevenly . " Pa can ride back with somebody else . " She got in ahead of him quickly , without a word , Nell , in a cool white suit , and a little round white felt beret upon her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head leaning back , his face pale and exhausted . Nell lighted a cigarette and handed it to him , saving the match for one of her own . Just then , Aunt Ethel was escorted to the car , weeping loudly as she came . Once she was loaded in and the door closed after her , the motor leaped up and the car was swiftly away back down the narrow tortuous road . Sherry 's head was still leaning back against the seat , his eyes closed , but his body was rigid and tensed , and his fingers , tightly closed over Nell 's , were constantly rubbing and smoothing at the back of her hand . There was no sound within the car except for Aunt Ethel 's uncontrollableweeping and , after awhile , Sherry said , vaguely , " Do n't , Ethel . You 'll make yourself sick . Please do n't , honey . " No one spoke again , and the immaculate black undertaker 's car streaked along until finally it was climbing the hill to the house , its engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door yard , another similar car pulled up behind it , this one bringing Pa and Margaret and two of Margaret 's children . Nell was out first , her smooth legs flashing , her hand still in Sherry 's as she led him after her . " Pa , you and Margaret see to Ethel , " she said , quickly , and then she was guiding Sherry hurriedly across the lawn and porch and into the dim stuffy interior of the house . She lead the way rapidly , on up the stairs and down the hall to Pa 's small bedroom toward the back.  |p228Once  the door was closed behind them , Nell sank down upon the straight chair just inside the door , pulling the beret from her head . " There , " she said , quietly . " I knew you 'd want to get in ahead of the crowd . " Sherry was away from her , pacing up and down the small floor space , lighting a cigarette from the butt of the one , all his motions rapid and jerking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nell was pushing at her heavy hair about her face , and Sherry paused , stripping off his coat and throwing it onto the bed , the tie loosened , and then his fingers rough and impatient with the buttons , and his shirt flung away after the coat . " I never wanted her to die , never , " he said , suddenly , his voice taut . " I 'd of give anything if I could have stopped it ! " He began to walk again and Nell tiptoed across the floor to a window and tusseled it up halfway from the sill . The thunder roared in the room , and Sherry said , " A year , almost a year , it 's been now , that I 've been with her all the time , that I 've waited on her hand and foot , that I 've always had her on my mind , every hour , every minute ! By Jesus , they 're throwin ' the dirt in on a year of my life along with her out there in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , and now she 's gone and I do n't know what to do or how to start it over again ! " He stood motionless in the dim room and the thunder rolled again , and suddenly he flung himself face down across the bed . He was completely still then , and , after a moment , Nell went to him , taking the cigarette out of his limp fingers . She rested her hand for a moment against his bare tanned shoulders . " Get it out of your system best way you can , Sherry , " she said . " You have to do this yourself . I ca n't help you  --  nor anybody . " He did not stir or answer her , and after awhile she left the room quietly , closing the door gently behind her.  |p229Sherry  slept , finally , for an hour , andawoke to the gentle persistent splatter of rain across the roof . The room was half-dark and still warm and stuffy , and Sherry 's head was aching again in sickening pounding thumps . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up from the bed immediately , groping for his shirt in the dim light . He buttoned on the shirt with quick fumbling fingers and walked out of the room and down the hall to the bathroom . When he came out again , his hair combed , his impassive face glowing from cold water , he stood aimlessly in the hallway . After a moment , he turned to look toward the half-opened door of Fay 's room . He looked at it and then strode to it , suddenly , turning on the light there . The room was immaculately cleaned and ordered and freshsmelling ; and empty , as impersonal and untenanted as a hotel bedroom . Every sign of Fay 's occupancy there was gone , only the faint marks left upon the faded wallpaper where her cherished pictures had been fastened to the wall . The furniture had been rearranged , the cot removed , the bed shoved to the opposite side of the roomp230and covered with a sleazy pink bedspread . Sherry stood there for a minute or two , the sound of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out the light and walked away , softly , down the stairs . He went to the door , his feet silent across the floor , and looked out to the dim porch where Pa and Glen and Clyde and Margaret 's husband , Joe , sat in solemn assembly , talking together quietly , their low-pitched voices mingling with the gurgle of water from the eaves spouting . Sherry sucked in his breath a little and turned away , noiseless as a cat , through the living room and out to the kitchen . That room was cheerful with warmth ' and light . Margaret 's children were gathered over a game of cards at one end of the kitchen table , and Margaret , herself , together with a neighbor woman , was busied there with the preparations for an evening meal . " Why , Sherry , you startled me ! I did n't hear you come down , " Margaret said quickly as he walked by her . " How do you feel , Sherry ? Did you rest a little ? Aunt Ethel 's still lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na eat in just a few minutes , Sherry . " Sherry reached out the doorway , his hand groping for his raincoat , hung from a nail driven into the woodshed wall . " I 'm not hungry , Margaret . Thanks . " " Oh , you better eat something , Sherry , " she said , anxiously . " Have some coffee anyway , it 's all made , and . . . " He did not answer her , and she stood and watched him helplessly , her worried-looking face flushed from the heat of the stove , as he got into the raincoat and fastened the belt around him . " I 'll see you , Margaret , " he said , briefly . " Thanks for everything . You , too , Mrs. Tucker . " He crossed the porch without ever pausing in his stride . " I 'm going out awhile , Pa . " And then he went down the steps into the twilight and the cheerlessfalling rain . As he crossed the lawn , he looked toward the house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights turned on there , but he thought he detected a glint of pale-blonde hair and a scrap of blue dress in the swing on the porch , and he turned off rapidly down the hill . He walked steadily in the rain , the foliage about him wet vividp231green as an aquatic landscape , and the water and mud of the road soaked into his stiff new conservative shoes that had , after all , already served the purpose for which Aunt Ethel and Margaret had intended them . He opened the door at Ned 's , and came in , shaking water from his head and shoulders . The room was deserted , except for Ned himself with his straw hat firmly on his head and his newspaper spread out in front of him upon the bar . " Sherry ! Did n't think you 'd make it down tonight ! " he whooped , an awkward note of solicitude in his hoarse voice . " Account a the rain , " he added , hastily . " Whatcha think of this for rain ? Guess you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comin ' right down ! " Ned was floundering . " Well , ca n't complain . Say we need it . Now we got it . Looks like it 'll be a regular sod soaker . Yes , sir , " he finished cheerfully , " a regular sod soaker ! " Ned stopped , his face appalled at some notion that had suddenly popped into his head that made the words he had just spoken singularlyinappropriate ones . He turned away quickly , his hands busy with a glass and cubes of ice . " How 's it goin ' , Ned ? " Sherry said quietly as he hoisted himself up on a stool . Then once the glass was in his hand and he had drunk from it thirstily , he said , " Look , I saw you and Verna at the funeral today , Ned . It was nice of you to close up and come . " Ned was very still for a moment , his pink face solemn as he rubbed at the polished wood with the bar rag . " Sorry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know her . Terrible thing , this here now cancer . Saw the picture there to the undertaker 's . Looked like a real pretty sweet girl . " " Yeah , " Sherry said . " She . . . " His voice trailed away as if there were too many things that he might have said and he were too weary to sort them out and begin . They were silent after that . Ned mixed a second drink and the rain beat upon the window glass and over the low roof , and splashed under the wheels of passing automobiles along the highwayjust outside.  |p232After  awhile , Sherry said , " You may as well set out the bottle and the mixings , Ned , and save yourself the trouble . I think this is gon na be my night . " " Got ta right to it , " Ned said , instantly . " Any man 'd have a right to it ! " He put out a newly opened bottle of liquor , a pitcher of water , and a small yellow plastic bowl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper companionably nearer along the bar . Headlights flickered through the half-closed slats of the Venetian blinds as a car pulled up outside , and a minute later , Verna burst into the room , shaking water like a walrus , dark spatters of mud over her thick nylon-covered legs . " Sherry ! Oh , honey , I 'm glad you come down , " she cried , as she hurried to him . " It 'll do you a world a good to get away from the house . But you must n't sit there in that wet coat . Ned , hang up Sherry 's coat for him , honey . I was just thinkin ' about you , Sherry , drivin ' out here from town , what a terrible lonesome night it was and the rain and everything . Do n't you mind , honey , they say the grave is green that the rain falls on . Honey , pour me a drink , I wanta have a drink with Sherry . " " Verna , you 're a good gal , " Sherry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all the while two vivid horrid images flickered back and forth in his mind in an incessant shimmering danse macabre : one , the cemetery as he had seen it this afternoon , but the crowd all departednow and the grave covered over , and darkness and silence under the tall old trees and the rain beating down hard over the fresh-packed earth ; and then the other image , in dreadful counterpoint , Fay as he remembered her in her terror on the night of the thunderstorm , screaming and clutching and clawing at him from the bed , and her voice over and over again , with the terror loose in it , " Sherry , do n't let me die ! Do n't let me go ! Oh God , I 'm so scared ! Oh , do n't let me fall down there , Sherry , it 's all dark and wet down there ! " The two images incessantly alive there in his mind , one then theother , back and forth , endlessly frighteningly paired , time after time . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sherryp233said . " I 'll buy the piano player a drink any time . " He went off quickly to the old juke box in the corner and fed the coins into it and blindly pushed down levers all the way across the front . The rain poured down in the darkness outside without stopping , and other customers straggled into the bar and out again . Sherry gravely discussed the baseball situation with a man on his right , and bought a drink for a girl on his left , who told him that she had the blues tonight and did n't care if she did get stinking , because her boy friend was with the army in Japan except by now maybe he was in Korea . And the two little images danced their bright dance there in Sherry 's mind . The night wore on , closing time came and went . The water roared in the gutters , and after awhile , Sherry stood in the open door , the cool moist air against his face , and watched the rain plunging down out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights . He closed the door again finally and went back to sit at the bar in solitary company with his own reflection in the mirror in front of him , while Ned worked at the drawer of the cash register . When he was done , and the money put away in the little gray canvas sack , Ned said , " Drive you up the hill , Sherry . No use you gettin ' soaked afoot , drive you up there in a minute . " And Sherry said , steadily and reasonably , " I do n't want to go home . They moved the bed and they took the pictures down , but the goddamn room 's so quiet and ... " " Sure , sure , " Ned said , soothingly . " Better off to stay with us . Your aunt 's liable to throw a fit unless she hears , though . I 'll telephoneright away . " Ned and Verna kept their former living quarters behind the barroomequipped for just such emergencies as this one . Verna already slept in one room there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He slept almost instantly , and just as the dark fold of sleep envelopedhim , the two tormenting images there in his head glimmeredfor the last time and finally were gone , retreating away to some other deeper inner layer of his mind.  |p234It  was almost noon , the next day , whenSherry walked out into the barroom at Ned 's . His eyes were still heavy with sleep , but he was clothed , and there was his look of impeccable good grooming in spite of the stubbleof beard upon his face . The room was empty , dim light seeping in through the Venetian blinds over the windows , and the bar itself was covered with bottles as Ned cleaned the shelves behind it , shirt sleeves rolled and his hard straw hat in place upon his head . " Sherry ! Figured you was gon na sleep all day , " he yelped heartily . " Might as well have . Bad day , still rainin ' off and on . " Sherry swung up onto a stool , feeling his pockets for cigarettes , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Mix you a little pick-me-up , " he said . " Have a little eye-opener and then get something to eat inside a you , that 's the ticket . " Sherry gave up the search for cigarettes and slumped forward over his folded arms , staring unseeingly at the array of bottles in front of him.  |p235Ned  hurried away down the bar . " Why , Sherry , " he called back , presently . " Better tell you before I forget . Little light-haired girl from up to Nell 's down here last night lookin ' for you . Come in while you was in the john once . Asked her if Nell or your folks sent her but she claimed not . Said she wanted to see you real bad . Verna thought you would n't wanta bother . Told her you was n't here and got her right out . Told Verna maybe she should n't a done that . " Sherry 's eyes came abruptly into focus and he sat up straight on the stool . " No , that 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned , will you quit fussin ' with that junk , for Christ 's sakes , and pour me a drink ! " Ned 's clean scrubbed hands stopped still over the cutting of an orange . He put the knife down slowly , and carefully wiped at his hands with a clean white rag . Then , after that moment 's hesitation , he walked back up the bar and reached for the bottle without a word . Ned worked again methodically with his dustcloth , and , after awhile , Sherry said , suddenly , his voice uneven and loud in the quiet of the room , " Jesus , I just need a little time ! I just need a little time , that 's all ! " " Sure , takes time , Sherry , " Ned said , reassuringly . " Man has to do best way he can . Takes time . " The dark dreary afternoon wore on , and darkness came early . By then it was raining again and Sherry was quite drunk . There was a curious precise economy to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strange light tawny eyes a little blank and a little slower to co-ordinate . The barroom emptied out suddenly with the boisterous departure of three men in work clothes , and Sherry got up instantly from his table and came to the bar where Ned was dumping remains of ice from used glasses . " Ned , do something for me , " he said rapidly , the words not slurred at all . " Call up Nella 's and tell her I want her to come down here . " " Why , sure , Sherry , " Ned said , but his face was a little dubious all the same . " It 's  --  business , " Sherry said , impatiently , with the same rapidp236purposefulness , as he picked the coin out of his handful of change . " There 's some business I have to settle , and I 've got to talk to Nella first , that 's all . And look , Ned , if somebody else answers , you do n't have to say who 's calling her . Right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of the telephone booth again almost immediately . " Said Nell was n't to home . Wanted to know who 's callin ' , all right , but I did n't say . Said Nell went downtownto Marney 's . " Sherry moved abruptly away toward the men 's room at the back . " Would you call a taxi for me , Ned ? Tell ' em in a hurry . " Ned hesitated , his eyes following Sherry thoughtfully , and then he shrugged and turned back to the telephone . When Sherry came out again , his hair combed and face washed , he got immediately into his raincoat , his hands quick and precise over the belt buckle . " Said they 'd come , but 'll take awhile , " Ned called to him . " Bad weather , cabs all out . Do n't like to come way out here back a town anyway . " The hell , I do n't want to drive . I 'll have to wait . " Sherry waited over another drink at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait under Ned 's surreptitious worried watchful eyes . Sherry sat silently , smoking continually , his face preoccupiedand his body tensed , as though he did his waiting with rigid control against a consuming energy to be off and about some urgent business . And around him the room was warm and still . The bottles and the long mirror and the pyramids of polished glasswareglittered under the lights , and outside the shuttered windows the rain fell quietly and steadily . Just as the door began to open at last , under the cab driver 's hand , Sherry was down from his stool , a bill dropped behind him upon the shining bar top . " Thanks , " he called back . " You 're a good guy , Ned . You 're the best . " He stepped out into the wet inky blackness of the night and skirted a mud puddle just outside the door with slight overdeliberateness , as he strode to the taxi cab . " You know Marney 's downtown ? " he said to the driver , over thep237slamming of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mac , if you can make it in a hurry . " " Yes , sir ! " t The driver earned his dollar , with the cab speeding along through traffic and darkness and the heavy mist . Sherry paid him off and crossed the strip of wet sidewalk to the blue-painted door underneath the gaseous blue neon sign . The large dimly lighted inner room at Marney 's was almost empty . Sherry hesitated , and then Marney himself bore down upon him , bright yellow hair and red angular face above his correct black dinner jacket . " Sherry Lockbridge ! Well , how about that ! " Marney 's voice was delighted , and his loud laughter boomed , as he caught hold of Sherry 's arm with friendly geniality . " Have n't seen you down here in a coon 's age , Sherry . What 's the matter , is n't Marney 's fancy enough for you after the Mocambo ? " Marney laughed again . Sherry stopped , unhurriedly pulling his arm away from him . " Save it , Marney , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nella around ? " " She 's around . Sure , Nell 's around , " Marney said , easily . " Come on , have a drink with me . I have n't had a chance to really set down and chew the fat with you since you been back . " " A drink I could use , " Sherry said , reasonably . " But tell Nella I 'm here , will you do that ? " " Sure , sure . " Marney guided him along again between the tables to a booth against the wall , and then slid in upon the blue-leather seat across from him , his face pleased and smiling . " Sherry Lockbridge ! " Marney said , reminiscently , leaning over his folded arms upon the table top . " By God , Sherry Lockbridge ! And now they tell me you 're gettin ' to be a big man out there on the coast ! " There was no mistaking the shine of malice there in his paleblueeyes for an instant , and then he said quickly , " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Sherry . That was tough . That was real tough . "  | " Yeah . " Marney 's eyes darted away , toward the entrance to the room , and he got up quickly , unfolding his long body out of the booth . " Got ta see that man , " he said rapidly . " Be right back . Order what you want , it 's on the house . " When the white-jacketed waiter came up to the table , Sherry said , " The boss is buying . That 's Scotch and water , Mac . Look , is Nella around ? " " Nell Schirmer ? I seen her around here awhile ago . I can find out , " the waiter said with total disinterest , as he turned away . Sherry waited , his brown hands motionless upon the table top , beaded water drops shining in his hair and over his raincoat . A hand came to rest upon his shoulder , suddenly , and a throaty female voice said , " Why , look who 's here ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your lonesome . " Sherry turned his head leisurely to look up at her . It was the tall girl with the long hennaed hair and the overly made-up face . This time she wore street clothes , with a shiny transparent raincoat over the dark suit underneath . " I bet you do n't even remember me ! " She waggled her preposterouslylong black eyelashes at him coyly . " Sure , I remember you , " Sherry said . " Sit down , Annie . Take a load off your feet . " She sat down on the edge of the seat across from him , perching gingerly in her wet clothing , holding her dripping umbrella out away from her . " Jeez , what a night ! " she said , cheerfully . " This keeps up , there wo n't be any crowd and maybe we wo n't have to do an early show . Would n't that be the nuts ? " " Look , is Nella here ? " Sherry said , patiently . " Nell ? " The girl 's voice cooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just this minute got here myself . " Just then the waiter returned to the table and Sherry looked up at him quickly and questioningly . " Nell 's left , " he said . " Want me to mix it ? " You know where she went ? "  | " Home , I guess , " the waiter answered with his total lack of enthusiasm . " Said she left quite awhile ago . " Sherry was silent , his face preoccupied again . " Give the lady one of what she 's drinking , " he said absently , after a moment . " Rum and Coke , Chris , " Annie said . She brightened perceptibly , and leaned closer to Sherry across the table . " Too bad you missed Nell , honey , " she said . " This is no kind a night to be settin ' around somewhere all by your lonesome . I know just how you feel . I 'm a real good friend a Nell 's and I would n't want no friend a hers to be settin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see , I remember your name , too ! " " Yeah . " Sherry searched for a nickel in a handful of change . " Look , Annie , would you do something for me ? Do you know Nella 's telephone number at home ? " " Sure , I know Nell 's number , " she said , half-suspiciously . " Will you call her up for me , Annie ? " Sherry said . " Tell her I 'm down here and I wanta see her . Will you do that , honey ? " " Well , for crisesakes , " Annie said , distantly , her face pouting . " What 's the matter with you callin ' her up yourself if you want her so bad ? " Sherry took her hand on the table top , dropping the coin into her palm and closing her fingers with the long painted nails over it . " Go ahead , Annie , be a good kid . If I call and her sister should happen to answer , she 'll talk my ears off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nella for me and tell her what I told you , okay ? " " Aw , all right , the hell with it ! " Annie said resignedly , propping her umbrella against the partition between the booths . " I 'll phone from the little-girl 's room . Hang onto my drink till I get back . " Sherry waited again , and a moment later , she returned , threading her way back between the empty tables . " I guess you 're just outa luck tonight , honey , " she said as she sat down . " Nell was n't there . Her sister did n't know where she was ; she thought she was down here . " " Thanks , Annie . You 're a good kid . " Sherry slid off the low seat onto his feet.  | " Take another raincheck , baby , " he said . " I have to beat it . " " Aw , what 's your hurry , Sherry ? " She began . " Hang around awhile and we can . . . " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm about Sherry 's shoulders genially . " Sherry , where you goin ' , kid ? Sit down , sit down ! " " Some other time , " Sherry said , evenly . " I got some business to attend to . " " Naw ! " Marney mourned . " Come on now and have a drink with me . Listen , I thought you wanted to see Nell . Do n't you want to wait for Nell ? " " She 's left . You know where she went ? " " Sure , I know where she went , " Marney said , heartily . " She 'll be right back . Set down , Sherry . She just went out on a little errand for me , she 'll be right back . " Sherry hesitated , his eyes narrowing and concentrated on Marney'sbland red face , and then he sat down again . " If Nella 's coming back , I 'll wait , " he said , reasonably . " Hell , I 'll even buy you a drink . What you drinkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently , but Marney paused , staring down accusingly at the blue-leather upholstered seat . " Why don'tcha look where you 're settin ' in that goddamn wet coat ? " he said to her , crossly . " You 're gettin ' water all over everything . I could ruin my pants settin ' in that water ! " " Well , ' scuse me ! " she said , angrily . " ' Scuse me for livin ' ! " She got up quickly , knocking against the table , and with a handkerchief from her pocket she scrubbed indignantly at a microscopic bit of moisture on the blue upholstery . " I was just leavin ' anyway , " she said . " It 's gettin ' a little too crowded around here to suit me . Thanks , Sherry . I 'll see you around . " Marney laughed loudly after her retreating back , and then he said , his voice lowering and confidential , " That Annie 's a character ! Wonderful lay though , wonderful ! Maybe I could fix you up , Sherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . The waiter came and went , and Marney watched Sherry 's remote contained face , with his own face pleased and interested . " Well ,  |p241Sherry  Lockbridge , by God ! What was it again you said your racket was out there in California ? " " I did n't say , " Sherry said , unhurriedly . " That 's right , you did n't , did you ! " Marney 's laughter boomed . " How long you figurin ' on staying out here , Sherry ? Like I told you before , you gon na be around , maybe you and I can do a little business . " Where 's your piano player tonight ? " Sherry said . " I like to hear that guy . He 's not so good but he 's got nice ideas . " Marney turned around to stare accusingly at the deserted piano for a second , and then he hunched forward , lowering his voice again confidentially . " That goddamn piano player takes too many nights off around here . You know , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano player . " " When you think Nella 'll be back here ? " Sherry 's voice was patientlyinsistent . " Relax , take it easy , Sherry . She 'll be back in awhile . Keep your shirt on . " Marney lifted his glass in a toast , his eyes sliding quickly away on one of their vigilant circuits of the room , and then back to Sherry again . " Well , Sherry , here 's to us , kid , how about that ! Sherry Lockbridge , by God ! Do n't seem like any time at all we was havin ' our last drink together , a couple a punk kids with neither one of us hardly more'n the shirt to our backs ! Just a couple a squirt kids , but with a lot bigger ideas than the rest of the little squirts around town , how about that ? Yeah , you was always a great one for ideas , Sherry , and that 's a fact . This town was n't big enough to hold you them days . " " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sampled his drink . " Oh , it 's a nice little town , if you like this small-town stuff . I did n't then , nor I sure as hell do n't now . " Marney sat so still for a second that he scarcely seemed to breathe , then his big body slowly relaxed and he was laughing again . " Yeah , I suppose this seems like a real hick town to a big operatorlike you , Sherry . Now me , I like it here . Funny how those thingsp242go . You take Nell now , she likes it here too . You know , Sherry , I do n't think Nell is ever gon na leave here . " Sherry stared at him for a moment , his tawny eyes as blank and unwinking as a jungle cat 's . " Is that a fact , sweetheart , " he said , softly . Marney looked back , his pale-blue eyes unwavering . " Yup , that 's a fact , all right . I 'm no gambler the way you are , Sherry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " The silence was electric between them , and then suddenly Marneywas laughing again loudly , unfolding himself up from the booth . " Better say hello to those folks just comin ' in , " he said , genially . " Any customers swim in here tonight outa this rain , they get a drink on the house . Stick around , Sherry , I 'll be back . " Sherry watched him go , smoking and sipping steadily at his drink , executing all of it with careful exactitude and no single wasted motion . The time passed , and Sherry waited , his eyes turning toward the entranceway time after time . Several more parties of customers straggled in , but the room remained substantially empty , with Marney'sbright-yellow head shining first at one table and then another . Between trips , the waiters loitered at one end of the bar where the musicians and bartenders had congregated , all of them talking togetheridly . There was no sound or presence of the falling rain outside , and the fabric of Sherry 's raincoat slowly dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she came down the steps , but did not recognize her . She hesitated , and then walked on a little farther , uncertainly , her eyes searching the room . Sherry watched her idly , and then suddenly he knew . It was Tude , unwontedly grown up , in a dark dress , with a short black coat of Nell 's over it , and her shiny pale hair done in elaborate curls and pinned to the top of her head above her carefully made-up face . She saw him almost at the instant of his recognition of her , and while he stared at her in a kind of stunned fascination , she walked toward him swiftly , in among the tables . She stood beside him for a moment , her eyes dark and frightenedp243and wary , in spite of all the brave pencil and mascara , and then she slipped into the seat across from him without a word . Sherry was motionless , even his lips hardly moving at all when he spoke to her , finally . " What you doing down here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . " " You do n't have to talk to me , " Tude said , humbly , her eyes pleading . " I just want to sit with you . I 'm real scared and  --  and lonesome tonight . I just want to sit next to you . " " I 'll come see you tomorrow , " he said . " I promise I 'll come talk to you tomorrow . " Tude 's lower lip quivered a little . " Why you keep sayin ' that ? I said you did n't have to talk to me . It ai n't gon na hurt you any for me just to sit here , is it ? " Sherry made her no answer , and after a moment or two , Tude moved uneasily on the seat , worrying the shiny cheap black plastic purse in her small hands , opening and closing the gold-colored catch at the top of it with little metallic snaps . " I talked to that girl when she called on the telephone , " Tude said , finally . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookin ' for Nell and everything . I wanted to see you so bad I did n't stop for nothin ' . I guess Leota 's really sore at me . I come fast as I could in a taxi cab . It cost a terrible lot a money . " Sherry dug his hand into his pocket . " I 'll get another cab , and you go home now , kid , " he said , quietly . " I ca n't talk to you tonight . You ought to know that . I 'm still feeling bad for Fay , I 'm  --  I 'm liquored up a little . I 'll come see you tomorrow . " The tears were bright in Tude 's eyes , but she did not shed them . " You the one that 's doin ' all the talking , " she said . " I would n't talk to you . I just want to sit with you because I 'm feelin ' so bad and lonesome . " She looked down to the nervous clicking of the purse clasp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face strange and unfamiliar to him , with her hair pinned up , thinner and more delicate , and older , suddenly . " Jesus , it all has to happen at once , " Sherry said , softly . " All I need 's a little time . Why does it all have to come at me at once ! "  |p244Tude  drew herself smaller on the seat , and did not look at him . And then Marney swooped down upon them , his face beaming and affable . " Well , Sherry , how about that ! I guess I do n't have to worry about how you 're doin ' , boy ! She 's nice , too . Very , very nice . Are n't you gon na introduce me ? " Sherry ignored him , tipping up his glass , his eyes staring ahead of him . Marney laughed , his eyes moving appreciatively from Tude 's shining blonde hair down to her small firm breasts under the thin dark fabric of her dress . " I guess if you was my girl I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to her , gallantly . " You mind if I sit down ? " " I do n't care , " she said , the tiny little pleased note in her voice , and the quick furtive glance to Sherry . She slid over and Marney sat down beside her , with the lordly careless beckoning wave of his arm toward a waiter . " How about another round here ? How about a drink for the young lady ? " Sherry roused himself momentarily from his private preoccupation . " Young lady 's just leaving , " he said , flatly . " Aw , she just got here , " Marney protested , his eyes upon Tude . " I saw her when she come in just a minute ago . I says to myself , What 's a beautiful blonde like that doin ' all by herself ? What 's the matter with all the guys around this town , lettin ' a doll baby like that keep herself company on a rainy night ? I says . . . " Under Marney 's admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her back straight , her chin tilting , and a new firmness in her voice . " Why , I would n't mind havin ' a beer before I leave , " she said . " I guess I 'm not in so big a hurry as all that . " " That 's the girl , " he said . Tude brought a cigarette out of her purse , and Marney hurried to hold his lighter for her . She puffed , her long lashes curled downp245over her eyes , her carefully manicured pink fingernails light upon his hand . Through the smoke then , she smiled at him , tentatively . " I guess you 're Marney . Everybody calls me Tude ; it 's a kind a nickname . " " Tude , how about that ! " he said , appreciatively . " That 's a cute name . By God , Sherry , where you been keepin ' her ? She 's real cute . " Sherry , lost in his vast inner preoccupation , paid no attention to them at all . Marney shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I bet old Sherry wishes I 'd go roll my hoop , whatcha bet ? " he said in a loud stage whisper . " Well , what 's he think anyway ? He ca n't expect to keep a cute baby doll like you all to himself ! " Tude smiled again , and touched her fingers lightly to her smooth pale hair , drawn up from the nape of her neck . " It 's awful quiet around here tonight , " she said . " Is n't the band gon na play ? " Marney consulted his wrist watch elaborately . " The band is gon na play in exactly two minutes and fourteen seconds ! Anything for you , baby , anything your little heart desires ! " Tude giggled softly . On the bandstand , the musicians already took their places , jokingamong themselves , tuning instruments softly . Sherry lighted a cigarette and for the first time his superb co-ordination was wrong , and he carefully dropped the burned match to the table cloth on the far side of the glass ash tray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering of peoplebecame more festive . Tude leaned forward , her face eager , her foot tapping out the beat against the floor . " You like to dance ? " Marney said , amusedly . " Okay , baby doll , how about you come and have a dance with me ? " Her face was immediately ecstatic . " Gee , I 'd love to , " she said breathlessly , and then she turned to Sherry , quickly and halfdoubtfully . Marney leaned forward to him across the table top . " How about that , Sherry ? " he said . " How about it , kid ? You mind if I have a dance with your girl friend here ? "  |p246Sherry  looked back at him unwinkingly . " Go ahead and dance , honey , " he said , his voice very soft . " Or water-ski to Waikiki , or drop dead , it 's all the same to me . " " How about that ! " Marney said , delightedly , and then clicked his tongue chidingly . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marney ! Come on , down the hatch , baby , and let 's you and me dance . Tude hurriedly slipped off her coat as Marney arose , pulling out the table a little for her to follow . She came out with perfect assurancenow , elegantly groomed from head to toe . The smart black dress she wore was Nell 's , and the black high-heeled pumps on her feet , the wide sparkling bracelet on her wrist , and her heavily scented perfume . " Gee , this is real swell , " Tude said happily , lifting her face to Marney 's great height above her , as they walked off together toward the dance floor . Sherry sat where he was , paying no attention to their going , or the loud music , or anything else about him in the room . A few minutes later , the tall girl with the hennaed hair drifted by his table , changed now into a gold-colored dinner dress , and a fresh layer of cosmetics over her face . " Well , look who 's still here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find Nell ? Hey , what 's the matter , honey ? " Sherry looked up , only his eyes moving . " Hi , Annie . Sit down . Take a load off your feet . " She sat down across from him , her eyes searchingly upon his face in the dim light , and then suddenly she slid all the way around the circular table to sit close beside him . " What 's the matter , Sherry ? " she said , lifting her voice over the music . " You got the blues tonight ? " " Flag down a waiter for us , will you ? " he said . She signaled to the waiter , and then slipped her hand through Sherry 's arm , moving her head close to his shoulder . " Aw , come on , cheer up , Sherry , " she said , coaxingly . " You really got the blues or something . " " Yeah , I got the blues . " She snuggled closer against him . " Aw , what 's the trouble ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what 's the trouble , honey ? " " The thing is , " Sherry said , reasonably , " I did n't love her , but I never wanted her to die . Christ , the months and the months of it , and there was n't anything I could do to help her . She claimed I was to blame , on account of the abortion , you know , but the doc never said that . The doc said they do n't know about those things . But that 's what she always said though , that it was the abortion and that 's why she made me promise the way she did . Christ , I do n't see how it could be , women do that all the time , but that 's what she always said , that it was the abortion . " Annie made little crooning sounds of comfort in her throat , her face totally bewildered . " I wanted to ask Nella about it , " Sherry said , softly . " I waited , but she did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about it , Annie . You tell me , Annie . " " Whatever it is , it 's all over with and you got to forget it , " Annie said soothingly . " You just got to forget it , honey . Put it outa your mind , see ? You just got to not think about it any more . " The music stopped just then and Tude and Marney returned to the table . Tude 's face was pleased and glowing , but once she saw Annie beside Sherry she stopped abruptly , her hands lifting to her hips . " Well , looks like we got some company , " she said , distantly , her eyes busy over every detail of Annie 's face and hair and dress . " Tude , meet Annie , " Marney said , easily , reaching his arm about her shoulders . " Now take it easy , baby doll . Annie just works here . Why , Annie 's just like part of the furniture around here , are n't you , Annie ? " She moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . " Stay with me . You 're a good kid , Annie . " Tude hesitated , her face wary and unfriendly , but finally she sat down , and Marney after her . While Marney held his ornate lighter to Tude 's cigarette , Annie stared back at her , her face equally unfriendly , her one hand slippingup to adjust her hair and then the heavy clips set with shiny green stones that held the low wide neckline of her dress at either side.  |p248Marney  summoned the hovering waiter with his sweeping gesture of his arm . " Another drink all around , and do n't forget the beet for the young lady . " " The young lady 's had enough beer , " Sherry said , his voice thin and distinct over the words . " Aw , do n't be that way , Sherry , " Marney began , but Tude interruptedhim . " If Sherry says I should n't , I guess I better not , " she said , primly . Once the waiter was gone , Marney looked from Sherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . " How about that , " he marveled . " I wish a doll a mine would do what I tell her , when I tell her . You always do what people tell you , baby doll ? " Tude giggled . " Naw ! But I do what Sherry tells me . " She paused , the modest lowering of her lashes for a moment , and then lifting them again , her brown eyes very wide as she said it in the silence at the table . " Sherry and me are engaged . We 're gon na get married . " For an instant , Marney 's face was genuinely thunderstruck , and then he was roaring with laughter , rocking back and forth upon the seat , his red face reddening still more . " How about that , how about that ! " he crowed . " Honey , this is wonderful ! Sherry , why did n't you tell me , kid ? You 're a lucky guy , boy ! Baby doll , this is wonderful ! " Tude smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherry paid him no attention at all , his face perfectly remote as he lifted his glass again from the table . Beside him , Annie sat very still , only her eyes moving quickly and alertly . Marney sat up finally , the tears of his laughter shining on his cheeks . " No kiddin ' , I think it 's terrific , " he said . " I think it 's really terrific . Sherry , how come you did n't tell me ? You 're a lucky guy , by God . All I can say is , you saw her first , kid ! " Tude stole a quick anxious look at Sherry then for the first time . But Sherry did not speak , and there was no emotion of any kind on his face . " By God , this calls for champagne , " Marney said , his voice unsteadywith delight . " Champagne on the house to drink to Sherry and the baby doll ! "  | " Why you wanta get champagne for ? " Tude said , practically . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't drink no champagneanyway . I 'd rather have a bottle a beer . " Marney 's laughter boomed again , and then he said , " Aw , come on , Sherry . Two bottles a beer is n't gon na hurt her . This is a cele-bration ! " Sherry made no objection , and he translated the order to the waiter . " And bring out the best damn corsage we got in the house ! This young lady 's engaged ! " Tude was smiling ecstatically at last , and her hands were suddenlyshaking uncontrollably as she held her cigarette . Marney shook his head incredulously , and then leaned across the table , his eyes darting from Sherry to Tude and back again . " How about that ! By God , you coulda knocked me over with a feather . This is terrific . No kiddin ' , I think it 's wonderful . Well , look , when you kids plan on gettin ' married anyway ? I suppose you have to wait a little . . . " He paused delicately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tude took a deep breath , the smile dazzling on her face . " Oh , I do n't know , " she said . " We not gon na wait very long , that 's sure . " The modest lowering of her lashes again before the revelation . " We got a reason . " Marney stared a moment , and then rocked helplessly with laughteragain , a silent laughter this time , soundlessly convulsed with it until his face was purpled . Annie moved then , undoing the little green sequined evening bag she carried , and beginning a frantic scrabbling into its contents . Marney sat up , his eyes popping , his face immensely keen and stimulated , his voice almost breathless when he spoke . " Oh , baby doll , you 're wonderful ! You sure you wo n't have champagne ? Why , hell , this is a double celebration now ! Sherry , congratulations , kid . No kiddin ' , I think this is all really terrific . I mean it ! And you know what I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a hell of an idea ... " Annie flung down her bag angrily , spilling its contents of compactand keys and lipstick out upon the table . She caught holdp250of Sherry 's arm , shaking at him furiously with all her strength . " Gim me dimes or nickels or something ! " she said , her voice rapid and choking . " For crisesakes , do n't just set there ! Come on , gim me nickels ! " Sherry moved obediently , drawing out the handful of change from his pocket , and Annie bent over it , scrabbling up the coins into her hand . She stood up then , pushing at the table impatiently . " Come on , lemme outa here , " she said tersely , to Tude . " I got business . They made way for her , Marney and Tude , and she was gone , almost running . She went to the powder room , to the telephone attached to the wall there . She fed the coins down the slot , one after another , flipping the pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dial . She asked for Nell , time after time , and each time received the same negative answer . When the last coin was gone , and the same answer received , she dropped the directory to the floor , resting her forehead for a moment against the black mouthpiece of the telephone , her eyes closed , her face sick and furious . " Oh , goddamn it to hell , " she said , softly . She was up instantly and out of the powder room , the door swingingafter her . She leaned across the checkroom counter , calling out urgently to the frizzy-haired blonde girl who sat on a stool there , yawning over a true-story magazine . " Lorene , listen . You know where Nell went ? This is something terrible important . Do you know where Nell is ? Did she go somewherewith Jerry or what ? Where can we get hold a Nell quick ? " " Gee , I do n't know ! " The hat-check girl got up from her stool , her face alarmed . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he doin ' something he should n't ? Why , I would n't know where in the world we could get hold a Nell tonight . Did you try home ? Ai n't she to home ? " " Gim me some change , " Annie said rapidly . " I 'll pay you back . There 's some other places I could call . " She was gone again , back toward the powder room , and the hatcheckgirl called after her , " Annie , what is it ? Should I get Tony ? "  | " No , never mind . " She made her last futile telephone calls , and left the powder room with the urgency draining away from her . She drifted about by the door for a moment , her face defeated , and then she slowly walked back to the booth against the wall . Tude was sitting close to Sherry now , her hand through his arm , her face transfigured with some high excitement , a great spread of gardenias fastened to the shoulder of her coat . " Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her , his voice keyed high , all the words tumbling out together . " I had a terrific idea while you was gone , a really hell of an idea ! We 're gon na drive the kids down to get married right tonight . How about that ! " " Yup , " Annie said wearily as she sat down beside him . " What become a my drink ? Yeah , that 's one hell of an idea , all right ! " " What 's the matter with it ? " Marney said rapidly . " This rain , we got no business around here anyway . The kids are ready and willing , we got the flowers , I can scare up a ring , Tony can drive us over the state line in less'n an hour , I know a judge . . . What 's the matter with that idea ? " " Why , a couple a things , " Annie said , her voice jerking with anger . " For one thing , the poor guy 's split to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' married to who or what ! Look at him , he 's stupefied ! He 's just one of them quiet drunks that it hardly shows on , that 's all . Look at him ! " She leaned forward quickly as she spoke , passing her hand back and forth rapidly close in front of Sherry 's blank , unwinking eyes . Sherry reached up and caught her hand unhurriedly . " How you doin ' , Annie ? " he said , perfectly distinctly . " You 're a good kid , Annie . " The smile was suddenly gone from Tude 's face . " Listen here , why you tryin ' to stick your nose into this ? " she said sharply . " I guess we know whether we wanta get married or whether we do n't , without any help from you . You keep your big mouth outa this right now , or believe me , you 'll wish you had ! " " Aw , take it easy , " Annie said , disgustedly . " Do n't strain yourself , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way you feel about it , doll , " Marneyp252said , the elation in his voice undaunted . " If you do n't wanta ride down with us , why , say so . Tony and I make just as good witnesses without you . I just figured you might wanta keep me company on the ride down . I waited special to ask you , doll . Tony 's out front with the car right now . " Annie made a little snorting sound of disgust and put down her glass hard . She leapt up and went to Sherry , leaning over him so that her face was close to his . " Sherry , listen to me ! You know what 's goin ' on around here ? You gon na let him marry you off to this baby-faced octopus ? Do you know what you 're doin ' at all ? " He brought his eyes slowly into focus upon her , while Tude hugged his arm fiercely tighter . " S'all right , Annie , " he said clearly . " The hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I promised her , poor kid . So I 'll do it and the hell with it . Do n't you worry , Annie . " " Oh , for crisesakes ! " Annie flung herself away from him , and kept on walking blindly , off in the direction of the bar without once looking back . Marney sprang up , laughing . " Well , come on , let 's go , " he crowed delightedly . " What are we waitin ' for ? We do n't wanta have to get my friend the judge outa bed , how about that ! " He lifted Tude out of the booth with a flourish , but when he took hold of Sherry 's arm , Sherry moved it unhurriedly away . Sherry got to his feet under his own power , and then stopped , staring down reflectively at the littered table top . There was part of a drink left at his place , and one full glass that he had not yet touched . He chose the tallest empty glass on the table leisurely , painstakingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his part drink and the full one both into it , the glasses clinking together unsteadily . They were gone then , Marney and Tude first , with dazzled excitedfaces , walking quickly and eagerly , his hand under her arm . And Sherry trailing after them impassively , carrying his glass very carefully in his hand.  |p253It  was after noon , the next day , whenSherry awakened . He awoke with the aching head , the queasy stomach , and the raw sensitized nerve-ends of a gigantic hangover . He stirred a little on the hard thin mattress , the springs of the bed squeaking under him , and opened his eyes reluctantly to an unfamiliar hot dim room , a shabby second-rate hotel bedroom . For a moment he struggled to orient himself , a whole series of unrelated bits of remembrance rising in his mind quickly , one after another , like bubbles in a glass . And then he felt the warm relaxed leg against his under the sheet , and turned his head on the pillow . There was a tangle of pale-blonde hair inches from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed with the covers falling away from his bare body . He stared , the pain splitting in his head , the nausea rising in his belly , and Tude rolled over , smiling up at him out of the tumbled bed coverings . " I thought you was gon na sleep all day , " she said . " I been layin ' here waitin ' and waitin ' for you to wake up . Ai n't you hungry ? I 'm about starved to death ! "  | " I knew I had a load on last night , " he said , wonderingly . " Now I know I must have been really stinkin ' ! " Tude kept on smiling . " Why you wanta talk like that ? Do n't you remember ? Do n't you remember ? " She reached her hand luxuriously upward and dug beneath the pillow , smoothing the stiff paper lovingly in her fingers , before she held it out to him . " We got married last night ! Here 's the certificate they gim me ! " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sherry stared , his face suddenly become pallid and wet with sweat . Through the open window the brisk sound of traffic and tootinghorns from the street below rose loud in the silence of the room . " I never been so happy in my whole life , honey , " Tude said , her voice soft and triumphant . " I 'm so happy I just feel like bustin ' out and yellin ' or something ! " Sherry stared , and then spun around , flinging his legs out over the side of the bed . But as though his energy spent itself in that single exertion , he sat still there , his shoulders slumping , his head dropping forward into his hands . Tude watched him , smiling contentedly , for a long time . She rolled over closer to him finally , her body cuddling and curled , so that her knees were pressed against his back . " Why , I was just thinkin ' while I was layin ' here this morning , " she said , happily . " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get fixed up now we 're married and you 'd be right with me and everything . So I was just thinkin ' . We could go to a doctor and I 'd get fixed up like you wanted me to , and then we could leave for Hollywood right away ! " Sherry sat very still , his head slowly lifting , his shoulders tensing . From the corridor outside there was a sound of a slamming door , and passing footsteps and loud careless voices . The sounds dwindled away , and Sherry got up from the bed slowly and turned to face her , his body erect in the white shorts . " So this is what you had in mind all along , " he said softly . " By Jesus , you suckered me good , did n't you ! I 'm a real sharp character lately . I walked right into it for you ! " " Why you wanta get mad ? " Tude began . " I just said that . . "  | " Shut up ! " he said , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty red carpeting to the chair where his clothing was flung and searched through pockets methodically for cigarettes . He coughed over the first inhalation of smoke in his throat , and walked to the window , flinging up the tattered shade to the sun and heat of the day . The minutes passed , and Tude moved uneasily in the bed , lifting herself up onto her elbow . " Why you want to act mad at me ? " she said , defensively . " We 're married now , ai n't we ? I got the certificate right here , and ... " " Yeah , you got the certificate right there . " Sherry turned around abruptly , his face controlled , his voice measured . " You 've got it , all right ! Baby , you 've had it ! There 's a couple of things you may just as well get straight right now , the sooner the better . You listen careful to what I 'm going to say because this is how it 's going to be . You 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place else , ever . You 're going to stay right here where you started . You 're not gon na have any abortion , either . You 're going to have a baby , and I 'm going to stay with you and see that you do . And once it 's born , I 'm gettin ' the hell out of here . I 'm gettin ' the hell out of here alone , and then I hope to Christ I never have to look at you again as long as I live . You understand all that ? " Out of the silence , Tude said uncertainly , " You 're just mad right now . But you 'll get over it . You 'll . . . " " Do n't hold your breath until I do , " Sherry said . " Now shut up and get your clothes on . We got a lot of things to do . " He began by collecting all the money out of his pockets and counting it thoughtfully the second time . He deliberated over it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blades and shaving cream to be brought to the room . He showered in the dingy bathroom , and shaved rapidly before the dirty speckled mirror . Tude was ready first and waited for him sullenly , her borrowed finery a little bedraggled , and no longer so becoming to her since her hair had refused to stay in place in the elaborate curls on top of her head and hung instead childishly loose and soft upon her shoulders.  |p256At  the door , Sherry said to her shortly , " Take those damn flowers off . I ca n't stand the stink of ' em . " Tude jerked the wilted yellowed limp gardenias from her dress and flung them away angrily in the direction of the wastebasket . They left the cheerless untidy room together . Downstairs , Sherry took her into the hotel coffee shop and left her seated at a table there with the menu spread open in front of her . Back in the garish lobby , he conferred with the desk clerk , and paid him the additional money necessary to secure the room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood at the bar to drink the one shot of whisky neat . Then he went back to the coffee shop , walking quickly and purposefully , with his look of good grooming in spite of rumpled clothing , his bloodshot eyes and the little nick at the deep cleft of his chin where he had cut himself in shaving with not quite steady hands . He drank coffee and tomato juice , while Tude finished her meal , and then they went out into the stifling crowded downtown street . " I 'm the nearest thing to broke , " he said to her briefly , " so we may as well start saving money right now and take the bus . " They walked the five or six blocks to the bus stop silently , Sherry walking rapidly and Tude hurrying along beside him , her shiny black purse swinging in her hand . Once they reached it , they waited in the middle of a little crowd of people at the edge of the sidewalk , the hot sun pouring down upon them . The bus came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Sherry 's face was pale again and glistening with perspiration . He took off his coat , folding it neatly together across his knees , and rolled his white shirt sleeves to his elbows . Over the sound of the bus motor , Tude began , " Why we have to ... ? " Sherry cut her off in mid sentence . " Look , just keep quiet , will you ? " The rattling bus made interminably slow progress with the jolting stops and starts at street corners . But at last they alighted in front of the filling station at the foot of the hill , there on the outskirts of town . Sherry set off immediately up the dirt road away from thep257highway , with Tude floundering along beside him , the sharp high heels of her pumps sinking into the moist dirt under foot . When they reached the top of the hill , he said to her rapidly , " You go on to Schirmers ' and pack up whatever belongs to you while I get my things . We 'll have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I get in the house , so hurry it up . When you 're ready bring your things and come out in the yard . And for Christ 's sakes , take off that dress and stuff of Nella 's ! " They separated in the road , Tude going the one direction , runninglightly , her hair flying , and Sherry the other , marching along steadily on a long diagonal across the thick grass of the dooryard , his coat slung over his shoulder . He crossed the porch and on into the stuffy interior of the house . There were sounds of a meal in progress from the kitchen , and then Aunt Ethel 's voice , lifted and anxious , " Oh , Sherry ! Is that you , Sherry ? " " Sit still , " he said quickly . " I 'll be out in a minute . " He went first to the telephone on the table in the living room , dialing rapidly , and his voice pitched softly into the mouthpiece as he gave the address for the taxi cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the telephone back on the cradle . " Oh , Sherry , where 've you been ? I 've been so worried about you , " she began , and from the kitchen , Pa called , " Why , say , Sherwood . . . " " Just a minute , Pa , " Sherry called back , and then to Aunt Ethel as he hugged her tightly for a moment , " I 'm all right , Ethel . Go back and eat your lunch now . I got ta go upstairs a minute , I 'll be right down . " He went up the stairs rapidly , and across the hall into the room that had been Fay 's . He found the suitcase in the back of the closet . He spread the big khaki-colored canvas-and-leather bag open upon the bed and filled it quickly with no attempt at packing , jackets and slacks and neckties from the hangers in the closet , several pairs of shoes , and then opened the drawers of the bureau carefully and quietly for the shirts and socks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then stood still a moment for the first time , wiping sweat from his face with his hand . He carried the bag swiftly out of the room and down the stairs , leaving it beside the door as he walked on to the kitchen . " You 're just in time , Sherry . You sit right down now , " Aunt Ethel said , fondly , beginning the quick moving and shifting of plates and dishes to make room for him at the table . " I 've already eaten , Ethel . Sit still now . " And then Pa said , his voice a little distant and disapproving , " Why , old man Duffy 's called here two or three times . He wants to know how you want to pay the rest of the funeral money , Sher-wood . " Before Sherry could speak , the telephone rang , an insistent buzzingthrough the house , and Aunt Ethel hurried up from her chair . " Why , I wonder who that is . . . " her voice trailing after her from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee cup . " Course I told him all about how you was fixed financially , Sherwood . I told him you 'd give him a check for the whole thing right away . " Sherry 's hands jumped with the match and cigarette , and for an instant he closed his eyes , standing beside the table there in the hot littered kitchen . " You 're wrong , Pa . If Duffy 's willing to give me any time , I 'll take all the time he 's got . I 'll sure as hell need it . " Pa put his cup down hard in the saucer and looked up , his face startled and frightened . " For Christ 's sakes , let 's get something straight right now , Pa , " Sherry said , his voice uneven . " I 'm sick and tired of you talking as if I 've got a lot of money and a business back there in California . I 'm sorry ! If I ever wrote anything in letters home that gave you that idea , I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there , money or anything else . I never did have . For a long time I used to  --  run errands for a guy out there that owned an insurance businessalong with a lot of other things that were n't half so legal . After the Army , I gambled for a living and got along the best I could . Hell , I got nothing out there . All I 've got in the world anywhere is less than thirty bucks in my pocket and the clothes I came outp259here with . That 's the story , Pa , now you know what the score is ! " Pa stared at the table in front of him silently , his face drawn together . Sherry drew a deep breath . " And while I 'm speaking pieces , there 's something else I might as well tell you . You , too , Ethel , I want you to hear this . " Aunt Ethel passed him , walking slowly , her face loose and pale under the rouge . " Margaret just told me , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the paper . Oh , Sherry , I do n't believe it ! " Her voice lifted to a scream . " Sherry , I do n't believe it . Oh , I do n't believe it , I do n't believe it ! " And then she was sobbing in a chair , rocking back and forth over her knees . Pa slowly lifted his head . " I 'm married , Pa , " Sherry said , wearily . " I got married last night to the girl that worked at Schirmers ' . " For a moment the old man stared , and then the tears gushed out of his eyes , and he leapt to his feet . " By Jesus , " he shouted , his voice harsh and unnatural . " By Jesus , we always been decent folks ! Buried your wife one day and married again the next ! Printed right in the paper so everybody can read it . I say we always lived like decent folks ! You 're no son a mine , Sherwood . By Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear me ! " " It 's all right , Pa . I 'm packed and leaving right now . Ethel , do n't cry so , honey . Please , do n't . " And then Sherry spun around suddenly and left the room , bumpingagainst the door frame as he went . " You ought a be thrashed till you did n't forget it ! " Pa shouted after him . " I say you 're no son a mine any more ! " Sherry picked up his bag and strode rapidly across the porch . " I tell you one thing right now , mister ! Duffy 's going to have his money that you owe to him tomorrow , by Jesus . I 'll draw the money out a the bank myself . We always lived like decent folks and I do n't intend . . . " Sherry went down the steps , the bag knocking against his legs . And across the street , Tude had run into the house , her heels clattering across the porch boards and into the hallway.  |p260Nell  's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That you , Tude ? For God sakes , where you been ? " Tude never paused . " Just a minute , " she called back from the stairs . There were voices from Margie 's room , but Tude ran by , unheeding , to her own small room at the end of the hall . Her packing , too , was accomplished in several minutes time . A large cardboard carton hauled out into the middle of the floor , and everything hastily flung into it , clothing and cosmetics , shoes and scarfs and bits of jewelry , all together . She made no attempt to be quiet about it , drawers noisily jerked out and slammed shut again , her feet hurrying back and forth across the floor . She left out sandals and skirt and blouse , and when the bureau and closet were emptied , she changed clothing quickly , leaving Nell 's dress in an untidy heap on top of her unmade bed , with the muddy pumps and the heavy bracelet on top of it . She lugged the cardboard box along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She left it and ran back up again swiftly and lightly , to pick up a stack of motion-picture magazines , two bottles of bright nail polish and her purse . She left the room without hesitation or a single backward look . In the lower hall , she went quickly to the door , but there was no sign of Sherry or of the taxi cab either , across the street . " rude ? " Nell called again from the kitchen . Tude stood still then , catching her breath and smoothing her hair into place . And then slowly she began to smile , her face tilting upward , ecstatic , and she hugged her magazines to her in a little shiver of pure delight , all through her body . She set off for the kitchen , moving swiftly and silently , more dancing than walking . But she entered the room slowly , with her strange dawdling walk . Nell looked up at her briefly from the stool in front of the highchair . The room was hot , and Nell 's face was flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spooned food to a rebellious , sleepy , whining Butch . " Margie and the baby just got home this morning , " she said to Tude , her voice expressionless . " The whole house 's been upside down , that 's why Butch is late . Okay , Tude , let 's have it . Whatp261have you been up to ? Do you know I was about ready to call the police ? " " Is that so ! " Tude said softly . She put her magazines and bottles down upon the kitchen table and sidled nearer , swinging her purse in her hands , her eyes very bright and intently fixed upon Nell 's face . Nell held out the spoon again , and Tude said , " I got news for you . You ca n't tell me what to do no more . I 'm leavin ' here right now for good . " Nell handed the spoon to Butch and stood up from the stool . She sorted a cigarette and matches from her pocket , as she said , slowly , " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa , or what shall I tell him ? " " It 's none a your business any more to tell my old man anything , " Tude said . " It just so happens I 'm married now ! " " Well , fancy that ! " Nell said , her eyes narrowing behind the smoke . Tude moved a step nearer , her eyes never leaving Nell 's face . " Go ahead and act flippy while you got a chance ! I 'm married all right , sweetie ! I 'm married to Sherry Lockbridge ! " Nell stood transfixed , and Tude watched her , unwinkingly , all the while she searched leisurely in her purse . " Here it is , " Tude said , her voice shaking with triumph . " Just to save you callin ' me a liar . Here 's the certificate they gim me , right here . Me and Sherry are married ! What you think a that ! " " I think you 're a goddamn little fool , " Nell said at last , her lips scarcely moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Oh , you 're jealous and I 'm glad ! I 'm tickled to death ! And you know why ? Because I hate you ! " She came closer , the hatred suddenly there naked and alive on her face , an ecstasy of hatred and triumph . " I hate you , Nell Schirmer . I always hated you . You think you 're so smart , with all your swell clothes and stuff , and guys always chasin ' after you . I did n't have nothing . You thought I was just some nothin ' , did n't you ? Well , you wanted Sherry and I wanted Sherry , and who 's the one that got him ? I 'm the one ! What you think a that ! "  | " You better get outa here , " Nell said . " Oh , I 'm goin ' ! " Tude flung out her arms as if she were intoxicatedand beside herself with all the power and delight and triumph and hatred within her . " I 'm goin ' all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm gain ' and I 'm so glad to go . You never gon na tell me what to do no more , or buy me any more stinking little kid kind a clothes , or gim me any more of your old worn-out stuff that was n't good enough for you to have no more . It made you feel so big to do to me like that , did n't it ? You thought how I was just some dirt , some nothin ' ! And now me and your boy friend got married . I 'm the one Sherry likes better'nyou . You think about that ! You just think about it and think about it some more ! " Tude went , scrabbling up her magazines and bottles from the table , and Nell stood quietly where she was . There were all the sounds of Tude 's departure , doors slamming , the cardboard box dragged hastily across the porch , the voices from outside . And finally a roar of a motor , and the car driving away fast down the hill . Nell listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then she sat down on the stool again , as though her legs would hold her no longer . Her face was untouched and remote , but she dropped her head slowly down against the edge of the highchair tray . Butch sat very still , watching her with alert round eyes , and then he reached out one sticky dirty hand and patted her dark hair vigorously . " Da da , " he said , smiling brightly at her . " Da da . "  |p263Sherry  made the second trip and carried the luggage himself from the elevator along the musty corridor to the hotel bedroom . The room was stifling , the late afternoon sun blazing through the window . Sherry jerked the cracked discolored shade to the sill , and mopped the perspiration from his face . " We may as well keep going and mop this all up at once , " he said . " How the hell we get out to your old man 's anyway ? " Tude whirled around from the dim mirror over the dresser , a lipstickin her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't goin ' out there ! I would n't go near that old bastard if . . . " " Quit your yackin ' , my head 's splitting open now . We 'll go because I say so . Now how you get out there ? " " Bus , " she said , unwillingly . " You take the Maple Street bus way out to Bradshaw , and then you ... " " Okay , bring your certificate and let 's get going , " Sherry said . " Jesus , we have to go right this minute ? " she wailed . " I 'm so hot I 'm about ready to die right now . Why we have to go out there any-way ? "  |p264Sherry  paused with the door part way open . " It wo n't be any hotter than this rat hole . This is your party , sweetheart , remember ? So cut out the bitchin ' and come on . " They walked again through the shimmering heat rising from the sidewalks , and rode another stuffy crowded bus with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a barren intersectionbetween the grimy red-brick walls of factory buildings , and Sherry pinched the burning end from a cigarette and carefully returnedthe unsmoked balance of it to the pack , just as they boarded the second bus . They rode again for a long time , jolting over the washboard ruts of the dusty dirt road along the railroad tracks . They left the bus at the end of the line and walked once more , with the wet patches spreading across the back of Sherry 's shirt and under his armpits , and Tude trailing after him , silent and sulking . The tarpaper shack was even less prepossessing by daylight and in the heat of summer . A sagging decrepit little building , with the skeleton derelicts of two automobiles and countless vagrant rusted parts of other ones strewn over the bare dirt in front of it , and the rank green weeds grown waist high behind it , transected by a path to the unpainted wooden outhouse in the rear . Sherry walked directly to the sloping wooden doorstep , his swift fluid stride unbreaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flies upon it , so that they arose for an instant , buzzing angrily , flashing blue-green in the sun , before they settled down again . He rapped on the flimsy rusted screen door , and from the dimnessof the interior , a gruff voice said , " Whatcha want ? " Sherry pushed Tude ahead of him through the doorway and the man sitting at the table looked up at them . He was a tall lanky man with graying dark hair , and dark eyes above a bristling stubble of beard . He sat in a grimy undershirt and trousers , with the faded sweat-stained red-and-yellow loops of his suspenders hanging down from his waistband on either side of his chair . He stared at them incuriously and took another spoonful of beans from the can in his hand , the jagged cut tin of the top still attached to one side of it . Through his chewing , he said , " What she done now ? "  |p265Tude  sucked in her breath angrily , but Sherry spoke first . " My name is Lockbridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your paper , Tude . " The man slowly put down his can beside the loaf of bread and the opened jar of peanut butter on the bare table top in front of him . Tude stepped forward reluctantly , hunting in her open purse , and the man stretched out his hand toward her , his eyes still fixed and unwinking upon Sherry 's face . He took the paper when she offered it , his eyes at last moving away from Sherry . He studied it leisurely , squinting a little , his face impassive , his other hand with the spoon in it finally moving out to dip again into the can of beans . " Jesus , whatsa matter with you ! " Tude screamed at him . " Ca n't you read English or somep'n ? " " Now would n't that frost your balls ! " the man said wonderingly . He dropped the certificate carelessly upon the cluttered table and looked up at Sherry again over the top of Tude 's head . " How 'd she ring you into it anyway ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sherry said , shortly . " She 'll let you know when we do . Come on , Tude , let 's shove . " " Yeah , let 's ! " Tude said , angrily , scooping the certificate up from the table . The man moved then , rising from his chair hastily , hurriedly stretching the suspenders up over his shoulders . " Could have a cup a coffee , well as not , " he said , cajolingly , to Sherry . " Boilin ' right here on the stove . " " Thanks just the same . We got a lot of things to do yet . We 'll see you . He caught Sherry at the door , his hand upon Sherry 's arm , and his voice lowering confidentially . " Things been kinda slow . You know how it is , Lockbridge . I could use a ten , twenty , if you got it to spare . " " That 's too bad , " Sherry said . " I was figurin ' maybe you could let me have twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away here . " The interest slowly faded from the man 's face . " Things is slowp266all over , I guess , " he said . " That 's how it goes . Well , good luck to yuh , bud . Beat the hell outa her when she do n't tend to business , that 's the only way . " Sherry went down the doorstep without a word , walking swiftly away , and Tude stumbled after him , looking back over her shoulder as she went . Once they reached the road , suddenly , without warning , she crouched down , digging stones out of the dirt with frantic clawing hands . Just as Sherry turned , she began to hurl the first of them against the house with all her strength , her face pale and twisting in the bright sun , her voice low and monotonous between her pantingbreaths , repeating it over and over , " Son of a bitch ! Dirty old son of a bitch ! " Sherry swung out instantly with the flat of his hand , slapping the stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get outa here ! " Tude began to weep as he pulled her along with him up the rutted dusty road.  |p267Leota  hurried up the hill from work thatnight , her suit coat folded neatly over her arm , her face reddened from the heat and her exertion . The nearer she came to home , the faster she went , until by the time she reached the porch she was running . Inside the door , she collided with a strange pleasant-faced elderly woman in a short-sleeved white uniform . She mumbled words of apology over her shoulder and ran on , her feet urgent upon the stair steps and along the hallwayto Nell 's room . She rapped on the door and opened it , all with one motion , and burst into the room . Nell looked up at her composedly from the chaise where she sat , clad in a thin yellow-colored robe , the big tiger cat curled at her bare feet . " Hi , Leota . Come set . " Leota 's haste was gone . She went slowly to the chair on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nell , her face suddenly more embarrassed than anything else . " Is n't this heat terrible ? " she said . " Seems like it just came off hot overnight . I wore this heavy suit down to work and I thought I 'd melt before I got home here . "  | " It 's a bitch , " Nell said , cheerfully . " I 'm worn to a frazzle . You know the nurse never got here until an hour ago ? My God , I was running in circles all day . The busy little housewife earns her alimony , that 's a fact . " Leota kept on staring at her , her eyes round in her moist pink face . " Hey , you seen the little nib yet ? " Nell said . " He 's a cutie pie ! See if the nurse 'll let you take a peek at him . You know , I think he 's going to have red hair . Where would he get red hair in this family , I ask you ? Karl says they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Nell stopped . " Okay Leota . Say what you want to say . Do n't sit there with your eyes popping like a zombi . Go on and say it . " Then you do know ? " Leota said , softly . " Sure , I know . Tude handed me the engraved announcement herself . Do n't mind me , go ahead and say what you want to say . " " You mean she was here ! " Leota said , incredulously . " You mean she had the nerve to come here and look you in the face ! " " Oh , she came for her clothes really , " Nell said calmly . " But she did n't mind looking me in the face . You might even say she enjoyed it . " Nell , I ca n't help it , " Leota burst out . " If I was to bite out my tongue , I 'd still have to say it ! After the way you took that  --  that good-for-nothing little tramp in here and did for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fay and the way he chased after you . . . " Nell waved out the match and said through the smoke , " Well , that 's life . " " I just could n't believe it when I first heard it , " Leota said . " After the afternoon paper was out everybody was talking about it at the bank . And here Fay was just buried day before yesterday ! It 's the terriblest thing I ever heard of ! " Leota stopped and then she said , self-consciously , " I felt terribly sorry for Clyde . He could n't look anybody in the face , not any-body . " And after a moment she added , " And you , Nell . Honest , Nell ... "  | " Do n't say it , " Nell said . " You can sit here and say , I told you so ' till you 're blue in the face , but do n't you say you 're sorry for me or I 'll knock your teeth down your throat with this ash tray . Beat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicest thing that 's happened to this family since Butch came along . " " I would n't say I told you so , " Leota said loyally as she went to the door . " But I did tell you so , did n't I ? Anyway , do n't you worry , you 're well rid of both of them . It 's good riddance to bad rubbish , that 's what it is ! " " Sure , " Nell said , cheerfully . " Good riddance to bad rubbish ! Flee is the bird to the mountain ! " The evening was in full swing when Nell arrived at Marney 's that night . She was unusually dressed up for Nell , a slim straplesssummer print dress , vivid white and blue and green , and rhinestones sparkling at her ears and wrists , and others set into the tall heels of her sandals . The hat-check girl greeted her with unwonted effusive affection , and Nell paused to discuss the hot weather with her , her face serene under the girl 's curious sympathetic eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the blare of the orchestra , there was the steady humming of the air-conditioning unit against the heat and humidity outside . The large inner room was crowded , but through the smoke , Nell saw Marney 's yellow head towering at the bar as she walked in that direction . He looked around to her just before she reached him , and stopped short in the middle of whatever he was saying to the bartenderto walk away hastily in the direction of a noisy party at a table on the edge of the dance floor . Nell watched him go , her green eyes amused and unperturbed , and then reached for the glass of cold beer that the bartender had drawn for her . She stood there for several minutes , idly sipping from her glass and talking to the solicitous hovering bartender . Yes , this heat wave was really something , and yes , it was a shame that crowds in this weather meant mostly beer trade , and hey , why should n't she look like a million dollars tonight , she never felt better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd in the direction of the dressing room in the back . When she opened the door there , a babble of excited feminine voices died away instantly , and four pair of mascaraed eyes turned toward her quickly and guiltily . " Hi , kids , how 's it goin ' ? " Nell said , calmly . They came to her , all talking at once , the warm affection and underlying sympathy in all the voices : Nell , how you ? Honey , you look wonderful ! Is n't this hot weather fierce ? Honey , you all dressed up , is that a new dress ? Nell , you look terrific tonight , simply terrific ! " Yeah , new rag , " Nell said with a deprecating gesture toward her dress . " My God , it 's brutal in here ! Maybe one of these years we can talk the boss into putting the air conditioning in back here . How about that ! " " That cheap screw ? " the girl vocalist said bitterly . " That 'll be the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the stools in front of the littered dressing table and went on with the making up of her face , Annie and Lorraine adjusted their scanty blue-and-silver dancing costumes in front of the mirror there , and the fourth girl , a member of a ballet tap dance team , withdrew back of the screen to finish with her dressing . Nell struggled with the dirty pebbled-glass sections of the window at the end of the room . " There , maybe that will let in a little air , " she said . " Hardly anybody comes in the alley anyway . If we catch somebody peekin ' in , we 'll sic Tony on ' em . How 'd rehearsals go ? " They answered her with a chorus of catcalls and raspberries , and Nell lighted a cigarette , the acrid smell of the burnt match mixing with the sweet cloying scent of perspiration and perfume and powder , heavy in the small hot room . " You mean the boss is off again ? Okay , come on and tell your troubles to Aunty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startin ' for our cue , " Lorraine said quickly . " Let 's go . " She was out the door , and Annie after her , but as she passed Nell , Annie said quickly and softly , her mouth close to Nell 's ear ,  | " Meet you down the hall when we come off . Somep'n to tell you . " Nell lingered in the dressing room for a few minutes after that and when she left she walked on down the bare corridor outside past the stacked wooden beer cases , and around the turn at the far end of it . Annie came to her there a moment later , her heel-and-toe taps clicking softly over the floor boards , a flimsy dressing gown loose over her bare body in the brief dancing costume , the little rivulets of perspiration streaking the heavy dark pancake make-up on her face . " How 'd it go , Annie ? " Nell said , sympathetically , holding out her cigarette pack . " Jesus , it 's really murder out there under them lights tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting up her heavy hennaed hair from the back of her neck with her other hand . " Want to borrow the boss 's office and sit down a minute ? " " No , we better not , " Annie said . " I only got a minute . I got ta get back in there and get changed . " " Okay , " Nell said . " So what 's the beef , honey ? The boss been hangin ' around the dressing room again ? " " Aw , I 'm gettin ' used to wrestling him around , for crisesakes ! " Annie paused , her face suddenly embarrassed and unsure , and then she said , rapidly , " It 's a rotten dirty shame , Nell . We all been talkin ' about it . You 're such a really swell kid , and we all had it figured the same way , that you really went for this Sherry guy , and now . . . Well , it 's just a dirty shame , that 's all . " " Annie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey . About Sherry Lockbridge gettin ' married to that little tramp last night . Gee , I 'm sorry , Nell . Honest , we all are , we . . Nell 's eyes were very green . " Annie , you 're cute ! You do n't have to be sorry . Nobody has to be sorry . There 's nothing to be sorry about , so skip it . " " Aw , honey , do n't , " Annie said , quickly . " But the thing is , it was n't his fault , see ? I was right here , I saw the whole thing and I know ! The boss pulled off the whole thing , that stinkin ' bastard.  |p272That  's what I wanted to tell you , see ? Nell , where was you and Jerry last night ? I tried to call you everywhere , I tried and tried and ... " " Annie , you 're a good girl . " Nell patted her shoulder . " Now go on , beat it and get changed . And tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? You 're dreaming up fairytales , honest . Sherry Lockbridge was just a guy I 've known since way back when . I know a lot of guys . There 's nothing to it . " " Nell , please , just let me tell you how it happened , please , " Annie said , desperately . " Because it was n't his fault , honest it was n't . Wo n't you just listen to me ? " " Okay , okay , " Nell said . " If you 're gon na twist my arm , tell me . But quick , huh ? " " Sherry came down here early last night lookin ' for you , " Annie said , rapidly . " I see him settin ' there when I come in and I went over to say hello . And he was plastered right then , see , really plastered . That 's the truth , Nell . . . . " She talked on rapidly , her eyes anxiously fixed upon Nell 's remote face . Nell moved at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her words tumbling out all the faster . " . . . and the next thing you know , that little blonde-haired bitch is tellin ' how she and Sherry are gon na get married , just like that ! And she 's the one that says it , see , he never says a word . So the boss likes to split a gut . He takes it big . Why should n't he , for crisesakes , everybody knows how crazy the boss is about you , Nell . And then right after that , she 's blabbin ' about how they got ta get married right away because they got ta . Ten to one she was makin ' that up , Nell , I only told you that because . . . Well , anyway the boss took that really big . Right then I see what 's comin ' and that 's when I try to find you , Nell . I tried , honest , I did , honey . I called everywhere , I called ... " " Sure you did , Annie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried . Now forget it , honey , and . . . " " Yeah , but just let me tell the rest of it , " she said . " Please , Nell ! I called everywhere and I did n't know what to do , and nobody knew where you was or anything , and when I get back to the table , it 's just like I figured , the boss 's got it all set , he 's gon na take ' emp273to get married right away , he 's running the whole show , and Sherry , that poor bastard , he 's so drunk he do n't know from nothin ' ! " Nell flung her arm about Annie 's shoulders and began to walk her back along the corridor . " Honey , if you do n't get changed , you 're gon na hold up the show . Come on , simmer down , Annie . Do n't you worry about this any more . There was n't anything you could have done . " " But , Nell , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherry never knew what hit him . The boss did it , him and that stinkin ' little towheadedfloozy , they just . . . " " Annie , look ! People get married every day . It 's all the same to me . He 's just a guy I know from way back when . If he wanted to get married , why . . . " " Honey , do n't be like that ! " Annie wailed at her . " You just make it tough for yourself ! Did n't I just tell you how it was ? He was so plastered he did n't know whether he was coming or going , and that 's the God 's truth ! " " Annie , ah , come on , honey ! He could walk around and talk , could n't he ? He knew all right whether he was getting married or whether he was n't , and to who , did n't he ? Then there was n't anything you could have done about it , why you want to blame yourself ? And get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's breaking me up , he 's just . .. " " Yeah , I know , he 's just some guy you know from way back when , for crisesakes ! " Annie said , angrily . " So I wasted a lotta my good breath tellin ' you a lotta stuff about something you do n't care nothin ' about anyway ! ' Scuse me for takin ' up your time ! ' Scuse me for livin ' ! " With the slamming of the dressing-room door , Nell spun around and walked swiftly back the length of the corridor and around the corner to the little room that Marney used for his office . She unlocked the door with a key from her purse , and entered the stuffy ( lark interior . She switched on the small lamp on the desk there , and pushed impatiently at the tilting sections of window glass . Then she sat down in the desk chair , wearily lifting her hands to support her head on either side . She sat still for a long time , the rhinestones winking and sparkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tony poked his head into the room . " Listen , Nell , " he said , rapidly , " You know where . . . Hey , what 's the matter , kid ? You look beat . This heat gettin ' yuh , kid ? " " Hi , Tony , " she said . " Some heat wave we got , huh ! What was it you wanted ? " " Aw , the hell with it , " he said , solicitously . " Look , lemme get you a cold beer . Or maybe you 'd rather have a shot a somep'n ? You stay here and lemme get it for you . " " Beer 's fine , I 'd love a beer , " Nell said . " But do n't you bother , Tony , you got enough to do . " " Naw , you stay right where you are . I 'll be right back . " When he returned , Nell was sitting in her customary comfortable posture , the chair tipped back , her shiny heels elevated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " Here you are , " Tony said , pouring the beer for her with a flourish . " You look fine now , but you better stay back here awhile and take it easy . It 's murder out front there , the joint is jammed and it's. hottin ' up even with the conditioning goin ' . Why the suckers all wanta pack in here a night like tonight ? Ai n't they got homes where they could take their clothes off and lay around and drink beer outa the icebox , for Christ 's sakes ! " " Thanks , Tony , " she said . " See , there you go again , talking the doughnuts right outa your coffee ! " They were both smiling but Tony lingered by the , desk uneasily . " Say , Nell , you look swell tonight , " he said . " I was- mean-in ' to tell yuh . You got the guys out front there all droolin ' ' all over their neckties ! " " Yeah , sure , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ai n't mad at me , are you ? ' I did n't have nothin ' to do with it . I drove ' em down there , like the boss told me , I was a witness when the judge married ' em , like the boss told me , but . .. " " Tony , cut out the hearts and flowers , with you ? ' ' For the first.  |p275time  , Nell 's voice was sharp . " I 'm not mad at you . I 'm not mad at anybody ! " " Well , just so you ai n't mad at me , that 's all , " Tony said , relievedly , as he turned away toward the door . " Tony , do something for me , " she called after him . " Tell the boss I wanta see him . Tell him I wanta see him back here right away , chop chop , on the double , no more stalling , right away . Tell him I said so . " " Sure , right away , Nell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipping at her beer with her fingertips leaving dark smudges in the frost over the glass . She heard his heavy tread along the corridor finally , his feet slow and reluctant toward the door , and her eyes slanted above her flaring cheekbones , but she did not stir in the chair . Marney opened the door and looked in cautiously around the edge of it , his face sheepish , with his look of childish sulkiness and guilt . " Now , Nell , now wait a minute , darling , " he said , instantly . " There 's something I wanta tell you before you say a word . There 's something I wanta say before you do anything . Now , you listen to me , darling , now you just wait a minute . . . " His voice dwindled out . Nell sat perfectly still , the little stones in her sandal heels winkingat him in the light . " Quit yackin ' and come in here and shut the door , " she said at last . Marney hesitated , and then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaned against it , his eyes intent upon her . Out of the long silence , Nell said , suddenly , " I got any dough coming , Chiefo ? " " Why , sure you got dough coming , darling . Hell , yes ! " Marney said , rapidly and placatingly . " I told you that last week . The deal with Haynes went through this time without a hitch , just like you said it would . You got a whole chunk a dough coming to you . You can have it any time you say . It 's right here in the safe . You can have it right tonight . "  |p276He  plunged toward the safe in the corner while he was still speaking . " Not all of it , just some of it , " Nell said . " I 'm going on a little trip . " Marney jerked upright , his fingers on the dial , his back rigid . " Aw , now , Nell ! " he said . " What you gon na do , where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't . . . " " I 'm going to Chicago , " she said , " where it 'll probably be a damn sight boiling hotter than it is right here . I 'm going just like any other time I go . I 'm going to Chicago , that 's all . I want some new scenery , I want some new clothes . Or I just wanta get boiled . Now you satisfied ? " " Oh , that 's the ticket , that 's fine , " Marney said , heartily . " A little change 'll be good for you , darling . How about that ! How much money you want ? " He brought a packet of bills to her at the desk , his eyes still wary . She put down her glass to take it , and leafed through one end of the stack rapidly , pulling out a third of the bills and returning the remainder of the packet to him . Marney carried it back to the open safe . " Yeah , a little trip 'll be just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have n't been away for two , three months now . You go and have a good time and do n't worry about nothing . We 'll miss you like hell , but we 'll get along till you get back , so do n't you worry about a thing . " " What 's the matter , Marney ? " Nell said , softly . " Your conscience bothering you , sweetie ? " " Now , Nell , there 's just one thing I wanta tell you , " he said desperately . " I know you 're mad at me , but . . . " " By Jesus ! " Nell banged her feet down from the desk to the floor , and then abruptly sank back in the chair again . " Ah , what 's the use ? I 'm not mad at anybody , yah-ta-ta , yah-ta-ta , yah-ta-ta ! I 've had just about all the yah-ta-ta I need ! I 've got to go away to get some peace and quiet , for God 's sakes ! " Marney came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean that ? You 're not sore at me ? " " No , I 'm not mad at you , " she said . " You been a bad boy , butp277not any badder boy than you 've been before now , I guess . No , I 'm not mad at you . But I had you sweatin ' here for a few minutes , did n't I , baby ? " Marney laughed uproariously , his pale eyes popping in his red angular face . " How about that ! Darling , I love you ! You kill me . I just love you ! " " Yeah , you kill me too , " Nell said . " You just kill me . " Marney leaned down , his hand against the desk top , his face close to hers . " Nell , you look wonderful tonight , " he said . " That dress and all the geegaws and everything . I never saw you look more beautiful , darling . I do n't suppose . . . " " Uh uh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's just like you do n't suppose . I better shove , Marney . I want to make the late bus and get in before it gets hot tomorrow . You know where to phone me in Chicago if something comes up . " " Sure , sure , do n't worry . " He tucked her hand through his arm , and walked with her to the door . " Have fun now , how about that ! Look , you want Tony to come drive you to the bus ? " She shook her head . " There 's a jam here tonight ; he 's busy . I 'll make it . " " I 'll come drive you myself , " Marney said . " Let me come drive you . " I got taxi fare , remember ? " And at the door , Nell said , " Well , be a good boy while I 'm gone , sweetie . Just remember that one of these times when you 're a bad boy , somebody 's liable to walk in here with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marney laughed silently , and then gravely bent his head to kiss her lingeringly . " Jesus , I 'm glad you 're not mad at me , " he said . " Is it my fault if he knocked up some little jail bait and she clipped him with a marriage license ? Have fun now , darling , and for Christ 's sake , hurry back ! "  |p278Nell  was away four days . She returned asshe had gone , in the middle of another hot breathless black night , traveling this time by plane . The flight was slightly rough , and Nell slept in the reclining seat , lulled by the steady powerful roar of the motors , the constant swelling dips and lifts of motion , and by the cool - air rushing in from the vent above her . When she awakened , the ship was already on the runway , the bright lights on the field flashing into her face . She unfastened her seat belt wearily , just as the ship taxied up to the terminal and made the turn at the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence in a perfectly maneuvered arc . Then the motors were still with a heavy unaccustomed silence in the cabin and the immediate stifling heat . Nell waited among the passengers in the aisle , and then filed down the ramp with them into the blinding white light that by some alchemy neutralized her face along with all the others into the common pale blank exhausted visage of the traveler . She walked through the crowd into the terminal building and out again by thep279opposite door . On the loading platform , she engaged a taxi cab and when the porter came at last with a few pieces of luggage on his hand truck , she offered her square of yellow cardboard and the driver carried her suitcase to the cab . As they drove away , she rolled the windows down on either side , and then leaned back against the seat , riding with the fleeting sense of unfamiliarity , a different motion and a different motor noise . " Look , Mac , I do n't hear a word you 're saying , " she called out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it 's hot , " the driver yelled back at her over his shoulder . " Yeah , hot , " she said . It was after closing when she arrived at Marney 's , and the neon sign was dark above the door . She paid the driver and carried her small suitcase across the sidewalk . Inside , the lights were dimmed in the corridor and the hat-check counter was closed , but the large inner room was bright with overhead light . The night cleaning man was busily removing white cloths from table tops there , and the bartenderleaned across his elbows at the end of the bar , talking to the blond-haired piano player seated on a stool . They both hailed her , and Nell waved back to them . She left her suitcase by the door , calling out a greeting to the cleaning man and walked toward the bar . " Hi , you guys ! What 's cookin ' ? " They both spoke at once and she said , " One at a time and loud , huh ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hey , I 'm glad you 're back . " The blond man pulled out a stool for her as he spoke . " You fly back , Nell ? " the bartender said . " Can you make good connections flying ? " " Not very . " She took a sip of beer from the piano player 's glass . " You might about as well take the bus . " " So how 's everything in the big city ? " the bartender said . " Hot , " Nell said . " Damn my ears ! One a these days I 'm gon na quit flying . " " Hey , you ca n't do that . That 's against the trend of civilization or somep'n , " the piano player said . " Hold your nose tight and blow . "  | " What you think I been doing ? " she said , crossly . " I just about punctured my left ear drum , that 's all . " The bartender put the bottle and glass in front of her . " Seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You stick out your tongue as far as it 'll go , see , and then you press ... " " That 's hiccoughs , " she said . " Naw , Nell , " the bartender said earnestly . " You put a paper sack over your head for hiccoughs . " " You stick out your tongue too . I took first aid during the war . " You take nine swallows a somep'n , " the piano player said , solemnly , " and you hold your breath . " " Aw , that 's a boilermaker , " Nell said . " Is n't that a boilermaker , Jimmy ? " " Chewin ' gum , " the bartender said . " I heard a pilot in hero talkin ' about ear trouble once and he swore by chewin ' gum . " " But it makes your ears so sticky , " she said . " Gee , it 's good to be back . Real good ! " " Is it ? " the piano player said . The bartender began to lock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss has already left , Nell . He and Bob Ferris took off from here right at closin ' . You guys gon na be around here awhile ? You want me to leave out some beer in the cooler ? " " Sounds good to me . " " Christ , who could sleep anyway ? " the piano player said . " Listen , how was Chicago ? Tell me about it . " " Same old town , " she said . " But hot . Or did I already say that ? " " Well , it could n't a been much worse than it 's been right here to home , " the bartender called back . " And according to the paper , no relief 's in sight yet . Well , I guess I 'll shove off now . These hot nights , I kind a like to take the wife out for a little ride and somep'n to eat before we go to bed . " " Sure , go ahead , Jimmy , " Nell said . " Say hello to Sadie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tomorrow . " " Yeah , see you tomorrow , Jimmy , " the piano player said . " Take it easy , kid . " After he was gone , the piano player stretched leisurely , his armsp281extending wide . " Let 's set at a table . This stool gives me cricks in the back . " They went , carrying bottles and glasses with them , and Nell called out to the cleaning man , " Hey , Bill , where can we park awhile where we wo n't be in your way ? " He answered her from the other side of the room , where he stacked chairs neatly together on bare table tops . " Any place you wanta over on that side a the floor , Nell . I ai n't gon na be over to that side for a while yet . " They sat down together , and the piano player said , " You get some records in Chi ? You find those Bob Wilbur 's we were talking about ? " Nell shook her head . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't in the mood . " He was silent , and then he said , " You 're still feeling lousy , are n't you ? That 's why you came back so quick . " " Cut it out , Jerry , " Nell said . " I do n't want that from anybody , not even you . " He chewed at a fingernail for a moment , a small man with light hair combed smooth above a nervous humorous face . " What difference does it make if you say out loud how you feel or not ? " he said softly . " It 's a hell of a lot better for you to say it . " " There 's nothing to say , " she said . " I 'm leveling with you , Jerry . I 'm not the type to carry a torch , am I ? Hearts and flowers is out of style , anyway . This is the Atom Age , for God 's sakes , who 's got the time to waste on hearts and flowers ? Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago ? Tattooing everybody with their blood type number , so when the bomb comes they can sort us out quicker . Jesus , it makes you sick ! What a crazy fouled-up world ! " " It 's the only one we got , " Jerry said . " What 's the matter with you , sweet potato ? That do n't sound like you talking ? " " Nothing 's the matter with me , " Nell said , sharply . " I 'm sick of it , that 's all . I 'm sick of this joint , too , if you want to know , and all the other joints like it . I 'm sick of myself . " " Oh , hey , you got it bad , " he said , biting at another fingernail . " You 'll get over it , Nell . "  | " Leave it alone , Jerry , I mean it , " she said . " I got nothing to get over . Do I always have to go around like some goddamn Pollyanna or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full of trouble , you know that as well as I do . " They were silent again , the hot room stark and tawdry under the harsh bright lights , the chairs mounted on the tables . " Sure glad to see you back , Nell . " The cleaning man paused besidethem suddenly , leaning on his broom and mopping at his drippingface . " How you feelin ' anyway ? " " Bill , have a bottle of beer , " Nell said , quickly . " It 's a brutal night for you to be working . " " Say , do n't mind if I do . Somep'n cold sure would hit the spot . " She walked off rapidly to the cooler behind the bar and returned a moment later with the sweating bottles in her hands . " Here you are , " she said , her cigarette wobbling in her mouth . " Well , one of my ears just blew out anyway . " " Thanks a lot , Nell , " the cleaning man said . " Whatsa matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearin ' you two play and sing while I 'm workin ' . Makes the job go a sight faster . " " No music , " Nell said . " No music tonight , Bill . " " Oh , hey , ca n't let the man down . " Jerry got up from his chair . " Look at all the time I waste playing for the customers in this joint , I could n't say no to my pal Bill . " Nell trailed after him across the dance floor , and from behind them , Bill called , " Play that Ace in the Hole , ' Jerry . That 's one piece I sure like to hear you play . " She leaned across the low piano top , her eyes upon his hands moving easily and effortlessly over the keys . He played it slowly and melodically , and then began the chorus over again , ragging it . He played on , and Nell stared away finally over the top of his head , into the static geometric jungle of chairs and tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wielded his broom . Jerry looked up , time after time , as he played , studying her tense miserable face intently . And suddenly he said , his voice roughened , " Jesus , kid , do n't ! You 've took enough of a beating from that guy already . Forget him ! Knock it off ! "  | " What you say , Jerry ? " His smile was wry . He shrugged and then he said , deliberately , " Who , me ? Why , I just said , you think you can come down out'of those clouds long enough to light me a butt ? " She looked at him quickly , her attention caught , her face protestingand questioning all at once . " Jerry ? " " No , go ahead . Light me a butt , angel . " She hesitated , and then she lighted it , holding it down to his mouth . " Thanks . " He rolled it between his lips to the position at the corner of his mouth and narrowed his eyes against the smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamn much other stuff on your mind ? " he said . " I saw a doc while you was gone . " " Jerry ! Tell me quick ! " " The pipes are okay . Even for blowing a horn they 're okay . " " Ah , wonderful , wonderful ! " She leaned down across the piano top swiftly , taking the cigarette from his lips to kiss him . " No kidding , Middle Valve , I 'm tickled to death ! " " Yeah , me too , " he said . " In three years , I 've saved up an awful lot of things to tell that horn . " Oh , but wait a minute , " she said . " I guess that means you 're ready to pack up and shove out of here . " " Miss me ? " he said , smiling up at her . " You know I will ! " " The boss knows it too . He 's liable to fire me before I have a chance to quit . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a moment he said , " Really miss me , Nell ? " She thought about it before she answered . " Yeah , Jerry . I 'm layingit straight . Really miss you . " He took a breath before he said it . " Want to come with me ? " She thought again , and his hands were suddenly louder and faster on the keys , " That 's a Plenty , " with his left hand beating the bass.  |p284From  behind them , the cleaning man called out , delightedly , " Jerry , now you 're playin ' for me , boy ! " ' The perspiration was suddenly shining across her forehead . " Jerry , I ca n't , " she said . " I ca n't . I got  --  unfinished business . " " Yeah , " he said . " I was afraid a that . I figured as much the way you come rushing back here tonight . " " No , " Nell said . " I did n't know it when I came back , honest . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you did . " " Well , I 'm not gone yet either , " he said , finally . " Maybe you 'll  --  get your business finished up by then . " She was completely still , staring at him , for a moment , and then very slowly her shoulders straightened , her body coming erect , her eyes slitting . " You know , you might have something there ! " she said , wonderingly . " You know , that could just be ! Half a lifetime on a merry-goroundis enough for anybody . I think I 'm gon na get off now . " " Now that begins to sound like you talking , " he said . " But just take it easy , huh ? " " Do n't I always take it easy ? " she said , abstractedly . " You never take it easy , angel . Right now you look like you 're ready to go out and stick a knife in the guy . " " Dah ! " she said . " What good would that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm out to finish up for good . " " Yeah . Well , try and take it easy anyway . You would n't like it in the pokey . They tell me there 's a lot a squares in there . " She was smiling all of a sudden . " Jerry , I love you ! " " I wish you meant that when you said it , chum ! " She flung back her hair , her face suddenly alive and vibrant , and then slammed her hands down hard upon the piano top . " Well , come on ! Let 's liven up this joint . This party 's going dead on us ! " " Ah , that 's the girl ! " Jerry said . " I 'll get some beer . " And then she called out , " Bill , I feel it coming on ! Here comes the one that always gives you the goose-pimples ! " The cleaning man began to laugh , and Nell clapped her hands , trucking across the floor , singing as she went :  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rambled all aroundIn and out of the town , Oh did n't he ramble , ramble . He rambled till the butchers cut him down . " " Whose funeral you got in mind anyway , angel ? " the piano player said , softly  |p286The  oppressive heat continued , like somevast tangible remorseless presence in the city ; there in every street and place of work and dwelling and theatre and bar , and the inescapable unseen passenger riding with the fleeing automobiles that clogged the highways out of town at sunset to overcrowded lake shores and picnic parks and ball fields . Just after noon on Saturday , Nell came down the porch steps out onto the parched grass of the lawn . She walked slowly , clad in faded denim shorts and a loose white shirt with rolled sleeves , her head lowered against the brassy savage sunlight . She crossed the road under the motionless dusty foliage of the trees to the house on the other side , and entered without knocking . The interior was darkened , window shades lowered to the sills in futile protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the radio turned low in an inner room , the excited enthusiastic voice of a commentator reporting a baseball game . " Hi ! Anybody home ? " she called out , cheerfully . " Nell ! We 're here in the kitchen , Nell . " It was Aunt Ethel 's voice that answered her.  |p287Nell  walked through the doorway , her feet light in flat sandals . The kitchen too was dim and stifling hot , and Aunt Ethel , Clyde and Pa were seated at the table . Clyde arose quickly . " How are you , Nell ? Is it hot enough for you ? " " Brutal , really brutal , " she said . " Hi , Pa , how 's my Saturday date ? Here 's your magazines . The little box is for you , Ethel . " " Nell , you should n't ! " Aunt Ethel 's voice was forced and lifeless , and Pa did not speak at all , or turn his head . He sat hunched forward , his elbows resting on the arms of his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face in the dim light older and shrunken together . " How is it out to your place , Clyde ? " Nell said . " You get any breeze at all from the lake ? " " Some , but it do n't help much . This sure is a regular heat wave . " He blinked his eyes rapidly , his face grave and embarrassed . " Come on and have a bite to eat . Here , sit over here , Nell , " AuntEthel said , and Pa said , shortly , breaking in upon her , " If you'redone , Clyde , we may as well get started for the groceries . " " Any time you 're ready , Pa . " Pa shoved back his chair . He avoided looking at her , but as he passed her , he reached out clumsily , squeezing Nell 's arm tightly in his fingers for an instant . By the time the screen door on the porch slammed behind them , the tears were running from Aunt Ethel 's eyes . " Oh , Nell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel , do n't . It 's too damn hot to cry . " Nell took a cup from the cupboard and filled it herself from the coffee pot sitting on the edge of one burner of the electric plate . " I do n't see how I could cry any more . I 've cried already till I must be all cried out . " Aunt Ethel blew her nose hard into her handkerchief and then looked up at Nell helplessly from her chair . Her face was unrouged , and her body sagged without a girdle under her thin faded cotton dress . " Oh , Nell , I just feel so bad I do n't know what to do ! It seems like I ca n't get over it . I do n't believe I 'll ever get over it . "  |p288Nell  pulled out the chair across the table from her . " You ca n't live other people 's lives for them , Ethel . You know better than that . " " I know it , Nell , " Aunt Ethel said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for them , can you , nor you ca n't help being disappointed ? " Nell was silent , staring down into her cup , and behind the drawn window shade flies buzzed loudly and excitedly over a row of peaches set along the window sill , and the room was filled with their sickish smell of warm over-ripened fruit . " And you , Nell , " Aunt Ethel said , softly . " I know however bad we feel , Nell , you must be feelin ' ten times worse . ' Twoud be a terriblehard thing for you or any girl to forgive him for goin ' off and gettin ' married to somebody else the first time , and then after you did forgive him , for him to turn right around and do it again , why ... Nell 's back went rigid . " Please , Ethel , " she said . " Please , please ! " The room was very still after that except for the monotonous buzzing of the flies , and then Nell said , steadily , " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know you have n't been over to see our new baby yet ? Fine thing ! He 's a cute baby , too , not all red , like some of ' em . When you coming over to see our baby anyway ? " And just then , in a little dark airless bathroom in a rundown apartment building on the other side of town , Sherry stood and shaved before a mirror , his body pinkened from a shower , a grayish bath-towel wrapped about his middle . There was the heat , and from the other side of the thin wall beside him , plumbing pipes suddenly gurgled and hammered loudly , drowning out for a moment the incessant thin fretful wail of a baby from across the hall . Sherry splashed water on his face , and outside there was the surreptitious metallic turn of a key in a lock , and the careful quiet easing open of a door . He stuck his dripping head around the bathroom door frame just as Tude came into the outer room . She closed the door behind her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright red from the heat , her hair dank and stringing with perspiration . " Where you been ? " he said , impersonally . " What makes you go out in the heat of the day like this ? " Tude stayed where she was , standing just inside the door of the shabby one-room apartment . " I thought you 'd be to sleep , " she said at last , sullenly . " I have to be at work early , " Sherry said . " It 's too hot and noisy to sleep in this dump today anyway . Why do n't you lay down or something , you look like you 're ready to keel over . " He started to turn away , but Tude hesitated a moment too long , her one hand held awkwardly behind her back , and Sherry stayed in the doorway of the bathroom , his eyes suddenly alert upon her , patting at his face absently with one end of the hand towel draped around his neck . She moved at last , sidling by him quickly , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster , reaching out to grab hold of her wrist . For a moment she struggled with him fiercely and silently , as he pried her fingers loose from the package . " What you think you 're doing ! " she shouted at him furiously , her voice uneven with her panting . " Give it back to me , it 's nothin ' to you . It 's mine , I want it ! " He turned away , unheeding , fending off her clutching hands with his shoulder as he slipped the string and unfolded the ends of bright-blue paper . It was a drugstore bottle filled with some clear liquid , and Sherry read the label on it , with the piece of crumpled wrapping paper fluttering away out of his hand to the floor . Tude stood motionless as he removed the top , smelling tentatively , and screwed the top back on again . When he looked at her then , his face was merely puzzled . " What you want this for ? Why should you go out in the heat to get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not answer him . She walked away , past the length of a sagging divan made up with sheets into a bed , to a second bed , a pull-down one , at the other end of the room . She threw herself down upon the tumbled bed coverings , rolling over onto her stomach and then lying still with her face hidden in a pillow.  |p290Sherry  looked from her to the bottle in his hand , turning it in his fingers thoughtfully . He stood a moment , and then suddenly there was a slow recognition and a quick anger in his face . He strode swiftly into the bathroom and turned on both faucets splashing hard in the washbowl . He unscrewed the bottle top again and emptied the contents over the drain . He rinsed the bottle several times and tossed it into a stained cardboard wastebasket at his feet . When he came out of the bathroom , Tude had not moved at all , her body still and limp and sprawling on the bed . " You goddamn little fool , " Sherry said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff ? Do n't you know it 's the same as poison ? Did n't you know you 'd be taking a chance on killing yourself with it if you tried to use it ? Have n't you got any brains at all ? " Tude stiffened and then rolled over on the bed , sitting bolt uprightto scream at him . " What you expect me to do ! Jesus Christ , what you expect me to do ! You talked and talked about takin ' me to some doctor to get fixed up , and now we 're married you wo n't do it ! What am I gon na do ! " Sherry 's face was impassive . " Cut it out . I told you how it was gon na be that morning in the hotel , did n't I ? There 's nothing more to talk about . " Tude began to cry hysterically , pulling at her hair , her face convulsed , screaming and crying all at once . " I ai n't gon na have no baby ! I wo n't , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and swole up and terrible lookin ' ! I 'm gon na get outa this town and get to be somebody , I 'm not gon na get tied down with no pukin ' squawlin ' brat ! Why you so mean to me ! " " You better cut out that screaming , " Sherry said , " before I put you under the shower , clothes and all . You worked overtime to get that marriage certificate , did n't you ? Well , now you 've got it , baby ! I say there 'll be no abortion , and that goes for tinkering around at home , too . You hear what I say ? " Tude flung herself down on the bed again , her arms flailing senselessly , her body threshing and twisting in agony . " Why you hate me so , oh , why ca n't you help me ? I never wanted to get in the family way , why ca n't you help me ? "  |p291Sherry  's face was stark , his hands fumbling and rummaging foi cigarettes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " All right , " he said , wearily . " For Christ 's sakes , all right ! You want to call it all off ? You want to take what money I 've got and go back to your Pa 's right tonight , and let me get out of this town ? " " No , no , no ! " she sobbed . " I just wanta do like you said I could ! I wanta go to some doctor and get fixed up right away ! Then we could get outa this town ! We could get outa here and go to Hollywood  --  orany place you wanta go . " Sherry was suddenly grimly smiling through the smoke . " You 're just like all the rest of the girls , are n't you ? " he said . " You 're bound to have it your way , but this time I say it 's gon na be my way . Cut out that crying before you make yourself sick . " He disappeared back into the bathroom , slamming the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself out , and she lay still , weeping in quiet exhausted misery . When Sherry came out again he was dressed in immaculately pressed trousers and clean white shirt and tie . He carried a wet washcloth over to the bed , and turned Tude onto her back , his hand firm and gentle upon her small shoulder . She lay limp and unresisting , her eyes closed , while he bathed her face . He wrung the washcloth out under the cold water faucet the third time , and folded it into a pad across her eyes and forehead . Then , with a cigarette dangling from his mouth , he hunted through the disorder of the small hot crowded room until he found her purse . He emptied out the change purse into his hand , a bill and a few coins , and put them away in his pocket . At the door , he said to her , impersonally , " You better take it easy , kid . There 's nothing you can do that 'll work anyway . And if you was thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can forget it . I 've got your money here in my pocket . You 've got cigarettes and magazines and stuff to eat right here , and next time you want to go to the movies you can walk down with me when I go to work . " Tude did not answer him , and Sherry went , closing the door quietly behind him . She lay still for a long time after he was gone ,  |p292while  the light slowly faded in the hot room . At last she pulled herselfupright exhaustedly . She sat for a moment , her shoulders bowed with fatigue , her face weary and a little ill . And then suddenly she sucked in her breath and hurled herself headlong over the edge of the high bed . She fell in a thudding , jarringheap upon the floor , crying out softly in pain , her hand reaching for her skinned elbow as she scrambled to her feet . Without pausing , she stretched up high upon her toes , her arms straining above her head , and then flung herself wildly forward from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She repeated the gyration again and again , frantically , her hair flying , her breath whistling in the room . And when at last she was too dizzied and exhausted to stand upon her feet any longer , she crumpled weeping to the floor and rolled over and over there desperately with all her remaining strength , knocking blindly against the legs of furniture , and sobbing all the while.  |p293The  heat broke suddenly several dayslater , without either the severe electric storm or the high cyclonic winds that all the amateur weather forecastershad prophesied gloomily , as certain to mark the end to it . Even as late as five-thirty , when Sherry walked to work that afternoon , the air had been hotter and more suffocatingly humid than ever . But the sky overhead was overcast with a strangely lurid gray and white in the slanting rays of the sinking sun . An hour later the rain came , without any warning preamble of lightning or thunder . The barroom was empty at the time , except for an old man sleeping at a table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar nearest the street , knee doubled , one foot braced against the rim of the sink . The rain fell in a deluge , so hard and fast that it merely seemed to hang motionless and timelessly suspended in the air , like a great pale diaphanous curtain between the buildings of the suddenly deserted street . Sherry stared out of the window for a long time , while the big electric fans droned on the ceiling overhead , and the little radio among the bottles on the shelf behind him played softly , musicp294mixed with crackling static . He saw the yellow taxi cab when it came , gliding slowly along the empty water-washed street , pulling over cautiously to the curb in front . After a moment , the door swung out , and he caught a brief dim glimpse of the woman 's figure darting across the sidewalk , head lowered under the plummeting raindrops . She burst through the doorway and stopped dead still . Over the sound of the loud falling rain through the opened door , Sherry said , " Get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The room was so indirectly lighted that it was almost dark , her race a white blur in the gloom . " The hell I will ! " she said . She whirled around and signaled back to the cab driver with several sweeping waves of her arm . Then she came in and slammed the door behind her . Sherry had not moved . " You can still catch that cab at the corner . Get out of here . I do n't want any part of you ! " " Oh ho , " she said . " Friendly son of a bitch , are n't you ? " She peeled off her soaked raincoat , and then brushed water from her hair impatiently as she walked up to the bar . " What 's the matter with this dump ? Do n't you do any business in here ? Of course , it takes a really hep bartender to make a go out of one of these hole-in-the-wall joints . " She dropped her coat on a stool , and looked about her leisurely . " Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cash customer back there ? Do n't tell me you 're so bad at mixing drinks , you 're handing out mickeys ! See , I always said it took a lot more to make a bartenderthan the time you 've spent leanin ' over the other side of the bar . " What do you want ? " he said . " Why , I 'll have a glass of beer , " Nell said . " Now you mention it , that 's just what I want . " " You wo n't get it here , " Sherry said , softly . She looked at him for a moment , her face inscrutable , and then she opened the flap of the big purse that hung from a strap over her shoulder . She took out the dollar bill and placed it squarely in front of her on the bar top.  | " This is a public house , and there 's my money , " she said . " You hop on that spigot , or I 'll either have your job , or I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at her for a long moment , and then he moved . He took the glass with him swiftly down the length of the bar to the spigots . He filled it part way under one of them , and allowed the beer to settle , and then added to it with a deft manipulation of his hand , so that the narrow white head rose and stayed just above the rim of the glass . He carried it to her , and turned away to the cash register with her dollar bill . When he put the change in front of her , he said , his voice raw with anger , " Now you 've seen it . Now you satisfied ? " " Yeah , you look real cute in that apron , " Nell said . " I had to do a lot of pub crawling to find you , but it 's worth it to me to see you in that apron . " He turned away from her quickly , staring blindly out the window where the rain was still pouring down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She studied labels on bottles of stock in front of her idly , her eyes moving along the shelves , and then stopping on a combined electric figurine and clock . It displayed the animated metal figure of a hula dancer , with the belly rotating tirelessly and monotonously under the grass skirt . Nell shuddered . " My God , where did that clock come from ? " Sherry jerked around to face her . " For Christ 's sake , what 's the deal , Nella ? What are you doing down here ? " Nell shrugged . " Why , you know me , I 'm just an old barfly from way back . " And then she said , deliberately , " You know , I would n't be a bit surprised if this joint did n't turn out to be my favorite bar for awhile , too . " Sherry watched her , his eyes intent and searching . " I do n't know what you got in mind , " he said , finally , " but there 's one thing we may as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want one single thing from you , baby , and what I say , goes . I took a hell of a pushing around for awhile , and now I 'm through . I took a royal workin ' over from Fay because she was sick and I was sorry for her . I ought to have my head examined for the clouting I tookp296from you . And then I left myself wide open and I took a regular left hook right on the knocker from that wacked-up kid of yours . This whole town 's poison to me ! But now I 'm all through . So , whatever you had in mind , you better run along , honey , and take your papers somewhere else to peddle . " She clucked her tongue at him , her eyes slanting . " Regular persecutioncomplex and delusions a grandeur ! I got nothing to peddle to you , sugar . I just like it here because it 's so cozy . Why , in a little while I could learn to love it here . It 'll be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Go ahead and have fun , " Sherry said . " But whatever it is , you 're wasting your time . Do n't say I did n't warn you . " " I never waste my time , " Nell said . " Thanks , just the same . " She drained her glass as she spoke , and reached for her raincoat . She got into it leisurely , buttoning buttons , tightening the belt while Sherry watched her silently . She took her time about it , adjusting the position of her purse strap over her shoulder . She picked up her handful of change last of all , fingering through it for a second as she selected the dime and tossed it deliberately onto the bar top . As she turned away , she said , " I 'll be seeing you , lover . Do n't think I wo n't ! " Sherry did not answer her . But when she opened the door , with one swift motion of his arm he flung the dime after her , spinning it away over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , where first lights glimmered yellow and distorted through the falling water . Nell closed the door behind her . It was several days before Nell returned to the bar . She came at night , when the place was crowded , appearing suddenly in the darkness of the open doorway , walking across the floor with her long lazy stride to slide upon a stool , her face cool and indifferent . Sherry paid her no attention at all . He set out drinks , rung up money on the cash register , and delivered change to customers competently . Then he walked to Nell , his face closed and remote as he asked for her order , and she answered him with equal impersonality . She stayed for an hour , sipping from her glass leisurely and se/renely . The several times that Sherry glanced swiftly at her and away , the professional attention to her wants , she was watching him , her chin propped on her hand , her eyes slanted green and mocking through a thin arabesque of smoke . She left as casually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next night , and the next . Then she did not come for severalnights , and a quick shade of annoyance and irritation passed across Sherry 's face sometimes when he caught himself watching the doorway from the corners of his eyes . It was just before closing on a Saturday night when she appeared again . It was a balmy summer 's night , with a light breeze stirring , and suddenly she was there , walking through the open door in a plain sleeveless black-linen dress , her purse in her hand . The regulars lined at the bar greeted her loudly and vociferously , as a long-lost comrade returned to their midst . She paused to speak to several of them cheerfully as she made her way to her favorite stool at the end of the bar . She lingered over her beer then , her heels hooked comfortably on the rung of her stool . The bar emptied out gradually , and Nell turned away several offers to see her home with the careless statement that she was waiting for a date to pick her up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped on unhurriedly while Sherry polished last glasses , and wiped the bar top and then went to the cash register . He finished counting the money and closed the drawer , and she was still sitting there , quietly and at ease . Just as he turned to her , she was drawing a cigarette from the package , and Sherry said , " Allow me , " his voice mocking her . She leaned forward gravely to the match , the sudden sweetness of her perfume , and the little flare of flame when she puffed lighting her face to form the brief dark patches of shadow beneath her cheekbones . Sherry fanned out the match and stood where he was in front of her , his elbow upon the bar , his eyes intent upon her . Just then the owner arrived , unlocking the front door with a hurriedjangling of keys . He was a small elderly man with dark horn-rimmed glasses . He greeted Nell , and then walked back of the barp298to confer with Sherry at the register . In a moment , Sherry left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he came out again he had removed his apron , and he carriedhis coat slung over his shoulder . Nell reached for her purse and slipped down from the stool . When he reached the door , she was just at his heels and they walked out together . On the dark street , she fell into step with him easily , matching his long rapid stride , the fresh warm breeze blowing into their faces . Sherry turned off at the corner , and Nell turned with him . " What , going my way ? " he said , sarcastically . She did not answer him , and they walked on together , the sound of their feet over the cement echoing against the darkened fronts of the buildings . They crossed a street where a lamp suspended overhead swung in the wind so that the peripheries of yellow light shifted and danced upon grimy brick walls . " Well , " she said , unhurriedly , " so what does a bartender do anyway , when he gets through work on a Saturday night ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face her . " Listen , Nella , " he said , shortly . " I do n't know what you 're after , but you keep hanging around me like this and one a these times you 're liable to get something more than you bargained for , you know that ? " " My , you talk it big ! " she said , her voice delicately scoffing . " That 's right ! " He moved suddenly , his hands rough upon her shoulders , his mouth hard and harsh against hers . In his arms her body was unresisting , and then yielding , and finally urgent . Sherry lifted his head abruptly , his eyes intent and seeking upon the pale blur of her tilted face . " Now what gives with you , for Christ sake ! Do you want me to go to bed with you , is that it ? " She stood motionless , her soft even breathing warm against his chin . " Maybe , " she said , calmly . " Maybe not . " Sherry was still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the hell then , it does n't mean anything to me , " he said , hisp299voice deliberately flippant . " I never said no to a good lay yet , specially when she was the one that did the asking . I think there 's a hotel up in the next block . " Her voice came cool and unmoved out of the darkness . " There 's one two blocks over on Conroy , too . I know that one 's clean . " " Okay , what are we waiting for ? " Sherry said . " And leave it to you to know of a good clean tourist hotel , sweetheart ! " They began to walk again , side by side , steadily and rapidly . The sidewalk was empty , but at the corner they met a policeman ambling slowly along his beat , his eyes alert upon the dark entrancewaysof buildings , and the refuse-littered mouths of alleys . They crossed the street through another shimmering pool of golden light , and walked on . It was a similar dark side street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dirty glass globes , one on either side of the unpretentiousdoorway . Sherry turned in , but at the top of the shallow flight of steps he paused , his eyes searching and wary as he looked at her . Nell waited , her face detached and unreadable , her one hand brushing at the fluttering crew of insects that circled in the light . He pulled open the glass door then , and she walked ahead of him serenely into the small sparsely furnished lobby . The sleepy old man behind the desk greeted them without enthusiasm . Sherry paid the money and scowled as he wrote the quick sprawling entry in the ledger . He traded the pen for the key that the old man handed to him , and they walked together to the elevator . It was a self-service one that rose slowly with the faint hummingof a motor . They waited , facing each other in the small antiseptic-smelling cubicle , Sherry still watching her , his eyes curiousand measuring . The corridor above was quiet and dimly lighted . They stood a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they moved in common accord down the hallway . Sherry turned the key quietly in the lock , and as the door swung open , reached inside to the light switch upon the wall . The room was clean and freshly painted , and contained the customaryhotel arrangement of double bed , dresser , desk and chairs . While Sherry closed the door , Nell walked on into the room , tossingp300her purse down carelessly upon the dresser top . She turned on a soft shaded lamp beside the bed , and another on top of the desk . He still watched , his face impassive , as she returned to the wall switch , clicking off the glaring light from the ceiling overhead . She went to the window then , with her lazy easy stride , working the catches to push it upward as far as it would go . She kicked off her shoes and leaned forward , her arms braced against the sill , while the soft warm wind blew into the room , billowing the thin curtains . Sherry crossed the room and flung himself down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe you are bluffing , are you ? I would have swore you were . " " Maybe I still am , " she said , without turning . " Maybe , " he said . " I do n't much care . But I got a hunch you 're not . " They were silent for a moment , and then he said , " Well , what 's the story ? You this hard up for a man , or have you got a special case of hot pants just for me ? " She straightened up from the sill , bunching her hair together in her hands , and then shaking it free again . " Got a butt ? " she said , indifferently . He handed her one he had just lighted , and she perched with it upon the low shelf over the radiator beside the window , drawing her knees up to her chin . Sherry laughed suddenly . " Well , here we are . Nice and cozy , just the way I used to want it so bad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me , and now it 's too late . It 's a hell of a lot too late , you know that , do n't you , Nella ? " She shrugged , her eyes very green in the dim light as she looked at him . Sherry settled himself in the chair , extending his legs comfortably , his face grimly amused . " Well , now what you waiting for ? I did n't bring cards for gin . Are n't you gon na give me the business , turn down the lights and take your clothes off and . . . ? "  | " What 's the matter , lover ? " she said . " You having hard work waiting ? " " Me ? " Sherry said . " Hey , now wait a minute . This was all your idea , remember , sweetheart ? It 's all the same to me . " " Is that a fact ! " Nell said . " Christ , Nella , do n't ! " His voice was suddenly taut . " Why does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get even with me because you were so goddamn sore about me marrying Fay orwhat ? " " Mercy , " she said , " if anybody was gon na start any hearts and flowers around here tonight , it seems like I 'd be the one . " " Good Sweet Jesus ! " he said . " Do n't tell me ! " She hugged her legs in her encircling arms and watched him over the tops of her knees . " Never see any further than the end of your own nose , do you , sweetie ? " " That sounds cute coming from you , " Sherry said . " You 're still the same , Nella . Always bound to have everything about us all your way , how you want it , and when you want it , and ... " " Look , you want to hash it all over ? " " No , I do n't want to , " he said . " There 's nothing to hash over any more . We 're way past the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she said again . She slid down from the ledge all in one lazy catlike motion . " All done , huh ? All finished up ? " Sherry was still in the chair , his voice soft . " Now you get the idea ! " " Think its all washed out , huh , and you can just take off and ... ? " Only his tawny eyes moved as he looked up at her , the words with scarcely any motion of his lips . " Ca n't I ? Who says I ca n't ? " " Why , nobody , " Nell said . " Nobody at all . " She swooped down suddenly , her face close to his , her hand upon the chair arm . " Okay , one for the road . The old sixty-four-dollar question , remember ? Look at me and let me hear you say it . Say that I 'm all out of your system , that you 're finished with it . Let me hear you say it ! "  |p302He  sat rigid for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwillingly , his eyes vacant with some inner focusing . Suddenly , without warning , he leapt up from the chair , his hand slamming out hard into her face . " You little bitch ! Now I know what you want ! Oh baby , now I know what it is you 're after ! " " I do n't want anything from you . There 's nothing you 've got I 'll ever want again ! " She backed off slowly , her body tensing and ready , and he followed her , the unleashed runaway glee and anger and exaltation upon his face . " You wanted me to tell you , did n't you ? You want me to holler uncle ' , you want me to crawl for you ! Now I know ! It hit you right in your goddamn pride , did n't it ? You want me to beg and crawl for you , do n't you , so you can spit on me and walk out of here free ! Oh , baby , you know me better ! You picked the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nell stopped in her retreat . " Yeah . I 'm wrong , huh ? " " Take your hands off that lamp unless you want to spend the rest of the night in the clink , " Sherry said . " You throw it and before I 'm done with you , they 'll have the riot squad here . " She moved again slowly backward in the direction of the door , and he stalked her . " Came back here and moved in on me like a steamroller , " she said through her teeth . " Bitched everything up nine ways for Sunday . You and your wives ! And now you think you can just walk out on it . " " You had to be boss , " he said . " You ran out on me and then saw to it I did n't know where you were all those damn years . I find you and you still have to be the boss . You try to tell me what we 'll do and when we 'll love , and why and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You act like I 'm some old pair of shoes that you can toss in the back of the closet , and then haul out and put on again any time you happen to feel like it . You 're damn right I 'm the boss ! " " We 'll see about that ! " He made the swift unexpected lunge that caught her.  |p303They  struggled , and then her lips were moving under his . " Last laugh yet , you bastard ! " They kissed with a fierce angry coming together of their mouths and of their bodies . When Sherry turned his face away at last , he said with the catchingof his breath , " Okay , we 'll see who gets the last laugh ! Got any more talking you want to do , sweetheart ? " " Not right now , " she said , her voice muffled against him . " Anythingmore you want to say ? " " Not right this minute , no . Oh baby , not right this minute ! " They moved to the bed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From somewhere near below , a train whistle screamed and screamed again before the onrush of the pounding roaring wheels . The soft balmy summer 's wind silently billowed the curtains at the open window.  |p304They  lay together then for a long time , notsleeping but at rest , without speech or the need for it ; faces all but touching on the same pillow , without motionexcept for eyelids and the languorous lingering caressing hands . The soft wind blew into the room , and after awhile , Sherry said , his voice muted and infinitely at peace , " Jesus , Jesus ! The other part of me ! " " I know , " Nell said . " I just got home myself . I was just visiting everywhere since I been away from you . " They were still again after that , and , as though they had been transmuted into a life in another dimension where time had no place or meaning , after the long endless interval , Sherry said , " It 's home all right . Can you remember the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lay smiling in the dim light . " I ca n't even remember . It 's ever since I can remember . What 's it like for other people ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " Look , take the rest of your stuff off , I want to look at you . " She sat up part way , his hands slowly fumbling and assisting her ,  |p305and  then she sank back down again , her hands lifted behind her head , her pale body relaxed and peaceful and deep breathing . For endless time again , he bent forward on his one elbow , his other hand touching and retracing , exploring and memorizing . " Christ , you 're beautiful , " he said . " I know your body better than I know my own . I saw it happen . " " I saw you happen too , " she said , her voice deep and amused and contented in her throat . He was smiling suddenly . " Yeah , but it 's different with girls . Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were about so high , with all your ribs hangin ' out and nothing but little flat nipples like the boys . You used to come out to play with nothing on but some kind of goddamn pants . " " Those were my black sateen bloomers , " Nell said , drowsily . " Do n't you make fun of them , goddamn it ! I was real proud of those bloomers . " " Yeah , you used to wet ' em , too , once in awhile when you got excited , " Sherry said . She rolled over onto her side lazily . " Oh , now look ! You gon na start remembering things like that I 'll tell about the time we opened your carbuncle . " " Christ , but you 're romantic ! " They laughed together , rich replete contented laughter . " No , but you were funny looking , no kidding , " he said . " They had your hair cut shingled up the back and it was straight as a string and all bristly . You went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little tough , and when you used to get sore at me for pickin ' on you , you used to back off and try to butt your head in my stomach . Regular little character ! " Nell sat up indignantly while he laughed . " Very funny ! Do you think you was some Little Lord Fauntleroy ? You just do n't rememberabout you . You were skinny as a rail and you wore big baggy knickers and you were all over scabs and scratches . Your hair stuck straight up and your ears stuck straight out , and there was nothing to you but eyes and that goddamn hole in your chin . You used to save stamps , for God 's sakes , and you kept a mouse in a cigar box . "  |p306Sherry  shook with laughter . " I caught you playing with a doll once . All by yourself you were , talking to it and taking on over it right out loud . Christ , how sore you was , how you flew at me ! " She leaned forward , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's funny , huh ? I do n't think it 's anywhere near as funny as what I caught you playing with that time , remember ? In the bushes out there back of Kraus 's , just you and your own little . . . " " Not so little , goddamn it ! " he said , indignantly , with the mock cocking of his fist . She rolled away from him , off the side of the bed onto her feet . She stretched there for a moment luxuriously , down to her toes , her arms wide . " I wonder if there 's a shower in this rat hole , " she said , conversationally . " Look , hoist the carcass , will you , and let me have this . " As she spoke , she began tugging at the corner of the crumpled flimsy white bedspread . Sherry worked it free from the top of the bed obediently , rolling over for her to pull it away . She wrapped it around her several times , under her armpits , sarong fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she removed several bobby pins from her hair . She dropped the pins on the dresser top , and shook her hair loose on her shoulders . Sherry bunched pillows together behind his head , and settled himself in the middle of the bed , stretching blissfully supine with the latent lazy vigor of his brown muscular body . " Where 're the butts ? " Nell said from the window . " Shirt pocket , are n't they ? " " Yeah , but where 's the shirt , stupid ? " " How should I know ? " She stretched again , her body lifting and flexing , and then she searched and found the shirt on the floor beside the bed . She lighted cigarettes for both of them , her hands a little awkward with her elbows still held against her body , securing the spread around her , and then she pushed the chintz-covered armchair in front of the window . She sat comfortably there , her slim legs elevated , her crossed bare feet resting on the window sill.  |p307The  warm wind still blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotonous clanging of a train bell , and suddenly the harsh hiss of steam escaping from an engine into the darkness . " Wonderful night , " Nell said , after awhile , her voice quiet . " Wonderful , wonderful night . They must get these kind of warm nights down in the tropics . " " Not like this , they do n't , " he said lazily . " You 're talking to the old expert on those desert islands , now , kid . " " That 's right , " she said . " Funny how I could forget that . " " You was back here by then , were n't you ? Ethel must have told you when I shipped out to the Pacific . Did you ever think about me then ? " " Dah ! " she said , her voice careless . " Just creepy scared feelings sometimes , like waiting for a shell to whizz over my own head . Honest . " " You know I knew that ? " he marveled . " Jesus , that 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I always had that hunch , no matter where you were or what you were doing or how you felt about me , that you knew I was out there and that there 'd be times when you 'd feel like that , because it was the way I was feelingthen . Crazy , huh ? " " Yeah , " she said . " Because I knew even then that you 'd know out there . I had the same kind of crazy hunch . " " See what I mean ? " he said , his voice very soft . " The other part of me ! " They were silent again after that , and after awhile Nell got up and made the second trip for cigarettes , two left , and the pack crumpled in her hand . " Hey , " she said , " you know we 're runnin ' out of butts ? " " Look in your purse , " Sherry said . " And will you do something else for me while you 're up ? Will you please throw all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , " she said . " Hold back the dawn ! I 'll do that little thing . " " Yeah , you do that , " he said . She rummaged in her purse and then threw it back again disgustedlyupon the dresser top.  | " Goddamn it , you know we are out of butts , " Sherry said . " You think the old boy down at the desk could rustle us up a pack ? " " Maybe , " she said , judiciously . " Personally I do n't think he 'd even give us the time of day . " " Do n't say the time of day , " Sherry said . " Ah , well , we 'll think of something . " She walked back to the window idly , squinting her eyes in the smoke , and then leaned again with her arms braced against the sill . " Oh , hey ! " she said , all at once . " It is beginning to get daylight ! Really . " The room was suddenly very quiet , static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sherry moved at last , sitting up slowly , swinging his legs down over the side of the bed . " Nella , " he said . " Oh , God ! " She stood very still , and then she turned around to him slowly and indolently , her drapery trailing after . " Well , thanks for the lovely evening , " she said . " Come on and hit the deck , lover . Put your pants back on and go home now . " " Jesus , I was waiting for it , " Sherry said . " The bell and the next round coming up ! You could n't keep your mouth shut , could you , Nella ? You have to spoil it , you have to ... " " Look , you expect me to get my hanky out and cry with you , for God 's sakes ! " " No , I do n't expect you to , " he said . " Sweetheart , nobody has to cry for me . I 'm way past the place where I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Her voice was sharp , and her eyes very large and wide , the pupils dwindling , as she looked at him . " Just leave it alone for a minute . Before you say anything more , or I say anything more , or . . . Just for one minute , ca n't you ! " She came to him all in a rush , tripping and stumbling over the ends of the bedspread wrapped around her . She took hold of his shoulders , and then she was hugging his head tightly against her as his arms encircled her , her fingers moving lightly and unsteadily , through his hair , over his eyelids , along the line of his jaw and back again , and to the deep cleft at his chin. wanta wake up all the animals ? " he mumbled . " Oh , Christ , now you done it ! Come here ! " " Do n't ! We ca n't . Look , it 's daylight , it 's . . . " He jerked at her , pulling her down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care if it 's high noon on the courthouse steps ! Come here , I tell you ! " Her voice was clear and high , between laughter and weeping , unsteadyand muffled under him . " Well , there 's one thing you do when you 're out of cigarettes. . . . "  |p310The  streets were warming in the brightsun when Sherry came home that morning . He met the hordes of scrubbed children dawdling along their way to Sunday-school services , and from somewhere over the rooftops , a church bell pealed loudly and clearly above the sound of the traffic . Sherry walked steadily , in slow rhythmic stride , his coat slung over his arm . He turned in at the open door of the apartment house , pausing to make way for a young woman wheeling a dilapidatedgray-canvas baby carriage out to the sidewalk , another small child clinging to her skirts . He climbed the stairs then , two flights of them , and walked along the noisy odoriferous hallway , his face oblivious and drowsy . He fumbled his keys sleepily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door swung open . Tude appeared immediately in the bathroom door , clad in a soiled pink bathrobe , part of her hair wound and skewered to her head in pin curls , the rest of it hanging down in damp pale rat tails . " Where you think you been ! " she said , her voice breathless and accusing.  |p311Sherry  let the outer door slam shut , and opened the door of the small clothes closet just inside the room . Tude watched him , hands at hips , and the anger growing in her face , as he hung his coat on a hanger and loosened the belt and zipperto remove his trousers . " I said where you been ! " " Yeah , I heard you the first time . " Sherry 's voice was drowsy and unmoved . " Then what you waiting for , ca n't you understand English ? You never come home all night ! Where you been ? " Sherry found the wood and canvas shower shoes in the litter on the closet floor , and then began to undo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some woman , do n't you try to lie to me , " Tude said . She moved suddenly , darting forward , her hands clawlike . " Look at lipstick all over your shirt ! Jesus , do n't you lie to me ! " In one motion , Sherry shrugged his arms out of the sleeves and left the shirt dangling in her hands . He walked away across the crowded untidy room to the little kitchenette in the opposite corner . " Any bacon left ? " he called back to her . Tude wadded the shirt together , flinging it away from her furiouslyas she followed him . " I wo n't stand for you out with no woman makin ' a fool a me ! I wo n't stand for it ! " Sherry dropped the stiff slices of bacon into the frying pan on the gas burner , and went back to rummaging in the little refrigerator compartment . " You hear what I 'm sayin ' to you ? Why do n't you answer me ? " " Look , why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie , " he said mildly , without turning . " Soon as I eat I have to grab some sleep before I go to work . " " Listen to what I 'm sayin ' to you , " Tude shrieked at him , weepingloudly all of a sudden as she talked . " You think I 'm just dirt or somep'n ? You think you can lie to me and . . . " " Cut it out , I do n't feel like a lot of yackin ' , " Sherry said wearily . " I 'm not lying to you . Who 's lying to you ? Sure I was with a woman last night , what do you think ? Now you satisfied , is that what you wanted to hear ? "  |p312Tude  stopped crying , her face staring and incredulous for a moment , and then she wept again louder than ever , so that her voice was strangled and incoherent in her throat . She sprang at him , kickingand clawing and flailing as she came . Sherry held her off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty dishes overflowing the small shelf , and then he picked her up and carried her out of the kitchenette . He dumped her on top of the pull-down bed across the room , and then backed away out of her reach . " You better simmer down , kid , unless you want another dose of the cold-water treatment . " " How can you do this to me ? " Tude sobbed into the pillow . " Oh , how can you do this to me ? " " Oh , come on , cut it out , " Sherry said again . " Quit trying to make a grade B movie out of this . Turn off the acting and the water works . What do you care what I do ? " Tude sat bolt upright on the bed as he walked back to the kitchenette . " What you mean , what do I care ? We 're married , ai n't we ? I got the certificate , and . . . " " Yeah , you got the certificate all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you did n't marry me , honey , and you know it and I know it , so let 's relax and you cut out the dramatics , huh ? What you married was a gamble on a bus ticket to Hollywood and the free conducted tour when you got there and you lost . What do you care what I do ? I 'll do as I please , so after this leave it alone and no yelling and crying . " " You bet your life I do n't care what you do ! " Tude wailed . " You spoiling everything for me , everything ! I do n't wanta be in the family way and you wo n't help me . Why you treat me like I was just dirt or somep'n ? I got feelings same as anybody , tellin ' me right to my face you been out with some woman , makin ' a fool outa me ! Why ca n't you take me to the doctor like you said , and then us get the hell out a this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't start it , save your breath . " Sherry 's voice was drowsy again . " I said I do n't feel like talking , so simmer down . " " Nobody ever cares about me , never , " Tude wept to herself , her voice muffled in the pillow . " You got me in trouble and now , byp313Jesus , you wo n't help me . I 'm not gon na have no baby and stay here and rot in this goddamn town , I wo n't ! " Finally there was only her dreary half-hearted sniveling and then , all of a sudden , it was stilled , all the sound of her weeping stopped off and gone uncannily , right in the middle of a sob . The room was very quiet after that , and for so long that at last Sherry came out of the kitchenette inquiringly , carrying his sandwich with him in one hand and his glass of milk in the other . Tude was sitting silently upon the side of the bed , her shoulders rigid , hands dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring in the pallor of her face . " My God , now what 's the matter with you ? " At the sound , she began to tremble , her head turning slowly , her eyes focusing upon him . Her voice was queer and quiet when she spoke . " You was n't with her , was you ? You was n't with her ! " " I thought we had this all straightened out now , " he said . " Who I 'm with is my business , too . " With her eyes still fixed upon him , Tude got up from the bed and came toward him slowly with her strange sidling walk , the bathrobe gapping open around her . " I do n't care nothin ' how many women you wanta chase with , " she said . " But you stay away from her . I wo n't stand for you being with her . If you start to run around with her again , I 'll do somep'n , I do n't know what , but I 'll do somep'n . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . She stood close to him , her whole body trembling , her breathing disturbed and noisy , biting at her lips to keep them still over her chattering teeth . " You hear what I say now ! You stay away from her . I wo n't stand for it . You 'll be real sorry , both of you ! " She walked by him then , into the bathroom , and slammed the door . Sherry looked after her , and finally shrugged . But he examined his sandwich thoughtfully as though he had lost his taste for it , before he took another bite and turned back into the kitchenette.  |p314The  night after that , Tude began her vigilacross the street from the bar where Sherry was employed . She came late , a half hour before closing time , padding silently along the dark deserted sidewalk , her bare feet in flat sandals , Sherry 's raincoat wrapped and belted around her , and underneath , the skirt of her thin nightgown turned up and pinned at her waist . She came down the opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her small face pale and intent , and then plunged into the doorway of a building , swallowed up and disappeared into the blackness there . She waited , motionless and patient , her eyes steadily fixed upon the open doorway of the bar diagonally across from her . Music from the juke box spilled out loud into the darkness , and the disembodied sound of voices and laughter . The row of stools was filled , a phalanx of backs and shoulders against the mellow light behind the bar , all of them as removed and unreal as pictured figures on a silent screen . Sherry himself , moving easily and deftly , talking sometimes and laughing , all without sound , one more picture image among the others . And over all the heads , the big electric fans turning slowly , without resting , the sinister black blades slicing the drifting smoke.  |p315Tude  watched . Once she drew a cigarette from her pocket automaticallyand then put it back again , her unwinking eyes never leaving the lighted doorway . She waited until the bar was closed , the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way along the street . Then with Sherry left alone at the cash register , Tude slipped out of her concealment , moving fast , keeping to the shadows close against the front of the buildings . At the intersection , she sped through the yellow pool of light , running now with her head lowered , and then up into the next block to dive and disappearagain into the shadows of another doorway . She saw Sherry when he left the bar , calling back something over his shoulder to the proprietor at the entrance . Then he came on , walking slowly and steadily , up to the corner and turning off there in the direction for home . Tude still waited , breathless , her lip caught in her teeth . The instant that he passed out of the angle of vision , she was off , running swiftly and quietly , up to the far corner and around into the street parallel , pelting along in the darkness , her hair flying out behind her , fists clenched in her pockets , gulping air in whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next block in between the parallel streets and out of sight again , leaned back winded and restingin the shadow of a wall , before he passed at the corner . She heard him first , the slow distinctive rhythmic strike and echo of his heels upon cement , then the glimpse of him , the shine of his white shirt , the contour of his dark head , the glowing tip of his cigarette . Tude waited and ran again , leaping out from the wall with her feet digging into the surface of the sidewalk . For two more blocks she kept him under such surveillance , and on the third one she was nearly caught in spite of her precautions . She was watching for him within sight of the corner again , and , after several minutes , when he did not pass there , she darted off in that direction , running the first few steps and slowly at the last to drift forward as vigilant and wary as a cat . At the corner building , she inched the rest of the way , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved her head out to look , the cool rough brick scratching against her cheek . And then she froze where she was , with Sherry not six feetp316from her where he stood regretfully rattling the knob on the door of a hamburger stand , which , in spite of the lights still on within , was closed apparently for the night . Tude jerked her head back around the corner of the building , and leaned against the wall , her eyes closing , her legs rubbery , the perspiration coming out upon her face . Sherry walked on again and this time Tude sped off in the direction of home herself , but by a more circuitous route . She ran all the way , and once , rounding a corner , she collided head on with a short fat man in dark trousers and a visored cap who was navigating underdifficulties from the opposite direction exhuding a strong odor of whisky . Tude disentangled herself impatiently and the man was left behind , lurching to regain his balance , arms waving as he danced a disjointed minuet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberating between the brick walls as he called after her , " Hey , little girl ! Where you goin ' so fast , honey ? " When she reached the block in which the apartment house was located she was slowing and tired and winded , but she ran on in one last desperate burst of speed , plunging into the dark interior of the lower hallway , and then the stairs , two flights of them , all with the same desperate cautious light-footed urgency . She was closing the apartment door softly while her hands already fumbled and yanked at the belt of the raincoat . She flung the coat into the crowded chaos of the clothes closet and ran across the room to the waiting pull-down bed , opening the safety pins that held the skirt of her thin blue nightgown doubled upward , as she went . She threw the pins onto the floor , and paused for the hasty undoing of her sandal straps . With her shoes kicked away , she was instantly in the bed with the covers drawn up to her waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , the half-filled glass of CocaColawaiting on the table , and for good measure she lighted a cigarettebefore she allowed herself to settle back against the wadded pillows . Then the haste left her , her body suddenly gone slack , her eyes closed , her face a little pale and sick from her exertions as she struggled to quiet her heavy noisy breathing . It was less than five minutes that she had to spare before the key turned over quietly in the lock . Sherry eased the door open softly ,  |p317and  then at the sight of the lighted room within , allowed it to swing on the rest of the way . Tude looked up from the bed as he came in , without interest or friendliness , and then turned a page of her magazine and took a sip from the glass in her hand . " Jesus , it 's stuffy in here , " Sherry said . " You shut the windows or what ? " " I never touched the damn old windows , " Tude said , virtuously . " You told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Never get any air in this dump , " Sherry said , wearily . His face was tired as he went to the clothes closet , shoving hard at the row of garment hangers to make the room to squeeze in his coat . From a shelf overhead he took down the bundle of bed coverings and pillow and dropped them onto the sagging divan as he walked by it on his way to the kitchenette . He turned on the light there and stood for a moment , gloomily surveying the unappetizing litter . " It ai n't raining , is it ? " Tude called to him . " It really looked like rain this afternoon . " " No , it is n't raining . " Sherry carried a grease-encrusted frying pan to the microscopic sink already piled with dirty dishes and started a faucet running . Over the splashing water he said , " How come you 're yackin ' about the weather tonight all of a sudden , toots ? You would n't noticeit if it snowed in July . " A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom , with the sounds and odors of percolating coffee and frying hamburger from the kitchenette behind him . " You got a dirty face , kid , " he said to her impersonally from the doorway . " Black smear of something on your cheek . What you been stickin ' your nose into now ? " Tude scrabbled for Kleenex under her pillows , scrubbing hard at her face with it , and looking in quick verification for the black smudge upon the white tissue . Then she wadded the tissue and tossed it to the floor , her eyes wary upon the door closed after him . For the next two nights , Tude continued to watch at the bar , and each night was very much as the first one had been : the patient waiting in the shadows of doorways , the breathless racing throughp318dark streets , the final desperate sprint for home with only minutes to spare before Sherry 's own arrival there . Then on the third night when Tude set out again , she discovered that a light rain was falling , enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rooftop and trash can and lamp post . She lingered doubtfully for a little in the lower hallway of the apartment building , but at last she bolted back up the stairs for the square of waterproof plastic rummaged from a bureau drawer , folded in tricorner and tied and pinned securely over her head . By the time she reached her point of lookout , her feet were wet and cold , and she was shivering against the clammy cement wall of the doorway . The windows of the bar across the street were blurred with slow-gathering drops of water , but the door stood open as before , the light streaming out and caught upon the sidewalk in a sparkling yellow reflection . There was the music and voices and laughter , but half of the stools were unoccupied tonight . On the long side of the bar there were only four men bunched together and in their midst , a tall girl with short yellow hair . The girl talked with great animation , head bobbing , her hands moving and expressive . And each time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each time the girl herself looked quickly to Sherry , and his quiet noncommittal face . Tude hissed , softly and contemptuously , and rubbed hard at her damp cold nose with the palm of her hand . At the far end of the bar , two women sat together , plump women with bright make-up over their sagging heavy faces , and Tude merely gave them one cold glance of dismissal . But at the near end of the bar by the door , a girl sat alone , heels hooked over the rung of the stool , long red hair spilling over the shoulders of her raincoat . Tude fastened upon her , studying her intently , but even as she looked , the girl stood down , gathering up her purse and cigarettes . She came through the doorway , calling back a good night casually in answer to Sherry as he picked up her empty glass and ash tray . On the street , she turned up her collar against the weather and walked away rapidly , the sound of her feet fading away into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one cold foot and thenp319the other from the damp stone step . She pulled the coat closer around her shivering body and looked once more at all of them there inside the bar . She stepped down then and began to drift along indecisively in the shadow close to the front of the building . She had gone no more than four or five steps when she saw the bright yellow taxi cab pulling in fast to the curb at the corner , and instantly she darted back , safe into the black shadow of the doorway . She heard the door slam and the roar of the motor and splash of water as the cab drove away , and suddenly she leaned against the wall , swallowing convulsively in nausea , her legs weak , her heart pounding . She turned her head to look slowly and reluctantly , and what she saw was as utterly familiar to her as though she had seen it all happen before : Nell walking down the glistening strip of sidewalkwith her slow indolent stride , her short black coat over her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and tied . Tude bit into the tight knuckles of her hand and watched Nell 's slim black heels strike water in the golden puddle of light outside the door . And she saw Sherry 's face when he looked up , coming fiercely alive for an instant , and then as instantly quiet and unrevealing again . Tude huddled shivering against the wall and watched , chewing at her fist , a roaring in her ears , and all the mists and vapors of the night before her eyes . She saw Nell , calmly sitting sidewise on a bar stool with her long legs crossed , then raising her hand to lift her hair and shake it free again over her collar ; Sherry pausing there across the bar top and the few words spoken ; the little group of men clustered around theyellow-haired girl spreading and disintegrating , so that it became a larger group with Nell a part of it . She heard the mingling voices , and a burst of laughter once , all of them laughing , Sherry laughing too , and Nell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the juke box , and the laughter . Tude watched , beyond the urgency of time and the cold and the wet . Bar closing came with noisy departures and leavetakings , until there was only Nell and Sherry left there . And Sherry came to Nellp320then , talking to her for a moment with complete preoccupation , and then his hand reached out , his fingers mixing into the dark hair at the back of her head , pulling her nearer as they kissed . Tude closed her eyes and fought the churning of her stomach , and spit one mouthful of vomit into a wadded Kleenex in her hand . The proprietor came , hurrying down the street with the ring of keys jingling in his fingers , and a few moments later Nell and Sherry came out the doorway together . They paused there for a moment , Sherry looking upward into the darkness complainingly and holding his hand palm up to test the weather , and Nell with hands thrust in pockets saying something to him , the familiar teasing half-mockery in her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy strides , to the corner and turning in perfectaccord . Tude watched them go , and stepped down out of her doorway , her feet numbed and stumbling , and followed slowly after . She stood at the corner intersection without pretense of concealmentand saw them again , walking rapidly down the next block , and she turned after them . A little farther on the rain came down hard suddenly for a moment , and the pair ahead joined hands and ran for it , running easily and lithely together , Nell with her skirt held hiked above her knees for the freedom of her legs . Tude ran too then , in a kind of lifeless jog trot , her eyes never leaving them , oblivious to the water striking at her face . The rain lessened to a mist again , and in unfamiliar territory now , Tude almost lost them . She stood on another corner , staring in all three directions , until down one block she saw the globes of light at an entrance , dimmed and yellow through the moisture . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had a last glimpse of them , brushing and shaking water from their clothingbefore Sherry pulled open the door and Nell ducked in under his arm . Tude waited , and then came slowly down the opposite side of the street . There was no sign of them any longer through the glass door , only the empty shadowy hotel lobby and the old man dozing behind the desk.  |p321Tude  stood there for a long time staring at the building and the lobby door and the two yellow globes of light , and from the freight yards down the street a train engine hooted scornfully time after time over the clanging of a bell . It began to rain hard again , and Tude moved , walking off slowly toward home.  |p322Tude  was in bed that morning whenSherry returned to the apartment , and she was still in bed when he awakened at the other end of the day . When he was dressed and ready to leave , he hesitated in the shadowyroom , looking toward the bed and the small still mound of her body under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn opaque window shades . He heard the sound of her deep even breathing , and he saw the stack of dirty dishes dotted with mashed cigarette butts on the table beside her , evidence of a meal she had eaten sometime while he slept . And then he went , quietly closing the door after him . As though the sound of the shutting door had been a signal for which she waited , Tude instantly flung back the covers and left the bed , wide awake and filled with purposeful energy . She spent a long time in front of the bathroom mirror slowly and meticulously windingand pinning several dozen flat spiral curls over her head . When she was finished , she turned on lights through the apartment , and raised windows high . She hunted a stumpy worn-out broom and rags , and scampered from one corner to another in an unsystematic frantic orgy of housecleaning . For the first time since their occu/pancy there , she folded back the covers and returned the pull-down bed to its vertical position in a niche in the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sink onto the worn square of linoleum under her feet , and then wiping up the floor carefully with one of her dirty dustclothes when she was done . She collected empty Coca-Cola bottles from under every chair , and heaping ash trays from each table and window sill . She ruthlessly crammed more shoes and strewn articles of soiled clothing into the long-suffering clothes closet . She did not stop until she had satisfied herself that the apartment was in order . Then she hunted food out of the little refrigerator and ate her lunch standing at the shelf in the kitchenette . When she was finished , she wiped away the crumbs carefully and rinsed each dirty dish under the faucet and returned it to the cupboard . She bathed leisurely under the shower in the bathroom , and spent another interminable period leaned close to the mirror with the shiny tweezers , plucking a hair here and there after great concentration , for the better shaping of her pale eyebrows . She spent a much longer time manicuring her fingernails and drying the brightcoloredpolish on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all intently , her face brooding and dissatisfied . She lowered windows and shades part way against the darkness and a spatter of rain fallingoutside . She straightened magazines into a tidier stack on the library table ; she picked bits of lint and ravelings from the backs of the frayed divan and upholstered chair ; she folded damp towels over the racks in the tiny bathroom . Still unsatisfied , she went to rummage finally in the closet . She found the battered card table there , with a stained brown pasteboardtop and flimsy legs folded flat beneath . She tugged at it determinedly , pulling it out into the room together with a tumbling suitcase , a bed pillow and a wad of crumpled clothing . She wiped dust from the table with the dish towel from the kitchenette , and then exploredthe mechanism for standing it upon its legs . One of the slidingmetal catches was worn out but with the aid of a doubled empty match folder she coaxed it into place and then leaned upon the table top gingerly to test its solidness.  |p324She  carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one upholstered chair in the room , moving the floor lamp back a little for exactly the desired amount of lighting . She set a place at the table , plate and cup and saucer and silver , and then surveyed it for a moment , her face pleased at last as she scurried back to the clothes closet . She dressed in a full-skirted housecoat of dark-green taffeta , a discarded one that Nell had given to her , and paraded in it for a little , appreciatively , turning quickly each time so that the long skirt swished and rustled around her legs . Then with sudden preoccupation , she ran into the bathroom , standing on tiptoe before the mirror to smooth the fabric anxiously over the slight fancied swelling of her belly . She ran out again to consult the alarm clock on the library table , and hurried back unwinding the thin scarf from her head as she went . She unpinned her hair before the mirror , working rapidly and skillfully , combing it into large soft curls and waves , and securing it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running back and forth , to drawers frantically for lipstick , mascara and eyebrow pencil , with a heavy dousing of cheap sweet perfume and various pins and earrings and necklaces tried for added effect . She was done at last and seated in a chair , triumphantly elegant with a magazine spread open across her knees , just as the clock reached the hour when Sherry was wont to arrive at the apartment . She waited , nervously flipping the pages of the magazine , her face strained and listening , her eyes returning to the clock face time after time . The minutes crept along and there was no sound at all except for the rain spattering hard against the windows . The magazine slipped out of Tude 's hands finally and she lighted a cigarette . She smoked three of them steadily , one after another , and then she arose and walked about the room rapidly , tidying the pile of magazines into a still neater alignment , emptying out the ash tray she had used into the toilet , shaking the folds of the limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while , her eyes moving to the door and back to the clock and to the door again . She waited agonizingly for over an hour , her body continuallyp325tensed and poised and listening , and then she gave up . She sat down again , her elegant skirt crumpled under her and forgotten , her small face stark and tragic in her disappointment . The rain drummed at the windows impersonally , but Tude did not cry . She merely got up after awhile and slowly took off her finery , returned the unused dishware to the cupboard , jammed the unneeded card table back into the closet , pulled the bed back down from its niche in the wall . She lay in the bed for a long time in the darkness before she slept . She did it all over again the next day with a kind of cunning desperate patience . Again she stayed quiet and waiting in her bed until Sherry was gone from the apartment . Again she worked painstakingly by the mirror , winding and pinning her damp hair into the myriad curlicues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done and went down the stairs to the street , a scarf wound about her head , her short full coat over her shoulders . She walked rapidly through the chill windy twilight of another overcast day that threatened rain . She walked purposefully , crossing streets , turning at corners , until she arrived at her destination . It was the busy corner of a main thoroughfare , a bus stop , where a news stand and an open-air flower stall did business side by side . Tude mingled with the crowd , her eyes watchful . She lingered and chose her moment judiciously , when the flower seller turned away to count change and bills into the hands of a waiting customer . Then Tude moved in , bending down to lift a little bunch of pink and blue flowers from a pail of water , instantly concealing it under her coat before she mixed back into the crowd milling at the crossing . She walked rapidly back toward home , and although her quickenedfrightened breathing quieted , her hand that held the wet stems of the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the apartment , she tidied and cleaned and straightened , and again pushed the bed up into the wall . Again she washed the dishes and cleared the kitchenette . And again she set up the card table before the easy chair , dishes in place upon its bare discoloredp326top . This time she added her small bouquet , a little crumpled from its hiding place beneath her coat , but still bright and sweet smelling , and distinctly festive in that room ; garden pinks and bachelor buttons in a water glass , and under it a dusty crocheted doily that she borrowed from the library table . Tude surveyed her table settingproudly , and then went off to make herself ready . Sherry came home that night through intermittent showers of rain , and climbed the two flights of stairs to the apartment wearily . He turned the key softly , and the door swung open to a lighted room . " Hi ? " Tude said , quickly and tentatively . Sherry answered her with a grunt in his throat as he undertook the perilous business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat . The coat was wet and he carried it into the bathroom to suspend it from the metal shower-curtain rod . He came out yawning , but just outside the door he stopped dead still , staring into the room ahead of him . " For Christ sakes , what happened to the bed ? " " Nothin ' happened to it , " Tude said . " I just put it up in the wall where it goes . " Sherry looked at her then as she arose from her chair slowly , her elegant dark-green taffeta rustling around her slender legs , her pale soft hair curled and upcombed so that her face as always appeared slimmer and older to him and a little strange , her wide brown eyes appealing between carefully applied mascara , and the long dangling rhinestone earrings sparkling as she moved . " Sit down , " Tude said . " I 'll fix you somep'n to eat right away . I guess you 're real tired . Go on , sit down . " Sherry saw the table then , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darted away , and instantly from the kitchenettethere was a banging of drawers and cupboard doors , a frantic crashing of cooking utensils and a splashing of water as though the little nook threatened to explode with fierce activity . Sherry sat in the easy chair and stared at the place setting on the card table in front of him , and poked at a bachelor button in the water glass with one stiff amazed finger . He lighted a cigarette , andp327when he reached for an ash tray he held it in his hand for a moment , staring at its pristine cleanliness unbelievingly . " Well , I 'll be damned ! " he said softly . " You say somep'n ? " Tude called over the clatter from the kitchenette . " No , I did n't say anything , " Sherry called back . He leaned back in the chair then , his eyes roving over the room with its newly acquired look of attempted tidiness and housekeeping . Along with the other noise from the kitchenette there was the sound of bacon frying and the hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took on a posture of waiting of his own , his face quiet again and unrevealing . Several minutes passed , and then Tude flew out into the room to put the plate down before him on top of the one already there upon the table , scorched pieces of toast , and a tangle of greasy overcookedeggs and bacon . Sherry looked at the unappetizing platefuland picked up his fork without hesitation . " Hey , this is nice , " he said . " You 're quite a cook , kid . " Tude watched him fixedly without answering as he took the first several bites . When it seemed apparent that he would eat the food without complaint , she flew back toward the kitchenette again , with her long skirt swishing after her . " I 'll git your coffee right away . " " Hold the coffee , huh ? I 'll have it when I finish . " She returned in a moment to hover over the table while he ate . As soon as his plate began to empty , she said quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want more toast or eggs or somep'n ? " " Uh uh , " he said . " This is just right . Thanks . " Tude waited , watching him unwinkingly down to the last greasedrippingforkful , and then she snatched up the plates and carried them away together with his cup and saucer . When she brought in the coffee , Sherry was lighting a cigarette , and he gestured toward the flowers on the table with the burned match.  | " These are pretty , " he said . " Everything around this joint looks pretty nice tonight , you know that ? " " You want me to bring some a that liquor you got , " Tude said steadily , " like you drink with coffee sometimes ? " " That 's just what I wanted , " Sherry said . " But listen , cut out all this waiting on me , will you ? Bring the bottle in here and the coffee pot , then I 'll be all set . " She brought them obediently , and Sherry pulled the cork from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaming strong black coffee . He sniffed at the aroma as he lifted the cup . " Hey , this hits the spot on a wet night ! How about you , kid ? You like some coffee or a beer or something ? " " No , I do n't want nothin ' , " Tude said . She watched him as he drank and then held the thick white cup between his hands for a moment before he drank again . She moved off a little , lighting a cigarette and putting it down , smoothing quickly and carefully at her hair where it was combed up sleek over the back of her head . Sherry added more coffee and then brandy to his cup , and sampledit again . " You know , this is really nice , " he said in the silence . " Coming home and finding you up and having something to eat like this . " " Why you wanta say that ? " she said . " You kiddin ' me or somep'n ? " " I 'm not kidding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at him for a moment silently , and then moved away with her strange dawdling walk , tidying the pile of magazines on the library table again automatically , and tweaking and straightening at the dusty drapes . " Come on , sit down , " he said . " I 'll let you try a slug of my coffee , if you want to . " She did not answer him , prowling on around the room , her face tense and preoccupied . Sherry did not speak again but he watched her . When his cup was empty he replenished it from the bottle and the coffee pot , and then he leaned back in the chair , loosening his tie and shirt collar ,  |p329settling  down so that his body was slouched and comfortable while the rain pattered against the windows . " Okay , what 's the pitch ? " he said , finally , his voice soft . " What you got on your mind anyway ? " Tude stopped still , glancing at him quickly over her shoulder and then away . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ? " " You may as well get it over with and relax . What was all this for anyway ? " Tude turned and stood for a moment , her eyes wide open , her body tensing and gathering together . She sucked in a great breath of air and then came to him running , flinging herself upon him , her body pressing and caressing and urging , her arms tight over his shoulders . Sherry sat motionless , his hands grasping into the chair arms . " Aw , come on and love me , honey , " she whispered . " Gim me a little loving ! Igo crazy livin ' here with you unless you gim me some lovin ' , honey ! " Sherry stood up slowly , and she came with him , her hands clasped tightly at the back of his neck , her body stretched up and rhythmically and insistently pushing against his , her head flung back , eyes closed and mouth moist and open . He looked down into her face and then unhurriedly he reached up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding to her wrists , and she began to tremble , her eyes still closed . " Aw , come on , honey ! Please , honey ! " He let her go abruptly , knocking against the flimsy card table so that all the little flowers trembled in the water glass . He walked across the room to the dark windows and the falling rain outside , and from behind him , Tude said , her voice high and sharp , " What 's the matter with you ? You liked me all right that time we did it , did n't you ? " Sherry did not answer her . He stood for a time , and when he turned finally his face was tired , his eyes looked inward , his smile wry and self-mocking . Tude was sitting in the chair that he had left , her body sagging and apathetic now , her elaborate hair-do carelessly dropped forward between her two supporting hands.  | " Whatever it is you want , you better try some other way , " Sherry said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He came to the table slowly , reaching for cigarettes and he spoke again without looking at her . " What were you really after anyway ? You still bound I 'll take you to a doctor , is that it ? " She did not seem to hear him , and after a moment he said , " Okay , kid , I 'm sick and tired of it . You listen to what I 'm gon na say for a minute . " He hesitated , his face frowning , and when he went on , he spoke more rapidly , his voice a little strained . " You know what Fay was sick with and the way she died of it . Well , Fay had a  --  an abortion once , see ? Christ , they do n't nobody know about those things , but she always claimed it was having that abortion that time that made her get sick the way she did . That 's what Fay always thought . So that 's all there is to it , that 's the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my head full of Fay and I had my head full of that , or you would n't have that certificate you got now . That 's the whole story . And now I 'm sick and tired of it , and I say the hell with it . If you want it so bad as all this , it 's your own business . I have n't been pushing you around just for the fun of it . I 'll take you to a doc tomorrow . You hear what I 'm telling you ? " " Leave me alone , " Tude said . " Shut up and leave me alone . " He reached down then , his fingers digging hard into her shoulder . " Did you hear what I said ? I said I 'll take you to see a doctor tomorrow . You can go to a doctor and get fixed up the way you been yapping to do , day in and day out around here . If you want it so bad as all this , I 'll take you tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me alone , why ca n't you ! I do n't want to go to no doctor ! " Sherry stood transfixed , his hand falling away from her shoulder . " What . . . you mean you do n't want to go to a doctor ! " She looked up at him for an instant , her eyes dark and steady inher furious small face . " Listen here , you ! " she said , each word slow and distinct and deadly spaced . " I would n't go to no doctor now for a million dol-lars ! " Sherry stood beside her and the room was warm and bright andp331static around them . He swung around suddenly , plunging into the bathroom , jerking down the damp raincoat , with the wire hanger falling and clattering and bouncing on the floor behind him . He called back from the door , struggling into his coat . " I 'm gon na take a walk . Go on to bed , for Christ 's sakes ! " When the door banged after him , Tude dropped her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fiercely , without a sound , and the little flowers nodded , bright above her pale tumbling hair.  |p332The  rain wore itself out , and the weathercame off bright and warm again . The nights , particularly , were warm and stuffy that following week , and the bar where Sherry was employed and others like it throughout the city did a lively beer trade up until the very hour of closing . For several nights , because of it , Sherry was detained later than usual finishing his work , and one night when he was finally done he set out directly for the hotel . The dark streets were still warm and more populated than usual at this hour , late strollers reluctant to return to their hot airless rooms . Sherry whistled softly as he passed them , walking jauntily , and overhead the stars scattered bright in the dark angular bits of sky between the sloping roofs and walls of buildings . When he caught the first faraway sound of tolling bells and busy train signals from the freight yards , he smiled and walked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps between the yellow globes of light , and pulled open the door into the musty lobby . He stopped at the desk , leaning over his elbows , his coat folded on his arm.  | " It 's Burton , " he said to the old man sitting there . " In case you do n't remember . Larry Burton . Mrs. Burton 's probably checked in already . " The old man moved rheumatically , his hand stretching up to the board hung with numbered keys on pegs , above his head . " She 's in 307 , " he said peevishly . " This here 's the only other key we got , so mind you do n't let ' em fall down the toilet now . " " Why , Mr. Sweeney ! " Sherry said happily . " Guests maybe throw keys down toilets in some fleabag like the Waldorf , for God 's sakes , but this here 's a high-class hotel ! " The old man snorted , and Sherry scooped up the key , tossing it and catching it again as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a good good night to you , . " sir . He walked off to the elevator , pushing buttons there in a merry tattoo , and then whistling again as the cage rose slowly in the shaft above the faintly humming motor . He went down the dim corridor above swiftly , and jabbed the key into the lock . When the door swung in , Nell looked up at him from where she reclined upon the bed in a welter of opened newspapers , her skirt wrinkled high on her slender legs . " Mrs. Burton , as I live ! " Sherry said . " You think I 'd stood you up . " " Why , Mr. Burton , how you talk ! " Nell answered him . " I never even dreamed of it ! " " Feel real good , huh ? " Sherry said , grinning at her as he closed the door . " Feel real cocky , all rarin ' to go , huh ? " " Who 's real cocky ? You 're bustin ' out all over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed , leaning down to kiss her . When they were through , and while he brushed hair back from her face with his fingers , she said , " How you feel ? You all right ? " " I 'm fine . How about you , you all right ? " " Sure , " Nell said . " Could n't be better . Really . Listen , I got some beer in the bathtub . " " Atta baby , " Sherry said . " Well , what 's new by the papers ? Jesus , I thought I 'd never get away from that dump over there , tonight.  |p334Look  , I 'm gettin ' dishpan hands , for God 's sakes ! Oh , hey , I brought you something . " " What you bring me ? " Nell said . " Come on , where is it , what you bring me ? " " Keep your shirt on a minute , it 's here in my coat , " Sherry complained . " You damn women , nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? ' Anything to eat around here , Mrs. B. ? Here he is , meet Oswald . " He held it out to her upon the palm of his hand , a small shaggy gray toy bear in a lifelike posture upon all fours , with lowered head . " Hey , I like him , " she said . " But not Oswald . He 's definitely not an Oswald . Give him to me . " " Wait a minute , ca n't you ? You have n't seen him yet . He winds up . What 's the matter with Oswald ? " While he turned the key , she lazily piled newspapers together on the bed to make a place . " Does n't look like Oswald , that 's all . Why , I brought a stack of sandwiches and stuff , and there 's milk in with the beer . You starved to death , poor baby ? " " Could eat a horse , that 's all , " Sherry said . " God , must n't ever say that in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toy down upon the newspapers and it moved and circledin a lumbering ludicrous gait , with the lifelike wrinkling of the shaggy hide behind the neck . " Oh , wonderful , " Nell said . " Will you look at that ! I love him . Where 'd you get him ? " She rolled over onto her stomach , propping her chin upon her arms , the better to watch , her legs lifted behind her and crossed at the ankles . " Old guy came in the place selling them tonight , " Sherry said . " I thought of you right off , my peace-lovin ' little she-bear , you ! Look , you shut all the windows in here , or what ? You ca n't breathe in here . " " I know better'n to shut windows around you , nature boy , " Nell said , her eyes fixed dreamily upon the slowly gyrating toy . " It 's just hot tonight , that 's all . You think he looks like a Buster maybe ? Lis/ten , I got something for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to see it , so let 's get it over with . " " Naw , not Buster , " Sherry said , judiciously . " How about Bruno , the Bruin ? I 'll still take Oswald . What you got for me , goody gum drop ? " She fumbled in her opened purse beside her , her eyes still fixed upon the toy . " I said not for fun . Read it and get rid of it . " She held it out to him at last , several folded sheets of cheap ruled notepaper . " How about Egbert ? " Sherry said , yawning . " Listen , what am I setting around here for , I 'm a hungry , thirsty man . What is this ? " And then again as he spread open the sheets in his hands , " Jesus Christ , what is this ? " The toy stopped at last , and Nell picked it up , rolling over onto her back again with a crackling of newspaper under her , settling her shoulders comfortably against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine it . " Has to begin with a B , Mr. B. " she said , her voice carefully light . " Let 's see , not Bartholomew , or Benny , or Bozo . . . Let me seeIt was a letter that she had given him , written on tablet paper with a hard pencil , straggling clumsy large block-letter printing coveringeach page on either side . It was a letter written to Nell , and Sherry read through it grimly , through each threat and each obscenityto the end of it , and it was unsigned . When he was done he stood up abruptly , impotent anger in the posture of his body , and in his face . " Where 's the envelop this thing come in ? " " There in my purse , I guess , " Nell said , without looking at him . " Not Bojangles either , I do n't think Bojangles , do you ? Maybe I should have thrown it out when it come this morning like I felt like doing . But it mentions you in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I did n't want to show it to you , for God 's sakes ! " He examined the envelop quickly , holding it to the light , but it was no more revealing than the letter itself , only an innocuous thin cheap white envelop addressed to Nell in the same hard pencil withp336the same crude disguised lettering , and postmarked from the city . Sherry studied it on either side , and then struck it with the tips of his fingers , angrily . " Ah , I got it , " Nell said . " Boris . Boris B. Burton , the bear . Now is n't that better than Oswald ? " " Yeah , " Sherry said . " That 's better than Oswald . Christ , who could sit down and write a stinking thing like this ? " " Oh , somebody that do n't like me much , " Nell said calmly . " And somebody that do n't intend to have me messin ' around with you either , sweetie . Ah look , they say people write this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , I bet ! " he said . He jerked at his tie and shirt collar , loosening them , and then began to read the first sheet of the letter over again . Part way through he wadded it together savagely in his hands . " Jesus , no wonder they did n't dare sign their name ! " He straightened the paper out again impatiently , opening the folder of matches , and then hesitated . " Listen , Nella , it 's up to you . What you want to do with this ? " " I say burn it and the hell with it , " Nell said . " Somebody just got something out of their system , that 's all . " He stood a moment longer and then he strode to the bureau and the ash tray there . He struck the match and turned the sheet from one side to another , while the bright quick flame crumpled and ate the paper from his hand . He started on the next sheet of it , the pale orange flame flickering the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in the silence , his voice expressionless , " You thinking it came from the same place I 'm thinking about ? " " I suppose so , " Nell said , slowly . She was still for a moment , examining one shaggy paw of the toy bear intently . " Your child bride know that many dirty words ? " " Well , does she ? " Sherry said levelly . " You know her better than I do . " " Oh , the hell with it , " Nell said . " Really . Unless .. Sherry frowned , igniting the last sheet from the one before , and deftly dropping the fragile wisp of black ash into the tray.  | " Unless what ? " " Oh , just unless , " she said . " Like  --  unless you think we ought to lay off if somebody feels this nasty about us . " " That does n't sound like you , sweetheart , " Sherry said . " There , that 's the end of the damn thing . You better save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it back and returned it to her purse , and then he stayed bent forward , his hands braced upon the footrail of the bed , smiling as he looked at her . " What 's the matter , Mrs. Burton ? " he said , mockingly . " You like to use this to hang something else on ? You would n't be trying to crawl out , would you ? Like to say uncle ' and take your dolls and go on home now , is that it ? " Nell dropped the toy beside her , and stretched wide and leisurely , her eyes slanting at him . " Not me , chum ! I just thought you might like to . " " Uh uh , not me , " Sherry said , cheerfully . And then he said , " Listen , Nella , I 'm sorry as hell about that damn thing . It must have give you the creeps , a thing like that and no name signed to it , or ... " Why should you be sorry ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baby ? Maybe she did n't either . It 's a big world full of funny people . " " Yeah , it 's a big world , " Sherry said thoughtfully . " But I got a hunch about it . It fits . A couple things are beginning to fit . Jesus , you know this is liable to turn out to be a real sweet mess ? " " Oh , brother ! " Nell began to laugh , her whole body shaking with amusement . " You mean you just thought of that just now ? Look , sweetie , it 's funny , I ca n't help it . You kill me ! Old big-time operatorBurton just bull headin ' along , blasting everything wide open , right out of one mess , right into another mess ! Sharp as a tack , busy as a beaver ... " Her voice trailed off into helpless peals of laughter , and Sherry said disgustedly , " Very funny , very funny ! I know another bullheadedBurton that does n't look so extra bright , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears right along with me , baby . Quit your laughing at me before you get a sock in the choppers ! "  | " It 's a bird , it 's a plane , it 's Superman ! " Nell gasped through tears of laughter . " The man 's mad . Blastin ' along ninety miles an hour , in the bucks , out of the bucks , marrying the girls like some guys shuck peanuts , and ... " " Cut it out , " Sherry said as he advanced upon her . " Goddamn it , shake your fanny out of that bed and get me something to eat ! Guy comes home from a hard night 's work and what does he get ? A bloody laughing hyena ! How long 's it been since I gave you a good threshing anyway ? Come on , on your feet ! Or should I drop you in the tub in there to cool off along with the beer bottles ? " They struggled on the bed as he hauled her up , Nell weak with laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried . " You 're settin ' right on Boris ! "  |p339Saturday  morning , Tude crept out of bedquietly while Sherry slept . Her clothing was collected and ready in the bathroom , and she dressed carefully and hurriedly there . She put on her best dress , hose and shoes , elaboratelycombed her hair and carefully put make-up on her face . When she was ready , her purse in her hands , she tiptoed out into the other room and stood for a moment , listening intently . Sherry slept deeply and peacefully on the sagging divan , his body still , his face hidden , burrowed away from the light . Tude slipped across the room to where his trousers hung from a chair back , reconnoitering the location of the pockets for a second before she dipped her hand noiselessly into one of them . She came up with a handful of change , and after one swift glance , the reassuring shine of silver coins among the copper ones , she dropped it all uncountedinto her open purse and glided off again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , the sun was already high overhead , and glaring bright in a pale unclouded sky . Tude trudged patiently the several blocks to the bus stop through the stifling heat rising from cement and brick walls.  |p340She  rode the bus to the center of town and then walked rapidly across a busy street and down another block , carrying a white transfer slip in her hand . She waited by the curb at the second bus stop while the cosmetics on her face caked and melted under the noonday sun and her curls wilted and straggled at her neck . Aboard the other bus at last , she sank into a seat and rode for a long time with her head leaned back , her face pale and exhaustedlooking . But finally she sat erect and resolutely put fresh lipstick on her mouth and fussed at her hair before a little cracked square of pocket mirror . She watched out the window after that , slid forward to the front of her seat , gripping at her purse upon her knees so tightly that her fingers left wet smears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way out to the edge of town and left the bus at the corner by the filling station . She lingered there by the highway for a moment as though she were reluctant to go farther , and then she set off up the hill , her feet sinking and slipping in the thick yellow dust of the road . She climbed steadily in the blinding sun , the little black stump of her shadow moving with her , and where the road angled at the hilltop , she passed into a suffocating gloom beneath the intermixed boughs of the motionless tall trees . Tude walked faster , licking at drops of perspiration on her upper lip . Ahead of her , Schirmers ' house stood baked and weatherbeaten in the heat , and she watched it as she came , her eyes never leaving it . But it was at the house across the street that she turned in , cuttingdiagonally along the path worn through the thick grass of the lawn to the steps . Without pausing , she crossed the worn porch boards swiftly and quietly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worrying her purse in her hands as she stood , her face strained and frightened . The room on the other side of the screen was still and empty , crowded with dark bulks of furniture in the dim light behind the drawn window shades . From a radio somewhere there was the loud flowing excited voice of a sports commentator , the sound eerie in the silence , as though the machine played on in a deserted house.  |p341Tude  stood , and at last she rapped on the door , a loud urgent tattooing of her knuckles against the warped wooden frame . It was Aunt Ethel who came in answer to the summons , hurrying from the direction of the kitchen , straightening her hair and droppinga soiled apron behind her on a chair back . She saw Tude through the screen before she reached it , and she broke step , stumblingover her own feet suddenly , her warm pink face instantly vacantand shocked . When she came on again she walked slowly and uncertainly , her hand doubled against her chin . " Oh , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Sherry . . . ? Wo n't you come in ? " " Hi , " Tude said , her voice thin and distant . Aunt Ethel held the door for her to enter , and Tude sidled a few steps into the room and stood rooted again , opening and closing the clasp of her purse with a nervous loud metallic snapping . " My , it come off hot today , did n't it ? We was just having somep'n to eat . " Aunt Ethel 's voice was frightened and mechanical . " Do n't you want to set down ? Would you like to have some coffee and a bite with us ? They 're to the table if you 'd like to come out . " Aunt Ethel plunged back toward the kitchen and Tude trailed after her . It was Clyde who saw her first from his place at the end of the table , and he stared with his eyes blinking fast behind his glasses . Then Pa turned , his knife and fork clattering onto his plate , his hands moving back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gristled stubble of beard gathered and waiting . " Hi , " Tude said again , licking at her lips . At the stove , Aunt Ethel lifted the big graniteware coffee pot unsteadilyso that it tilted and slopped over . She put it down again with a crash and whirled around , her hands lifting to her face , her voice sharp and loud and half-weeping in the silence . " Oh , what 's happened to Sherry ? Where is he ? Tell us what 's the matter ! " " Nothin 's happened to him , " Tude said . " I  --  just come to see you . The room was still again and finally Pa said , clearing his throat , " Wo n't you have a seat ? "  |p342Tude  hesitated and then came to the table quickly , sliding out a chair and pulling it back several feet from the table . She sat stiffly on the very edge of the seat , holding tightly to her purse , her feet nervously shifting and unsettled until they came to rest at last with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shoe . " Let me get you a cup a coffee , " Aunt Ethel said . " I do n't want no coffee , " Tude said quickly . " I sure could use a drink a water , though . " They were all silent in the hot airless kitchen while the water from the faucet splashed noisily into the sink and the radio played on loudly from another room . Aunt Ethel brought the dripping glass and waited while Tude drank from it thirstily . When Aunt Ethel had carried the glass back to the sink , Tude said finally , " It 's real hot today , is n't it ? " After a little too long a pause , it was Clyde who answered her . " Yeah , it sure is . Looks like we 're in for another hot spell , all right . " The room was full of their waiting : Pa staring ahead of him unseeinglyat his plate , Clyde gulping coffee and setting his cup back in the saucer and lifting it immediately again , Aunt Ethel wiping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail above the sink . Tude squirmed on her chair , and suddenly she said in a loud determinedvoice , " I guess you heard that me and Sherry are married . I got the certificate right here with me . " Pa lifted his head to look at her . " We know about that . Sherwood told us of it , " he said with rebuking dignity in his voice . Tude stopped digging for it and snapped her purse shut again . Her eyes were large and frightened as she lifted them slowly to meet his . " I come to you to help me , " she said softly and unevenly . " I did n't know nobody else to come to . " Pa drew a deep breath , his shoulders straightening , and then he turned his head toward the open doorway . " Glen , by damn ! " he yelled , " you shut off that radio now so 's we can hear ourselves think out here for a minute . "  |p343He  turned back to her and the radio was obediently stilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it . " Sherwood 's got no call to send you here askin ' for help , " Pa said angrily . " If he ai n't man enough to come and ask himself , whyTude 's face was blank for a moment . " He did n't send me . He do n't even know I come here . I guess he 'd be real sore if he knew . " She was still a moment longer , her whole body tensed and frightened , and then with a last snap of her purse she leapt to her feet , bursting into loud rapid speech . " You got to help me . You got to make him do right to me . He treats me like I 'm just dirt or somep'n ! He ai n't comin ' home at night half the time . He do n't gim me a cent a money , he do n't even talk to me civil ! " She stopped for breath and went on again with venomous anger in her voice . " It 's her fault . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wo n't leave him alone no more'n she would when he was married to Fay . She 's stayin ' in hotels with him all night all the while . I followed ' em and seen it myself . You got ta make him stay away from her . I ca n't stand no more of it ! " Pa , too , leapt to his feet and then stood beside the table , his body bent forward and immobilized in a futile helpless posture of flight . Aunt Ethel wept and Tude wept louder still , the tears gushing from her eyes and streaking the cosmetics on her contorted face . " You got ta make him do right to me . I 'm in the family way ! You got ta make him leave her alone . I do n't know what I 'll do if he do n't stay away from her . I ca n't stand no more of it ! " At the table , Clyde picked at a button on his shirt , his head lowered , his face agonizingly red and embarrassed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving uneasily , his face baffled and uncomprehending . " You got ta do something ! " Tude shrieked again . " You got ta make him leave that bitch alone , you hear me ! " Pa spoke without looking at her . " There ai n't no use of you sayin ' any more . There was a time when I could do with Sherwood , when he was a boy . I ca n't do nothing any more . "  |p344Pa  drew the old cracked leather wallet from his pocket and slowly spread it open and removed the several bills it contained . " Any time you ai n't got the money to get along , I 'll see you through the best I can . And if you was to ever need a roof over your head any time , you 'll be welcome here . I ca n't do nothing more'n that . " Tude struck the bills away out of his extended hand . " I do n't want your old money ! " she screamed at him . " I mighta known you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known you 'd stand up for her , that dirty stuck-up chasin ' bitch ! " Tude whirled around to confront Aunt Ethel where she wept into her doubled arms against the window sill . " You wo n't do nothin ' for me neither , will you ! None a you ! I mighta known it would n't do no good to come here . You all think she 's somep'n real wonderful , do n't you ! That cheatin ' dirty bitch ! And I 'm just nothin ' but some dirt , you can just . . . I hate you , every stinkin ' one a you ! Nobody never cares about me , never ! Well , I 'm not gon na put up with him chasin ' with her . I wo n't , you hear me ! " She ran then , out of the kitchen and toward the door , her pale hair tumbled and flying , her fists digging hard into her streaming eyes . Of them all , it was only Glen who followed after her . He moved in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch , his hands upon her small quivering shoulders , his face troubled and still uncomprehending as he looked down at her . " You should n't take on like this , " he said . " You 'll get sick . You want me to bring you some water or . . . ? " " Just take your hands off me , you big dummy , " Tude spat at him . " All I want 's to get the hell outa this stink hole ! " She jerked away from his hands , diving down the steps and runningoff across the dooryard to the road . Glen watched her go helplessly , his eyes squinted against the glaringlight , her small body quick and shining and alive in the sun and then suddenly swallowed up into the patch of heavy shadows beneath the trees , and around the bend in the road and gone . He stood a moment longer uncertainly , and then walked slowlyp345back to the kitchen . They were all just as he had left them , and he looked from one to another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she takin ' on so ? " he said at last . " What 's she mean that Sherry 's doing ? Did she mean Nell , that woman she kept talkingabout ? " Pa stood silent , his breathing quick and shallow , his blue eyes fixed and very bright . Glen waited and finally left the kitchen . The house was very still except for the sound of Aunt Ethel 's soft helplessweeping . Clyde stirred in his chair , and at last , he said awkwardly , " You want to go and get the groceries now , Pa ? " Pa turned slowly , his eyes snapping . " I do n't mean to hear a word out of you now , " he said , his voice jerking with anger . " No , I do n't want to go with you and get no groceries . Nor I do n't want to see your white-livered face stickin ' in around here any more . By damn , I got no use for a son that ca n't go out and take a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want you hanging around here any more . " " Oh , stop , stop ! " Aunt Ethel sobbed at him . " You 're worked up and sayin ' things you 'll be sorry for tomorrow ! Clyde , do n't you pay attention to him , he 's just . . . " Clyde stood up from the table , his eyes beseeching upon Pa 's face . " Pa , what 's the matter ? I never said a word against Sherry , you know I never would ! What do you mean , you . . . ? " You heard what I told you all right , " Pa said , loudly and distinctly . " Like some woman , by damn ! Keeping house like a woman , and bookkeeping down to the bank and . . . I got no use for a son like that . Go on back to where you live and keep away from here ! " Clyde stood a moment longer , his mouth working foolishly , and then he turned and strode quietly away to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his pocket with unsteady hands , and stared at it and shoved it back into the pocket of his overalls again . From outside the house , there was the sound of Clyde 's car startingup , the motor roaring and then quieting as the automobile moved away down the road . Aunt Ethel was no longer crying . " You had no business to do that , " she said to Pa softly . " Andp346what was the use of it ? No matter how bad you feel inside , you think it 'll change things with Sherry or ever make him any different from the way he is ? " " I 'm going to lay down a spell , " Pa said tonelessly . " I 'm tuckered out with the heat . " He left the kitchen , and Aunt Ethel listened to his feet upon the stairs , slow and dragging . Her legs gave under her then , and she sank down onto a chair beside the littered table , her hand moving automatically to brush at the flies hanging over the sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard the steps upon the porch , and Nell 's voice singing out , " Hi ! Anybody home ? " Aunt Ethel sprang up and ran all the way through the living room so that she met Nell just inside the screen door . " Well , what you think of this for weather ? " Nell said , cheerfully . " Hey , do n't tell me Pa and Clyde got an early start today , and I 've missed them . I thought I heard Clyde 's car . " " Clyde went on , " Aunt Ethel said , hurriedly . " His Pa was n't feelingextra good so he 's laying down upstairs awhile . " She did not look at Nell 's face at all , staring instead carefully at one of her slender bare arms , and the stack of magazines she held there , a white bakery box together with another package balanced on the top . " Ethel , you been crying about something ? " Nell said . " Ah look , what 's the matter ? Maybe we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another quick step , awkwardlybarring her way . " Oh , no , I was n't crying , " she said quickly . Nell hesitated and then she held out her magazines and packages . " It 's all right , honey , " she said lightly . " I 'll come over some other time . You take it easy now . " Aunt Ethel took the armful obediently , and suddenly she looked at last into Nell 's face . " Oh , Nell , Nell ! " she said , her voice broken and anguished . " Ethel , what is it ? " " Why , it is n't anything , " Aunt Ethel said again , softly and rapidly , controlling the trembling of her lips . " It 's just this wicked heat . I believe I 'll have to lay down awhile too . "  |p347Nell  's eyes were searching , but she only said , " Okay , honey , you do that . I 'll see you later . " She went back across the porch and out into the parching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet slowing more and more until she was stopped still . She reached for the cigarette automatically , and the match was struck and ready , the little flame gaseous and invisible in the bright sunlight , but Nell was motionless , her face still thoughtful and intent . The match curled into a black wisp in her fingers and she dropped it nimbly . She walked on then across the road and to the house on the other side , the cigarette still unlightedand forgotten in her mouth.  |p248Monday  was the night that Sherry had offfrom his job . He slept later that day , luxuriatingin his holiday freedom , and spent twice the time over his showering and shaving . When he finally left the bathroom his face was unwontedly rested and relaxed . He rolled window shades to the top to let the light into the musty cluttered apartment , and whistled softly over the preparation of his lunch while Tude lay silent and apathetic in the middle of her tumbled unmade bed . After he had eaten , he doggedly cleaned the littered kitchenette with its overflowingaccumulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the street , walking slowly and aimlessly for a long time , savoring the heat and brightness of the sun . He doubled back finally to the large grocery store nearest the apartment building . When he left the store he carried huge brown paper sacks in either arm : grocery , meat and bakery supplies , cigarettes and bottles of milk , coke and beer , and several late issues of the motion-picture magazines that were equally necessary to Tude . While he unpacked the sacks back at the apartment , he toldp349Tude impersonally that if she would hurry up and put some clothes on for a change , he was prepared to treat her to dinner out and a good downtown movie . He shrugged at her contemptuous refusal , and silently departed again a few moments later . He ate an early solitary dinner in an inexpensive neighborhood restaurant , and then boarded a bus for the trip to the downtown area himself . Once there , he strode through the entrance to the drugstore on the bus-stop corner and the row of telephone booths just inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dialed rapidly and waited , and when Margie answered him he asked for Nell without identifyinghimself . She came after a moment , her voice cool and unhurried in his ear . " Hi , " Sherry said . " Buy a Fuller brush today , lady ? How about some nice magazine subscriptions ? Like to get your picture took for free . . . ? " " Why , Mr. B. ! " she said , her voice pleased . " What 's with you ? " " Do n't tell me you forgot this is Monday night ! Shake your mink out of the mothballs , Mrs. B. , we 're on the town . Where 'll I meet you , what 'll we do ? You got any ideas ? " " Yeah , " she said . " Matter of fact , I just this minute got a dandy . Why do n't we start with you hopping a bus out here and saying hello to Pa and Ethel for a minute ? " All of the good humor instantly left his face . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , remotely , " Is that supposed to be a funny ? " " Look , I 'm worried about them , " she said , softly and rapidly . " The stuffing 's clean knocked out of them both . I 've seen them , you have n't . All they really care about by now 's to know that you 're all right . What 'll it cost you ? " " I 'm sorry ! Christ , what more you want me to say ? This has n't been a picnic for anybody , has it ? I 've got a little dough ahead now , maybe enough to parlay into something , but I still ... " " You have to borrow trouble ? " Her voice was calm in his ear . " What 's money got to do with making it up with Pa and Ethel , for God sakes ? You told Pa what the score was with you , did n't you ? "                   @ @
