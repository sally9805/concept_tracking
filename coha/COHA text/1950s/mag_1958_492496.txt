SO YOU 'RE ALL TENSED UP A cynical observer of the American business scene has remarked that there arc only two kinds of executive , those who get ulcers and those who give ulcers to others . As a physician who each year interviews about 1000 men , I can not agree with such a sweeping indictment . Most executives , in my opinion , are pleasant fellows who work at a reasonable tempo , treat their associates with understanding and consideration , and enjoy fairly good health . But there are unquestionably enough of them in the cynic 's two categories to generate plenty of problems in the world of interoffice memos and commuting brief cases  --  problems coming under the general heading of tension . In a survey of tensions , just completed by the Life Extension Foundation and here reported for the first time , a number of causes were pinpointed . They included frustration , lack of recognition . worry about decisions , and so on . But the commonest cause of all was conflict of personalities , the factor implied in the quip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionnaire , 13 per cent said they worked under constant tension ; another 7b per cent experienced it occasion-tally . Question No , 26 posed eight possible causes and asked the men to check those they considered most responsible , Sonic checked several causes , but the one blamed more often than any other was " personalities of superiors . " This was checked by 25 per cent . Twelve per cent blamed " personalities of subordinates . " We followed this with another question which asked : " Is there someone with whom you work whom you would like to ' drop oll ' a bridge ' ? " A leading question . perhaps , but 18 per cent of the executives said , " Yes . " These responses reminded me of the case of the five jittery vice presidents of a company I shall call Ulcers , Inc . It is a real company and is one of the hundreds whose executive personnel are examined annually by doctors of the Life Extension pFxaminers . It fell to my lot , as the organization 's medical director , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked with them it became apparent that each was under extreme emotional strain , but I could get no clue to the reasons for it . Then one day the president of the company came in for his interview , and 1 was no longer puzzled . No one could have been anything but nervous in his presence . He was a tense , driving , demanding type . Pure . undiluted personality problems are often difficult for a doctor to cope with . We got help in this instance , however , through our discovery that the company president had signs of coronary heart disease . 1 would n't wish this diagnosis on anyone . But it gave us a good medical excuse to warn him to slow down and let his vice presidents have a freer hand in managing the company . We urged him to take more vacations and holidays and , if possible , to relax , A few months later , one of the vice presidents came in to see me , and he was as calm as could be . " Doctor , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boss is letting us take much more responsibility , and he 's not riding herd on us , Why , he 's now the easiest person in the world to get along with . " Apparently the man had really heeded our warning and slowed down . And , as he admitted to me later , he had become a much better executive as a result of it . A. similar source of tension existed in a large New York company whose bachelor president made a practice of calling meetings late in the afternoon , for no other apparent reason than to make his asso  --  Oates unhappy . Being unmarried him ' Self , he seemed to resent the happy home life of the others . He 'd drag his conferences on past 5:30 and would not even let the men phone their wives to say they 'd be late for dinner . Unfortunately , this company was not one of our clients . I heard about the ease through one of the long-suffering vice presidents , a friend of mine . Often the only way to cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign your job . We have several times recommended job changes to men caught up in an employment atmosphere conducive to tension and strain . One man told me he could n't stand the rigid formality of the office where he worked . All the executives had to address each other as " Mister , ? no matter how long they had been working together , He decided life was too short to put up with Ikat sort of thing . So he left and got a position where the president called everybody by his first name and where the whole atmosphere was more relaxed . " ulcer mill , " and if he is n't actually on an ulcer diet , he whips himself through the daily grind with the help of two martinis at lunch and tranquilizers ad libitum . Or so , at least , our more vocal exponents of the high-tension life would have us believe . It was to determine just how much tension does permeate the management of American business and industry that the Life Extension Foundation last year undertook its survey . We wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally thought , what its principal causes were , and what , if anything , could be done to reduce tension . This was a logical function for our group , for we have always been interested in just such phases of preventive medicine . The Foundation 's parent organization . Life Extension Examiners , was established forty-five years ago as the Life Extension Institute by a group of men which included former President William Howard Taft ; political economist Irving Fisher , of Yale ; and industrialist Harold A. Lcy ; and the original purpose was to serve the life-insurance companies by making periodic health examinations of their policyholders . In the last decade , Life Extension Examiners has broadened its work to include health-examination services to industrial and business establishments and to the general public . We now examine about 35.000 individuals each year  --  most of them executives and office workers . Half of the examinations are performed at our New York headquarters , the remaining by more than 500 selected local physicians in other parts of the country . You can collect information about tension in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment " in which you deliberately impose suspected stress factors on one group of " subjects " and compare their reactions to a group not exposed to these factors . You can arrange a complicated set of multiple-choice levers and food boxes for caged rats or monkeys and try to give them nervous breakdowns . You can ask doctors for their opinions . Or you can query the stress-ridden businessmen themselves , We chose the lastmethod , sending out questionnaires to 10,000 executives at all levels of management , representing 179 companies scattered over the United States . It is the largest survey , we believe , ever made on what people think about the stresses and strains of their work and their home and office environment . We asked the executives forty-nine questions about their jobs , their eating , drinking and smoking habits , their sleep and exercise and recreation . We probed into their attitude toward business homework , business travel and business entertainment , and asked about their wives ' attitudes as well . Finally , we asked them point-blank whether they thought they were working too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much , and whether they were under emotional tension . ( There is an important difference between pressure and tension , as our survey brought out . ) And then we asked what they thought the tension was due to . More than 6000 of the men filled out the questionnaires and returned them . That in itself was a gratifying response , indicating the widespread interest in tension as a health factor . And the answers were most revealing . Some surprised us . Others simply confirmed , statistically . observations we had ourselves made in twenty-five years of medical counseling . In that time I had personally interviewed about 25,000 executives and I could see in the pattern of replies a reflection of many of the problems they had discussed with me . It should be pointed out that all of the 10,000 who received the questionnaires were men who in the previous twelve months had undergone a health checkup by Life Extension doctors . Actually this is much more than a routine examination . After the usual thumping , probing , X rays , electro-cardiograph , laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a counseling doctor whose job is just to talk and listen . The counseling physician is in no hurry . He encourages the man to unburden himself of any problems he may have bottled up . Health , of course , is his primary concern at the moment . And , its one might expect , health worries do contribute signilicantly to the over-all tension picture . But it is amazing how quickly this kind of tension disappears when examination provides reassurance of good health . Bearing this out , our experience has shown that about 78 per cent of executives have some concern about their health at the time of their first examination , whereas only 18 per cent of the 6000 men covered by our recent survey , all of whom had completed a checkup with LIS during the prior year , were still worried about their health . Although the companies pay for these annual examinations , all the information obtained is kept in strict confidence between the doctor and the man being examined . In the case of the questionnaire , also the executives were asked not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are men who run many of America 's best-known companies . The mailing list of 179 firms covered a wide range of products and services , as this sampling will indicate ; American Gas &; Electric ; American Oil Company : American Radiator and Standard Sanitary ; Babcock and Wilcox ; Batten , Barton , Durstinc &; Osborn ; Bendix Aviation ; Continental Baking ; Continental Can ; ChesebroughPond 's ; C.I.T , Financial Corp ; Colgate-Palmolive ; General Aniline &; Film ; W. R. Grace ; W. T. Grant ; Hilton Hotels ; Lone Star Cement ; McKesson &; Robbins ; National Dairy Products ; Otis Elevator ; Parke , Davis ; Prentice-Hall ; RCA-International : Raynnier ; U. S. Rubber ; U. S. Steel ; Worthington . Many of the executives were on foreign assignments at the time they received their questionnaires , and when the returns began to pour into our offices they came from all over the world  --  South America , Europe , South Africa , Pakistan , Ceylon and the Philippines . All parts of the United States were represented , but two thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , and two thirds of the executives work in cities of over a half million . incomes from their principal employment ranged from under 510,1100 ( reported by 33 per cent of the men ) to over 530,000 I reported by 6 per cent ) . The largest group-37 per cent  --  earned between 510,000 and 515,000 . In planning our survey , Richard Sutphen , secretary of the Life Extension Foundation , and I tried to frame questions that would make the important distinction between pressure and tension , to which I have already alluded , Pressure is usually something objective , like heavy job requirements . Tension is the individual 's subjective response to that pressure or to unpleasant working conditions , including the difficult personalities . Some men thrive under pressure . Confronted by a pile of work and a deadline , they roll up their sleeves and pitch into it with enthusiasm and determination . Others arc distressed by the very sight of the pile and become tense and nervous . Just how demanding , then , are the job requirements of the average American executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , although 40 per cent arrived at the office at eight and a third worked until six . A shade under three quarters of them spend less than live hours a week on homework , and 20 per cent spend five to ten hours . Four per cent work ten to fifteen hours at home , I per cent fifteen to twenty hours , and a very busy I per cent said they spend more than twenty hours a week on homework . Of those who did take work home , 22 per cent said they liked it , 57 per cent were resigned to it , and 21 per cent " loathed " it . " How does your wife feel about your business homework ? " we then asked . Sixty-nine per cent said their wives were " understanding , " 19 per cent said they were " indifferent , " and 12 per cent said they were " resentful , " The length of a man 's business day and the way he spends it are basic to the whole problem of tensions . And in talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , like a prosecuting attorney cross-examining a witness . " You 're working pretty hard , are n't you ? " I 'll say . Invariably the answer will be : " You have no idea how much work we do down there . When I come home at night I 'm just plain exhausted . " Then I get the man to analyze the day 's operation . He admits that although he gets into the office at nine , he has to finish his morning paper before he looks at the mail , which then takes an hour or two . " How many letters do you usually have ? " HI ask . " Oh , it varies . Five or six , or ten or twelve . " Next there will be people to see . " HOW many ? " " Maybe two or three . " " And how long do you take for lunch ? " " Well , " the busy executive will reply , " 1 believe in a good lunch hour . I do n't rush my lunch . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " " What do you do in that timc , besides eating ? " " 1 read the paper or the Journals . That 's when I keep up with my bosom .. literature . " Further questioning reveals an afternoon somewhat like the morning . At the end of the discussion I 'll say , " Now the amount of work you actually do in as day  --  could n't you have put it into abou - four or five hours of real honestoo-g ness work ? " And he 'll grin and say , sheepishly , " Well , I guess maybe I a not a good manager . " So I suggest a change in the routine , persuade the man to arrive at his office later , leave earlier , take some exercise , do some walking . When he follows this rather simple advice , you can almost see a physical change . I do n't say you can release all tensions by such simple prescriptions  --  and some jobs do require full attention for eight or twelve hours  --  but if the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may prevent an explosion . Business entertaining is often cited ay a cause of pressure , But 80 per cent o our men averaged no more than two business luncheons a week and 90 per cent had one evening date or less per week . About a third were required to entertain business associates on an average of one weekend a month . Actually , three quarters of the men and their wiv said they enjoyed business entertainin and did not feel it contributed to the pressure of the job . Nor did travel seem to be a serious stress factor for most men , Thirty per cent did no business traveling at all , and 39 per cent spent less than five days a month away from home on business . Thirty-one per cent were away five or more days a month . Two thirds liked business travel and one third did n't . We wondered if businessmen had adequate incentives to avoid tensions . Therefore we asked them whether they and their wives were satisfied with their progress and had a feeling of security . The vast majority-80 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar questions . Hence , from all these replies , we concluded that most executives , in their ow judgment , worked at jobs that were n overly demanding , that they enjoyed sr curity. were happy in their work and were reasonably free from excessive tension-producing anxieties . It was apparent that tensions are not so prevalent in the Amer ican business community as most people had assumed . Our tally showed , moreover , that while 23 per cent said they felt they were working under constant pressure , in terms of job demands , only 13 per cent said they were under constant tension  --  defining tension as emotional strain . This seemest to us a significant difference . It was apparent that not all pressures produced tension , and that job demands themselves were not necessarily to blame , So , by further analysis of the questionnaire results , we tried to pin down the most important specific sources of trouble . First , we sorted out the returns of the men who said they were under constant tension . In another pile we placed the returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . We then looked for differences between the tense and the calm executives in their answers to questions about their work and living habits . We found , somewhat to our surprise , that the objective job requirements , the things so often blamed as causes of tension  --  long hours , travel , business lunchcip and so on  --  were much the same for both groups . The amount of business homework was only 10 per cent greater among , the tense men , and they actually did less traveling than those in the calm category . What about the type of business ? Here advertising seemed to live up to its reputation , for it had the highest proportion of executives-21 per cent  --  who claimed they worked under constant tension . In the high-tension column were also 17 per cent of those in legal work  --  as members of business or industrial staffs rather than independent attorneys ? I 6 per cent or the personnel-management executives , 15 per cent of the financial men , and 7 per cent of the sales-promotion people . Of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive tension  --  about the average for the whole group of 6000 . These differences in tension rates among types of jobs were very slight , however , compared to those we found when we compared more subjective factors , such as attitudes . For example , boredom with the job was 355 per cent higher among the tense executives than the calm ones , the feeling of job insecurity was 174 per cent greater , dissatisfaction with business progress 155 per cent more frequent . And from 30 to 60 per cent more of the high-tension men disliked business homework , travel and entertainment . Sixty per cent more of them wanted to retire by the age of fifty-live . While only 6 per cent of all of the men said their wives did not feel they were making satisfactory progress in their jobs , I am quite sure the wife is to blame in a much larger number of tension cases . It has been my observation that men are reluctant to admit their wives are dissatisfied . Sometimes a little prodding from the wife is just what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But too often the woman 's main motive for pushing her husband ahead is to get more money to spend . She has probably not been too frugal , so she takes it out on him and continually needles him . Her approach may be flattery . " A fellow with your ability , " she 'll say ? " why , you should have got that job , and not Bill Smith . You 've got much more on the ball than he has . They just do n't recognize your ability down there . " She gives him the build-up , but instead of helping him to get ahead , she only spends every nickel she can get hold of and puts pres-sure on him to earn more and more . Occasionally the tension can be blamed on the opposite situation , the promotion itself . Several years ago the young Western representative of one of our big companies dropped dead in Denver . The president called me and asked me if I could explain it . " Here is a man who was only thirty-seven years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he is dead . Why ' ? How can you account for it ? " I asked him something about the man 's career and found that he had been catapulted into a vice presidency over the head of a man who had twenty years ' more experience than he . I felt that the younger man must have simply been pushed and pressed to the point where he became extremely tense . The medical cause of his death was a coronary attack , but I am sure a contributing cause was a promotion made too rapidly  --  without sufficient preparation . This is a danger to be guarded against in companies undergoing rapid expansion . I have been told that many firms have grown so fast in the last ten years that they have trouble finding enough experienced men to fill top jobs . Consequently , young men arc throw n into positions of great administrative responsibility before they arc ready for them . They arc put on the spot , knowing they must succeed , and they pour everything they have into their work . But they arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They get steamed up over little things which five years later they would laugh at . In the meantime they develop spastic colons and ulcers , or worse . I recall a certain young man who wail suddenly promoted to a branch managership . A week after the transfer he resigned . His superior , puzzled by this action , refused to accept the resignation and arranged for the man , whom we 'll call John , to come in to see us for a routine physical examination . In my conversation with him I learned that he had been perfectly happy in his old job with the company , that the new one meant a dislocation for himself and his family . John had had no experience in running an office , and he felt grossly incompetent . He had built up a fear of the new position out of all proportion to us requirements . ItiVe tossed the problem back and forth in a friendly way , and finally , at my suggestion , he was sent off on a three-week vacation . " Do n't even think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " When you come back we 'll talk it over again . " Of course , he did think about it  --  a lot  --  and on his return he said . " You know , I 'm going to take that assignment after all . " I now surprised him by advising him not to take it . " You 'd have one strike against you in that particular job , " I said . " Why not wait for another opportunity , one for which you 'll be better prepared ? " I promised to discuss the matter with his chief , a vice president of the company , so that he would n't be passed by when the next chance did come along . ' " I 'm convinced the reason things did n't work out this time , " I told John , " is that you were n't given enough encouragement to ' make you feel you could handle the new position . " The vice president , when I talked with him , bore out my analysis . " John 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was a natural for this managership . But it 's true that nobody took the trouble to build him up , to tell him why we thought he was fitted for the place , to give him that necessary pat on the back . " A similar problem in personal relationships was brought out by the rather surprising answers to another survey question . One does not ordinarily think of the Amencan businessman as inhibited in speech . Yet 30 per cent of our questionnaire respondents confessed to some degree of fear in expressing themselves to their associates , especially their superiors . Men in the constant-tension group mentioned it seven times more often than the others . If not a cause of tension , this is certainly a manifestation of it . And in a sense it is another aspect of personality conflicts . For example , a man of real ability may carefully prepare a presentation , but when he gets to the meeting he does n't say a word . What happens is that someone more aggressive grabs the ball in the discussion , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . The unfortunate part of it is that the company may be the loser , for the quiet man often has better ideas to communicate than his less-inhibited colleague . Here again , what is needed is reassurance . It will do a great deal to help a man overcome his fear of speaking . The per- son in charge of a meeting should make it a point to call on such a man for comments or suggestions , A little frienc.0111 pressure  --  not too much at first  --  will bring him out . This is another example of the value of informality in management relations . Time and again we hose been impressed by this approach as an antidote to tension . We have devoted most of our attention , in this discussion , to the disturbing factors in the businessman 's work  --  his altitude toward his job and his associates , But no study of the subject would be complete without recognizing another very important truth  --  namely , that tension is often tightly bound up with irregular living habits . Our questionnaire revealed that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the food and drink , rest , exercise and recreation departments than did the calmer individuals . A greater proportion of the high-tension people gulped breakfast in live minutes and whipped through lunch in fifteen . They smoked more , had lunchtime cocktails oftener , got less sleep , exercise and recreation , and swallowed more tranquilizers and sleeping pills . Of the 6000 executives only 4.6 per cent took tranquilizers regularly , and only 3.3 per cent took sleeping pills , You can argue that the irregular living habits are an effect of tension rather than a cause . But whichever came first , they combine to form a vicious circle . And it has been our experience that correcting the faults in the daily regimen may break the circle and ease the tension itself . Habits are not easy to change , especially those you rationalize . Take the matter of cocktails at noon . As an occasional indulgence there is nothing wrong with them . But some of my friends insist that they simply could n't get through the afternoon if they did n't have two martinis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , and I tell them so . But they reply , " Well , you do n't know what pressure I am under . " It is true , some jobs arc both highly creative and competitive . Take advertising , for instance . It has a degree of uncertainty and insecurity that generates stress . When new copy or a new campaign is being presented , everybody holds his breath . If the client approves , they breathe again  --  until the time rolls around for the next presentation . However , some executives , while griping about their work , say they would n't be in anything else . And as to tension , I suspect there is a bit of self-hypnosis there , I believe they feel it below their dignity not to emphasize the tension in their job . They are proud of it . They wear it like the gray-flannel suit . Nevertheless , I have occasionally persuaded such persons to take a twenty-minute walk atnoon instead of two martinis , and to get eight hours of sleep at night . The result has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us in the medical profession are coming to appreciate more and more the value of regular exercise as a preventive of tension . If possible , the exercise should also be recreation , something that is fun to do  --  like golf , or swimming , or bowling . A regular workout in u gym is good medicine for the nerves . In addition , however , we feel that a person should have fifteen minutes of walking three or four times every day . The suburbanite , if he does n't live too far away , can walk to the train . To city residents I 've suggested they board the bus or subway six or eight blocks beyond their regular stop , to give them some extra walking . That provides a regular exercise pattern to follow , and men who have done this tell me they really feel much better , It is obvious that in this time of ever-increasing threat to security and to the continuation of the human race itself , no prescription can be expected to abolish all excessive tension . But we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of the 6000 men who answered our questionnaire and the thousands we have interviewed in our offices . To summarize , we would say that you ca n't cure tension , but you can certainly modify it . You should recognize that jobs are n't tense  --  people are . Abnormally tense people arc not neurotics or psychopaths . They arc simply persons who are more susceptible to tension-precipitating factors . Excessive stress does not spell disaster , but it does require attention . If you are tense , it is you yourself who can do the most to reduce that tension . Change your perspective . When molehills become mountains , ask yourself how important the irritating situation will be tomorrow . Build up your self-confidence and make the most of what you have . Do n't fret about what you do n't have . Be tolerant . When someone rubs you the wrong way , ask yourself what wrong he has really done you . What reason have you to criticize him ? Is n't it usually jealousy ? Finally , the old reliable admonition , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think . Who loses most by the constant rushing and restlessness ? Why , you do , of course . So calm down . Take a walk around the block .
