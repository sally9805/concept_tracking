Spotlighted in Los Angeles ' Cocoanut Grove nightclub , cocking an ear to the tinkle of glasses , stood a tall ( 6 ft. 2 in . ) Negro in an open-necked shirt . Suddenly he cut loose with a high , pained call of " Timber ! " that froze drinkers ' elbows in midair . Folk Singer Harry Belafonte , the newest nightclub hit on the West Coast , swung into a blue-noted work song : <P> Lord , this timber 's got ta roll ; I got ta pull this timber ' fore the sun go down , Get across the river ' fore the boss comes ' round . <P> Belafonte kept them listening with full attention for a good 40 minutes . With a guitarist strumming in the shadows behind him , he mimed to the words &; music , gesticulating , jerking his shoulders , snapping and rolling his head as he sang . In a high baritone voice whose plainness he disguised by plaintive hoots and back-country hollers , he sang a repertory that ranged from a Negro preacher 's passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through such folkish songs as Shenandoah , Scarlet Ribbons and Hold ' Em , Joe , to an off-beat bit of calypso gibberish called Man Piaba . West Coast nightclub audiences have been packing the big ( capacity : 650 ) Cocoanut Grove for this kind of program for a month , and have accepted Harry Belafonte , 26 , as a folk singer to be ranked with Josh White and Burl Ives . <P> Jamaica Memories . Belafonte came to folk singing by a roundabout way . He was born in Manhattan , spent five years of his boyhood in Jamaica , and after a hitch in the Navy ( storekeeper third class ) , studied acting at Manhattan 's New School for Social Research . But that got him nowhere , so he went to work as a clothing dyer to support his wife and child . At 22 , thanks to an audition , he got a few months of good nightclub work singing such workaday favorites as Blue Moon , Black Magic and Pennies from Heaven . <P> But Belafonte had no taste for being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **34;10601;TOOLONG routine . I quit cold . " He took his savings and , with a couple of friends , opened a short-order restaurant in Greenwich Village . There , while frying his share of the hamburgers , Harry did some thinking : " I recalled my boyhood in the West Indies and the songs I heard there and the things I heard in the South with the Navy , the broken-down bars and street singers . " <P> Congressional Material . Belafonte and Guitarist Millard Thomas got to work on a folk-music routine . They combed the Library of Congress recordings for material , added their own touches , invented new lyrics , finally presented themselves to the public . Just over a year ago , they began to click in what the trade calls " smart " and " intimate rooms , " i.e. , small ones . <P> Today , Belafonte headlines at the biggest nightspots , is under contract to RCA Victor ( his version of Gomen-Nasai was the label 's second biggest seller last week ) , and he plays a supporting role in MGM 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released next month . <P> Although there are still a lot of Belafonte favorites , e.g. , somber chain-gang and railroad songs , that he has not been able to use on the nightclub circuit , he believes he has finally found himself . " The best thing about it , " he says , " is that we are doing what we want to do and getting paid for it . "
