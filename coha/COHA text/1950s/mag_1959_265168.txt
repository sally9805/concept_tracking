The performance opened with a thud of tom-toms and the calls of masked , grass-skirted witch doctors exorcising spirits . It closed with an exuberantly costumed rain dance that compares in color and good humor to New Orleans ' Mardi Gras . The show : a fast-moving , two-hour demonstration of native dances by Les Ballets Africains , a troupe of skilled amateurs from newly independent Guinea . The 28 dancers have won raves all over Europe , last week dazzled Manhattan audiences and critics . <P> As in most folk dancing , the women were mostly decorative , while the men made the main contribution with dramatic jumps , a kind of rhythmical chain-gang walk , and a Charleston-like dance step . Scenes ranged from flirtatious rambles in the market place to formally styled initiation ceremonies . One episode , simply enacting the death of a man and a witch doctor 's earnest attempts to save him , conveyed the feeling of real tragedy , accompanied by chanting as insistent and haunting as Ravel 's Bolero . <P> Les Ballets Africains is the creation of Keita Fodeba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Interior when that country chose independence last fall in Charles de Gaulle 's referendum . As a law student in Paris in 1949 , Fodeba led two other Guinean students , Artistic Director Kante Facelli , 35 , and Administrator Achkar Marof , 28 , in singing African songs over the French radio . What they sang went over so well that Fodeba assembled a successful dance group recruited from fellow Africans in Paris . Then the trio took off on a " 25,000-mile " talent hunt for authentic West African dancers , organized contests , persuaded ritual dancers that performing publicly outside Africa would not profane secret rites . To keep the flavor authentic , Fodeba insisted that costumes be of native materials , even brought along a highly convincing fire eater . <P> As part of the authentic flavor , three of the ballet 's women dancers appeared bare breasted in several innocuous numbers . Though this stirred neither critics nor theatergoers , it raised the eyebrows of New York 's License Commissioner Bernard O'Connell , and he ordered bras upon the ladies . As the troupe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , of all the cities on the tour ( the group has already played Boston and Philadelphia ) , was affronted by authenticity . After the U.S. tour ends , the African dancers expect to go back to their villages , where they hope to buy land with their ballet earnings and live untroubled by license commissioners .
