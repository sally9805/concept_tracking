txt Shortages and skyrocketing prices for many construction materials have thrown the home building industry in New York and throughout the nation into confusion and have brought on a new " gray " market for some key products . A survey of conditions in the industry disclosed yesterday that the costs of certain basic supplies in the last few days had soared above the levels that prevailed even in the notorious black markets of the war period . The new inflationary spiral is forcing an increase in the prices of homes here at a time when builders were making progress in their effort to tap the mass market with lower-priced dwellings , particularly for the families of war veterans . The disturbed situation also threatens to checkmate ambitious summer and fall construction programs being prepared on the basis of recent production , which has attained a record peak of 30,000 " starts " a week nationally , and with developers in the metropolitan area hard pressed to keep up with demand and advance sales . Strikes in various types of plants also have been a major factor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goods in some other lines of business , have made it necessary for some producers of dwellings to go out and look for certain items at inflated costs in order to complete projects started in the early spring . This condition has brought uncertainty , particularly in expanding communities on Long Island and neighboring New Jersey centers , even where the sponsors were proceeding with operations on the basis of what they thought were " firm " contracts for delivery of supplies . The lumber supply has been unusually tight , with increases in quotations ranging from 30 to 100 per cent above the levels of a year ago . Leonard Frank , president of the Long Island Home Builders Insti- ' tute , reported that rough framing lumber used extensively in small homes , was being quoted at $110 or $120 for 1,000 running board feet . Only a few weeks ago it was available at $80 . S. Richard Silbert and Leon M. Silberstein , who have completed about 200 small houses in their 490-unit Silbert Manor community bordering on Massapequa State Park , said they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $80 made when they started their development less than two months ago . They explained that lumber dealers " simply said they did not have the goods on hand " and it was necessary to pay more than the new list price of $95 , even for the cheapest grades suitable for residences . Oak flooring has risen in six weeks from $120 and $150 for 1,000 feet to $180 , or even $220 , depend , ing on the grade . Sheet Rock Supply Off Sheet rock also is in scant supply and the quoted price has just gone up from $35 to $41 for 1,000 square feet , but some large purchasers said it was necessary to pay $45 to get prompt deliveries . A strike in the Brooklyn plant of the National Gypsum Company , one of the leading producers , in recent weeks has disrupted the flow of this material to the builders in the metropolitan area despite the diversion of some of the output of one of the Midwestern factories of the company to the New York market . Shortages also were noted in rock lath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumbing supplies has been advanced 5 per cent . Two Long Island builders announced higher prices yesterday , and many others were reported to be preparing to follow suit , although a number announced that they would be able to hold the price line for the time being on their current construction operations because of stockpiling and fortunate advance deliveries of materials . $1,000 Added to Price At Freeport Acres in Nassau County Frank Spinetta , builder , announced an increase of $1,000 in the price of his homes to bring the cost to $17,9911 , effective today . John Aragona , sponsor of Ranch Homes by Argo on Hicksville Road in Bethpage , will increase his price on May 26 because of rising costs . The Silbert Manor builders explained that with each $10 rise in framing lumber adding about $100 to the cost of a house , they expected to be forced to advance their price shortly from the current level of $7,990 . Heavy buying and open weather , which permitted builders in most parts of the country to continue operations through the winter , absorbed available supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected in a new peak of 126,000 housing " starts " during April . Weather conditions were unfavorable for lumbering , however , particularly in the Northwest and Northeast , where ice and swollen streams are needed to help bring ' down the spring supply of logs . Higher prices for lumber also resulted from the Goverment 's decision to increase stockpiling.
