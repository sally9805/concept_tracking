COME , MY BELOVED ( 311 pp. ) - Pearl Buck-John Day ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> EVERY PROBLEM HAS A SOLUTION FIND <P> IT . By order of Railroad Tycoon David MacArd , this slogan hung in every office of Manhattan 's towering MacArd Building . It was not only his recipe for riches , but the nearest he could get to a religious conviction . So when his adored wife died , Multimillionaire MacArd turned instinctively to his slogan and asked : What solution exists to the problem of death ? And where shall I find it ? <P> MacArd moved in the direction of an answer when he took passage to India at the turn of the 20th century . One walk through the squalid streets of Bombay was enough to convince him that the Indian way of life was no better than living death . India , he decided , needed the sort of inspiration that had made him and his country great : the go-getting zeal of the American way . His wife had been a devout Christian , so what better memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raising and training of businesslike Christian-Indian leaders ? <P> Vital India . Such is the spacious plan of Pearl Buck 's new novel , which , like most of her works , coolly takes a continent for its province . But her theme is even wider than her scheme-so wide , in act , that better novelists would find it hard to cover . Intricate and twofold , it ries on the one hand to show the great gap that divides American and Indian understanding and , on the other , how religious zeal and hard experience affect not only this gap , but the Americans and Indians who try to bridge it . <P> Tycoon MacArd 's approach to the gap s that of a plain , blunt millionaire . Throw money over from the U.S. side , he argues , and new-type Indian leaders will emerge to invest it . But his idealistic son David thinks otherwise . Money , he believes , is not enough . India may be near to death hysically , but it is vibrant with religious vitality . The would-be missionary can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must live in their land and carry his faith to them . To his father 's horror , David does just that . <P> As Author Buck shows , David has come a degree closer to a solution than his father did . But as the years pass , David , too , begins to shrink in stature . His Poona mission station grows so famed that it loses its Christian simplicity , and becomes to David what railroads became to his father . David dreads Indian independence . If the British raj is booted out , who will protect his lifework from destruction ? It is now his turn to be horrified when his devout son Ted walks out on his father 's seminary and goes to live among Indians in a village of mud huts . <P> Old Devil Sex . Up to this point , Author Buck handles her material nicely , bringing the core of religion steadily closer to the reader . Then , suddenly , she gives out . The conclusion she wants to reach is that neither dollars nor Christian dogma can bridge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples and agreement that all religions are equally valid , equally tenable . It is sex which prevents her from putting over this conclusion properly . The old devil has hovered on the fringes all through Come , My Beloved , and when he hears the magic word " intermarriage , " he hops boldly into the pulpit and converts earnest Missionary Buck into a thinly piping Miss Lonelyhearts.
