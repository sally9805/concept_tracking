THE OTHER PLACE , AND OTHER STORIES OF THE SAME SORT , by J. B. Priestley ( 265 pp. ; Harper ; $3 ) . In these nine short stories , Britain 's robust , many-sided man of letters takes a series of ordinary Englishmen right out of this world . In one story , an engineer named Harvey Lindfield-lonely , bored and bewildered by the drab meanness of life in a manufacturing town-gingerly walks through a library door into The Other Place . There he basks in sunshine and fellowship among the townspeople with whom he used to be shy and awkward but who are now transformed into his friends . Then his own lustful impatience leads him to open a girl 's door too soon , and he finds himself back in his miserable old world . In other fantasies , a movie director and his script-writing wife win back brief happiness in a flying visit to Regency England , a schoolmaster gets a terrifying look at the future , a cabinet minister has the illusion that he is addressing an audience of dead men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same supernatural theme as to suggest that the author , who has been writing plays for years about tricks with time ( I Have Been Here Before , Time and the Conways , would rather like to take his fantasies seriously . The one exception is Uncle Phil on TV , an uproarious account of how the unwanted uncle whose insurance money was spent by his family on a TV set returns to haunt every program they turn on . <P> A WORLD OF LOVE , by Elizabeth Bowen ( 224 pp. ; Knopt ; $3.50 ) , is not a tempest but a great calm in a teapot . In the attic of a ramshackle Irish country house , adrift in the summer doldrums , a beautiful girl finds a batch of old love letters . Their author-a dashing young man , dead these many decades , to whom the girl 's mother was once engaged-now comes strangely to life . Around his memory , three women begin to dance slowly , lazily , like tired butterflies : the young girl , who falls in love with the shade she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shackled to the remembered lover ; and the young man 's cousin , a great ruin of a woman , who suddenly presents a claim of her own to the dead love . The bond between the two older women , one strangely dominating the other 's life , might once have grown into a whole Gothic novel , but no Goth is Author Bowen : her plot twists are in the mind , her castles are moated by irony rather than romance . It is the kind of story where mood is action : each fall of spirits is barometered , each falling flower microscoped . Hovering on the story 's edges is a terrifyingly bright child who wants to make a man out of her weakling father and closes in , occasionally , to prick the balloon-souls of her elders . In the end , after the hot letters have rekindled an ashen marriage and warmed the cool young beauty , Author Bowen unconvincingly produces a handsome American deus ex machina-the machina in this case being a plane that carries him abruptly from Colorado to Shannon . Irish-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beautifully that it hurts . But she also demonstrates that it takes more than good writing to make a good book .
