txt Science has come up with a gimmick that will permit politicians to squeeze 1 hour and 15 minutes of talk into an hour . The tape recording device , called a " time compressor , " would do away with the practice of cutting speakers off the radio when they run overtime . The machine speeds up words or music by chopping the sound into little strips  --  like boards in a fence  --  throwing some of theboards away , and then shoving the rest together . Prof. Grant Fairbanks , director of the University of Illinois speech . research laboratory , demonstrated the device today . Fairbanks said compressions of 10 per cent can not be detected by human ear . The machine capitalizes on the fact the ear is faster than the mouth . He said it would enable radio to tailor programs to fit time . A speech by the President running an hour and 15 minutes could be compressed into 59 minutes for an hour broadcast .
