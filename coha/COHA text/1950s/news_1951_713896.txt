txt A Saturday buyers ' rush struck New York 's department stores yesterday on the fourth day of the price war . The shoppers ' ranks were augmented by large numbers of men for the first time since the cost of price-fixed items began tumbling on Tuesday  --  and the men proved as adept as the women in negotiating the hazards of a bargain basement . The most intense battle was fought between Macy 's and Gimbels in Herald Square , but reports from Bloomingdale 's , Frederick Loeser &; Co. and Abraham &; Straus also showed that throngs had milled through their doors and queued , up at counters for rapidly vanishing articles of clothing and houseware . By late afternoon , however , much of the rush had subsided , lines had disappeared , and emptyhanded patrons had filed out , mildly resentful that they had been buffeted by the crowds with nothing to show for their efforts . In most cases.the resentment resulted from the fact that merchandise they were seeking no longer was available . In others , it was the realization that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited usefulness . Although prices continued to fall yesterday , there was a noticeable slowing in the rate of decline and intangible evidence that a measure of stability had returned to // what had appeared to be a virtually uncontrollable situation . At the same time , the leading stores announced their intention to meet all price cuts for the duration , whatever it might be . Department store spokesmen said they expected a " slackening of the rush " tomorrow , mainly because stocks of severkl popular items had been depleted . However , orders for such items were placed with the manufacturers yesterday , and the stores hoped that by tomorrow morning the stocks would be replenished . When the doors at Macy 's opened at 9:45 A. M. , the crush at the Thirty-fourth Street entrance was so great that the revolving doors failed to work . One door finally fell flat and the crowds poured over it to get to the basement where electrical appliances were on sale . At Gimbels , a store spokesman reported customer traffic was three to four times greater than earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bloomingdale 's . In Brooklyn , Abraham &; Straus , Frederick Loeser &; Co. and Namm 's experienced the busiest Saturday in their histories , and seat hundreds of persons away from bare counters . Members of the Macy sales force approaching the store were appalled at the numbers lined up outside before the doors opened . One salesman braced himself and muttered , facetiously , " Well , tell my wife the last time you saw me I was going in . " Replacement Items Cut Ass items were swept off the counters in the early buying spree , new articles were rushed in . The Sunbeam Mixmaster , one of the most popular and deepest-cut items , disappeared from the shelves of most of the stores yesterday . In its place , the Dormeyer Mixer was put up . Its fixed price was $46.50 . Macy 's cut it to $30.55 , and shortly thereafter , as comparison shoppers brought word of the cut , Gimbels reduced its price to the Macy level . Sales clerks reported that many shoppers , unable to take advantage of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could not be learned , however , whether there were sufficient purchases of these non-sale items to offset whatever losses the stores might be incurring through the cuts on the loss-leaders . Non-sale purchasing was particularly marked in the lower-priced men 's suit division , which adjoins the section where Palm Beach , Springweave and Haspel suits in many instances no longer were available . Other items that were sharply reduced in most of the stores were Palm Beach slacks , Bayer Aspirin , which went down to 24 cents a hundred , Ken cards , Mayfair vacuum cleaners , Proctor steam irons , record players , infra-red broilers , books typewriters . While the price reductions continued , they were not as sharp as on the preceding three days . There even were nominal price increases on a number of items , including Curity diapers and some deodorants . The upward changes were generally attributed to the sellout of certain items in rival stores . I.

Rivals Challenge Statement A statement in yesterday 's NEW YORK TIMES that Macy contended it must maintain its 6 per cent cash savings policy and that the other stores had accepted this policy prior to the beginning of the price war on Tuesday was challenged by ** Street , Gimbels and Bloomingdale 's . Richard J. Blum , executive head of ** Street ; said that at no time had his store ever knowingly permitted Macy or any Other store to sell anything at a price lower than that at ** Street . Louis Broido , executive vice president of Gimbel Brothers , denied the store ever had accepted " any such thing .

He cited a recent 15 per cent reduction in the cost of all books , and reported that Macy 's had done nothing about meeting these prices . Richard Weil Jr. , president of Macy 's , which reportedly is being cut off by two suppliers of summer men 's wear and writing instruments , said the store would continue to offer merchandise at its own prices to lower the cost on more and more items . He also said " a way would be found " to bring in the merchandise that was to be cut off . The price warmn New York also gave impetus to similar developments in other sections of the country . In Memphis , at least two stores reacted to the Supreme Court limitation on fair-trade pricefixing agreements by reporting sharp reductions , and two large stores in San Francisco were reported ready to cut prices on fairtraded items beginning tomorrow .
