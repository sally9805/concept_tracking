txt Switch in the top command of the price control administration almost certainly brings a price freeze nearer  --  possibly a rollback to Jan. 2 levels within a week or 10 days . With letters to and from President Truman that breathe an admirable spirit of magnanimity , Dr. Alan Valentine retires as Economic Stabilization Director after only three months in office and is replaced by Eric Johnston , long-time head of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and current czar of the motion picture industry . ' Washington 's feelings are those of relief . " If anybody can do an impossible job . Eric can , " is the frequent comment . Behind the switch is a story of personality difference . But overshadowing any human drama is the huge economic stake involved . The stake is nothing less than the value of the American dollar . Prices Soar Unchecked Nobody can doubt the crisis . In an ominous statistic published this week end , it is revealed that for the 10th straight week average wholesale prices have hit an all-time high . Failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has permitted the value of the dollar to decline while the cost lof living soared . ' Now a big new complexity is added . One of the best ways of drying up excess purchasing power to halt inflation is to ; Let the public to increase savings instead of competing for scarce goods . To this end , the Treasury is ready to launch a big-scale War Savings Bond drive . It already has proposed a 10-year extension of existing E bonds- at interest , $1 , - 000,000,000 of which matures this year and $4,300,000,000 next year . But people hestitate to buy bonds if inflation is n't checked , for it means depreciation of investment . Urgent calls for fast action to control bounding prices have risen from the Treasury . Since Pearl Harbor . the dollar 's buying power has fallen 40 per cent . It was worth 95.1 cents on the 1935-39 average in 1941 ; last year it was down to 59.6 cents ; today it is 58 cents . The buying power of $75 put into an E bond in 1941 has shrunk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total $100 will buy less than the principal alone in 1941 . ' Shift Comes Suddenly The need for action is urgent . It is one of the precipitating factors in the change in economic top command . A feature of the situation is the complete frankness with which the exchange of letters between President Truman and Dr. Valentine disclose divided views within the economic stabili zation agency , whose top boss is hard-driving Charles E. Wilson , formerly of General Electric . The change was not unexpected , but it came with startling suddenness . From the letter and from oral comments , it appears that Dr. Valentine , a former university president , did not want to move until he had set up a plan that would meet criticism and cover most eventualities . Admirable as this academic thoroughness of preparation was , the cost of goods meanwhile bounded upward steadily . The third man in the team , roly-poly Michael V , DiSalle , who left the mayorship of Toledo to take on the job of price administrator and who is used to the hurly-burly of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was obvious that such a freeze would produce countless requests for exceptions and exemptions , most of them justified : also that Mr. DiSalle 's outfit did not have the manpower to handle them expeditiously . Dr. Valentine rejected the proposal . But it was the question of whether to throw any obstacle at hand into the hole in the dike or to wait until blueprints for careful cement work had been drawn up . Johnston Popular Mr. Johnston is popular in Congress and will be confirmed quickly . The change does not reduce the difficulty of the problem of halting inflation in the slightest . Mr. Truman 's budget message this week reduced it to simple terms . The government proposes to spend about $70,000,000,000 , its income will be around $55,000 , - 000,000 and the inflationary deficit , building up competitive purchasing power for scarce civilian goods , will be about $15,000,000,000 . This excess spending power can be either blotted up in new taxes or reduced by savings . The effort at mandatory controls is only a part of the over-all steps needed to combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other steps are not taken . Dr. Valentine was brought to Washington by W. Stuart Sy ? ington , who himself has been largely eased out of the picture by the arrival of Mr. Wilson . Those who knew Dr. Valentine 's background of stout opposition to government interference and controls won- , dered from the outset about the success of the experiment . The Wilson-Johnston-DiSalle team now seems bent on quicker emergency measures . While for the moment the tendency is to make the expendable Dr. Valentine the target of critical comment , it is only a matter of time before the countermeasures of the new team may be the target .
