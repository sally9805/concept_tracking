" Proletarian " painting , the high-style school of U.S. art in the late ' 30s , is out of fashion today-but one of the A students of that school who still commands attention is dour Jack Levine , 37 . Even abstractionists , today 's darlings ( whom he sneeringly refers to as " Space Cadets " ) , respect his work ; and conservative as well as advance-guard museums collect it . This fall Levine 's paintings will get more attention than ever before : a retrospective show opens this month at Boston 's Institute of Contemporary Art , and will be seen later at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center , Washington 's Phillips Gallery and other museums . <P> Levine focuses , with the rapt attention of a G.I. picking lice out of his clothes , on the seamy side of American life . Born and raised in Boston 's South End slums , he knows the harsh , scrabbling lives of the poor , and he brings their hurt faces alive in his canvases . The stock characters in Levine 's more preachy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than types ; he paints them with real anger and a genius for caricature . <P> In technique , Levine is an expressionist . He twists figures and features with an El Greco-like abandon , and trowels on hot &; cold colors almost as lavishly as Rouault . But Levine dislikes the term : " Expressionism , " he says solemnly , " puts too high a premium on subjective reactions . " <P> Every now &; then Levine descends from his propaganda perch to paint a frankly personal picture . Only slightly larger than the reproduction opposite , King Saul carries no message except its touch of pathos . It is the latest of a series of Israelite kings which Levine began as a tribute to his father . The painting served as a relaxation from Levine 's big , grim canvases , took years of off &; on " fiddling " to finish . <P> " Perhaps the most apparent thing about artists of the past , " muses Levine wistfully , " is their freedom from crisis and dilemma in the sense we find it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not concern himself with " crisis and dilemma " to achieve high rank among contemporary painters .
