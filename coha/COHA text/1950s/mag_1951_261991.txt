Machine-made cigars have been old stuff in the U.S. ever since the late George Washington Hill , master huckster , coined the advertising slogan , " SPIT is a horrid word , but it 's worse on the end of your cigar . " Until Hill and his machine-made Cremos , the U.S. had happily smoked stogies rolled by hand . It was Hill 's contention that cigar makers ' saliva held the stogies together at their tip , but cigar makers insisted that they used vegetable gum . <P> In the home of fine Havana tobaccos , Hill is not honored . There is nothing in the world , say the Cubans , like the coronas , perfectos and panatelas rolled by the torcedores of their capital city , men who have inherited jobs and skills from fathers and grandfathers , and who hire " readers " to sit in their midst and recite CalderOn , Cervantes and Marx to them as they work . <P> Yet machine competition from abroad has been stiff : one machine can turn out cigars 25 times as fast as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cigar makers have been out of work . Last year the hard-pressed Cuban Cigar Makers Union , in an attempt to revive the industry 's prosperity , agreed to the introduction of machines . <P> But union and management reckoned without Cuba 's thousands of one-room cigar makers . Convinced that their livelihood was at stake , these small independents rose last week in rebellion . Many other Cubans joined in their protest . In the central province of Santa Clara , crowds seized 14 town halls , often with the enthusiastic consent of mayors and aldermen . In Placetas , 5,000 marched through the streets shouting : " Down with mechanization ! " <P> Order was restored only when President Carlos Prio Socarrs promised that local markets would be safe for handwork . Hereafter , he decreed , machine-made cigars would be for export only . The big companies , which had already installed 29 machines ( displacing 768 workers ) and ordered 12 more , refused to accept Prio 's decision as final . " Now that we have invested our money , " wailed one big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is definitive . Our export market is not large enough to take our full machine output . We need 20% of the home market besides . " The battle of men V. machines was not yet over .
