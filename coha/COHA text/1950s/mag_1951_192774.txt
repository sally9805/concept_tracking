At the mud-hut village of Panmunjom , the place agreed on as the new site for cease-fire talks , the Communists put up a large tent . Under it , Communist and U.N . liaison officers met last week to haggle-not over peace , but over how wide the neutral zone must be in which to discuss the peace . At this point , two U.N . planes , strafing the Kaesong neutral area by mistake , killed a twelve-year-old Korean boy and wounded his two-year-old brother . After an investigation , General Matt Ridgway accepted responsibility for the occurrence , expressed his " heartfelt grief " and promised " prompt and appropriate disciplinary action . " <P> The Red protest had been mild , almost perfunctory . Since the incident had been real and not a piece of propaganda trumpery , the Reds seemed almost to regard it as only a nuisance . For reasons of their own-perhaps the weight of allied firepower in the battle zones-they seemed anxious to get on with the truce talks .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
