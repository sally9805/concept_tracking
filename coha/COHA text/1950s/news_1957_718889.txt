Brundag 's Tax Cut Goal The tax cut goal outlined by Mr. Brimdage would mean lower levies effective between July 1 , 1958 , and June 30 , 1959 . This timing is in line with Administration efforts to view its fiscal 1959 budget calculations , which will he presented to Congress next January , with an eye toward including some proposals for tax reduction .

" Even without such improvement , " he declared , " success in the strenuous efforts with . in the Administration to make each dollar go further should help us to hold the line .

" " While an increase in spending can not he ruled out , " the Budget Director said , " I certainly hope it will net occur , and am taking all possible steps to prevent it . " ? Chairman Byrd ( D. , Va. ) of the Senate Finance Committee , which next week launches hearings expected to he critical of the Administration 's monetary policies , declared that . despite Mr. Brundage 's prediction of possible higher spending in fiscal ' 59.

Mills ( D. , Ark. ) , preceded the appearance today of Treasury Secretary Humphrey and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Martin . ? The Budget Chief agreed yesterday with Mr. Mills when the lawmaker said nothing Congress is doing now on appropriations hills would actually cut spending greatly in the coming fiscal year and there was a good chance an unbalanced budget would result if Congress voted tax cuts on the assumption of lower spending . ? Mr. Brundage said he felt at the present time tax reduction - might ... add to inflationary pressures . but conceded if an ' economic down ' turn should develop , some tax cuts might be ' justified in the long range interests of the economy . For the current fiscal year , the Budget Di rector said , " Insofar as we can tell at this time the total budget receipts are likely to be fairly close to the budget estimates  --  perhaps a $100 million either way  --  and budget expenditures are now estimated to be approximately one-half billion dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estimate of Defense Outlays Mr. Brundage explained that the current fiscal year 's spending total would run above earlier estimates mostly because of a step-up in the Air Force 's ballistic missile program and higher rates of aircraft procurement . It 's estimated defense outlays may rise $2 billion above the $36 billion scheduled in the original budget . This added defense spending , Mr , Brundage said , would more than offset reductions expected under the military portion of the foreign aid program , by the Federal . National Mortgage Association , the Export-Import Bank in operations of the soil bank program . The Budget Director also blamed part of the spending rise on inflation . His new estimates on the spending outlook , Mr. Brundage said , took into account price rises since the January budget estimates were prepared December , but did not consider any ' price rises that might take place from now on . He contended that if the Administration made no positive efforts to hold down spending , would go up some $3 billion a year just from automatic expansion of some present prOgrams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current fiscal year goes up $500 million , as Mr. Brundage predicted , and revenues decline $100 million below earlier estimates , as he suggested they might , the Government 's surplus would drop to just $1.1 billion . As for the fiscal 1958 budget now before Congress , Mr. Beendage noted Congressional staffs already were predicting that the Administration 's $71.8 billion spending , estimate would be exceeded by $1 billion to $1.5 billion . ConcluSion ? Called " PrematUre " " I believe it is somewhat premature to accept this conclusion , " he declared , " as we are making the most strenuous efforts to make savings wherever possible . " He said the very fact that defense spending jumped so sharply this fiscal year ... indicated that sonic offsetting reductions might he possible next fiscal year . The ' Budget Director said fiscal 1958 spending would depend " a good deal " on the action of Congress . He urged lawmakers to approve such things as postal rate increases , but he opposed boosting the Federal National Mortgage Association 's ' borrowing authority too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold down money for Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation pmjects lo the " really urgent . " ones . The House Appropriations Committee acted along this line yesterday when it sliced $61.6 million , or over 7% , from an appropriations bill for domestic public works programs . A total of $876.5 million had been requested in this field for the year starting July 1 : - The appropriations cover  --  such ? programs as the river and harbor projects of the Army Engineer Corps , reclamation projects of the In , tenths Department and of the Bonneville Power Administration . ' Total House Cuts The committee action on the bill brings to , 1 $1,042,955,929 the total that the Appropriations i Committee or the House itself has cut so far from the 62 appropriation bills acted on for the year starting July 1 . These 12 bills involved Administration requests for just over $56 billion , so the House and committee action represents an overall cut of just over 7 , " ; .

The House already has chopped 52.6 billion from the defense request , and the administration has asked the Senate to rescind $1.2 billion of this cut . Involved is a recent directive from Defense Secretary Wilson banning so-called " instalment buying " of complex military items such as planes and missiles . Air Force officials have contended a rigid interpretation of the edict ? which prohibits the ordering of equipment un . less a service has sufficient spending authority to pay for completed items  --  will slew down or curtail $4 billion of procurement programs . Sen. Robertson ( D. , Va. ) said it does n't make sense for the Pentagon to ask the Senate to rescind House cuts when , by its own action , it is barring the Air Force from spending al ? ready-appropriated funds .

In another budget development , the full House Government ' Operations Committee . ap ? proved a bill aimed at confining Congressional appropriations in  --  any one fiscal year to what the Government actually expects to spend that year . The bill , which witfi approved by a subcom ? mittec earlier this week , is hacked by the.Ad ? ministration and carries out a key recom mendation - of the Hoover Commission . Simi tar legislation has already passed the Senate but the House outlook for the bill remains dark despite the committee action yesterday , be cause of strong opposition from key member ! of the House Appropriations Committee .
