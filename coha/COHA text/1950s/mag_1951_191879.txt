As the Communists swept over the China mainland in 1949 , Mao Tse-tung 's regime promised moderation , tolerance and forgiveness . Last week tolerance was lost in the mounting clamor of a great Red terror . Mao Tse-tung 's regime announced the execution of 120 " counterrevolutionaries " at Canton , 56 at Swatow , 89 at Hankow , 28 at Kweilin . In scenes reminiscent of the tumbril-and-guillotine days of the French Revolution , the Communists turned the spectacle of death into public carnivals , with music and dances . <P> China 's Red press described the liquidation of one " batch , " numbering several hundred . Tien Feng had wrecked locomotive boilers in Peking 's railroad shop . Li Chih-hsiang had ruined wind gauges , wind pumps and water pumps . Tung Hua-chang had inspired workers to slow down . Chin Han-kui had fabricated 90 false rumors against the government . On their way to execution , the victims were paraded slowly through Peking 's streets to the scenes of their crimes , where death was meted out . <P> " Thousands of citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reported the Reds ' New China News Agency . " All were highly indignant , and cursed these counter-revolutionaries . " Peking 's People 's Daily added that the crowds " gritted their teeth in hatred . . . Cheers and applause were heard as these people were killed . " A mob surrounded a van transporting one group of prisoners , and would have torn them to pieces had not a well-armed guard intervened . After executions , onlookers kicked the bodies and beat them with sticks . <P> The People 's Daily quoted from the approving comments of the people . A shoemaker : " Shooting is too lenient . " A peasant : " Too bad I arrived late . I would have liked to see this special agent die . " A dozen textile workers vowed that they were so inspired by the executions that they would now step up their production . A Buddhist priest , Chu Tsan , member of the Peking Municipal Consultative Council , was quoted as saying : " To execute these counter-revolutionaries does not contradict the Buddhist command to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the majority of the people will be saved , and criminals will be deterred from committing crimes . That is good . "
