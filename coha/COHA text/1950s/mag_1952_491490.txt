. I WAS THE WITNESS By WHITTAKER CHAMBERS 2. 0NE of the more attractive traits of the average American , but one which for more than three decades has blinded him to a ruthless plot to destroy all that he values , is his contempt for conspiracy . Until the Hiss Case broke and laid open the dark pattern of the communist underground 's secret invasion of high Government circles , his contempt amounted to outright disbelief . Even today , with Alger Hiss and others in prison , many good citizens retain a hunch that the whole affair was a mere political circus . It seems , to them , inconceivable that men  --  especially educated men Copyright 1952 by C1tanthrrn of good family background and economic position ? could give themselves covertly to such bold plotting against the nation and the freedom which it nurtures and preserves . This incredulity was one of the biggest obstacles which I , as the ex-communist witness , faced in that frightful month of August , 1948 , when the Hiss Case was getting under way and the Hiss forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was depraved , and possibly insane . Even some members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities were incredulous as I droned on , naming names , giving dates , and so on . One of these was the then chairman , Congressman J. Parnell Thomas , of New Jersey . Thomas himself before long was to land in jail for a much lessimaginative crime than criminal conspiracy . But he asked a question which I have been asked many times by somewhat more imaginative people . From the record of the committee 's hearing of August 25 , 1948 : THE CHAIRMAN : What influenced you to join the Communist Party originally ? Mx . CHAMBERS : It is a very difficult question . As a student , I went to Europe . It was then shortly after the first World War . I found Germany in chaos , and partly occupied : Northern France and parts of Belgium were smashed to pieces . It seemed to me that a crisis had been reached in Western civilization which the society was not able to solve by the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual means . I lust studied for a considerable time British Fabian socialism , and rejected it as unworkable in practice . I was then very much influenced by a book called Reflections on Violence , by Georges Sorel , a syndicalist , and ' shortly therefore I came to the writings of Marx and Lenin . They seemed to me to explain the nature of the crisis , and what to do about it . THE CHAIRMAN : Well , I can understand how a young man might join the Communist Party , but will you explain to us how a person who has made a real living in this country , a person with a large income , such as some of the witnesses we have had before this committee , over a period of time  --  What , in your mind , would influence them to join the party here in this country ? ? ? Ma . CHAMBERS : The making of a good living does not necessarily blind a man to a critical period which he is passing through . Such people , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral solution in a world of moral confusion . Marxism , Leninism offers an oversimplified ex-planation of the causes and a program for action . The very vigor of the project . particularly appeals to the more or less sheltered middle-class intellectuals , who feel that the whole context of their lives has kept . them away from the world of reality . I do not know whether I make this very clear , but I am trying to get at . it . They feel a very natural concern , one might almost Kay a Christian concern , for underprivileged People . They feel a great intellectual concern at least , for recurring economic crises , the problem of war , which in our lifetime has assumed an atrocious proportion , and which always weighs on them . What shall I do ? At that crossroads the evil thing , communism , lies in wait for them with a simple answer . The cilium ( of my own youthful struggle for a faith came when I was still a student at Columbia University , and while another young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross for almost a decade , was a liberal-arts student at Johns Hop-kins University , Baltimore , preparing for Harvard 141w . One day , early in 1925 , I sat down on a Concrete bench on the Columbia campus , facing a little Greek shrine and the statue of my old political hero , Alexander Hamilton . The sun was shining , but 11 was chilly , and I sat huddled in my overcoat . I was there to answer once for all two questions : Can a man go on living in a world that is dying ? ' If he can , what should he do in the crisis of the twentieth century ? The dying world of 1925 was , I thought , without faith , hope , character ; without understanding of its malady or will to overcome it . It was dying , but it laughed . And this laughter was not the defiance of a vigor that refuses to know when it is whipped . It was the loss , by the mind of a whole civilization , of the power to distinguish between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the power to distinguish between good and evil . - This failure I , too , shared with the world of Which I was a part . Only in communism had I found any practical answer at all to the crisis , and the will to make thatanswer work . It was not an attractive answer , just as the Communist Party was not an attractive party . Yet when I rose from the bench on the Columbia campus , I had decided to leave college for good , and change the whole direction of my life . I had decided to join the Communist Party . In the late 1920 's 1 helped to edit the Daily Worker , then , during the Depression years of the early 1930 's , became editor of the magazine New Masses . There was a new spirit in the magazine . Until then , the communist control had been masked . I edited as a communist . Nothing was surer to attract the noncommunist intellectuals who were looking for the Communist Party as I had looked for it in 1925 , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The intellectuals , whose world had crumbled in the depression , were now thronging toward the party . Every year the communist National Students League was graduating its hundreds from the colleges . These were the first quotas of the great drift from Columbia , Harvard and elsewhere . These were the years that floated Alger Hiss into the party and made possible the big undergrounds ; the infiltration of the Government , science , education and all branches of communications , but especially radio , motion pictures , hook , magazine and newspaper publishing . As an example of how the Communist belief can breach the walls of an American home , let me tell you something about my family . The Chambers family , though it had some special overtones and undertones of its own , fulfilled the description " sheltered middle-class intellectual " right down to the ground . My mother , whose maiden name was Whittaker , was the 60 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 16 ; 1952 daughter of an inventor who made , and lost , several minor fortunes . She was educated privately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was something of a beauty , became an actress , much to the agitation of her family , which clung to the Victorian conception that the stage was not respectable . In New York she met and married Jay Chambers , then an artist for the New York World . Later on , Jay Chambers transferred his talents to book and magazine illustration , at which he did quite well . As a father , he had one tragic defect ; he was one of those unhappy men who are unable to make any real emotional contact with their own children and , as a result , are strangers to them . Besides myself , there was one other Chambers child  --  my younger brother Richard . The world I first became aware of as a child was not Philadelphia , where I was born in 1901 , but the south shore of Long Island . When I was two or three , my parents bought a big frame house  --  my mother lives in it  --  in Lynbrook , about eighteen miles from New York City and seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village of some 200 souls . They were chiefly workingmen , shopkeepers , farmers and " baymen " ? men who owned or worked oyster beds in the tidal creeks and salt marshes between the ocean and the farm land . Even seven miles inland the sea was always around us . Sometimes it came as fog , rolling in suddenly , heavy with the smell of tidal water , softly blotting out the houses and the streets . Sometimes it came as sound ? the terrible sound of the surf pouring without pause on the beaches seven miles away . As a very little child , I used to hear it while I ttled to fall asleep . I would sit up in my bed to listen to it on winter nights when the cold air brought it in clearly . I was frightened , for it seemed about to pound away the land . It was the sound of inhuman force  --  the first I knew . I early learned that the root cause of panics was Democrats . I knew about " Democrats and hard times " long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents were Republicans the way an Englishman is for the king ; it was not a matter that required any thought . Even my father , who nerar had the slightest interest in politics and never mentioned the subject , always went off dutifully to the polls when the party buggy called for hirn on election day , and voted the straight Republican ticket . My father was a snort , mild man who became soft-looking from the excellent food my mother prepared . Though sedentary by nature , he was physically powerful . Not once in our lives did he ever play with me . He was uncommunicative to the point of being mute . Once in a while he would utter one word : " Do n't " ? when my brother and I were doing something he did not like . Every evening when my father came home from his office , my brother and I had to meet him at the door and kiss him . He would stoop to receive each kiss with a smile that was less affectionate than baffling . In the morning we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with my mother , we would go to the window and watch him go down the street . As he reached the corner , he would wave once and be gone . I loved my father dearly in those days . If " had to work , " and did not get home until late , I would often lie awake listening until I heard him turn the knob of the front door . Only then , sometimes after midnight , would I fall asleep . Yet when he left home in the morning , it was as if the sun had come out , and the image of my mother , which , when my father was home , seemed rather quiet and withdrawn , took over and dominated the house . In my earliest recollections of her , my mother is sitting in the lamplight , in a Windsor rocking chair , in front of the parlor stove . She is holding my brother on her lap . It is bedtime and , in a thin sweet voice , she is singing him into drowsiness . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I crawl behind my mother 's chair because I do not like the song she is singing , a sad French song , and do not want her to see what it does to me . The vowels darken ominously . My mother 's voice deepens dramatically , as if she were singing in a theater . This was the part of the song I disliked most , not only because I knew that it was sadder than the first part , but because my mother was deliberately  --  and rather unfairly , I thought  --  making it sadder . My dislike of my mother 's dramatic singing went so deep that to this day I =mot bear to have anyone singing around me . My father had never wanted to buy the house on Long Island , in the first place . It was big , built like a nest of boxes and painted a faded yellow . Over the years , the paint faded still more and peeled off in an incurable acne . The shutters , that had once been green , weathered to a washed-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . That made some of the windows look like laslaless eyes . My father would never give my mother money to repaint or repaper the house . She had overridden him in buying the house , and he was determined that he would do nothing to improve it . At last my mother made a little parcel of her jewelry  --  a fairly pathetic hoard , which included a brooch watch her father had given her and some rings and pins chiefly of sentimental value . These she took to New York and pawned  --  an act that made her skin . crawl , as she told me . With the money she obtained , she had the walls re-papered . She expected my father to be pleased . Instead , he studiedly ignored the papering while it was going on and made no comment at all when it was finished . My mother wept and her sobs were dreadful to hear . My father also refused to give her the money to redeem her jewelry , and she lost all of it . If there was any religion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never prayed or said grace at table . I never heard my father mention religion in his life . My mother mentioned religion from time to time , but scarcely in a religious way . An enlightened woman , she felt that religion was not a subject that would interest enlightened people . It was absurd , she sometimes said , for people to call themselves Christians when they did not practice Christianity . This does not mean that my parents were atheists . Each of t hem , I suspect , had a personal belief of some kind , which , in my mother 's case , later became active . But they shared the view  --  still current  --  that it is wrong to influence children 's minds in religious matters , and that they should he left to develop their own religious beliefs , or to have none at all , if they choose . While in grade school and taking my first insecure steps in the outside world , the one secure world that I knew  --  my home ? collapsed . I had noticed that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as my mother put it  --  and was getting home from Manhattan later and later . Once or twice , at this time , I was awakened in the night by angry voices  --  voices such as I had seldom heard anywhere . In terror , I realized that they were my parents ' voices . They were quarreling . Occasionally a woman 's name was mentioned , a woman my father knew . Sometimes , in the morning , my mother would be crying . Once , there were black and red marks on her throat . She took to shutting us out in the kitchen while she paced up and down the long living room , holding desperate monologues with the walls , her voice more eloquent by the quiet tears that she could not quite keep from filling her eyes . Obviously , my father was not a man who could sustain the force of such affection . When he was gone ? he moved to an apartment in Brooklyn  --  my mother prepared to live wholly , as she said , for the only beings life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first night that my father was gone , my mother moved my brother 's cot and mine into her bedroom , which was at the back of the house . For the first time , we locked the front door . My mother also locked our bedroom door and we helped her move a heavy bureau against it . Soon my mother took to keeping an ax in the closet . " A woman with an ax , " she said , " is a match for any man . " In that somewhat uneasy atmosphere , I began to take a knife to bed with me . Sometimes , in the middle of the night , I would feel to make sure that it was still under my pillow . I always put it away carefully in the morning . My mother never knew that I had it . Nevertheless , those years when my father lived away from us were among the happiest of my mother 's life . Perhaps they were the happiest of my brother 's and my boyhood too . My mother , my brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own lives , we shut out the world . My mother enjoyed t he proud sense of being equal to any challenge life made of her . Every week my father sent us eight dollars for living expenses . At the time and place , it was possible to manage on eight dollars , and my mother was a good manager . We were never hungry . Rutabagas were very cheap then and a big one would last us several meals . We also ate a good deal of pea soup , and a great deal of spaghetti and rice . I grew husky on a diet that would scandalize a dietitian . Fuel was sometimes a problem . We used to keep a sharp eye out for houses that were under construction . After the carpenters had gone home at night , we would fill burlap bags with beam and board ends . My brother and I could each manage one bag . I have seen my beautiful and slender mother plodding through the dark with a heavy bag of kindling slung over each shoulder . Sometimes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our living , my mother began to bake cakes for sale . I would go out and hustle orders . The next day I would deliver the cakes . In summer I peddled vegetables . I also developed a regular route for eggs . When the first of our incubator chicks grew big enough , I went out and got orders for dressed broilers . Then my mother told me to go and kill the first chickens . The thought of hurting anything so helpless and foolish was too much for me . I said , " 1 ca n't . " My mother did not even answer me . She took a sharp knife and pressed the handle into my hand . " I will not have any man in this house , " she said fiercely , " who is afraid of blood . " I knew that she was thinking of my father . I caught a chicken . I sat down with it in the coop , stroked its feathers and tried to quiet its alarm . It was a sunny day . The thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light must now fade unnerved me . Why must I darken it ? So that the live , free creature could pass through the bowels of a gross person ? It made no sense . I tied the chicken 's legs and hung it , head down , from a nail , and , as quickly and as mercifully as I could , severed its head . The knife fell as if gravity had jerked it from my hand . Then I hid . In hiding I had these thoughts , in other words or phrases , but substantially these thoughts . Something in me , the deepest thing that makes me what I am , knows that it is wrong to kill anything . But there is something else  --  a necessity ? that forces me to kill . I have the strength to overcome the feeling in myself against killing , and I am proud that I have it , for it is part of what makes me a man . All right . As a man , I will kill . But I will kill always under duress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of myself , and always in rebellion against that necessity which I do not understand or agree to . This was one of the decisive moments of my boyhood . I came out of hiding , cleansed the knife in the ground , took it in the house and laid it down in front of my mother . I have always been grateful to her for handing it to me in the first . place . For years , I was the family butcher . My brother never killed anything . I never killed anything  --  and never kill anything today ? without suffering the same ordeal . One day my mother told my brother and me that my father was coming home to live with us again . In his absence , we had been half a family , but that half had been a happy , active unit . With his return , the chill of his presence spread through the house . My father moved into the big front bedroom . Soon he was surrounded by a clutter of artistic materials without which he seemed unable to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door upon us . For years , all my father 's meals were served to him on a tray in his room . The rest of us ate downstairs in the kitchen . We were no longer a family in the usual sense of the word . We were four people , living in emotional and physical anarchy . fAs time went on , the author 's Grandmother Whittaker , who had gone insane , came to live in the sprawling house . She wore a sealskin coat all year around and , when she roamed the house , now babbling , now silently , she sometimes carried a knife . Mostly , she kept to her room with the door locked , cooking her meals over a tiny stove made of a tomato can . She detested Jay Chambers , whose room was opposite hers . Sometimes , standing behind her locked door , she would scream insults at him until , enraged , he would charge out and shoulder her door open . She would defend herself with a pair of scissors . It was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The small scars I still have on my hands , " he writes , " are where the scissors missed my father and caught me . " ? Editors ' Note . My brother Richard was eighteen or nineteen when he left for Colgate University . He set out gaily , for he went with a group of his fellow high-school students who were his close friends . Unlike me , he had been very popular , for he was a smiling , candid , uncomplicated boy . From college , he wrote my mother regularly . He had not been there long when she told me that she was worried abOut him . He had failed to make a fraternity which his close friend and roommate had made . My mother thought that this had shocked him in some very deep way . This seemed incredible to me . But I am now convinced that my mother was right , that this social rejection to which his sociable nature made him vulnerable was the starting point of his disaster . When Richard got home for the Christmas holidays , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen with my mother  --  an almost unrecognizably white-faced , taut-lipped boy , arguing desperately , but with the natural courtesy that almost never failed him , that life is worthless and meaningless , that to he intelligent is to know this and to have courage to end it . I took him for a long walk . My brother , who had never discussed anything with me , was bursting with talk . My brother , who had never read anything previously , had been reading voraciously ? Rabelais , Montaigne , Voltaire and Diderot . Of the moderns , he seemed to have read only Anatole Prance and Thomas Hardy . All his reading , more jumbled and more immature than mine had ever been , added up to one certainty : the folly of life , the need to end it . By the time his vacation was over , he had withdrawn from me , and I , feeling the baffled hopelessness of trying to help him , had withdrawn from him . He went back to college , not gaily this time . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not believe that he completed his freshman year . For a time , I scarcely saw him . He slept most of the day and was gone most of the night . When I did see him , he was pleasant , but uncommunicative . He had nothing more to say to me . But he was no longer excited . He was very quiet . One day I came in and found him lying an the old couch , where we had suffered the toothaches of our childhood . His eyes were open and he was staring at something ahead of him . His face was pinched and white . After a while , he raised his arm and pointed to a gloomy old Italian print that hung EVENING POST at the end of the couch : " II Conforto " ( Death , the Comforter ) . Then he asked slowly , without looking at me , " If I kill myself , will you kill yourself with me ? " I said , " No . " " Why not ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He laughed meanly . " You 're a coward , Bro , " he said , addressing me by the nickname he had always used . Richard then became interested in remodeling parts of the house . He finished the long , tedious job of molding the baronial ceilings , and put in a new bathroom , laying the tiles and doing the plumbing . He also built himself a workshop behind the house . It was a little house in itself with a gabled roof and a fireplace . He piped in gas from the main house so that he could use his workshop after dark . He moved in a couch and sometimes slept there , surrounded by his tools , his pipe wrenches , vises and dies . My mother was paying him regular wages , which he certainly earned , for he was a first-rate workman . All day he worked steadily , and apparently cheerfully . One day my mot her said to me , " Your brother is drinking . " She told me that he had been drinking for some i.ime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how and where he spent his nights , the names of his friends and that girls were involved . She knew the details of his most , intimate life . Each day he told her what had happened on the night before . " You must go with him , " she said , " and watch over him . I do not know what he is going to do next . But I am afraid that he is going to try to kill himself . " The author stuck close to his younger brother on his speak-easy tours , and once , when Richard tried to kill himself by gas , in i he workshop , resuscitated him . ? Editors ' Note . My father had watched all this helplessly . But one night I heard a shout in the kitchen . I hurried down to find my father and my brother fighting furiously . My brother was drunk and could not see what he was doing . My father was blind with rage and no longer knew what he was doing . He was pummeling my brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pry my father off and failed . At , that , the ulcer of years of anger burst within me  --  as if my father had not done his part to make my brother what he was . I struck at my father . My brother slid to the floor and lay there prone . Above him , my father and I wrestled and fought . Finally I flung him against a cabinet . The ferocious strength drained out of him . His face was ashen and twitching . He was an old man , fighting for breath and panting , " He  --  has been taking girls into that little house  --  at night . Your mother  --  I wo n't stand for it . " I walked over to my father and put my arms around him . We wept . ( Richard ' s drinking increased . He tried to kill himself with gas a second time , and again the author managed to resuscitate him . Richard married and moved to an apartment in Rockville Center , but his wife shortly went back to her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas again . This time he succeeded. ? Editors ' Note . We buried Richard in the Sand Hill graveyard . Every day I walked to the graveyard , sometimes with my mother . Every night I went there alone . I went in rain and in snow , never missing a February 16 , 1952 night . Only when my brother was dead did I know how much I had loved him . My relations with my father softened after Richard 's death . His loneliness , his sense of the failure of his whole life were inescapable , and he began to show me as much affection as it lay in his nature to show anyone . We took to meeting in New York for lunch or supper and walked aimlessly afterward . Wewere still almost as silent with each other as in the past , but now my need for silence had become almost as great as my father 's . One night we met by chance on the Long Island train and walked home from the station together . It was a very starry night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were watching the sky . Both of us saw a meteorite streak across it and flash out as it hit the earth 's atmosphere . " Strange , " said my father  --  who knew little about science ? " to think that a world has ended . " No more than a few months after that my father , while shaving , dropped dead in the bathroom which Richard had installed . We buried him beside my brother . A thought that kept torturing me in these days was whether my brother had not been right in an insight to which he had repeatedly given voice : " We are hopeless . We are gentle people . We are too gentle to face the world . " My instinct told me that he was right , and for some time the question of my own suicide lay before me . Ingo far as I was gentle , I shared my brother 's view . But I was not only gentle . Deep within me there was a savage fierceness that my brother lacked . If you kicked my dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred times , and will refuse again , that time I will wait and fight to destroy you . I can not help myself . Within me there is a force . It says that gentleness which is not prepared to kill or be killed , to destroy the evil that assails life , is not gentleness . It is weakness . It is the weakness of the well-meaning . I decided to live and to fight . I was a communist , and I was irreconcilable . Already I was holding down an unpaid job on the Daily Worker , and I was also working at a regular job in the New York Public Library to earn enough to live on .
