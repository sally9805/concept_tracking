txt The state all but completed its case against William F. Sutton and Thomas Kling on bank robbery charges yesterday . The last three state witnesses  --  policemen  --  are to be heard in Queens County Court in Long Island City today , the ninth trial session . The defense has not told how long it will take with its case , nor has it reached clear-cut decision on whether Sutton is to be called to the stand . The consensus seems to be that he probably will , since he is already doomed to life imprisonment , accrual of two prison escapes and a pending sentence for having a loaded automatic pistol when he was picked up in Brooklyn on Feb. 18 . Assistant District Attorney James called nine witnesses yesterday . Of these , two provided dramatic highlights . They were Mrs. Mary Corbett , Sutton 's former landlady on Staten Island , and Robert Hoffman , manager of the Sunnyside branch of the Manufacturers Trust Company , in Queens . The bank manager put a firm hand on Sutton 's shoulder in the courtroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $63,942.09 from the bank the morning of March 9 , 1950 . Mr. Hoffman , a positive sort of man who spoke in crisp executive phrase and manner , was firm about the 9 cents in the total taken from his bank . He was the first witness to include the figure . Laughter rippled through the chamber when Mr. Hoffman testified that Sutton scolded him for being a few minutes late at the bank the morning of the robbery . The witness said : " He told me that I was late ; said my schedule was off . " County Judge Peter T. Farrell smiled grimly ; ignored the laugh- ter in the three-quarters filled old chamber , Mr. said , " Did you reply ? " The bank manager stopped to think . Finally he said , " I forget whether I did . " Mr. Hoffman 's story was much like the account given to the jury by other bank employes at earlier trial sessions , but added a few details . He told how Sutton took him at pistol point to the vault " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he thought he would see ' big money , ' as he put it . " " Is that what he said ? " Mr. Hoffman came back briskly : " That 's what he actually said . Mr. Sutton the witness used that polite designation throughout his testimony said he was sure that ! in this chest we kept our ' big money . ' He used those words ? ' big money . ' " The chest was empty , later testimony established . Holds Up Under Questioning Mr. Hoffman 's confidence and his firecracker responses seemed to dampen a bit under on-the-move cross-examination by G. W. Herz , Sutton 's lawyer , but his identification and the main facts in his testimony bore up under long questioning . Mr. Herz got the bank manager to concede that Mr. Hen and another than had gone to the bank a few days after the Sutton arrest to discuss the case . Mr. Hoffman identified James , Herz associate , as that man . The lawyer sharply implied that this identification was an error , and after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Farrell he would require the bank manager for further cross-examination before the trial was ended . Note of Romance Late in the afternoon , after a parade of somewhat lesser witnesses , mostly policemen , Mr. wheeled toward the courtroom doors and called , " Mrs. Mary Corbett "  --  and the first romantic note entered the robbery trial . Mrs. Corbett was Sutton 's landlady in her four-room cottage on Kimball Street in Westerleigh , S. L , before the Sunnyside bank robbery . She seemed to quail as spectators ' and reporters ' eyes followed her long walk to the witness chair . She is a slender little woman of 32 , pale-faced and dark-haired . She wore a blue suit and a conservative blue hat Emotional distress was betrayed by roving fingers , downward glances , knee-gripping and flexing facial muscles . Sutton , who rarely looks up from his courtroom stenography , lifted /ids eyes and the skin around them crinkled in a characteristic grin . He half-lifted his right hand in a friendly gesture that might have been a kind of wave of greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she kept fumbling at lips , at chin , at throat  --  answered with a wave that was a bare flutter . Mr. said : " Do you know the defendant Sutton ? " She said , " yes " in a thin little brogue , and was admonished to raise her voice so the jurors might hear . " What name did you know him by ? " " Edward Lynch . " " Where did you first meet him ? " ' " I met him at the farm colony run by the City of New York . " The colony is a kind of old peoples ' poor farm at Willowbrook on Staten Island . Testimony brought out that Sutton was a porter there and that she worked around as a. nurse 's aid . " Do you remember the eleventh day of March , 1950 ? " Mr. asked . " Yes , I do , sir . " " When you came home that evening did you see Sutton in your home ? " " Yes . " The shy witness testified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital that day , when the police had named him as a suspect wanted for the Sunnyside robbery . Mr. said : " Will you tell this court and jury what you said to him and what he said to you when you got home that day ? " Mrs. Corbett made a pass at her face , but fought her hand down . " When I got home , " she faltered , " I told him I had heard that they the police were looking for him . I told him about the picture in the newspapers and he said , no , it was n't him . He said it might be a half-brother of his . He said ' He gets mixed up in stuff like that ' " The witness licked her lips , hunched down into her thin shoulders . Sutton looked up at her every once in a while with a reassuring grin  --  just the ghost of a smile . " And what did Sutton do ? " the prosecutor wanted to know . " He said he was leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . " " How soon after ? " " In a few minutes , anyway . " Mr. got the witness to testify that Sutton had left $700 in cash behind before he went away ; just put it on the table and was gone . A few weeks later the police came and found in Sutton 's upstairs bedchamber a slip of paper that he had used as a kind of work-sheet for the Sunnyside robbery . The sheet was admitted to evidence , but not without some opposition from Mr. Herz . It showed that Sutton had studied the movements of the Sunnyside bank employes at opening time , the time when the hold-up was eventually staged . The notes said : " 8:56 A. M. One W woman . " 8:59 A. M. One M man no topcoat , no hat . " 9 A. M. One Y. M. young man topcoat , felt hat . " 9:01 A. M. One M , two canvas bags . " 9:40 A. M. Postman . " Sutton toyed with his pencil . He took no notes while Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , at one point , the witness wiped tears from her eyes with her bare hand . Mr. turned to Mr. Herz . " Your witness , " he said . Sutton 's lawyer asked one question  --  did the witness know at what time on Sundays Sutton had gone to church  --  but a prosecution objection blocked that as irrelevant , and Mr. Herz murmured , " that 's all ; thank you , " and the witness ' stumbled out as if her knees were weak . The other witnesses during the day included Henry Fullop , motor car salesman who sold Sut- , ton a used Chevrolet last January , for $1,968.85 cash and Detectives Louis Weiner of the Bergen Street precinct in Brooklyn , who arrested Sutton on Feb. 18 . The policeman ' yielded a three-inch-thick stack of mildewed banknotes totaling $10 , - 678 taken from Sutton 's pockets and from his room .
