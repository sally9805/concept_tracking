In Latin America , where government violations of the press are the order of the day . the Inter-American Press Association is the only organized voice of press freedom . Last week , at its tenth annual meeting in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , the outspoken representatives of 390 newspapers and magazines from the Western Hemisphere demonstrated why I.A.P.A. has become the most effective force for an unfettered press in Latin America . <P> Up before the convention stepped Chicago Daily News Publisher John Knight , who denounced the press in President Juan Peron 's Argentina for " kowtowing before the dictator for the dubious privilege of earning a living . " One Argentine editor who refused to kowtow could not attend the I.A.P.A. meeting at all ; he had to send in his report . David Michel Torino , owner of Argentina 's well-named El Intransigente , was not allowed out of the country by Peron 's police . Three years ago he was thrown in jail for " disrespect " of the government . Last September , after his release , an I.A.P.A. representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Freedom of the Press " medal . But Argentine police hustled the I.A.P.A. member aboard an outgoing plane as soon as he landed in Argentina . <P> Argentina is not the only country in which the press is being hamstrung . The Chicago Tribune 's Latin American Correspondent Jules Dubois. an old foe of censorship and suppression , delivered a report singling out Argentina as the worst offender , but also recommending that protests be made to Bolivia , Colombia , the Dominican Republic , Paraguay , Peru , Nicaragua and Venezuela for various forms of interference . <P> To the most notable fighters for press independence went the Mergenthaler Awards , Latin America 's equivalent of the Pulitzer Prizes . Among the winners : Editor Jorge Mantilla of Ecuador 's El Comercio , who won the $500 prize for " work on behalf of press freedom " after he refused to print a government communique in his paper and was closed down by the police ; and Carlos Lacerda , fiery publisher of Brazil 's Tribuna da Imprensa ( TiME . Aug. 16 ) , for his crusading editorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lesson we learn from events in Brazil . It is the growing responsibility of the press in forming a public opinion capable of fighting . "
