IN THE latter part of April and the early part of May I went on a conducted tour through Spain . My trip was not arranged by one of the commercial travel agencies but by the Paris headquarters of the anti-Franco underground . It lasted three weeks . If I visited some of the spots to which tourists are usually taken , it was not in order to see the sights but because these places were convenient rendezvous for men I wanted to meet . Most of them were among the nearly three million Spaniards who live under constant suspicion , in what is called " provisional liberty , " and are subject to arbitrary arrest at any moment . None of them , especially during this troubled spring , could afford to be noticed talking to a foreign visitor ina place that was likely to be watched . But the Franco government , one of them told me , has apparently not yet realized that subversion goes beyond the proletariat , and does not keep a lookout for suspicious characters in museums and luxury hotels . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there are places where it would n't be possible . The secret police have n't been issued dinner coats yet . " Naturally , on this trip I did not visit Spain as a journalist . An Italian citizen living in France , I happen to have a passport on which an official mistakenly wrote " business man " in the space reserved for the bearer 's profession . In Spain , his mistake served me in good stead . If anyone got curious , I was an agent for an Italian maker of optical goods . My tour took me to the Basque country and Catalonia , with a stop in Navarre . I went to Madrid and Salamanca and south to Seville . I arrived in Barcelona a few weeks after the streetcar strike which marked the first public resistance to Franco since the end of the civil war ; 1 was in the Basque country in time to witness some of the strikes there ; and I passed through Madrid a few days before the anti-Franco demonstration of May 22 . In the course of my tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . My trip went off smoothly , without any unpleasant surprises from the police or any missed appointments . This fact is in itself evidence of the degree of co-ordination already achieved by the various groups opposing the Caudillo 's regime . W HEN I crossed the border into Spain , customs officials took away the books I had brought along as presents to friends . They kept the ones by Jean-Paul Sartre ( an amoral writer ) and by Balzac ( on the Index ) , but returned the letters of the Marquis de Sade . It is still good to be a marquis in the land of the Inquisition . It was evening . I took a streetcar , as I had been told to do , and found it full of workmen carrying big loaves of bread . I was later told that they were Spanish Basques who have jobs in France . Every night when they come back from work they bring with them a loaf or two of white bread , now unobtainable legally in Spain , to sell at black-market prices in the fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my informant said , tolerate this illegal traffic and take their cut . Next morning I was on a bus for Tolosa , one of the Basque towns where a strike was in progress . Beside me sat a Basque nationalist whom I shall call Pablo , first of the underground agents I was scheduled to meet . " The government is worried , " said Pablo , " because it ca n't figure out who gave the strike order . " " Are the police so inefficient ? " I asked . " No , but the Basques are sticking together . " He showed me a copy of a small printed sheet calling for the strike . " This was distributed all over two of the three Basque provincesGuipitzcoa and Vizcaya ? before the Madrid government even heard about it . You must MAGAZINE remember that we have no great industrial concentrations here except for Bilbao , which is the second largest manufacturing city in Spain . Yet all over the two provinces the strikes went off as scheduled . Ninety per cent of the workers walked out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo then ? and others later on in Barcelona ? how they explained the origin of the Barcelona streetcar strike , the first one of all . From what I had heard in France , it appeared to have been spontaneous . Was this true ? And if it was , had the underground leaders foreseen such a popular outbreak ? All those I talked to told me they had not . The Catalan underground was taken by surprise , they said , both by the outbreak of the strike and by its success . When a student , one morning , found that the fare had gone up , he refused to get on the streetcar and shouted to other prospective passengers not to board it either . They followed his lead , the idea spread , and soon all the streetcars in Barcelona were going around empty of passengers ? most of them with their windows broken . The strike lasted four days , and on the fifth the fare was reduced to its former level . But the people of Barcelona had tasted victory and it was sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week later , March 12 . " The opposition parties , " I was told by a man in Barcelona , " were not unaware that the tracts were being distributed . But the number that were passed around were a revelation to them . " The tracts were copied out by hand , mimeographed , and even printed by people who had nothing to do with any of the organized resistance groups . When virtually the whole city went on strike March 12 , the latter were in the position of the sorcerer 's apprentice . " The strike looked like the result of perfect discipline . In reality , it was almost entirely improvised . " To the opposition groups in Catalonia and throughout Spain , all my informants agreed , the events in Barcelona provided such encouragement as they had never had before . They began to tighten their relations with one another , to make plans for action . " We have made more progress in the past few weeks , " one member of the Catalan underground told me , " than we had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked the girl behind the bar . I told her where I had come from . " What do they think of the strikes in France ? " asked a workman at my elbow . " They do n't know much about them . " " They ought to know , " said another . Two policemen with tommy guns over their shoulders came in , hot and perspiring , and ordered drinks . The conversations in Basque continued . Caf ? s , I gathered , were neutral spots where both sides could come in for refreshment between rounds . " Try not to attract too much attention here in Tolosa , " said one of my neighbors . " Even foreigners are getting arrested now . " He and two others led me to a table in a corner of the room . They gave me tobacco to roll a cigarette . I passed around a package of French Gauloises . " You have ready-rolled cigarettes in France and your tobacco is better , " said one , and we began to talk more freely . Oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of a liter per person per month . As it forms one of the average Spaniard 's main items of nourishment and the chief source of fat in his diet , such a ration is grotesquely inadequate . But on the free market in Tolosa oil had risen to 60 pesetas a liter ? and my companions , unskilled workmen , earned 15 pesetas a day . " Potatoes are 3 pesetas a kilo , " said one . " If we have kids ? and I have three ? that 's all we can afford to eat . The five of us live in one room and it costs 200 pesetas a month . Somehow we have to buy clothes . And yet you see me here drinking wine at 50 centimos a glass . But what workman in the world will do without a drink now and then ? Besides , today is special . " Someone came in and said the police had finally stopped trying to molest the women in the church . A cheer went up for the Basque clergy and I went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo. 44 HAT proves the weakness of the regime , " he said as we were having lunch , " is that even the Carlistsas individuals ? are taking part in the strike . Half the Falangists in this region have turned in their arms and resigned . Even the police have been extremely correct with the strikers arrested in the past few days . After they are freed , the prisoners come back and tell us how disgusted the members of the Guardia Civil are with the dirty work they have to do . Whenever they can , the police go to a worker 's house to arrest him at the time when he 's least likely to be there . In some places the Guardia Civil have been confined to their barracks , and the soldiers too , because of their lack of zeal . " Even two years ago it would have been unimaginable that they should have such an attitude . But now things have changed . Gradually Franco has lost the supporters who helped him come to power in the days of Hitler and Mussolini . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social reforms he said he stood for , and they are tired of having things run by a military caste which , in its turn , is becoming more and more monarchist . The Carlists are separated from the Monarchists only by a question of persons . The lower clergy is siding with the people ? as you saw this morning ? and the higher clergy , which has always supported the Franco regime , is changing too . That 's a most important sign . If Franco 's high church dignitaries are deserting the ship , it 's because the hold is already three-quarters flooded . " Yet look what 's happened . The Bishop of Bilbao has openly taken the side of the strikers . He is n't a Basque ; Franco split the Basque region into three dioceses and took pains to see that the bishops should all be Spaniards . The Bishop of Bilbao wanted to talk to the strikers by radio , but the authorities stopped him . All he could do was address a group of workers who belong to the Action Catedica . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be the first to walk out , but above all , do n't be the last . ' The Bishop of Vitoria feels the same way . Only the Bishop of San Sebastian disagrees , and he 's notoriously narrow-minded . Since Rome spoke out against Franco last month , even the high Castilian clergy is watering its wine . " As for us , we want to prove what seems to us obvious ? that the Communist party is not now the leader of the Spanish masses . If we can do it , Franco 's support in the Americas will begin to fall apart . " A T THE top of a funicular in San Sebastian where tourists go to get a fine view of the city , Juanito introduced me to students in democratic countries feel free to carry on in the open . They were not affiliated with any political movement , though Catalan nationalist feeling was certainly prominent among the motives which led them to side with the strikers . One of them told me he had slipped out of Spain secretly , in 1947 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had come home disappointed . wanted to represent the Federation of Catalan Students , " he said , " but when I got there I found there was already a delegation from something called the Communist Catalan Federation . It was made up of people who had n't been in Spain in years ! " He was finally admitted as an observer , not a delegate , and when I met him he was still indignant about it . " Today , " he said , " there are only four Communist students in all Barcelona ! " 1 N AN aquarium far from Barcelona I talked with one of the top-ranking leaders of the Catalan underground , a CNT man who walked with the telltale drag of former prisoners who have had their ankles chained . He was quite definite when I asked what he thought of American aid to Franco . " We 'd rather stay hungry and not see his government strengthened . Most of the Catalan resistance groups have already let the Americans know that if war breaks out we will never consent to collaborate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must remember one thing : there are only two railroad lines crossing from Spain into France . If two bridges were blocked , all communication with the north could be stopped . We estimate that with a force of two hundred men we could block those bridges ? and we 've had experience . Franco knows it too . When he talks about the help he could give the West in case of war , a lot of it is bluff . " I asked about reprisals since the Barcelona strike . He told me that 150 students had been jailed and questioned for three or four days , and over 4,000 former political prisoners taken into custody . I had already heard similar figures from the group of students I had met in Barcelona , and one man who was with them ? still young but worn and whitehaired ? had told me about his own earlier experience with Pedro Polo , a former pupilof Hirnmler who is now chief of the social section of Franco 's secret police . " We wish , " said the CNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so-called ' organic democracy . ' We wish we could get help from abroad to stop the tortures inflicted on prisoners . The beatings , the solitary confinement for weeks in a pitch-dark cell , and all the other niceties that have resulted from German-Spanish collaboration in the realm of cruelty . " I am not just trying to be eloquent . Something could be achieved . The government is afraid of what foreigners may think because Spain is a tributary state . It is not a great power like the United States or Russia , which can brave public opinion if they have to . " We are trying to solve our own problems . Since we have found a mine of riches in discovering that it is possible to call a strike without great preparation , we will use that weapon continuously if it seems advisable . But in 1946 the Western powers signed an agreement promising to help the Spanish people as soon as they let their will be known . The Western powers should keep their promise ; they should pay off the note they signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to an agreement with the monarchy ? " I asked . " If the Pretender had had the courage to come to Barcelona during the strike , the military commander of the city would probably have proclaimed him king . We were ready to support him then and we still are , for we want to avoid a new civil war in Spain . Later , we would act toward the monarchy as the monarchy acted toward us . " IV 0 NE night I took the fast luxury train from San Sebastian to Madrid . There is only one such train in the country , and it used to be reserved for the Caudillo 's propaganda tours . Lately such tours have been inopportune , and twice a week ordinary mortals are permitted to use the train . When I say " ordinary mortals , " I mean rich business men , high-ranking bureaucrats , and foreigners , for the fare is high . In the railroad station at Madrid the police opened my suitcase and examined it , then made excuses and took me to a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " said a press attach ? when I mentioned preparations for a demonstration in Madrid . " We have to admit it , " added one of the correspondents ; " we 've lost contact with the Spanish resistance . " Next day I repeated these remarks to Manuel , who serves as a liaison man between underground groups in Madrid . " What he told you is true , " he said , " but it 's not through negligence on our part . People abroad can help us a lot ; we know it . But people like your friends of last night have done imprudent things in the past . Even when they act in all good faith , they ca n't help moving in official circles , keeping up contacts that are justifiable for them but dangerous for us . Having to work in secret as we do , we 've reached the stage where we have to be suspicious of everybody but ourselves . This point of view has its dangers and is often unjust , but what else can we do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date for an anti-Franco demonstration which would count the Monarchists among its backers . It would mark the first time they had co-operated with the other anti-Franco groups . and my schedule included a talk with one of their leaders in the city . " We are regionalists rather than federalists where Spain is concerned , " said Don Juan 's man , " but that does n't prevent us from believing firmly in a federalized Europe . For i he time being , we agree with the other resistance groups that the main problem is to get rid of Franco . " He assured me that the 0 Pretender was a man of democratic views and would see that the Declaration of Human Rights was respected . " He is now waiting for the proper moment , " he added , " to come back into Spain . " We know , " the spokesman continued , " that after Franco is gone Communism will not be able to make any headway in Spain . Paradoxical as it may seem , his remaining in power would strengthen leftist extremism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of western Europe where Communism will have the least influence . " Today , our formula is the only acceptable one because it is a formula of conciliation . Spain is worn out by war and dictatorshipand wants liberty and peace . The camps divided by the civil war can rally only round the King . They have already done so , in fact . The bishops , the generals , the industrialists , the bourgeoisie , the working masses , the Socialists , the Action Catdlica , the members of the Democratic Union , the Basque and Catalan nationalists , the CNT , the UGT , even the remaining Trotskyites ? all are now for the King even though some of them have reservations . The only people in Spain still who oppose us are Franco , the Falange , and the police . " " Yes , everyone is agreed on the Monarchists ' formula , temporarily at least , " Manuel commented later . " But I still have doubts about their tactical ability to lead the masses , even in royalist Castile . I 'm not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't ? but because the Monarchists have had so little experience in the field . And yet they want to impose their ideas and their methods . " I HAD to leave Spain before the Madrid demonstration , but the acquaintances I had made there managed to let me know , in some detail , how things turned out . Franco expected a city-wide strike and alerted the Falange ? much more loyal in conservative Castile than in the turbulent Basque country ? as well as the army and police . Former political prisoners received threatening letters the day before from the Falange and the Guardia Civil . " Red , " said the notes , " we have our eye on you . If you do n't go to work tomorrow , we 'll meet you in the street . " Everybody in Madrid went to work next day ? but on foot . As in Barcelona , the demonstration consisted of a boycott of subways , streetcars , and busses . Madrile nos walked to work , carrying their lunches so that they would not be obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , and cafes remained empty ? until the disconcerted Falangists , who had patrolled the streets all day without finding any opponents to attack , changed into civilian clothes and began to make a show of animation on cafe terraces . " Franco has not only failed , " wrote one of my former hosts , " he has made himself ridiculous . " A few days later I got a message saying that the Caudillo had asked Don Juan for an
